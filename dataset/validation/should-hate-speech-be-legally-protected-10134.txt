Discussion Name: Should Hate Speech Be Legally Protected?

1. Hate speech should be legally protected.
1.1. Pro: Free speech is a [core human right](http://www.law-democracy.org/live/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foe-briefingnotes-1.pdf)(Freedom of expression is a core human right which is guaranteed under international law and \nby virtually every constitutional bill of rights in the world. It is key to human development, dignity, personal fulfilment and the search for truth, and a fundamental pre-requisite for democracy and good governance. It facilitates free debate about and between competing political parties, enables citizens to raise concerns with authorities and ensures that new policies and legislation may be \nthe subject of careful scrutiny.). As such, it should remain as free as possible, even if that means allowing some harms to exist.
1.1.1. Pro: Governments should avoid restricting the core rights of citizens to the greatest extent possible, even if that means allowing some harms to persist.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Pluralism requires tolerating different viewpoints, even the abhorrent ones.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Pluralism is only possible if those who seek to tear down society, celebrate authoritarianism, and are intolerant towards others, are [excluded](https://academy4sc.org/video/paradox-of-tolerance-to-tolerate-or-not-to-tolerate/)(Philosopher Karl Popper described the paradox of tolerance as the seemingly counterintuitive idea that “in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.” Essentially, if a so-called tolerant society permits the existence of intolerant philosophies, it is no longer tolerant.) from politics and society at large.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Pluralism presupposes mutual respect. Otherwise, certain participants would lose interest in or fear entering public discussion and debate. As such, discriminatory views are automatically anti-pluralist.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Even if this is the case, exclusion should be used only against political actors who are known to be violent or malicious, rather than against broader forms of speech.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Democracy is contingent upon the idea that all people have a right to keep and present their own beliefs, regardless of how abhorrent those views are.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Insofar as this is the case, those who hold beliefs that imply that certain people do not have the right to political or economic freedoms contradict the spirit of democracy.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: States should be considered [neutral arbiters](https://academic.oup.com/pq/article-abstract/40/161/433/1525733?redirectedFrom=PDF) in the political discussions of citizens, as, in a democracy, they are only meant to represent the views of the people.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Governments should not seek to prohibit every morally reprehensible act.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Legal, state-based sanctions crowd out private, community-based sanctions, which are often [more effective](https://www.nhmunicipal.org/town-city-article/secrets-successful-small-communities)(Successful communities use education, incentives, partnerships and voluntary initiatives not just regulation. To be sure, land use regulations and ordinances are essential to protecting public health and to setting minimum standards of conduct in a community. Regulations protect the environment and prevent the worst in development, but they rarely bring out the best. Regulations are also subject to shifting political winds. Often one county commission or town council will enact tough regulations only to see them repealed or weakened by a future town council with a different ideology or viewpoint.).
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Community-based sanctions, like [criticism from those one is close to](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201212/one-thing-will-ruin-perfectly-good-relationship), often affect the aspects of one's life that they deem the most important. As such, these forms of punishment are more consequential.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Community-based sanctions, such as ostracization, have been shown to be less effective and [more detrimental](https://medium.com/\@julesdixon/ostracism-social-exclusion-in-adulthood-8764ea1a4003)(‘Being excluded or ostracized is an invisible form of bullying that doesn’t leave bruises, and therefore we often underestimate its impact.’ Kipling D. Williams, Professor of Psychological Sciences at Purdue \(Purdue.edu\)) to the offender as they do not have methods of appeal.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Laws should reflect the [will of society](https://studopedia.info/3-81830.html)(Laws generally reflect and promote a society's val­ues. Our legal system is influenced by our society's tra­ditional ideas of right and wrong. For example, laws against murder reflect the moral belief that killing another person is wrong. Most people would condemn murder regardless of what the law said. However, not everything that is immoral is also illegal. For example, lying to a friend may be immoral but is seldom illegal.). If a society believes that a given act is immoral, their government should create legislation to prevent people from engaging in such acts.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Protests are a common method of voicing collective displeasure with certain laws, regardless of morality.
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Governments often heed the warnings from societal pressure and [back down](https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/vucic-backs-down-on-rio-tinto-project-under-pressure-from-civil-society/) from controversial, unsafe, or unfair legislation.
1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: It is [not clear](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/free-speech-for-all-poll-reveals-americans-views-on-free-expression-post-2020-301454976.html)(Similarly, 90% of Americans agree that "people should be allowed to express unpopular opinions.") that society desires greater restrictions on hate speech.
1.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: The role of a government is not just the preservation of rights, but the creation of a community where every citizen feels represented and comfortable. As such, morality is an important policy-making consideration.
1.1.1.2.2.4. Con: Citizens often support harmful and dangerous views. In such cases, the government should not reflect the will of the people.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: States ought to be as minimal as possible in terms of how their decisions affect the rights of citizens.
1.1.1.3. Con: When individuals agree to trade off some freedoms in exchange for the ability to co-exist peacefully, societies become more stable and cooperative.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Living in a society in which it is known that one may have to pay a small fine for calling someone a derogatory slur does not necessarily make them less free. It just makes the legal consequences of that action more predictable.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Individuals should not be expected to give up their rights in favor of a society they likely did not choose to join.
1.1.2. Con: Freedom of speech has a number of limitations defined in the relevant legal and judicial areas of country codes and democratic constitutions.
1.1.2.1. Con: Despite other types of restrictions on speech, many countries do not legally restrict hate speech itself.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that hate speech is legally protected speech.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: In [Snyder v. Phelps](https://www.thoughtco.com/hate-speech-cases-721215), the Court ruled that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket a funeral — a deeply offensive act.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: In the first landmark Court ruling on hate speech, [Beauharnais v. Illinois](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/250)(lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous and the insulting or 'fighting' words — those which by their very utterances inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.), the U.S. Supreme Court established legal limits for speech.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The Beauharnais v. Illinois decision has been [substantially weakened over time](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/545/beauharnais-v-illinois)(Though Beauharnais seems to suggest that the First Amendment provides the government with significant leeway allowing the State to restrict racist speech that constitutes group libel, the five decades since that decision have been marked by a tightening of the doctrine which heavily constricts the government’s ability to regulate \nracist speech.) as successive rulings have loosened the definition of hate speech and given more leeway to protect all speech, no matter the subject matter.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the 1990s, the Supreme Court determined in National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie that the Nazi swastika did not not constitute "fighting words" as mentioned in the [Beauharnais decision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/250)("lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous and the insulting or 'fighting' words — those which by their very utterances inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."), allowing the NSP to march freely in Illinois \([pp. 969-970](https://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/84/84_3_Bell.pdf)(In responding to the challenge, the village relied on Beauharnais, but the Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, contending that \nBeauharnais had been significantly weakened. The court declared the uniform and literature bans unconstitutional on the grounds that the ordinances attempted to regulate the content of the message being communicated by the demonstrators.)\).
1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: In the Virginia v. Black case, the US Supreme Court ruled that [banning cross burnings](https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/rehnquist10/opinion_announcement_audio/21604) would violate the First Amendment.
1.1.2.1.1.4. Con: The United States has a history of limiting the right to freedom of speech in strategic situations beneficial to the government.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: During WWI, people could be jailed for [handing out anti-war leaflets](https://www.aclu.org/other/freedom-expression).
1.1.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: The early 20th century saw a number of [egregious violations of the First Amendment](https://www.aclu.org/other/freedom-expression)(The early 20th century was not much better. In 1912, feminist Margaret Sanger was arrested for giving a lecture on birth control. Trade union meetings were banned and courts routinely granted injunctions prohibiting strikes and other labor protests. Violators were sentenced to prison. Peaceful protesters opposing U. S. entry into World War I were jailed for expressing their opinions. In the early 1920s, many states outlawed the display of red or black flags, symbols of communism and anarchism. In 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the text of the First Amendment at a union rally. Many people were arrested merely for membership in groups regarded as "radical" by the government. It was in response to the excesses of this period that the ACLU was founded in 1920.) carried out by the government.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Many countries, like [Estonia and Romania](https://news.err.ee/1159938/estonia-one-of-two-eu-countries-not-to-criminalize-hate-speech), have opted against criminalizing hate speech.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Romania does have laws protecting against incitement and any speech that includes "instigation to hatred or discrimination" \([p. 161](https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-REF\(2018\)042-e)(ART. 369 - Instigation to hatred or discrimination \n\nInstigation of the public, using any means, to hatred or discrimination against a category of individuals shall be punishable by no less than 6 months and no more than 3 years of imprisonment or by a fine.)\).
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Article 19 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not permit any curtailment of speech \([p. 5](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf)(Article 19\n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.)\); protection of speech should be applied as broadly as possible.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly ruled that threatening to undermine state institutions by terror organizations is not free speech \([Gündüz v. Turkey](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":\["001-61522"\]})(The recommendation lays down guidelines designed to underpin governments' efforts to combat all hate speech, for example the setting up of an effective legal framework consisting of appropriate civil-, criminal- and administrative-law provisions for tackling the phenomenon. It proposes, among other measures, that community-service orders be added to the range of possible penal sanctions and that the possibilities under the civil law be enhanced, for example by awarding compensation to victims of hate speech, affording them the right of reply or ordering retraction. Governments should ensure that within this legal framework any interference by the public authorities with freedom of expression is narrowly circumscribed on the basis of objective criteria and subject to independent judicial control.)\).
1.1.2.1.5. Con: [Most countries](https://futurefreespeech.com/global-handbook-on-hate-speech-laws/) in the world have laws restricting hate speech.
1.1.2.2. Con: The fact that many countries restrict speech is not an indication that those restrictions are just.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Many laws and governmental restrictions are [undemocratic](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/06/were-citizens-not-subjects-we-have-the-right-to-criticize-government-without-fear)(Consider the Department of Justice’s admission in May 2013 that they had secretly seized sensitive office, home and cellular telephone records from more than 20 reporters working for the Associated Press while investigating a leak leading to a 2012 AP news story reporting on an operation foiling a terrorist plot. The president of the AP, Gary Pruitt, called the actions a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” and noted that the government’s actions were creating a profound chilling effect on sources and members of the press. The president personally defended the actions of the Department of Justice, saying: “I make no apologies”.); a democracy does not guarantee that all laws will be [enacted democratically](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/rule-law-and-democracy-addressing-gap-between-policies-and-practices)(Another key dimension of the rule of law-democracy nexus is the recognition that building democracy and the rule of law may be convergent and mutually reinforcing processes whenever the rule of law is defined in broad, ends-based terms rather than in narrow, formal and exclusively procedural terms. The nexus is strong whenever the rule of law is conceived in its relationship with substantive outcomes, like justice and democratic governance. This distinction is often characterized by resorting to the opposition between "thin" and "thick" conceptions of the rule of law.).
1.1.2.2.2. Con: The purpose of [government](https://www.ushistory.org/gov/1a.asp)(Governments almost certainly originated with the need to protect people from conflicts and to provide law and order.) is to provide its citizens with law and order and protect them to the best of their ability. Not everyone will agree on the fairness of those protections and restrictions.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Constitutions can be modified, indicating that they should not be considered infallible or irreversible. For example, the [13th Amendment abolished slavery](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/list#event-/timeline/item/13th-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution-abolition-of-slavery) in the United States even though it was protected in the initial Constitution.
1.1.2.3. Pro: In the United States, the freedom of speech [does not apply to](https://www.thefire.org/resources/free-speech-freshman-orientation/limits-to-free-speech/) cases of true immediate threats, intimidation, incitement, harassment, or unlawful conduct.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Article 10 of the UK's Human Rights Act 1998 explicitly outlines a number of cases where free speech is [restricted](https://www.theweek.co.uk/97552/hate-speech-vs-free-speech-the-uk-laws)(Those restrictions may be “in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary”.).
1.1.2.5. Pro: Sweden, Japan, and South Africa put [limitations](https://firstamendmentvoice.org/2021/01/what-free-speech-limitations-exist-in-other-countries/) on free speech for acts like defamation, intimidation, and hate speech.
1.1.3. Con: It is justifiable to restrict the rights of citizens if availing those rights infringes upon the rights of others.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Enabling certain liberties, such as hate speech, may have an overall negative impact on the freedom of others.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Hate speech bans may lead to individuals self-censoring out of fear of being prosecuted or labelled "a criminal," ultimately restricting the speech of more people.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Hate speech rarely refers to individual [comments made privately](https://www.gotelee.co.uk/blog/private-conversation-criminal-offence/)(After careful consideration, the Law Commission recommends that words spoken and communicated in a “private conversation” should not lead to prosecution.\n\nA private conversation might include social media, such as WhatsApp, if the chat is private. So, what is “private”? The Commission does not define this in detail except to say that where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, then that conversation would likely be considered private. For instance, a WhatsApp group composed of a small number of family members might almost certainly be expected to give rise to a belief that anything said would be private in that group. On the other hand, a group of, for instance, police officers sharing racist or homophobic material would not.) between people; it usually refers to public speech which has an audience.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: People [often self-censor](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#)(two-thirds—62%—of Americans say the political climate these days prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.) in cases where they worry their speech may become public and controversial.
1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: People already [share their controversial views or hateful ideas](https://www.politico.eu/article/hate-speech-and-terrorist-content-proliferate-on-web-beyond-eu-reach-experts/) by confiding in those who are close to them. This means there will be little difference in overall self-censorship for most.
1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Politics are one of the subjects people [tend to avoid](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306422020917602) discussing with relatives and loved ones.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Persistent hate speech may lead to victims [censoring their own opinions](https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/self-censorship/43569)(Self-censorship is when someone, most often a journalist or media outlet, censors their own speech or expression. They choose not to say something — perhaps not to report a story on the government or give an opinion on a new law — that could be important for the public, either because of its factual nature or because it would contribute to a robust public debate on the issue.\n\nSelf-censorship is considered to be a voluntary act, but it is often done out of fear or pressure. Recent events in Europe have shown the pressure that can be applied to independent media that do not parrot the government line. Threats of closure or state capture in Poland and Hungary, even threats — sometimes carried out — to individual journalists in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Malta and elsewhere.) and speech out of fear that they will be attacked.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: If the most frequent victims of hate speech begin self-censoring, their public voice may become even less prominent and they may be unable to fight for their rights.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Hate speech is a relatively insignificant cause of self-censorship. The "[spiral of silence](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/the-spiral-of-silence-how-social-media-encourages-selfcensorship-online-9693044.html)(The researchers found far from encouraging debate, social media nurtured a phenomenon known as the ‘spiral of silence’ – a term coined in the mid-70s to describe how individuals supress their own views if they believe they differ from those of family, friends and work colleagues.\n\nAlthough the hubbub of comment threads and Twitter timelines might seem to contain a wide variety of opinion, the researchers suggest that internet users tend to clump together with like-minded individuals \(a tendency that internet experts have previously suggested is reinforced by online search algorithms that cater to our views\).)" is a common phenomenon on social media where people self-censor when others are critical of their opinions.
1.1.3.2. Con: Free speech should take precedence over the other rights, meaning the barrier to restricting speech should be especially high \([p. 11](https://rm.coe.int/handbook-freedom-of-expression-eng/1680732814)(The conflict may arise when authorities need to protect the interests or values listed in Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Convention, such as national security or public health. When such conflict occurs, the Court strikes a balance in order to establish the pre-eminence of one right over the other. The balance of the conflicting interests, one of which is freedom of expression, takes into account the importance of the latter. The Court has repeatedly stated that freedom of expression “constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment”. Or, “the press plays a pre-eminent role in a State governed by the rule of law”.)\).
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: When people are silenced, others in a polity will not know about their views. People have a democratic right to know such things and engage with them.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Given that speech directly influences politics and, therefore, how societies treat rights, speech is one of the most consequential rights. Therefore, it should be respected even in harmful cases.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: Minor restrictions on speech do not impact the ability to access other rights.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: [Most people](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/06/populists-silent-majority-loud-minority)(Populist parties are not only usually less popular than traditional parties, they are seen unfavorably by the majority of their respective populations. The least liked party, across all eight countries, is Alternative for Germany \(AfD\), allegedly the main challenger of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. AfD is seen as unfavorable by 83% of Germans and favorable by just 11%. The second and third least favorable parties in western Europe are both rightwing populist parties – the French National Front, with just 16%, and the Sweden Democrats \(SD\), with 17%.) do not engage in hate speech. That means the rights of most will not be affected, regardless of the legal status of hate speech.
1.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Extreme and abusive views cannot change the politics of a country for the better. Therefore, given the importance of speech, hate speech should not be protected.
1.1.3.2.3.3. Con: Rights should not be infringed upon, even if the impact of infringing on them is minor.
1.1.3.3. Con: Laws regarding hate speech are purely a political construct favoring protected groups to the detriment of unprotected groups.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Less vulnerable groups, like those holding greater social power and influence, will face comparatively little harm from slight infringements on their freedoms, compared to the potential risk of vulnerable groups going unprotected.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Certain sectors, such as [medical research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3619959/), justify protecting vulnerable groups who are more susceptible to outside influence and unable to protect themselves within the resources and information available to them.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Those with greater amounts of wealth can appeal infringements of their rights that they deem unjustified. Therefore, they have the superior ability to rectify harms imposed on them.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: Infringements of rights are wrong regardless of severity. Therefore, the amount of power held by one individual is inconsequential.
1.1.3.3.1.4. Con: Many international constitutions hold that all people are born free and [equal](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights); one group should never be favored over another.
1.1.4. Pro: Free speech implies a [right to offend](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-right-to-offend-shock-or-disturb-or-the-importance-of-protecting-unpleasant-speech-c57bc0672a30)(The First Amendment to the United States Constitution probably offers the most robust protection to unfavorable speech. Except for so-called ‘fighting words,’ true threats, and incitement, a wide array of offensive speech is protected in the United States.) people.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Even speech with no positive value should still generally be protected.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The typically left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union \(ALCU\) [defended](https://text.npr.org/514785623) the editor of a divisive far-right website after his talk at a university was cancelled following student protests.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Rights are meant to protect certain actions that others may want to restrict. As such, the right to offend ought to exist.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: The primary role of the state is to protect its citizens from [harm](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/#HarPri)(Second, Mill envisions that the harm principle is something that we can apply prospectively to prevent someone from acting in certain ways and causing harm. In many cases all we could reasonably know is that a given action risks harm.). Therefore, if the speech has no positive value and is harmful, it should not be legally protected.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Unrestricted free speech, especially when offensive, is necessary for free thought and political discussion.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: People ought to be able to express their views and engage in debate without bringing hatred of others into it.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: An argument that assumes that a group of people ought to be dehumanized is not an argument worth debating or including in the social conversation.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Con: Often, especially when discussing touchy subjects, people speak emotionally and passionately. In such a situation, they may accidentally use hateful or vulgar language. That does not invalidate the point they are making.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Discussions of topics like abortion or sexual freedom are often taken to be offensive to people with certain religious views. However, it is vital that such discussions are allowed to take place.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Highly religious communities, which are frequently offended by free speech and wish to regulate it, often fail to realize that many of their holy texts are [incredibly offensive](https://www.cato.org/commentary/right-offend-inalienable-part-right-religious-freedom-free-speech#) to others.
1.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Having the ability to openly discuss offensive topics can [help people change their minds](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes).
1.1.4.3. Con: By definition, hate speech is more than just offensive speech; it is an explicit attempt at intimidation or the incitement of violence and must always be prohibited.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: In Australia, the [Racial Discrimination Act 1975](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/racial-discrimination)("… unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person, or of some or all of the people in the group.") outlines that mere offense suffices as hate speech.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: People have a legal responsibility for themselves and their actions. If one chooses to act violently or intimidate others, that is their choice and only they should face the consequences of that act.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Those who normalize hateful ideas within their communities are also culpable for the acts of their followers.
1.1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: No individual forms their notion of acceptable social behavior in a vacuum. We rely on our communities to form beliefs about which acts are acceptable and moral \([p. 1](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25075/chapter/1)(Social and cultural norms are rules or expectations of behavior and thoughts based on shared beliefs within a specific cultural or social group. While often unspoken, norms offer social standards for appropriate and inappropriate behavior that govern what is \(and is not\) acceptable in interactions among people \(WHO, 2009\). Social and cultural norms are highly influential over individual behavior in a broad variety of contexts, including violence and its prevention, because norms can create an environment that can either foster or mitigate violence and its deleterious effects.)\).
1.1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: All humans ought to be considered rational and capable of making their own decisions. As such, those who commit hate crimes do so through their own free will; they alone are at fault.
1.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Those engaging in hateful speech will suffer social consequences regardless of hate speech crimes.
1.1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Those who join extreme movements often end up facing [social isolation](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/27/928209548/dude-i-m-done-when-politics-tears-families-and-friendships-apart)("He was going off like, 'Oh, you drank the Kool-Aid,' and 'Kavanaugh didn't do anything,' " she recalled. "It made me sick. If this is his core ethics, I don't want that kind of person in my life.") from those they were previously close with.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: Punishment for harmful acts should not be imprecisely and unequally applied. There is no way to ensure the social consequences of hate speech will fit that criteria.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3. Pro: Many who engage in hate speech [lose their jobs](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/employees-fired-for-hate-speech-on-social-media.aspx)(Some states prohibit employers from taking adverse employment actions against employees based on lawful off-duty conduct, Grider said. "Currently, California, Colorado, Louisiana, New York and North Dakota ban employers from firing or retaliating against employees for any off-duty lawful activity, including speech," she noted. "Arguably, this could include conduct that their employers and co-workers may find offensive."\n\nBut, she added, "even in these states, online speech attacking other persons' immutable characteristics protected by law—such as age, race, ethnicity, sex and religion—or that constitutes workplace harassment is not protected.").
1.1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Individuals should be expected to have the moral fortitude to not follow hateful ideas and movements. If they resort to hateful actions, that is when they should be punished.
1.1.4.3.2.3.1. Con: If the individual spouting off hate speech does not accept responsibility for their actions, they might [blame the victim](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/the-psychology-of-victim-blaming/502661/) for the hate they receive.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Speech within a democratic society must start from the assumption of the equal moral worth of all citizens.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Any democratic political project must continue to [allow all citizens to freely exist](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/redefining-populism)(What’s dangerous for democracy, and what I take to be critical to this phenomenon, is basically the tendency to exclude others. Some citizens don’t truly belong, and we see the consequence of that on the ground in India and Turkey and Hungary and in many other countries.) and have access to their rights. Any view that rejects that is, by definition, anti-democratic.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Con: All political views imply some kind of exclusion, even if just implicitly, since all political identities presuppose groups that [do not belong](http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/issue.107/17.2tally.html)(There can be no rational consensus because identity is always based on exclusion. There is no alternative to the we/they binary, so the goal cannot be to overcome this antagonism. According to Mouffe, Schmitt concludes that pluralism has no place in democratic society; only a homogenous society can work. For Mouffe, who insists on democratic pluralism, the goal is to maintain Schmitt's agonism and to prevent it from becoming antagonism. In other words, she wants to maintain a we/they relationship while keeping it from devolving into a friend/enemy relationship.). As such, democratic speech should be allowed to have exclusions.
1.1.4.3.4. Pro: Hate speech seeks to not merely convey ideas or opinions, but rather to foment emotional and intolerant responses in those listening.
1.1.4.3.4.1. Con: There are plenty of forms of speech that evoke emotional responses that individuals consume frequently.
1.1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: The emotional responses generated by certain forms of speech can lead to [disagreements](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/overserving-holiday-cheers-survey-finds-152900488.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADwTSNTVK9suvhwGVHbx9HC9Va-AniARDyvaXxcnf0AiHtpiLuuL8JE5Stqn9pYgr-wtjwiV9CHSD4jdE-Yls8Sn3nDM0-uKCqrhoc2FhXsj4AgdwfxaeQ9uoNOpZGELUqPMQb9pDx65QsttMzay-X3kcTfTen6skzgg0jpH3Ovo)(Sixty-three percent agreed that there's always a family member who takes things too far, with one-third of respondents sharing that their uncle is most likely to drink too much and do something shocking.\n\nWith over imbibing comes regret: 54% shared that someone at the holiday event has had to apologize for something they don't remember doing or saying, with that same amount agreeing that someone has done or said something that has changed the family dynamic.\n\nTaboo table talk? Forty-seven percent said politics is their least favorite dinner table discussion topic, followed by more intimate ones like family gossip \(42%\) and personal drama \(41%\) — with Mom \(31%\) and Dad \(30%\) leading the charge in bringing up uncomfortable subjects.) and potential physical altercations at family gatherings.
1.1.4.3.4.1.2. Pro: Songs and [novels](https://medium.com/\@sec220/the-role-of-catcher-in-the-rye-in-john-lennons-assassination-4216033a75ed)(The other element that many relate to is his unending tirade on phoniness. I can imagine how, especially during the 50's when Catcher was published, this would have mass appeal in the post-war, pastel world of suburban America. Holden’s staunch stance against phoniness appealed to violence as well. On December 8th of 1980, John Lennon was shot by Mark David Chapman. Outside of Lennon’s Manhattan home, police officers arrived to the scene to find Chapman casually flipping through his copy of Catcher in the Rye.) have often inspired people to commit actions they may not otherwise do, due to the emotional impact of the art.
1.1.4.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: For example, satirical content and parodies have the potential to fool an unaware or ill-informed person \([p. 6](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/INGE/DV/2021/07-12/IDADisinformation_migrant_minorities_EN.pdf)\).
1.1.4.3.4.1.3. Pro: Otherwise mundane speech can cause intense emotional reactions when its content inspires fear and is [repeatedly](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/repeating-misinformation-doesnt-make-it-true-but-does-make-it-more-likely-to-be-believed.html)(According to a 2015 study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, the illusory truth effect is the notion that repeated statements are perceived to be more truthful than new statements. This effect is clearly something that marketing professionals, cult leaders, and politicians understand. In other words, you say something enough times, and people start to believe it.) told to listeners.
1.1.4.3.4.1.4. Con: Hate speech differs from other forms of evocative speech in that it is very explicit in its meaning, directly identifying groups of people for others to direct hate against.
1.1.4.3.4.1.5. Con: That hate speech evokes hate makes it different from other emotional forms of speech. Hate is a [uniquely powerful](https://theconversation.com/why-hatred-should-be-considered-a-contagious-disease-161163)(Hatred can be conceptualized as an infectious disease, a determinant of health and a public health issue spreading violence, fear and ignorance. Hatred is contagious and crosses barriers and borders, and no one is immune to its risks.\n\nLike traditional diseases, hatred is initially triggered by a causal agent or from harmful exposure. Once the exposure is manifested and incubated within the host, it can grow slowly over a period by continuous chronic exposure — or instantly by acute exposure.) motivating emotion.
1.1.4.3.4.2. Pro: Hate speech is performative and often has [illocutionary force](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/speech-acts/#AspIllFor).
1.1.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: Whereas 'locutionary acts' merely seek to convey information to a listener, hate speech often carries '[force](https://www.thoughtco.com/illocutionary-act-speech-1691044)(in the theory of speech acts, the act that is performed by saying something \(e.g., asking, ordering, threatening\), as opposed to the act of speaking itself \(the locutionary act\) or the act of causing a particular effect on others \(e.g., persuading, amusing, inspiring\) as a result of speech \(the perlocutionary act\).)' in that it tries to urge listeners to adopt certain feelings and opinions.
1.1.4.3.4.2.2. Con: All speech is performative in some way.
1.1.4.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: It is unclear, then, why hate speech especially should be restricted rather than any form of speech that may [motivate people](https://dangerousspeech.org/guide/)(Dangerous speech is also quite different from the term “hate speech” which, though widely used, is hard to define clearly and consistently. The simple words “hate speech” present a variety of questions. For instance, what exactly is hatred? How strong or enduring must an emotion be to count? And does the “hate” in hate speech mean that the speaker hates, or seeks to persuade others to hate, or wants to make people feel hated?\n\nThere is one common thread among definitions of hate speech, which is that it vilifies a person or group of people because they belong to a group or share an identity of some kind. Therefore it’s not hate speech to say “I hate you” without referring to a group.) to act in harmful ways.
1.2. Pro: Protecting hate speech is necessary to ensure the democratic rights of all individuals.
1.2.1. Pro: When rules cannot be clearly written or enforced, the risk of citizens losing access to their rights is higher. Therefore, states should opt to protect people's freedoms as much as possible in these cases.
1.2.1.1. Con: Important policies should still be passed regardless of ambiguity, complexity, or difficulty in enforcement.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Complex policy changes have massive costs associated with them, which can be exacerbated when implemented hastily or without proper planning \([p. 25](https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/studies/pdf/cba_guide.pdf)\). With hate speech, this may mean major infringements on people's rights.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Plenty of complicated and difficult policies have successfully been implemented around the world, even ones related to [speech](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/germanys-laws-antisemitic-hate-speech-nazi-propaganda-holocaust-denial/)(The law was expanded to explicitly ban Holocaust denial in 1994, after a federal appeals court overturned the sentence of a far-right German politician who had organized a lecture describing the gassing of Jews at Auschwitz as a hoax. It is punishable by a sentence of up to five years. \n\nIn an interview with FRONTLINE, Christoph Hebbecker, a German federal prosecutor who specializes in digital hate crimes, described a recent case in which a German woman was charged with incitement after posting on the Russian social media platform VK that Syrian refugees should be shot upon entering Germany. “She was in relevant groups; her favorite book was Mein Kampf; and she wrote posts like that and similar ones,” Hebbecker said of the woman, who did not have a previous criminal record. She was convicted and sentenced to 11 months of probation and a fine, Hebbecker said.).
1.2.1.2. Pro: States exist primarily to facilitate the rights of citizens. As such, governments must restrict those rights as little as possible.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Insofar as hate speech may affect the rights of victims, violations of rights will happen regardless of government intervention. States, therefore, ought to protect the rights of victims more than those of offenders.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It would be government overreach to preemptively restrict the rights of others to avoid harms that may not occur.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Such laws are already commonplace, for example, restricting the [purchase and possession](https://www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives) of [weapons](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/firearms) that may cause great harm to others.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: When one infringes upon the rights of others, they automatically forfeit some of their rights. As such, their victim's rights ought to be considered more important.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Our natural rights, including freedom of speech, are [prior to and more important](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nozick-political/)(These moral rights are understood as state of nature rights. That is, they are rights that precede and provide a basis for assessing and constraining not only the actions of individuals and groups but also the conduct of political and legal institutions. These rights also precede any social contract; they morally constrain the conduct of individuals, groups, and institutions even in the absence of any social contract.) than the institutions and contexts we find ourselves in. As such, they are of the utmost importance.
1.2.2. Con: Governments need not be the actor to restrict hate speech. Abuses of power can be avoided if private media and social media corporations can restrict offensive speech themselves.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Most social media websites already [restrict or take down](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/twitter-is-penalizing-more-accounts-for-posting-hate-speech)(Twitter Inc. “took action” on a record number of user accounts for violating the company’s hate speech policies during the second half of 2020, a reflection of the company’s decision to expand its rules.\n\nTwitter “actioned” 1,126,990 different accounts between July and December 2020 for infringing its hateful conduct policy, a 77% increase over the prior six-month period. Actions taken could range from removing a tweet to banning an account.) prominent hate speech.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Such restrictions are different to hate speech laws, insofar as paternalistic laws protecting children are more well-accepted.
1.2.2.2. Con: Tech companies are not required to monitor content; many of them are based in the United States and are protected by the [Communications Decency Act](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1070/communications-decency-act-of-1996).
1.2.2.3. Con: Having private companies monitor hate speech would be even less democratic than government intervention, as people would have less ability to dictate what laws are chosen and how they are enforced.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Social media websites should [function](https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-01-social-networks-need-to-be-more-like-online-forums.html) more like forums and abide by national free speech laws.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Citizens can withhold financial support if they do not like a private company's behavior. This makes those companies accountable to them and unlikely to enforce arbitrary restrictions.
1.2.3. Con: There are several cases of successfully enforced bans or limitations on hate speech that do not violate the speech rights of citizens.
1.2.3.1. Pro: After World War II, Germany successfully banned Nazi books and [symbols](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/16/16152088/nazi-swastikas-germany-charlottesville)(Germany has strict laws banning Nazi symbols and what’s called Volksverhetzung — incitement of the people, or hate speech. Like more than a dozen European countries, Germany also has a law criminalizing Holocaust denial.), neo-Nazi [political parties](https://apnews.com/article/germany-bans-far-right-pro-nazi-group-2129b08825bbc2a60d23059a4f36ee28)(“Whoever fights against the basic values of our free society will get to feel the resolute reaction of our government,” Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. “There’s no place in this country for an association that sows hatred and and works on the resurrection of a Nazi state.”), Holocaust denial and other forms of hate speech.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In Germany, even online discourse is limited; [hate speech is banned](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/germanys-online-hate-speech-law-slammed-by-opposition-commission/) and website hosting services based in Germany [must remove hateful content](https://www.eurozine.com/no-freedom-to-hate-germanys-new-law-on-online-incitement/)(The NetzDG, which comes into effect on 1 October 2017, forces network operators to delete within 24 hours any ‘obviously illegal’ content reported to them. Where content is not unequivocally illegal, the law allows a period of seven days in which to act.7 Only in exceptional cases can this limit be exceeded. If systematic failures to enforce the law occur, the employees responsible risk being fined up to €5 million; companies can be fined – if only in theory – up to €50 million. Additionally, network operators must establish a system so that users can report potentially illegal content. Any social network with more than two million users must also appoint a contact who the authorities can deal with. This move spells an end to the ‘facelessness’ of Facebook and co.) or face sanctions.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Despite strict speech laws in Germany, [toxic speech remains rampant](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/technology/online-hate-speech-germany.html)(But an influx of hate speech and harassment in the run-up to the German election, in which the country will choose a new leader to replace Angela Merkel, its longtime chancellor, has exposed some of the law’s weaknesses. Much of the toxic speech, researchers say, has come from far-right groups and is aimed at intimidating female candidates like Ms. Dornheim.) and far-right parties have achieved great amounts of power.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Neo-Nazism is [on the rise](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election-reaction-afd-idUSKCN1BZ10H)(The first far-right party to enter Germany’s parliament in more than half a century, the AfD - which has been likened by Germany’s own foreign minister to the Nazis - won around 13 percent of Sunday’s vote, according to early projections.\n\nThat puts it on course to be the third biggest party in the new parliament after Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats, both of whom saw their share of the vote fall amid the AfD surge.\n\nIts campaign provoked controversy with posters featuring a pregnant women under the slogan: “New Germans? We’ll make them ourselves” and women in traditional Bavarian dress holding wine glasses with the words: “Burqa? I’m more into Burgundy”.) again in Germany, despite their bans on Nazi materials \([p. 243](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26642828)\).
1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Some argue that these laws have failed because they are too lenient on internet communication, implying the need for [stricter legislation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/tough-new-german-law-puts-tech-firms-and-free-speech-in-spotlight)(Under the law, known in Germany as “NetzDG”, online platforms face fines of up to €50m \(£44m\) if they do not remove “obviously illegal” hate speech and other postings within 24 hours of receiving a notification. A seven-day period is granted for removal of “illegal” content.) in that area.
1.2.3.2. Pro: The UK has [several laws](https://www.theweek.co.uk/97552/hate-speech-vs-free-speech-the-uk-laws) against hate speech. Despite this, there have been no egregious or excessive violations of the rights of citizens.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: The UK has historically faced international criticism for its strict speech restrictions, especially when they propose [new ones](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-concerns-over-internet-free-speech-tech-regulation-power-grab/)(Even the Carnegie Trust — a public policy think tank whose research on a "duty of care" model to regulate the internet influenced early iterations of the government's proposed legislation — has raised concerns.\n\n"To meet the U.K.’s international commitments on free speech," it said in a response to the bill, "there should be a separation of powers between the executive and a communications regulator."\n\nThe power to modify a code of practice to “reflect government policy" might undermine Ofcom’s independence, it added. "Removal of this provision is, in our view, desirable and would reaffirm ... regulatory independence.").
1.2.3.3. Con: Regional political actors in Russia frequently engage in unabated hate speech, despite it being illegal \([p. 49](http://history.kubsu.ru/pdf/k4-47.pdf)\).
1.2.4. Con: Judiciaries will be able to prevent governments from abusing hate speech laws and create clear legal guidelines for any restrictions.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court is [primarily responsible](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does) for deciding what is protected as free speech. Enacting legislation restricting free speech would likely need their input or approval.
1.2.4.2. Con: Judges are often [appointed by the ruling party](https://judiciallearningcenter.org/judicial-independence/) and would be unlikely to remain impartial or rule against laws instated by the person who appointed them.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: In the US, it is [somewhat common](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/24/five-times-republican-appointed-judges-ruled-against-president-trump/2083399002/)(But while there have been rulings by judges appointed by Obama, a number of major rulings against the Trump administration have come from conservative-appointed judges. Here are five that came out this year:) for judges to rule against the political ideals of the person that appointed them.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Politics influence judiciary decisions and play a [significant role](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/federal-judicial-appointments-politics-impact-sentencing-decisions)(During an average four-year term, a Republican president has the potential to alter the partisan composition of the district courts by more than 15 percentage points, potentially increasing the racial and gender sentencing gap by 7.5 and 3 percent, respectively.\n\nThe authors collected data on more than half a million cases between 1999 and 2015, linking federal sentencing data with information on around 1,400 judges. And they home in on a critical moment that affected individual discretion over sentencing. The 2005 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Booker greatly increased judges’ ability to determine sentence length by ruling that mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines were unconstitutional.\n\nWhat followed was a widening of the sentencing gaps between Republican and Democratic judges.) in the racial and gender disparities in sentencing.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Through an independent judiciary and system of checks and balances, courts can [overrule](https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/PARL/POL/ParluGewaltenteilung/index.shtml) the government and prevent abuse.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Courts have prevented governments from pursuing harmful restrictions to free speech [repeatedly in the past](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/resources/freedom-of-speech-general).
1.2.4.4. Con: Ambiguous laws may give courts an undue amount of power to determine the scope of speech restrictions.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: Courts often base their decisions on [precedent](https://law.jrank.org/pages/9325/Precedent.html)(The Anglo-American common-law tradition is built on the doctrine of STARE DECISIS \("stand by decided matters"\), which directs a court to look to past decisions for guidance on how to decide a case before it. This means that the legal rules applied to a prior case with facts similar to those of the case now before a court should be applied to resolve the legal dispute.\n\nThe use of precedent has been justified as providing predictability, stability, fairness, and efficiency in the law. Reliance upon precedent contributes predictability to the law because it provides notice of what a person's rights and obligations are in particular circumstances. A person contemplating an action has the ability to know beforehand the legal outcome.), meaning that the nature of the law will be determined by many judges, through a complex process of interpretation and reinterpretation.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Courts often opt to read laws as [literally as possible](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/white-papers/on-originalism-in-constitutional-interpretation)(Originalism is a theory of the interpretation of legal texts, including the text of the Constitution. Originalists believe that the constitutional text ought to be given the original public meaning that it would have had at the time that it became law.). This means they may veer towards over-protecting restrictions on speech.
1.2.5. Pro: Governments and political elites may seek to expand the definition of hate speech to [restrict speech that criticizes](https://challengehate.com/what-if-your-government-treats-criticism-as-hate-speech/) them.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [Powerful political interest groups](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/07/us-billionaires-hard-right-britain-spiked-magazine-charles-david-koch-foundation)(When I asked Spiked what the money was for and whether there had been any other payments, its managing editor, Viv Regan, told me that the Charles Koch Foundation has now given Spiked US Inc a total of $300,000, “to produce public debates in the US about free speech, as part of its charitable activities”. She claims the foundation supports projects “on both the left and the right”. The Koch Foundation has funded “a free speech-oriented programme of public debates on campus titled the Unsafe Space Tour” and four live events, the first of which is titled “Should we be free to hate?” She told me: “We’re very proud of our work on free speech and tolerance, and we are proud to be part of the programme.”) might be able to influence hate speech legislation, making it unfair and unevenly enforced or watered down.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: The influence of political interest groups is not unique to hate speech. They influence [every aspect of legislation](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government), including whether or not legislation even gets passed.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Political actors may make bad faith accusations of offensive or discriminatory language against opponents who criticize them.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: In countries with strong far-right movements, institutions sometimes have an incentive to appear balanced, leading them to [excessively penalize](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/european-populism-left-right)(Right-wing populists have much in common. They reject all ruling elites and other political parties, whom they accuse of hijacking democracy. Distrustful of globalization to varying degrees, they assert the need for strong national sovereignty above all else and emphasize national interests. Their idea of the nation is based on ethnicity and identity, thereby rejecting foreigners and immigrants. They do not hesitate to inflate figures regarding the presence of these groups on their soil, or even to ring the alarm about the "great replacement" allegedly underway. Almost all of them denounce Islam as a threat to their country’s entire cultural heritage, which they reframe in their own image. They promise to be resolute defenders against the "multiculturalism" that they abhor. Finally, they present themselves as the best possible guarantors of security and authority in the face of delinquency, criminality and a threat of decay.) the speech of left-wing voices.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Many conservative commentators refer to certain proposals and talking points among civil rights groups as "[reverse racism](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/08/myth-of-reverse-racism/535689/)(Data show that many Americans do perceive reverse racism to be a significant societal problem. A 2016 Public Religion Research Institute poll indicates that half of all Americans, 57 percent of all white people, and 66 percent of the white working class believe that discrimination against white people is as big a problem in America as discrimination against black people.)." They may have an incentive to weaponize hate speech laws against this speech.
1.2.5.2.3. Pro: Criticisms of Israeli foreign policy are [sometimes branded as being anti-Semitic](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-criticism-of-israel-and-its-policies-isn-t-antisemitism-1.9668517)(The Israeli government and its supporters have a keen interest in blurring the distinction between criticism of Israel and antisemitism, in order to paint any substantive, harsh criticism of Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians as antisemitic. By these lights, opposing the occupation is considered antisemitic, BDS is antisemitic, criticism of Zionism is antisemitic, and the International Criminal Court in the Hague is of course without a shadow of doubt antisemitic. The Israeli government and its supporters have put tremendous effort into advancing this notion. Just recently, Haaretz published a comprehensive report on the witch hunt taking place in Germany against critics of Israeli government policy.). Hate speech laws may allow governments to penalize these critics.
1.2.5.2.4. Con: Political parties have an [incentive](https://aceproject.org/today/feature-articles/countering-hate-speech-in-elections-strategies-for)(The use of hate speech during elections is a dynamic and rapidly evolving issue. Its scope and complexity will require a strategic approach that connects with and mutually reinforces the efforts of a range of stakeholders. Regulatory solutions can be controversial, difficult to reconcile when fundamental rights come into conflict, and their effectiveness is limited. As such, EMBs would be well advised to explore non-regulatory solutions in collaboration with both state and non-state actors. To date, rigorous quantitative research about how distinct populations understand and react to \(or act upon\) hate speech and about the effectiveness of counter measures in specific country contexts is limited. Comparative practice of EMBs is not readily accessible to the broader community of election practitioners, nor is information about how EMBs have successfully leveraged the experience of other government bodies or civil society.) to not create egregious cynical restrictions on speech as, should they lose an election, those laws may be used against them.
1.2.5.2.4.1. Con: Political parties will like refrain from punishing their own members and supporters at the risk of losing them. Therefore, they are unlikely to enforce hate speech laws evenly.
1.2.5.3. Con: Governments and political elites do not need to use an expanded definition of hate speech to restrict criticisms against them.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: The government of Ethiopia has been [accused](https://www.article19.org/resources/ethiopia-hate-speech-and-disinformation-law-must-not-be-used-to-supress-the-criticism-of-the-government/) of using hate speech laws to crush dissent and effectively block and ban criticism of the government.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Governments often have other means of silencing criticism, like forms of [intimidation](https://cspl.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/08/intimidation-in-public-life-continues-to-threaten-democracy/)(Intimidation is not just a problem for national politicians and public figures, but is unfortunately the reality for local councillors, and all those holding public appointments, such as headteachers. It is completely unacceptable that individuals and, in some cases, their families, should be subject to threats and abuse for doing their job.) or ways of deprioritizing the speech of dissidents.
1.2.5.3.3. Pro: Countries like Belarus and China are well-known for [restricting the freedom of speech](https://ifex.org/freedom-house-report-finds-global-internet-freedom-in-decline-for-the-11th-consecutive-year/)(China continues to rank as the worst environment for internet freedom. The greatest deteriorations were documented in Myanmar, Belarus, and Uganda, where state forces cracked down amid electoral and constitutional crises.) without abusing hate speech laws.
1.2.5.4. Con: Political parties who seek to obstruct hate speech laws will likely face some electoral backlash, giving them an incentive to not abuse them.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: Parties who oppose speech restrictions often receive [significant amounts of support](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/first-amendment-regulation/617827/)(The deplatforming of the president appeared to many conservatives to offer vivid proof that these companies are just as dangerous to freedom of speech as Trump had claimed. Steve Daines, a Republican senator from Montana, took to Twitter to attack “Big Tech” for “censoring \[Trump\] and the free speech of American citizens.” Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, claimed that the platforms’ decision to restrict speech “threatened our democracy.” And on the floor of the Capitol building, newly sworn-in Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wore a mask bearing a single word—CENSORED—in stark white letters. Many liberals, meanwhile, insisted that the decision to deplatform the president had nothing to do with freedom of speech, at least not as protected by the First Amendment.). This may actually give parties an additional incentive to oppose them.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: Voters may see these parties as 'obstructionist' or refusing to focus on more important issues related to their well-being.
1.2.5.4.3. Con: Studies show that candidates who have registered at least one case of confirmed hate speech have improved their electoral performance [threefold](https://thewire.in/communalism/hate-speech-accused-3-times-more-successful-in-elections)(Candidates with hate-speech cases against them were three times more successful in elections compared to those without a criminal record, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of self-disclosed crime records of candidates who have contested various elections nationwide over the past 12 years.).
1.2.5.5. Pro: Recent [court cases](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/pablo-casta-o/free-speech-under-siege-in-spain)(But the situation has become much darker in recent months. Last February, three blows to free speech took place in the space of 24 hours: rapper Valtonyc was condemned to three and a half years in prison for the lyrics of his songs, Santiago Serra's work 'Political Prisoners in Contemporary Spain' was excluded from the Arco contemporary art fair in Madrid, and the book Fariña was seized by a judge because it points out alleged links between a Galician Popular Party leader and drug trafficking. Serra, whose censored work has denounced the situation of Catalan political prisoners, duly protested: “If Spain isn't a dictatorship, it surely looks a lot like one”.) in Spain arguably show punishments being doled out against speech that was defined as [disrespectful](http://theconversation.com/spains-freedom-of-speech-repression-is-no-joke-75889)(Ruling on her crime, judges in the National Audience, Spain’s top criminal court, stated that Vera’s tweets “constitute contempt, dishonour, disrepute, mockery and affront to the people who have suffered the blow of terrorism”.\n\nThough the victims of terrorism do, as noted by the judges, deserve “respect and consideration”, the prison sentence has caused outcry in Spain. These kinds of jokes have been repeated publicly since the day of the attack. Luis Carrero Blanco’s granddaughter herself has even written that though the jokes were in bad taste, she is “scared of a society in which freedom of expression … can lead to jail sentences”.), especially in cases that are [critical of the government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/world/europe/echr-spain-free-speech.html)(In their unanimous ruling, the judges said they were “not convinced” that the burning “could reasonably be construed as incitement to hatred or violence.”).
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Many of these cases are contentious because of the recent [Catalonian independence referendum](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29478415)(Following a symbolic referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election.\n\nCatalonia's pro-independence leaders then went ahead with a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also declared illegal by Spain's constitutional court.\n\nOrganisers said 90% of voters backed a split. But turnout was only 43% amid a boycott by unionists.\n\nIn a febrile atmosphere the separatist majority in the Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October.\n\nUsing the Article 155 emergency powers, Madrid dissolved parliament, sacked its leaders and called a snap election for 21 December.\n\nSeparatists won a slim majority. The following May, Catalonia's parliament swore in Quim Torra as their new president, after Madrid blocked several other candidates. Mr Torra vowed to continue fighting for independence.\n\nThe sight of Spanish national police beating voters, and politicians being jailed, revived disturbing memories, for some, of the Franco dictatorship.).
1.2.5.6. Pro: Expanded definitions of hate speech have been used by authoritarian governments to [justify](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/14/germany-flawed-social-media-law)(At least three countries – Russia, Singapore, and the Philippines – have directly cited the German law as a positive example as they contemplate or propose legislation to remove “illegal” content online. The Russian draft law, currently before the Duma, could apply to larger social media platforms as well as online messaging services.) more aggressive speech restrictions against dissidents.
1.2.5.6.1. Pro: Russia has [hate speech laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country#Russia)(Actions aimed at the incitement of hatred or enmity, as well as the humiliation of a person or group of persons on grounds of sex, race, nationality, language, origin, attitude to religion, as well as affiliation to any social group, committed publicly or with the use of media or information and telecommunication networks, including the network "Internet" shall be punished by a fine of 300,000 to 500,000 rubles or the salary or other income for a period of 2 to 3 years, or community service for a period of 1 year to four years, with disqualification to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities up to 3 years, or imprisonment for a term of 2 to 5 years.) and has been [widely criticized](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/04/29/russia-closing-down-media-freedoms) for using them to infringe on the freedom of speech of its citizens.
1.2.5.6.1.1. Pro: Independent news organizations have faced [fines](https://www.rferl.org/a/rferl-european-court-block-russian-fines-foreign-agents-law/31206812.html)(The measures are "clearly intended to damage its reputation and viability as an independent media organization in Russia," RFE/RL's news release said.) for broadcast materials that the government has deemed "dangerous". This has made it harder for the media to criticize those with power.
1.2.5.6.1.2. Con: The supranational European Court of Human Rights has [dismissed specific challenges](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22itemid%22:\[%22001-79619%22\]}) on hate speech in Russia.
1.2.5.6.2. Con: A country banning hate speech without many free speech protections in general does not imply that most countries would abuse hate speech restrictions.
1.2.6. Pro: The definition of hate speech can often be ambiguous and subjective. Therefore, hate speech will be difficult to ban and any related laws would be easy to manipulate.
1.2.6.1. Con: Laws frequently deal with ambiguities; even if hate speech is ambiguously defined, the legal system will still be able to find an operable balance.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Threats, extortion, [slander](http://legaldb.freemedia.at/international-standards/), and blackmail are all speech acts that do not always have clear classifications but have been satisfactorily defined in the law.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: High courts, like the US Supreme Court, build more robust legal guidelines over time by [setting precedents](https://lexlaw.co.uk/solicitors-london/the-doctrine-of-legal-precedent-when-is-a-court-decision-binding/) on individual hate speech trials.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: Some hate speech laws inadvertently turn into laws that control how people are able to speak. As such, hate speech should be protected, to ensure this does not happen.
1.2.6.1.3.1. Con: [Limitations](https://futurefreespeech.com/global-handbook-on-hate-speech-laws/) on hate speech have been sparsely adopted worldwide. As such, it is unlikely that new laws will become overly restrictive.
1.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: [Freedom of expression](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2019/democracy-retreat)(Freedom of expression has come under sustained attack, through both assaults on the press and encroachments on the speech rights of ordinary citizens. Freedom in the World data show freedom of expression declining each year over the last 13 years, with sharper drops since 2012. This year, press freedom scores fell in four out of six regions in the world. Flagrant violations, like the imprisonment of journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo for their investigative reporting in Myanmar, have become more widespread. Even more stark have been the declines in personal expression, as governments have cracked down on critical discussion among citizens, especially online. The explosion of criminal cases for “insulting the president” in Turkey—more than 20,000 investigations and 6,000 prosecutions in 2017 alone—is one of the most glaring examples of this global trend.) has been declining for more than a decade across the globe, suggesting that governments are already willing to make trade-offs that limit people's rights.
1.2.6.1.3.2.1. Pro: Criticizing or [disrespecting Russia](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/03/putins-new-law-makes-it-illegal-disrespect-russia/585502/)(A couple of months later, Prokopyeva was made the target of a criminal investigation, accused by the authorities of “justifying terrorism,” making her the latest symbol of a worsening clampdown on journalists, activists, and human-rights defenders here. And the climate for free speech looks likely to get worse: This week, Putin signed into law new rules that criminalize any “disrespect” for Russian society, the government, official symbols, the constitution, or any state body, as well as what the authorities deem to be “fake news.” Watchdogs fear that the laws will be used to stamp out the limited pockets of dissent here, drowning out what were previously legal forms of protest.) or its government in any form is illegal.
1.2.6.1.3.2.2. Con: The global decline of freedom of expression largely has to do with the [increased global power](https://ifex.org/freedom-house-report-finds-global-internet-freedom-in-decline-for-the-11th-consecutive-year/)(Tech companies faced high-profile showdowns with illiberal and authoritarian leaders in India, Nigeria, Russia, and Turkey that will have global implications for the future of free expression online.) of authoritarian countries like China. It has little do with democratic countries clamping down on dissent.
1.2.6.1.3.2.3. Pro: Freedom of speech in Hungary, Poland, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey has been [eroded](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2019/democracy-retreat)(Antidemocratic leaders in Central Europe and the Balkans—including some who have brazenly consolidated power beyond constitutional limits—continued undermining institutions that protect freedoms of expression and association and the rule of law.) by anti-democratic leaders clamping down on dissent with aggressive speech restrictions.
1.2.6.1.3.3. Con: Even if overly restrictive laws are proposed, vocal opposition will help countries develop fairer hate speech laws over time. This experimentation would help create sustainable laws with the consent of all major parties.
1.2.6.1.3.4. Pro: Meaningfully cracking down on hate speech may necessitate especially draconian enforcement policies. Therefore, even otherwise well-intentioned governments may slip into over-restriction \([p. 3](https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/publications/striking-a-balance.pdf)(Much censorship down the centuries has been advanced for ideal causes to promote versions of the good or the truth, whether secular or religious. It has almost always ended in disaster in the constricting of debate, the suppression of dissent and the corruption of the truth. The advocate of freedom of expression has no difficulty in demonstrating the abuse of legal controls even on racial speech in contemporary history. The South African laws against racial hatred were used systematically against the victims of its racist policies. 3 In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union laws against defamation and insult were vehicles for the persecution of critics who were often also victims of state-tolerated or sponsored anti-Semitism. The writer Salman Rushdie has been subjected for three years to persecution and a death sentence because his novel was declared an insult to Islam.)\).
1.2.6.1.3.4.1. Con: Enforcement agencies will likely seek to identify powerful people and communities, rather than targeting individuals with little influence, as that would be more effective and visible.
1.2.6.1.3.4.2. Pro: Governments may need to monitor more closely the social media posts of citizens, for example, to identify who is engaging in hate speech. This, however, would require much greater violations of privacy.
1.2.6.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: With such capabilities, governments may use this information for other purposes, which may lead to more infringements of their rights.
1.2.6.1.4. Con: Ambiguity increases the chance that a given law will not be applied equally across all jurisdictions in a given country \([pp. 320-321](https://digitalcommons.du.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1649&context=dlr)(In its review, the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue\nwhether under the Tennessee statute "crime\[s\] against nature" was to be "narrowly applied to only those acts constituting the common-law offense of sodomy, or \[was it\] to be broadly interpreted to encompass additional forms of sexual aberration. In addressing this issue, the Court first pointed out that a "substantial number of jurisdictions" maintain the common law proscription of "crimes against nature.")\).
1.2.6.1.4.1. Pro: Specificity is required in legislation; for instance, court cases surrounding ['up-skirting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upskirt),' a clear violation of a woman's privacy that occurs in public spaces, have had rulings go [both ways](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47902522) regarding the [legality](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-appeals-court-upskirting-is-legal/).
1.2.6.2. Pro: Depending on the context, it is possible for one comment to be hate speech, but for an identical comment to not qualify.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Sometimes, other people [choose to take offense](https://www.fastcompany.com/90472232/these-are-the-reasons-why-you-find-something-offensive) to things that the person who was actually insulted does not care about.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Hate speech cases should not be fully delineated until proven that they have [caused harm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10677-019-10002-0#Sec6)(Hate speech is a particularly nasty type of speech, but it is still speech, not conduct, and is covered by the freedom of speech principle \(Section 5\). Waldron clearly agrees with that conclusion when he states that its value must be balanced against the gravity of the harm for which it is responsible. As explained in Section 3 of this article, though Waldron argues that hate speech does performative work, his case is essentially consequentialist: it is legitimate to proscribe it because of its impact on the sense of social assurance to which we are all entitled.). As this is how [common law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/common_law) works, it should be applied to hate speech as well.
1.2.6.2.2.1. Pro: The Rabat Plan of Action outlines [six criteria](https://rm.coe.int/advanced-guide-toolkit-how-to-analyse-hate-speech/1680a217cd)(In order to make the distinction between the criminally punishable hate speech and the other two \ntype of hate speech, the Rabat Plan of Action proposes a six-part threshold test, that takes into account:\n \n1. the Context of the speech \n2. the Speaker \n3. the Intent \n4. the Content and the form of the speech \n5. the Extent of the speech and \n6. the Likelihood of the speech to produce immediate actions against its targets. \n \nand offers general recommendation as to what needs to be taken into account for each of these six criteria.), including the potential to cause harm, that must be met in order to establish whether speech should be considered hateful or not.
1.2.6.2.3. Pro: There is an [ongoing debate](https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-point-of-offensive-humour-76889)(Some people believe that offensive humour such as sexist or racist jokes can help break down barriers and challenge prejudice. Others simply find it appalling. The topic is clearly sensitive and often leads to discussions about free speech, morality and political correctness.) as to whether some offensive jokes and controversial comedic routines should be considered hate speech.
1.2.6.2.3.1. Pro: Many comedians have been "[cancelled](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-10-15/cancel-culture-comedy-history-chappelle)" and threatened with violence due to their controversial routines involving ethnic jokes that toe the line of acceptability.
1.2.6.2.3.2. Pro: The hate speech trial against comedian Count Dankula led to an immense [debate](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/count-dankula-freedom-of-speech-comedy-joke-iran-offended-a8270631.html)(There were an abundance of people who hated this “alternative” comedy as much as I hated Manning but that’s the point – comedy is subjective. You can’t say something isn’t a joke just because you don’t find it funny.) about offensive comedy, with little to no agreement between sides.
1.2.6.2.3.3. Con: There are plenty of comedians who make [edgy jokes](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150804-comedy-in-the-age-of-outrage-when-jokes-go-too-far) without crossing the line into hate speech.
1.2.6.2.3.4. Con: It is mainly those comedians who '[punch down](https://scroll.in/article/995883/punching-down-the-profound-problem-with-comedy-routines-that-target-marginal-groups)(On the other hand, when people make casteist, sexist or Islamaphobic jokes, they are “punching down”. The subjects of these jokes might be incompetent in their own way – be they politicians who exploit their popularity, doctors who seem less than competent or religious fanatics who use dogma to instigate violence.\n\nThe problem arises when their incompetence is linked with their larger social identities as members of groups that have traditionally been marginalised. Men joking about their wife’s driving might seem funny if viewed in isolation. But if this premise is linked to their spouse’s gender and becomes a generalisation about all women drivers, it forms the basis of every misogynistic WhatsApp forward ever.)' who are criticized as hateful. Comedians do not need to mock marginal groups to be funny.
1.2.6.3. Pro: The meaning and intention of one's speech is often unclear. As such, it will be difficult for such laws to be written and enforced fairly.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: Many crimes already require courts to make judgements regarding the [intent](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-criminallaw/chapter/4-2-criminal-intent/)(Although there are exceptions that are discussed shortly, criminal intent or mens rea is an essential element of most crimes. Under the common law, all crimes consisted of an act carried out with a guilty mind. In modern society, criminal intent can be the basis for fault, and punishment according to intent is a core premise of criminal justice.) of accused individuals.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: There are clear-cut examples of hate speech with harmful intent which can be written into law fairly easily.
1.2.6.3.2.1. Pro: Slurs are [considered provocative](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0403.xml) and bring about violent reactions; those words could be easy examples of hate speech.
1.2.6.3.2.2. Pro: [Symbols](https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols) used by hate groups or [misinformation](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/disturbing-resilience-scientific-racism-180972243/) used to justify and perpetuate discrimination can be identified objectively.
1.2.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: Some [symbols](https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols) are deliberately used by hate groups and should be censored.
1.2.6.3.2.3. Con: Accusations for hate speech are often made regarding far less clear-cut forms of speech.
1.2.6.3.2.3.1. Pro: Racial slurs and monkey noises [directed at a family in Virginia](https://www.wtkr.com/news/disturbing-and-reprehensible-racial-slurs-animal-noises-played-in-neighborhood-not-considered-crime-va-beach-police-say), though racist, were not considered hate speech because they were not threatening or intimidating.
1.2.6.3.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.3.4.1.
1.2.6.3.3. Pro: There are a number of [common hand gestures](https://www.businessinsider.com/hand-gestures-offensive-different-countries-2018-6) in the US which are considered offensive in other countries, and [vice versa](https://people.howstuffworks.com/10-obscene-hand-gestures-from-around-world.htm).
1.2.6.4. Con: Many clear and operational definitions of hate speech exist.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech)(We define hate speech as a direct attack against people – rather than concepts or institutions – on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We define attacks as violent or dehumanising speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation.) and [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en) have very clear guidelines regarding what counts as hate speech.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Con: The [technical and algorithmic challenges](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.00003/full#h5)(First, the main goal of the project essentially turned out to be the quantification of hate as a single digit and a figure of anticipation \(see Mackenzie, 2013\). This happens, first, when classifying the training data, and second, when vectorizing the textual data for the machine learning method \(Mackenzie, 2017\). While an adequately well-working machine learning solution was developed in the project, the automated approach requires heavy simplification, such as using rudimentary scales for classifying hate speech, which in reality has several different tones and varieties.) encountered by social media companies make it nearly impossible to eliminate hate speech, regardless of their official public stances.
1.2.6.4.1.2. Con: Despite attempting to reduce hateful content and misinformation, both [remain rampant](https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/)(In public, Facebook seems to claim that it removes more than 90 percent of hate speech on its platform, but in private internal communications the company says the figure is only an atrocious 3 to 5 percent.) on Facebook.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1. Con: Social media websites could decrease hate speech on their platforms without banning it. Research suggests that [personalized warnings](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/november/warnings-may-reduce-hate-speech-on-twitter.html)(Warning Twitter users about potential adverse consequences of their use of hate speech can decrease their subsequent posting of hateful language for a week, finds a new study by New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics.) for users could do so successfully.
1.2.6.4.1.3. Pro: In general, social media companies consider [direct attacks on people](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) to be the determining factor.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: The Southern Poverty Law Center \([SPLC](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Southern-Poverty-Law-Center)\), [an arguably well-respected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/26/after-conservative-backlash-charity-tracker-guidestar-removes-hate-group-labels/?utm_term=.11576296e05a) authority in this field, frequently identifies clear examples of hate speech.
1.2.6.4.2.1. Pro: The SPLC even maintains a [clearly defined hate group list](https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map)(\[Those who\] vilify others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity – prejudices that strike at the heart of our democratic values and fracture society along its most fragile fault lines).
1.2.6.4.2.2. Con: In the past, the SPLC has had to face criticism and backlash regarding certain policies and behaviors, potentially undermining their credibility.
1.2.6.4.2.2.1. Pro: The SPLC had been facing [litigation](https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2018/april/southern-poverty-law-center-deletes-list-of-anti-muslim-extremists-after-legal-threat) for defamation after listing Maajid Nawaz, a liberal Muslim who founded an anti-extremist think tank in the UK, as an anti-Muslim extremist.
1.2.6.4.3. Pro: Several governments and governmental organizations have defined hate speech.
1.2.6.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.2.6.4.3.2. Pro: The UN has a clear [definition of hate speech](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf)(\[A\]ny kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.).
1.2.6.4.3.3. Con: Despite having defined hate speech, an analysis of relevant laws in Europe determined that they were "vague and overbroad," suggesting that they are incapable of protecting individuals or groups from hateful incitement \([p. 17](https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ECA-hate-speech-compilation-report_March-2018.pdf)(Typically, the relevant provisions prohibit various types of incitement and are often vague and overbroad. These include, inter alia: “the use of unlawful threats directed against groups or individuals” or “public insult of group of people or individuals” on protected grounds \(Poland\); “instigating” or “provoking violence” based on protected grounds or “public instigation to disobedience of public order or hatred amongst social classes” \(Italy\); “hatred with intentional harming of human dignity” \(Austria\); publically “promoting” certain ideologies \(Poland\); the “dissemination” of certain ‘propaganda’” \(Germany\); “racialist chanting at football matches” or belonging to certain proscribed organisations, including some Nazi organisations, in the country or overseas \(UK\).)\).
1.2.6.4.3.3.1. Pro: Germany's recent hate speech laws have been criticized for being [too unclear](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/01/13/germany-is-silencing-hate-speech-but-cannot-define-it).
1.2.6.4.3.4. Pro: In Canada, where hate speech is outlawed, [sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-42.html#docCont) define hate speech as advocating genocide, or encouraging hatred towards a group which is likely to lead to a breach of the peace.
1.2.6.4.3.4.1. Pro: In R. v. Keegstra \(1990\), the Canadian Supreme Court clearly defined hate speech as speech with a destructive intent that cannot be reasoned with \([p. 700](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/695/1/document.do)(Hatred is predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society. Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation.)\).
1.2.6.4.4. Con: Definitions vary from company to company and country to country. No [single universal definition exists](https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/)(People who live in the same country — or next door — often have different levels of tolerance for speech about protected characteristics. To some, crude humor about a religious leader can be considered both blasphemy and hate speech against all followers of that faith. To others, a battle of gender-based insults may be a mutually enjoyable way of sharing a laugh. Is it OK for a person to post negative things about people of a certain nationality as long as they share that same nationality? What if a young person who refers to an ethnic group using a racial slur is quoting from lyrics of a song?), making it difficult to guarantee that any given piece of speech would be considered hate speech.
1.2.6.5. Pro: Hate speech definitions vary based on culture and politics. This will make it harder to create fair and just hate speech laws around the world.
1.2.6.5.1. Pro: In Canada, the non-binding [Motion 103](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/3/24/canada-passes-m-103-motion-against-islamophobia) was introduced as anti-Islamophobia legislation; yet, comparable motions for Judeaphobia and Christianophobia do not exist.
1.2.6.5.2. Pro: A comprehensive analysis of European nations with hate speech laws showed significant variations between their respective definitions and applications \([p. 16](https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ECA-hate-speech-compilation-report_March-2018.pdf)(There are significant variations across the six countries in how incitement is approached and defined in legislation, and in how these concepts are then applied. The inconsistencies in approach and application exist even within the countries under review and are further compounded by the range of specified protected characteristics in those countries. The available case-law also shows that the legal reasoning deployed by the courts is often vague, ad hoc and seemingly lacking in conceptual discipline or rigour.)\).
1.2.6.5.3. Con: Culture and politics influence law-making in every country; this is [not unique](https://www.pibriefupdate.com/content/pibulj-sec/2065-how-do-legal-systems-differ-from-one-country-to-another) to the issue of hate speech.
1.2.6.5.4. Pro: The varying cultural and political settings will cause a large variation between how hate speech laws will be written and enforced across countries, eliminating the ability for most governments to take inspiration from each other.
1.2.6.5.5. Con: Some tools, like the [Miller Test](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/obscenity), can be used to create a more general and applicable model of what constitutes generally 'offensive' hate speech.
1.2.6.5.5.1. Pro: The Miller Test judges speech as obscene if it fulfills [one of three conditions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/obscenity)(Currently, obscenity is evaluated by federal and state courts alike using a tripartite standard established by Miller v. California. The Miller test for obscenity includes the following criteria: \(1\) whether ‘the average person, applying contemporary community standards’ would find that the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ appeals to ‘prurient interest’ \(2\) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and \(3\) whether the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.): if the average person would find it distasteful, it describes a clear crime, or it has no clear value.
1.2.6.5.5.2. Con: The US Supreme Court has repeatedly struggled with what the Miller Test defines as "[problematic elements](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1585/miller-test)(In the ensuing decades, the Miller test would face its greatest challenge with online obscenity cases. In Ashcroft v. ACLU \(2002\), a case challenging the constitutionality of the Child Online Protection Act, several justices questioned the constitutionality of applying the local community standards of Miller to speech on the Internet.)." This means that institutions will struggle to use such definitions.
1.3. Con: Hate speech directly causes violence and harms its victims.
1.3.1. Pro: Hate speech should be prohibited because of the emotional harm it inflicts on victimized groups.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Harvard University's research on [verbal child abuse](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/verbal-beatings-hurt-as-much-as-sexual-abuse/) denotes that speech is a form of abuse with lasting effects.
1.3.1.2. Con: Whether hate speech causes mental harms will depend on individual predispositions and interpretations, which cannot be codified into law.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Despite their potential subjectivity, mental harms are frequently codified into law.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Stalking, intimidation and death threats are [legislated against](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Criminal-Threats.htm)(Even though the Constitution guarantees the right of free speech, that right is not an absolute one. The law has long recognized specific limitations when it comes to speech, such as prohibitions against slander and libel. In some situations, speech can even constitute a crime, such as in the case of criminal threats. A criminal threat, sometimes known as the terrorist threat, malicious harassment, or by other terms, occurs when someone threatens to kill or physically harm someone else.), regardless of freedom of speech protections.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Psychological damages can be sought and awarded through [emotional distress tort laws](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress).
1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Cases where mental harms are legislated against tend to be ones where victims suffer significantly in an overwhelming number of cases. It is not clear that hate speech is harmful to such a degree.
1.3.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Pervasive hate speech is tied to increased [immigrant suicide rates](https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20040813/hate-speech-predicts-immigrant-suicide-rates) in Europe.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Mental health professionals agree that hate speech causes [severe emotional harm](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/hate-speech-killing-us).
1.3.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Depression, PTSD, and other mental conditions are all [protected categories](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/depression-ptsd-other-mental-health-conditions-workplace-your-legal-rights)(If you have depression, post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\), or another mental health condition, you are protected against discrimination and harassment at work because of your condition, you have workplace privacy rights, and you may have a legal right to get reasonable accommodations that can help you perform and keep your job. The following questions and answers briefly explain these rights, which are provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\). You may also have additional rights under other laws not discussed here, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act \(FMLA\) and various medical insurance laws.) under the law. Being a victim of hate speech is not.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Harm from speech is context-dependent. People who know each other well often say mean or offensive things about each other without mental harms accruing.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: Even if offense is somewhat subjective, all people should have the right to harassment-free safe spaces, where hate speech is prohibited.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: For example, the family of a deceased Black person should have the right to have a funeral without being harassed by the KKK.
1.3.1.2.3.2. Con: This does not require governments to restrict speech. Individuals can form their own safe spaces with those they know and trust, without aid from the government.
1.3.1.2.3.3. Con: In public areas, there are no harassment-free safe spaces.
1.3.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Hateful groups are [legally permitted to protest at funerals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/03/21/westboro-baptist-church-pickets-funerals/6688951/)(U.S. Marine Matthew Snyder \(2006\): When Westboro members, including Phelps, picketed the March, 2006, funeral of Matthew Snyder, a Marine killed in Iraq, it sparked a case that went to the Supreme Court in 2010. The high court decided in an 8-1 decision that the church's actions were protected under free speech. Westboro has picketed numerous military funerals dating before and after Snyder's.) as it falls under the freedom of speech.
1.3.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: If the offensive comments occur [during a public protest](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10459695/Florida-Nazis-spewed-anti-Semitic-hatred-horrific-racist-rally-Orlando.html)(A spokesperson said: 'The group, assembled on public property, was reported by witnesses to be wearing clothing with "Nazi" insignia and yelling profanities and anti-Semitic slurs at vehicles passing by.'\n\nThey added several demonstrators got into a fight with a person passing by, and an investigation is ongoing although no arrests were made.\n\nPolice said that while the office 'deplores hate speech in any form', the protesters had the First Amendment right to demonstrate.) without any of the protesters breaking any laws, then the protestors' comments would not be prohibited.
1.3.1.2.3.3.3. Con: In places like Dubai and Rio de Janeiro, there are specific women-only metro cars which can act as a proxy for eliminating hate speech and harassment from men \([pp. 30-31](https://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Women-only-Transport.pdf)\).
1.3.1.3. Pro: Psychological harm, such as PTSD, can be [just as significant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/)(Initial reactions to trauma can include exhaustion, confusion, sadness, anxiety, agitation, numbness, dissociation, confusion, physical arousal, and blunted affect. Most responses are normal in that they affect most survivors and are socially acceptable, psychologically effective, and self-limited. Indicators of more severe responses include continuous distress without periods of relative calm or rest, severe dissociation symptoms, and intense intrusive recollections that continue despite a return to safety. Delayed responses to trauma can include persistent fatigue, sleep disorders, nightmares, fear of recurrence, anxiety focused on flashbacks, depression, and avoidance of emotions, sensations, or activities that are associated with the trauma, even remotely.) as physical harm.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Making people feel unsafe or inferior can cause significant, harmful changes to their behavior.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Hate speech can cause the person on the receiving end to retaliate with physical violence \([p. 101](https://rm.coe.int/wecan-eng-final-23052017-web/168071ba08)(A point of departure is to understand that feelings in the context of activism and committed educational work are real and legitimate. It is reasonable to feel desperate, hurt and/or angry when addressing hate speech, especially if it targets social groups that one is a member of. It is important not to feel afraid or ashamed to talk about one’s feelings, especially when facing a difficult situation of producing and using counter narratives. It is recommended that organisations arrange mentoring and “safer-people” with whom to talk about it, even just to ventilate the \(justified\) anger. One should allow oneself to feel vulnerable in spaces and with people one can rely on. If needed, one should not hesitate to take a break for some time \(an hour, two weeks, a month...\) and, if possible, be able to provide the same support to colleagues and communities.)\).
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Women often [change their behavior](https://www.cairn.info/revue-francaise-de-sociologie-1-2007-5-page-101.htm) when faced with unsafe or unfamiliar situations.
1.3.1.4.3. Con: Forms of implicit discrimination are just as likely to make such people feel unsafe or inferior. Confronting those forms of discrimination would be more effective.
1.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: Interacting in [spaces](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2018/08/28/how-to-help-women-sustain-careers-in-male-dominated-spaces/)(Despite the best efforts of many firms, gender equality in terms of employee numbers is still elusive. Close to 40 per cent of women who gain engineering degrees eventually decide to leave the profession.\n\nResearch has identified many barriers that deter women from establishing careers in a male dominated context. The exclusion of women from male oriented social networks, stereotyping women as technically incompetent, perceiving women first and foremost in terms of sexuality and appearance – these are just a few.) dominated by ethnic, racial, or gender majorities is more frequently what leads minorities to feel insecure in public spaces.
1.3.1.4.3.2. Con: Both forms of discrimination can and should be targeted at the same time.
1.3.2. Pro: Bans on hate speech would incentivize people to make fewer potentially offensive comments due to the risk of being caught and punished.
1.3.2.1. Con: Banning hate speech may create a backlash that leads to an increased amount of harmful speech and actions.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: "[Whitelash](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/11/us/obama-trump-white-backlash/index.html)," or white backlash, is a common response by white people against the progressions and advancements made by minorities; these people view this as encroachment into "their territory."
1.3.2.1.2. Con: The power of public backlash can be overstated. Many murderers in the US have been found [not guilty](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/kyle-rittenhouse-verdict-reaction-conservatives), despite the public backlash against them.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: When people with hateful views are unable to express themselves, they often perceive themselves as victims of oppression by the government and double down on their opinions.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: In practice, suppressing a viewpoint alienates the individuals who subscribe to it, making them less accessible to constructive discourse.
1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Many people do not form their opinions based on facts, but based on [their identities, and their communities](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_is_it_so_hard_to_change_peoples_minds)(Most of us have a strong drive to hold on to pre-existing beliefs and convictions, which keep us anchored in the world. When your stance on controversial issues both cements your group identity and plants you in opposition to perceived enemies, changing it can exact a high personal toll.\n\n“We are social animals instinctively reliant on our tribe for safety and protection,” says risk perception expert David Ropeik, author of How Risky Is It, Really? “Any disloyalty literally feels dangerous, like the tribe will kick you out. This effect is magnified in people already worried.”). As such, suppressing certain viewpoints creates backlash as people feel personally attacked.
1.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Often, attempts to refute and discredit hate speech are also interpreted as suppression, meaning that the benefits of open communication are somewhat limited.
1.3.2.1.3.2. Con: Those who engage in hate speech often feel they are [victimized or targeted](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09662-x)(We find that these manifestations of victimhood cut across partisan, ideological, and sociodemographic lines, suggesting that feelings of victimhood are confined to neither “actual” victims nor those partisans on the losing side of elections. Moreover, both manifestations of victimhood, while related to candidate support and various racial attitudes, prove to be distinct from related psychological constructs, such as \(collective\) narcissism, system justification, and relative deprivation. Finally, an experiment based on candidate rhetoric demonstrates that some political messaging can make supporters feel like victims, which has consequences for subsequent attitudes and behavior.) regardless of the reality. As such, laws against hate speech are unlikely to dramatically change their feelings.
1.3.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Additional examples of their victimization may lead such people to support increasingly extreme political actions, as they see themselves as having no alternatives \([p. 83](https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&context=gsp)(Eliminating the perceived viability of alternatives to violence is therefore just as critical as are assertions of the desirability or permissibility of violent options themselves. There are various ways in which this destruction of alternatives can\noccur.)\).
1.3.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Trump and his supporters often describe themselves as the [victims](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/conservatism-reaches-dead-end/617629/) of the January 6, 2021 invasion of the Capitol in Washington, DC.
1.3.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: In contemporary right-wing movements, many claim to [feel victimized](https://www.salon.com/2021/12/27/the-conservative-urge-to-be-a-victim-why-right-wing-victimhood-is-spreading-so-fast/)(It is this exact same logic that was the backdrop to the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and we can see the same logic in play in right-wing responses to the House investigation into the attack. Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich claimed, "Democracy is under attack. However, not by the people who illegally entered the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, but instead by a committee whose members walk freely in its halls every day." That's right, according to Budowich the real threat to our democracy are those elected officials investigating what happened on January 6, not the actual people who attacked the Capitol. Those people were, according to this twisted logic, simply victims of election fraud.) by changing social norms that criticize their traditional forms of behavior.
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: Social backlash often [spreads easily and quickly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hundreds-of-neo-nazis-march-in-berlin-protected-by-police/) through tabloids and traditional media, which would end up reinforcing hateful behavior.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Con: The hate and backlash created by these tabloids can actually end up impacting their bottom line, as demonstrated by the [Stop Funding Hate](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2016/11/pulled-advertising-university-newspaper-bans-backlash-against-uk-tabloids)(This came only a week following Lego’s announcement that they were “not planning any future promotional activity” with the Mail after heeding calls to boycott newspapers that promoted “demonisation and division” during the Brexit debate from the Stop Funding Hate campaign group.) campaign.
1.3.2.1.4.2. Pro: Sometimes, restrictions on speech unwittingly create [heroes, icons, and role models](http://leejohnbarnes.blogspot.com/2009/09/freedom-for-josue-estebanez-de-la-hija.html) for hate groups.
1.3.2.1.4.3. Pro: Social learning [occurs by imitation](http://web.colby.edu/socialpsychology/2015/03/21/social-learning-learning-through-imitation/). For example, oftentimes suicides are not covered by the media to avoid giving others the "[inspiration](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/the-werther-effect/42915/)."
1.3.2.2. Pro: The certainty of getting caught doing something illegal or frowned upon is often the biggest deterrent \([p. 2](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/247350.pdf)(Certainty refers to the likelihood of being caught and punished for the commission of a crime. Research underscores the more significant role that certainty plays in deterrence than severity — it is the certainty of being caught that deters a person from committing crime, not the fear of being punished or the severity of the punishment. Effective policing that leads to swift and certain \(but not necessarily severe\) sanctions is a better deterrent than the threat of incarceration. In addition, there is no evidence that the deterrent effect increases when the likelihood of conviction increases. Nor is there any evidence that the deterrent effect increases when the likelihood of imprisonment increases.)\).
1.3.2.3. Pro: People with hateful views may commit hate speech and crimes for the thrill of it \([p. 30](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/58880/1/understanding-who-commits-hate-crime-and-why-they-do-it-en.pdf)(McDevitt et al \(2002\) identify that, when some people are bored or seeking excitement, then they are more likely to initiate or participate in hate crimes. Based upon an analysis of 169 police cases in Boston they concluded that in around 66% of these, offenders were motivated by the ‘thrill’ of their act and the need to enhance their own feelings of power and importance. Again this replicates the commissioning of crimes in general as Katz \(1988\) showed.)\). As such, many will decide that the potential costs of engaging in it outweigh the benefits.
1.3.3. Con: Banning hate speech may lead to more violence against those typically victimized.
1.3.3.1. Con: Allowing countries to restrict hate speech in certain cases would reduce the frequency with which people see certain offensive ideas.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: When Donald Trump was banned from Twitter over the January 6th riots, his mentions on social media [decreased significantly](https://www.vox.com/recode/22421396/donald-trump-social-media-ban-facebook-twitter-decrease-drop-impact-youtube)(Mentions of Trump went down by 34 percent on Twitter and 23 percent on Facebook the week after he was banned from both platforms following the Capitol riot on January 6. Since then, Trump mentions have continued to decline around 90 percent on both platforms from where they were the week of the riots. \(That decline may be even greater than what the current data reflects on Twitter because it doesn’t include retweets and tweets from accounts that have since been deleted, like Trump’s.\)).
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: [Distrust](https://www.cato.org/policy-report/january/february-2021/big-tech-free-speech#) of tech companies is bipartisan in the US and prevalent all over the world. Therefore, there would likely be [greater backlash](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter-suspension-effective-1277806/)(No sooner had Greene been suspended than she huffed off to GETTR — a social media platform run by a former Trump adviser — to flex that “Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth,” adding that she’ll “show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies.” In short order, then, one began to wonder if maybe she was right, if maybe social media bans just create an elaborate game of whack-a-mole, sending offenders off to GETTR pastures where they can reach just as many like-minded Americans as they did before.) and lack of support for tech companies spearheading the regulation of speech.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: If prominent and powerful forms of hate speech are restricted, it might become difficult to come across hate speech, except for those actively seeking it out.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.2.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: "[Selective censorship](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms)(The reason is that Facebook deletes curses, slurs, calls for violence and several other types of attacks only when they are directed at “protected categories”—based on race, sex, gender identity, religious affiliation, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation and serious disability/disease. It gives users broader latitude when they write about “subsets” of protected categories. White men are considered a group because both traits are protected, while female drivers and black children, like radicalized Muslims, are subsets, because one of their characteristics is not protected.)" is already in effect on Facebook; algorithms developed and programmed predominantly by white men protect the speech of white people while censoring that of Black people.
1.3.3.1.4.1. Con: Facebook censorship changes are not based on race. They work in favor of [protected categories](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/)(We define hate speech as a direct attack against people — rather than concepts or institutions— on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We define attacks as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation.) and classes of people.
1.3.3.1.4.2. Con: Increasing [diversity in programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/why-diversity-matters-more-in-programming-ad6c5d3d2641) is one way to ensure that algorithms are representative and protective of the entire populace, not just the groups that programmed them.
1.3.3.1.4.3. Pro: Facebook censorship programs are dreadful at monitoring posts in [foreign languages](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/john-oliver-tackles-whatsapp-misinformation-immigrants-rcna2861); fake news that Facebook blocks in English is still commonly shared in other languages.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Hate speech is more dangerous when driven underground. Therefore, it should remain legal to prevent more harm from being caused.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: If an individual's irrational hatreds are reinforced in echo chambers, they will be [more likely to commit hate crimes](https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/gab-and-8chan-home-to-terrorist-plots-hiding-in-plain-sight)(Platforms like these force us to reassess our understanding of how violence may be inspired by such hateful echo chambers. Even more broadly, as we have recently reported, mainstream platforms can sometimes push such individuals from an open community, such as Twitter, into fringe environments like Gab that foster acceptability of dangerous views.), regardless of the legality.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: These actors already understand that their actions are not supported by the public, hence the need for their isolated echo chambers.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Since hate speech is intrinsically harmful, just like a physical act of violence is harmful, just driving it underground is beneficial as it reduces the visibility of such views \([p. 247](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1923&context=wmlr)(The civil rights rejoinder to the argument that bigotry will go\nunderground is, "Good." Because the speech is intrinsically harm-\nful, stopping the speech is just as worthwhile as stopping a slap, or a rape, even though the aggressor may still want to hurt you.\nThis justification, however, only supports stopping the speech if\nand when it is like a slap or other physical harm, which points toward a tighter causation requirement than the more aggressive civil rights proposals anticipate. It points toward proscribing only fighting words, not the less immediate harm of group libel.)\).
1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Banning hate speech may make it more attractive and controversial, leading more people to engage in it publicly.
1.3.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: People often seek out and read [banned books](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/why-your-kid-should-read-banned-books) as they are often embraced by [counterculture](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/14/hungary-media-law-protest)(Forbidden books were circulating, people were listening to banned radio stations. If they banned something, they made it immediately interesting for the people.).
1.3.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: The [Streisand effect](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-18458567)(The story sums up the Streisand Effect, named after singer Barbra Streisand, which is an online phenomenon in which an attempt to hide or remove information - a photo, video, story etc - results in the greater spread of the information in question.\n\nPaul Armstrong, head of social for Mindshare , a global media network, says the Streisand Effect is a reminder to brands and celebrities about the effect groups, and individuals, can have on the internet in a very short space of time.) is when an attempt to suppress information has the opposite effect; people disseminate that information with vigor to as many other people as possible.
1.3.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Such an effect is unlikely to lead to a significant increase in hate speech, as most people who engage in it do so because they sincerely hold those hateful beliefs.
1.3.3.2.2.1.3.1. Con: In online communities, many engage in hate speech just to appear ['edgy' or to make jokes](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990274685/how-extremists-weaponize-irony-to-spread-hate)(Fuentes is best known for using cartoonish memes to spread white supremacist propaganda. His followers refer to themselves as "Groypers" — a reference to a mutated version of the Pepe the Frog cartoon that was co-opted by the far right. Though Fuentes exists on the fringes of the extreme right, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., spoke at a political conference that Fuentes hosted, drawing widespread criticism.\n\nBut Fuentes has said himself that he uses irony and "jokes" to communicate his message without consequences.\n\n"Irony is so important for giving a lot of cover and plausible deniability for our views," Fuentes said in a 2020 video. He specifically cited Holocaust denial — or what he termed Holocaust "revision" — as a topic that is too fraught to discuss earnestly, even on the far right.). These forms of 'ironic hate speech' could increase where stronger laws exist.
1.3.3.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: If people understand why the speech itself is offensive, they are unlikely to engage in it, regardless of its legal status.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: If harmful speech is harder to find, it would reduce the ability to persuade others.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: People often get around hate speech laws by using [dog whistles](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1889639), innocuous language and terms that express the same hateful messages.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Dog whistles are preferable to hate speech because they are a more subtle, indirect form of hate. Thus, they do not subject individuals to the psychological harms of hate speech.
1.3.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Dog whistles may actually make hateful ideas more palatable, allowing people to support discrimination without saying offensive statements \([pp. 1-2](http://precaution.org/lib/boyd_nixons_southern_strategy.19700517a.pdf)\).
1.3.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Fewer people will understand dog whistles and offensive 'inside jokes,' reducing their ability to spread hateful views.
1.3.3.2.3.2. Pro: Normalized dog whistles can spread harmful ideas about other groups implicitly, since they are often [hard to spot](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/11/7/13549154/dog-whistles-campaign-racism)(While many people might hear "international banks" quite literally, or maybe as an allusion to Clinton’s ties to foreign financial interests in general, anti-Semites hear something very different. After all, the supposed existence of a cabal of international Jewish bankers working to undermine US democracy is a recurring theme in American anti-Semitism, from Henry Ford’s The International Jew to Reddit troll-conventions. Trump’s choice of language serves as a signal that he is one of them.).
1.3.3.2.3.3. Pro: Those spreading dog whistles often claim that the symbols they are spreading are mundane and not hateful, making them harder to criticize \([p. 14](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathilda-Akerlund-2/publication/349545872_Dog_whistling_far-right_code_words_the_case_of_%27culture_enricher%27_on_the_Swedish_web/links/6038be7b92851c4ed599b4b4/Dog-whistling-far-right-code-words-the-case-of-culture-enricher-on-the-Swedish-web.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(Phillips \(2019, pp. 2–3\) argues that hate can be laundered into the mainstream through seemingly innocent humour: ‘by exploiting the fact that so many \(white\) people have been trained not to take the things that happen on the internet very seriously’. Despite the perception of the internet as harmless, previous research illustrates the potential stepwise progression of far-right radicalisation, starting in a normalisation of humorous, but nonetheless hateful content, and gradually moving towards exceedingly radical ideas and settings \(Munn, 2019\))\).
1.3.3.2.4. Con: People may always try to circumvent laws, but that does not eliminate the need for said laws.
1.3.4. Con: The violent actions associated with hate speech are illegal, not the speech itself; therefore, anything that is not directly harmful should be permitted.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Speech can be hateful, but legally speaking if it is not accompanied by a threat legally presenting a "[clear and present danger](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/clear_and_present_danger)," then it is not calling for violence.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Promoting attacks against certain groups is incitement to violence, not hate speech. These cases do not depend on having hate speech legislation.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Laws against incitement and hate speech can and do [coexist](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/1/e/116608.pdf)(Therefore, hate speech lacks the first essential element of hate crime, i.e. the criminal base offence \(if the bias motive or contents were removed, there would be no criminal offence\). Direct and immediate incitement to criminal offences is universally prohibited. Where such incitement occurs with a bias motive, it should be categorized as hate crime because there is a criminal base offence .) with one another.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Under the [imminent lawless action](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/970/incitement-to-imminent-lawless-action)(Many Supreme Court cases upholding restrictions on speech believed to be subversive have relied on the idea that such speech is forbidden because it incites, or is likely to lead to, violence or illegal actions.) test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: Hate speech directly leads to violence. Nearly one-third of hate crimes in the United States are driven by [hateful attitudes and preconceptions,](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/02/us/who-commits-hate-crimes/index.html)(These eye-for-an-eye attacks spike after acts of terrorism, a bitter backlash that often targets Muslim Americans. After the 9/11 attacks, for example, hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose by 1,600%. A similar spike occurred after the Paris attacks in 2015.) often fueled by hate speech.
1.3.4.2.4. Pro: Most countries already have [laws against the incitement of violence](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/inchoate-offences) which effectively punish and deter such acts.
1.3.4.2.5. Pro: The [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx) \(ICCPR\), signed by 172 countries, already prohibits incitement.
1.3.4.3. Con: Hate speech directly harms communities and society in general through hateful rhetoric.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: People who experience hate speech can experience emotional traumas, which could lead to depression or suicidal thoughts and feelings \([p. 2](https://www.connectsafely.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hate-Speech-8.5x11.pdf)(Hate speech can harm individuals, communities and societies. Research focused on the impact of racial, ethnic, religious, gendered, and LGBTQ hate speech finds that the targets of hate speech can experience negative emotional, mental, and physical consequences.\nThese can include low self-worth, anxiety, fear for their lives, and even self-harm or suicide.)\).
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Hate speech harms relationships in communities by making it more difficult to communicate and empathize with others \([p. 2](https://www.connectsafely.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hate-Speech-8.5x11.pdf)(Hate speech harms our relationships with each other. It interferes with our ability to communicate with others and to empathize. Because it often relies on stereotypes and scapegoating, it negatively impacts our ability to address the root causes of social problems. Therefore hate speech can also harm communities, even when it targets individuals.)\).
1.3.4.3.3. Con: Hate speech is far from being a major societal harm, especially compared to [crime and poverty](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/urban-strangler-how-crime-causes-poverty-inner-city).
1.3.5. Pro: There is a link between hate speech and racially-motivated violence. Restricting speech that is likely to cause this violence could save lives \([p. 1](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=752123112086066113098070014091068023006042023048070022113019027098094064101122086089054030034103008038096119029087101117087097126071075054031100121068006023024026090085079018085002006000104065087120108094029027077112123069004029026101103112010007111065&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)(This paper investigates the link between social media and hate crime. We show that anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook predicts crimes against refugees in otherwise similar municipalities with higher social media usage. To establish causality, we exploit exogenous variation in the timing of major Facebook and internet outages. Consistent with a role for "echo chambers", we find that right-wing social media posts contain narrower and more loaded content than news reports. Our results suggest that social media can act as a propagation mechanism for violent crimes by enabling the spread of extreme viewpoints.)\).
1.3.5.1. Pro: Prominent hate speech can radicalize individuals and make them more likely to engage in violence in the future.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: All speech attempts to communicate ideas to others. The simple expression of a given idea does not mean it would inevitably be instilled into the beliefs of the listener.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Hitler’s grandiose speeches popularized his ideas [among the general public](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/hitler-speech-1919.html)(On Oct. 16, 1919, Adolf Hitler became a propagandist. It would be his chief occupation for the rest of his life. Without propaganda, he could never have become a public figure, let alone risen to power. It was as a propagandist that he made a second world war possible, and defined Jews as Germany’s foe. The form of his propaganda was inextricable from its content: the fictionalization of a globalized world into simple slogans, to be repeated until an enemy thus defined was exterminated.), giving him more power over time.
1.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: Each individual is free to listen to the speech of others and integrate any or all aspects of the discourse into their life.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Online hate speech is especially likely to translate into real-world harms.
1.3.5.1.2.1. Con: Online hate speech is largely [trolling](https://www.psychosocial.com/article/PR200156/9347/), meaning most comments are made in jest and those who post such comments are mostly kidding.
1.3.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of the original intent, trolling can still [intimidate and hurt](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356036793_HATE_SPEECH_AND_CULTURE_OF_TROLLING_ON_SOCIAL_MEDIA_Hate_Speech_and_Culture_of_Trolling_on_Social_Media) its recipients.
1.3.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: Trolling is a normal part of internet culture.
1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Trolling is a way to [dismiss hate speech](https://www.vox.com/2016/11/23/13659634/alt-right-trolling) as a part of normal behavior.
1.3.5.1.2.1.2.2. Con: There are many "normal" behaviors on the internet which would be [wholly unacceptable](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/psychological-reason-mean-on-internet.htm)(By continually presenting only our "best selves" online and reaping the emotional benefits of lots of "likes" on Facebook for instance, psychologists say our self-esteem may bloom disproportionately -- and negatively impact self-control. The result? You'll feel entitled to be an online meanie. Experts also posit that people sometimes actually forget that they're speaking out loud when they post a snarky comment -- writing something from a smartphone almost seems like you're talking only to yourself) in public.
1.3.5.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Trolling refers to a [whole subset](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/trolls-internet-cartoons-hate-her-reddit)(According to her, “good” trolling is a kind of satirical storytelling. Rather than imps who aim to harass and sow discord, today’s “good” trolls are more like very online Jonathan Swifts, weaving fishy tales in order to illuminate the stranger aspects of human nature.) of internet humor. It is incredibly widespread and is often harmless.
1.3.5.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: While fine in some cases, trolling has been [hijacked](https://theconversation.com/online-trolling-used-to-be-funny-but-now-the-term-refers-to-something-far-more-sinister-110272)(As a term, internet trolling has significantly deviated from its early, 2002 definition and become a catch-all for all antisocial online behaviours. The lack of a uniform definition of internet trolling leaves all research on trolling open to validity concerns, which could leave the behaviour remaining largely unchecked.) by especially hateful groups and is used to spread offensive ideas.
1.3.5.1.2.1.3. Con: Trolling can often [create cultures of hate speech](https://www.digitaldemocracy.nz/hate-speech-and-trolling)(The rise of hate speech and trolling is linked to polarising effects of filter bubbles and echo chambers. A troll is an anonymous user who deliberately provokes antagonistic reactions for sheer enjoyment. Trolling is aided both by the ease of creating anonymous online profiles and by the atomised nature of internet interaction. Trolling can pose a direct threat to opportunities when it becomes systematically targeted towards minority groups in order to deliberately cause emotional distress. Remaining anonymous makes individuals more likely to escape prosecution for the more egregious examples), where 'joking around' leads to violence, echo chambers, and the spread of harmful ideas.
1.3.5.1.2.1.4. Pro: Restricting hate speech would likely be unable to meaningfully reduce trolling.
1.3.5.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: South Korea attempted to force people to register their real name when posting on certain websites to reduce trolling; the plan was a [failure](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/12/30/2011123001526.html). Trolling only decreased 0.9% and the requirement was scrapped.
1.3.5.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Experts agree that the [anti-trolling laws](https://theconversation.com/the-governments-planned-anti-troll-laws-wont-help-most-victims-of-online-trolling-172743) instituted by Australia in 2021 are unlikely to help victims of trolling or discourage trolls from making disparaging remarks online.
1.3.5.1.2.1.4.3. Con: Other factors, such as YouTube removing the dislike button, are likely to have more of an impact on [reducing trolling](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-59264070)("It will discourage a lot of trolling and a lot of mean-spirited people on the internet that want to try to put down other people's creative work," says rapper Kenzo Jae.) than restricting valid forms of speech.
1.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: Online anonymity emboldens hate speech.
1.3.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: The lack of consequences for anonymous hate speech [facilitates uncivil discourse online](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/)(Anonymity, a key affordance of the early internet, is an element that many in this canvassing attributed to enabling bad behavior and facilitating “uncivil discourse” in shared online spaces. The purging of user anonymity is seen as possibly leading to a more inclusive online environment and also setting the stage for governments and dominant institutions to even more freely employ surveillance tools to monitor citizens, suppress free speech and shape social debate.).
1.3.5.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Since other users do not know who is spreading hate speech, they are unable to confront them or punish them.
1.3.5.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Most online platforms have [terms of use](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy)(You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.) that restrict especially harmful actions. Users who break these still face accountability.
1.3.5.1.2.2.2. Pro: The anonymous nature of online interactions make it easier for individuals to [dehumanize](https://www.rehumanizeintl.org/amp/2016-04-12-arguing-on-the-internet-how-anonymity-dehumanizes-our-opponents)(This problem of dehumanization in our arguments is multiplied by the distance with which we might regard our online adversaries. In person, I would never think of using biting sarcasm with someone who is working through an argument with me. But online, my weariness of a culture that condones violence comes out in a sarcastic comment towards someone whom I've never met. Many times on Twitter, I find myself working tirelessly to help some anonymous screen-name see the truth of science or basic common-sense ethics, and I'll feel the conversation get dragged down \(sometimes little by little, sometimes all at once\) into epithets, sarcasm, and a total inability to see the humanity of the other side. When we lose sight of the humanity of the other—when we forget empathy and we leave sonder behind—we make our opposition into a bogeyman, someone who we cannot hope to reach and convert, but can only hope to pummel into submission.) and, consequently, abuse others.
1.3.5.1.2.2.3. Con: Given that hate speech online is often anonymous, it will be practically impossible to regulate expressing opinions online.
1.3.5.1.2.2.4. Con: Anonymity makes threats less compelling and believable and hence less worthy of regulation than face-to-face speech.
1.3.5.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Social media may provide individuals a better space to vent and avoid using harmful speech in real life, where it may have consequences.
1.3.5.1.2.2.4.2. Con: A British politician was [threatened online](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-arrested-threat-kill-mp-21887742) one week before he was stabbed to death.
1.3.5.1.2.2.4.3. Con: Some countries have argued that online violence is just as [destructive and problematic](https://phys.org/news/2019-11-online-violence-destructive-offline.html)(Had these acts taken place offline—which included breaches of privacy, reputational attacks, incitements to violence, coordinated bullying and vilification campaigns, economic vandalism, workplace harassment and institutional inaction—they would not be tolerated.\n\nDr. Jane says in addition to social norms rebuking such acts, police, courts, and various types of regulation exist—at least in principle—to protect victims and apprehend perpetrators. She says similar measures should be adopted in online environments.) as offline violence and have taken steps to prosecute abuse and threats online just like offline offenses.
1.3.5.1.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: The UK has instituted regulations to [protect against](https://www.theweek.co.uk/87916/hate-crimes-on-social-media-to-be-treated-as-seriously-as-offline-offences) online "abuse based on race, religion and physical disability - as well as homophobic, transphobic and biphobic hate crimes."
1.3.5.1.2.3. Pro: Targeting specific groups with hate speech on social media has become pervasive.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: The white supremacist movement has used the internet as a platform to commit hate speech and [radicalize](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/online-hate-violence-bigotry-racism-solutions)(In 2018, for instance, a shooter killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Penn. He had been active on the website Gab. It fed the man’s “steady, online consumption of racist propaganda,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 2017, a University of Maryland college student stabbed a visiting Black student at a bus stop. The killer was part of a Facebook group that stoked hate against women, Jewish people and African Americans. And in 2016, a gunman killed nine Black people at a church in Charleston, S.C. Federal authorities said online sources fueled his passion “to fight for white people and achieve white supremacy.”) people.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Many white supremacists, radicalized through social media, have committed [violence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/) against members of vulnerable minority groups.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The violent "Unite the Right" demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia was [organized on social media](https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-social-media-helped-organize-and-radicalize-americas-newest-white-supremacists).
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Many platforms have begun to [ban or deplatform](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/05/710313380/facebooks-ban-on-white-extremism-comes-amid-international-pressure) white supremacists.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Some websites refuse to [moderate](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/tech/parler-trump-supporters/index.html) their content, making it easy for extremist groups to use them to radicalize others.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Twitter and Facebook [banned Donald Trump for inciting violence](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/09/1015977/who-decides-free-speech-online/) during the white supremacist riots in Washington DC on January 6, 2021.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.3. Con: White supremacists were able to successfully organize before the internet.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: The internet has sped up and increased the reach of white supremacist organizations, for example, by making it much easier for people to find and attend white supremacist rallies and demonstrations.
1.3.5.1.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: Populist and far-right parties saw increasing support during [the 1990s](https://www.jstor.org/stable/422288), before voters had widespread internet access.
1.3.5.1.2.3.2. Con: The internet itself is pervasive and has been [ingrained](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-impact-of-the-internet-on-society-a-global-perspective/)(Counting on the family and village uses of mobile phones, and taking into consideration the limited use of these devices among children under five years of age, we can say that humankind is now almost entirely connected, albeit with great levels of inequality in the bandwidth as well as in the efficiency and price of the service.) into every aspect of society; hate speech online is no different.
1.3.5.1.2.3.3. Pro: Nearly [three-quarters](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1087412) of online hate speech is directed at minorities.
1.3.5.1.2.3.4. Pro: Between August 2015 and July 2016, the Anti-Defamation League \(ADL\) reported 2.6 million tweets containing anti-Semitic language targeting journalists \([p. 2](https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/press-center/CR_4862_Journalism-Task-Force_v2.pdf)\).
1.3.5.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Such threats can scare journalists from reporting on important issues, constituting a greater threat to free speech.
1.3.5.1.2.3.4.2. Con: The ADL lacks credibility and has a [history of attacking](http://bostonreview.net/politics/emmaia-gelman-anti-defamation-league-not-what-it-seems) Arabs, Black people, and the LGBTQ+ community.
1.3.5.1.2.4. Con: [Cyberstalking is already illegal.](https://legaldictionary.net/cyberstalking/) Other forms of online communication, like comments or messages, can easily be ignored or blocked.
1.3.5.1.2.4.1. Con: If a sufficiently large group of individuals were to attack someone online, it would be prohibitively difficult to ignore or block everyone.
1.3.5.1.2.4.2. Pro: Some social media websites, like Instagram, have [built-in tools](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/instagrams-new-tools-to-prevent-abusive-content-in-direct-messages/article34395407.ece)(Instagram’s new tool will automatically filter DM requests containing offensive words, phrases, and emojis, preventing recipients from seeing the messages in the first place. Users will have a choice to switch on the filter under ‘Hidden Words’ in Privacy Settings, the company said in a statement.) to combat harassment, bullying, and unwelcome comments in general.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: Hate speech indoctrinates the vulnerable into adopting extremist views. The communities propagating these views encourage new members to commit acts of violence.
1.3.5.1.3.1. Pro: There is a proven link between the dissemination of hate speech online and an increase in violence offline, especially among neo-fascist groups \([p. 2](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2018-0428_EN.pdf)(whereas the dissemination of hate speech online often leads to a rise in violence, including by neo-fascist groups)\).
1.3.5.1.3.2. Con: Indoctrination does not require hate speech and would still happen if there were restrictions on hate speech.
1.3.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: Extremist indoctrination often requires members of violent groups [making contact](https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/publication_series/notes_internacionals/n1_163/what_does_radicalisation_look_like_four_visualisations_of_socialisation_into_violent_extremism)(Self-radicalisation is rare. Even autonomous self-starters who radicalise on the internet need social interaction with a long-distance recruiter. Evidence points to the importance of neighbours, cliques of friends, and relatives in explaining indoctrination. The progressive intensification of radical beliefs is still bound by territory and is very context dependent. Furthermore, radicalisation with like-minded people rarely occurs in the virtual space and more often takes place in cities and neighbourhoods which act as fertile grounds in which to harden ideological positions.) and becoming friends with targets. Hate speech is not required for this.
1.3.5.1.3.2.2. Con: There is evidence that suggests that engaging in hate speech or offensive discussions can [act as a useful gateway](https://www1.undp.org/content/oslo-governance-centre/en/home/library/misogyny--the-extremist-gateway-.html)(Misogyny often lies at the heart of violent extremism and is central to indoctrination, recruitment, and ideology – yet it frequently escapes scrutiny.) for radicalizing others.
1.3.5.2. Con: [Many instances](https://www.thefire.org/category/cases/free-speech/) of supposed hate speech pose no discernible physical threat to others.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Often, acts that are classified as hate speech involve the accuser assuming more [ignorance or hatred](https://www.heritage.org/civil-society/commentary/the-origins-hate-speech)(Hate speech theory does not do that. It assumes bad faith on the part of people regardless of their stated intentions, essentially calling them liars if they defend themselves against the current orthodoxy.) on behalf of the speaker than is the case.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: Even if one is not seeking to incentivize violence, engaging in hate speech can make other people feel that their actions are justified, thereby empowering them to commit heinous acts \([p. 8](https://rm.coe.int/factsheet-on-hate-speech-july2018-docx/16808c168d)(The European Court of Human Rights noted that the impugned letters amounted to an appeal to bloody\nrevenge and that one of them had identified persons by name, stirred up hatred for them and exposed\nthem to the possible risk of physical violence. Although the applicant had not personally associated himself with the views contained in the letters, he had nevertheless provided their writers with an outlet\nfor stirring up violence and hatred. The Court considered that, as the owner of the review, he had been\nvicariously subject to the duties and responsibilities which the review’s editorial and journalistic staff\nundertook in the collection and dissemination of information to the public, and which assumed even\ngreater importance in situations of conflict and tension.)\).
1.3.5.2.3. Con: Even 'harmless' hate speech can still boost and give credence to other voices engaging in explicit hate speech by making their ideas appear reasonable.
1.3.5.2.4. Pro: Most hate speech is confined to niche online communities filled with individuals who have no intent on acting upon the beliefs they interact with.
1.3.5.2.4.1. Con: Such subcultures, which frequently denigrate others, often can act as the breeding ground for violent action.
1.3.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: For example, [incel](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-44053828)(A hero within inceldom - possibly a somewhat ironic one - is Elliot Rodger. In 2014, he killed six people and turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a rambling manifesto filled with racist and misogynistic slurs, Rodger complained that women did not want to have sex with him.\n\nAlthough the manifesto did not specifically mention incels, his actions are discussed constantly in incel forums. Sometimes the comments look like dark humour but at other times they appear more serious.) online communities often engage in vile speech regarding women and minorities. This rhetoric has inspired several members of the community to commit major [acts of violence](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/103496623/incels-are-a-danger-to-everyone-including-themselves).
1.3.5.2.4.1.2. Con: Such communities are often exceptions. Most communities where hate speech occurs are political in nature and are geared towards increasing support for specific policies supported by [party leaders](https://truthout.org/articles/how-the-right-wing-koch-and-devos-families-are-funding-hate-speech-on-college-campuses-across-the-u-s/)(So why is someone with such fringe ideas invited to speak on college campuses, and who pays for it? It’s unlikely that many university departments would invite such an obviously racist and discredited figure. While co-presenting the Murray talk, the political science department did not invite Murray, nor did it contribute any funding for the event. The Middlebury student chapter of a far-right libertarian think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, asked him to speak, and AEI picked up the tab.).
1.3.5.2.4.2. Pro: What is often labeled as hate speech is actually meant to be a form of dark humor to openly mock and troll [mainstream political figures](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/ok-sign-gesture-emoji-rightwing-alt-right)(But the transformation of mundane symbols into something to be feared is part of a broader aim to garner media attention, and getting one up on the people they think they’re fooling.\n\n“Reporters don’t always understand that \[trolls\] seek media attention – when they see something get media uptake, they capitalise on it,” says Dr Joan Donovan, a media manipulation expert who is the director of Harvard’s Technology and Social Change \(TaSC\) Research Project.).
1.3.5.3. Con: It is not necessarily hate speech that causes more violence. Rather, it is often fear towards others that leads to violence. Such fear is propagated by more than just hate speech.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: Crime reporting in the US, for example, often [emphasizes and villanizes people of color](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/crime-reporting-racial-bias)(Research shows the media disproportionately depict African-Americans as criminals, and whites as victims.), making white audiences more afraid of them and willing to support policies that further discriminate against them.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: Hate speech often portrays its victims as [physically or mentally different and therefore dangerous](https://theprint.in/india/hate-speech-now-fear-speech-study-finds-new-way-indians-on-whatsapp-target-minorities/608347/)(Presenting an example of a message classified as fear speech, it says the post portrays “the Muslim community as a threat, thus creating a sense of fear in the minds of the reader”.) and unpredictable. This significantly exacerbates fear.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Research has found that, when people see fewer examples of hate speech, hate crimes drop accordingly in turn. As such, restrictions on hate speech can prevent violence.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: The results of a 2018 review claimed that "in the absence of anti-refugee posts on the [AfD](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37274201)(The nationalist Alternative for Germany \(AfD\) has grown rapidly since it was formed in 2013 and is now the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag \(national parliament\), with 89 seats.\n\nFounded in 2013 as an anti-euro party, it has shifted its focus to immigration and Islam and is increasingly seen as far-right in tone.) Facebook page, 316 \(9%\) fewer anti-refugee incidents would have taken place" \([pp. 4-5](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/crschwarz/fanning-flames-hate.pdf)\).
1.3.5.4.2. Pro: A study found that poor internet connections and power outages in a given region [weakened the connection](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/01/12/in-germany-online-hate-speech-has-real-world-consequences)(The authors even came across one pattern that could be described as a smoking gun: at times when residents in a given area reported poor internet connections, the correlation between social-media and anti-refugee violence in that region weakened. Messrs Muller and Schwarz conclude with a back-of-the-envelope estimate that in 2015 and 2016, the AfD’s Facebook posts increased the number of anti-refugee attacks in Germany by 13%—an additional 437 incidents.) between social media and anti-refugee violence.
1.3.5.4.3. Con: Most of this research has occurred in highly partisan and divided societies, where hatred between political groups is rampant. It is more likely that that [division](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/hate-crime-global-politics-polarization)(The analyses in the book serve to highlight two broad conclusions: that in times of social distress and economic uncertainty, tensions between groups become acute and find expression in hate crimes; and that the burden of guilt for these acts cannot be attributed to or blamed on entire groups of people. While individuals must ultimately bear the responsibility for their own behavior and criminal acts, the context and social climate in which these occur is quite relevant to their understanding.) is what causes hate crimes.
1.3.5.4.4. Pro: The rhetoric and election of Donald Trump - who has been [documented](https://www.vox.com/21506029/trump-violence-tweets-racist-hate-speech) on numerous occasions engaging in hate speech - is linked with a [sharp uptick](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38149406) in hate crimes.
1.4. Con: Persistent hate speech can dehumanize and marginalize certain groups of people across societies.
1.4.1. Con: Banning hate speech would not address some of the underlying causes of hatred and discrimination. Attention to those causes would be more successful at preventing the proliferation of hate speech.
1.4.1.1. Con: The removal of hate speech from public discourse has a downstream effect on culture, making the propagation of racist ideas more difficult and taboo.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Populist politicians often benefit from [symbolically breaking taboos](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/30/europe-populist-lie-shamelessly-salvini-johnson)(In a culture where directness \(or bluntness\) and trust are highly valued, such as the Netherlands, breaking taboos around multiculturalism and political correctness is a perversely effective way to claim authenticity. Geert Wilders, with his talk of taxing hijabs and vitriolic statements about Islam, was a master of the outlandish statement twinned with a claim to authentic Dutchness.). Simply relying on social taboos may therefore provide an opportunity for hate speech to reemerge.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: When a society has overwhelmingly decided to condemn certain ideas or uses of language, those holding such hateful views are more likely to stop themselves from repeating such language in public.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Those who use taboo speech risk facing social and even [financial consequences](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/14/georgia-teacher-n-word-classroom)(Last week, Newton school officials said in a statement they had “received notification of a video circulating online that allegedly involved an Alcovy high school teacher making inappropriate statements in class.\n\n“The teacher, Ms Alexandrea Boyington, is currently on administrative leave pending the outcome of our investigation.”), making it costly to continue such behavior.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Other issues, especially economic inequality, are often the [underlying cause](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/) of people's hatred and divisiveness. Banning hate speech would not change this.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Homophobic attitudes consistently tend to be [more prevalent](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2014/02/global-map-homophobia/8309/) amongst those who are worse off, and are more prevalent in countries with more inequality and less wealth.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: Economic inequality can be addressed while restrictions on offensive speech exist. The two are not mutually exclusive.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: Even under ideal economic conditions, hate speech will continue to exist; the issue is [significantly more entrenched](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/)(To try to answer this question, we collected data on key socioeconomic factors1 for each state, including indicators for education \(percent of adults 25 and older with at least a high school degree, as of 2009\), diversity \(percent nonwhite population and percent noncitizen population, 2015\), geographic heterogeneity \(percent population in metropolitan areas, 2015\), economic health \(median household income, 2016 seasonally adjusted unemployment, September 2016, percent poverty among white people. 2015, and income inequality as measured by the Gini index, 2015\), and what percent of the population voted for Donald Trump. \(You can find the data on GitHub here.\)) and complicated than simple economic inequality.
1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: Attempts to restrict speech may actually hamper redistributive policies if voters lose trust in their governments and vote for more extreme alternatives or refuse to opt into redistributive schemes.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Without access to therapy and reconciliation services, the underlying causes of hate speech will continue unfettered.
1.4.1.2.4. Pro: Hatred can influence economic policy, further exacerbating inequality.
1.4.1.2.4.1. Pro: Racial hatred is a powerful [factor that influences public spending](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/7/17426968/white-racism-welfare-cuts-snap-food-stamps)(Wetts and Willer are hardly the first scholars to argue that racial animus is a powerful factor motivating opposition to social spending and redistribution in the US. Jill Quadagno’s The Color of Welfare in 1994 and Martin Gilens’s Why Americans Hate Welfare in 1999 credited racial factors — in particular, stereotypes of black people as lazy and overly dependent on government aid — with substantially reducing support for welfare spending since the war on poverty began in the 1960s.) on welfare and food stamps.
1.4.1.2.4.2. Con: As the local Latino population grows in a given area, white views on [welfare become more positive](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/422587)(It shows that whites' stereotypes about Latino work ethic grow more positive as the size of the Latino population increases, suggesting positive effects of contact. Moreover, the effect of whites’ stereotypes about Latino—but not black—work ethic on support for welfare is contingent on ethnic context. In areas with few Latinos, the lazier whites think Latinos are, the less whites want to spend on welfare.) because whites tend to view Latinos as hard working.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Hate speech reveals the biases of the speaker, providing critical information to potential employers, voters, etc.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Employees have been fired over [racist posts](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-10-11-employee-fired-for-racist-facebook-rant-loses-court-bid/) on social media.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: If the bias of the speaker aligns with one's own personal bias, they are [unlikely to notice](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/03/why-we-dont-recognise-our-own-biases/) that any bias exists.
1.4.2. Con: Protecting hate speech would make it easier for that speech to be effectively refuted.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If the majority of people ignore hateful views they will fade away, diminishing any need to prohibit hate speech.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Adults are able to selectively [process and ignore](https://nickwignall.com/emotionally-mature/)(Emotionally immature people tend to see thinking patterns like worry and rumination as things that happen to them over which they have little to no control. This is understandable because they often didn’t have adults in their lives at a young age who modeled this for them and taught them how to be aware of and take control of their thinking.\n\nOn the other hand, people with higher levels of emotional maturity have developed the mindset that believes while thoughts can initially be quite automatic and outside our control, it’s always possible to become more aware of them and modify them. They’ve learned to control their attention and their thinking styles in a way that’s flexible, realistic, and useful.) certain aspects of speech or comments. They can do this to hate speech as well.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Comments made in public places with loved ones present can be [very difficult](https://www.fastcompany.com/90425093/why-your-brains-so-bad-at-letting-go-of-negative-comments) to simply ignore due to [negativity bias](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_overcome_your_brains_fixation_on_bad_things).
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Arguing and a willingness to talk back to someone can build life skills and be considered a [positive attribute](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/03/144495483/why-a-teen-who-talks-back-may-have-a-bright-future).
1.4.2.1.2. Con: If hate speech were prohibited, the expression of hateful opinions would seem even more hateful than before. Restrictions may, therefore, make the speech even more jarring and hurtful.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: This would give hateful voices even more power over the groups of people they hate, as their speech would appear to be even more shocking.
1.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: When people are not accustomed to [certain behaviors or sights](https://www.bustle.com/articles/184142-i-dyed-my-hair-blue-suddenly-everyone-started-treating-me-differently), their reaction could be exaggerated and unexpected.
1.4.2.1.2.3. Con: With hate speech restrictions, victims would be able to pursue legal recourse against people who use such speech. This could potentially lessen the impact and hurtfulness of having to endure hate speech.
1.4.2.2. Pro: If people are allowed to express their hatred, their views can then be addressed and challenged.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Some underlying issues in society that might otherwise remain hidden can be discovered through hate speech.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Hateful people will push their agenda regardless of legality. Keeping this speech out in the open makes it easier to monitor what they say and react accordingly.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Various forms of fact-checking have been shown to effectively [challenge hateful stereotypes and misinformation](https://www.dw.com/en/is-fact-checking-effective-a-critical-review-of-what-works-and-what-doesnt/a-55248257)(Publishing fact-checked information has been shown generally to have a positive effect in terms of correcting inaccurate information. However, that effect is smaller in polarized contexts \(such as during election campaigns\) and among certain audiences \(partisans with deeply held beliefs\).\n\nWhether or not verification directly changes people’s minds though, fact-checkers work to hold elites accountable, teach audiences to handle dubious information appropriately, and promote good journalistic practice. At the same time, fact-checkers are actively developing strategies to improve the effectiveness of their work.).
1.4.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Most people hold hateful views, not because they have rationally deduced them, but out of emotion and fear. Therefore, public rebuttals to their views are [unlikely to change their minds](https://fullfact.org/blog/2019/jun/how-fact-checking-works/)(The idea that fact checking can work by correcting the public’s inaccurate beliefs on a mass scale alone doesn’t stack up. Nobody should be surprised when, despite fact checkers publishing lots of fact checks, people still believe inaccurate things and politicians still spin and distort. Fact checking can work but not if this is all we do.\n\n\[...\]\n\nAnd it doesn’t work like that because of how our brains work. Imagine walking late into a party where people have been arguing about politics, announcing that you have a PhD in what they’re talking about, and correcting everyone there. Would you expect them to be grateful?\n\nThe most effective campaigns of persuasion engage people’s emotions and not just their heads. Organisations that take sides are better placed to run campaigns of persuasion than fact checkers.).
1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: There are significantly better methods of unearthing underlying issues and problems through scientific principles and research; allowing hate speech is unnecessary.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: People can express their opinions in a respectful manner, or avoid speaking altogether.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is possible to be respectful of others and [validate](https://www.vetset2go.edu.au/modules/vetset2go/content/empathy-respect.pdf)(Communicating genuine empathy allows the other person to feel respected, accepted and understood. Empathy is key to establishing both trust and respect, which can be defined as showing due regard for the feelings, needs, or rights of others. Respectful communication validates the basic dignity and worth of others, without necessarily endorsing their views or beliefs.) their worth as a human being without agreeing with or accepting their opinion.
1.4.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: People often cannot express themselves in a measured way, especially when they are emotionally triggered, which is when their expression is often the most raw and authentic.
1.4.2.2.1.2.2. Con: There is an [emotional toll](https://culanth.org/fieldsights/when-fieldwork-breaks-your-heart) on field researchers, particularly when they focus on difficult topics such as hatred and anger.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: Societies frequently experience [ideological swings](https://theconversation.com/after-trump-and-brexit-the-coming-of-the-progressive-wave-133200)(Cycle of populism repeats throughout history\n\nIn my 2019 book, The Great Disruption: Understanding the Populist Forces Behind Trump, Brexit, and LePen, I point out that populism has occurred throughout history, from Julius Caesar and Napoleon to Andrew Jackson, Juan Perón and Adolf Hitler.) meaning hateful ideas can always re-emerge.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.1.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Fascist ideas have [reemerged to a significant extent](https://www.dw.com/en/us-neo-nazi-groups-on-the-rise-under-president-donald-trump-report/a-42688331)(There were more than 600 white supremacist groups in the US, according to the report. Neo-Nazi groups rose to 121 compared to 99 last year, marking a 22 percent increase.) in the US, despite their previously being marginalized.
1.4.2.2.2.3. Con: If society has already swung towards being increasingly accepting of harmful views, the banning of hate speech will do little insofar as people are already willing to vote for politicians who act upon those hateful ideas.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: Current methods of shielding people from hate speech online or in society are insufficient; a ban would be more encompassing.
1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: Many social media platforms activate temporary blockers for [sensitive and inappropriate content](https://yr.media/tech/instagram-draws-backlash-after-introducing-sensitive-content-control/).
1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: Fake news and misleading information are [quite convincingly able](https://whatsnewinpublishing.com/neuroscience-explains-how-fake-news-works-and-what-publishers-can-learn/)(Sensory neuroscience has shown that only unexpected information can filter through to higher stages of processing. The sensory cortex may have therefore evolved to adapt to, to predict, and to quiet down the expected regularities of our experiences, focusing on events that are unpredictable or surprising. Neural responses gradually reduce each time we are exposed to the same information, as the brain learns that this stimulus has no reward associated with it.) to trick people into consuming information without realizing it.
1.4.2.2.3.3. Pro: Lies tend to spread [faster and farther](https://instituteforpr.org/why-lies-spread-faster-than-the-truth-and-what-pr-professionals-can-do-about-it/) than the truth or their retractions. Prevalent hate speech may therefore influence and change peoples' minds.
1.4.2.2.3.3.1. Pro: Hateful disinformation about Muslim ethnic attacks on Buddhists in Sri Lanka led to [days of violence](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/commentary-tech-companies-inability-to-control-fake-news-exacerbates-violent-acts/)(\[E\]arlier this year, Sri Lanka again descended into violence as online rumors spurred deadly attacks by members of the Buddhist majority against Muslims... Over the course of three days in March, mobs burned mosques, Muslim homes, and Muslim-owned shops... In response, the government temporarily blocked social media, including Facebook and two other social media platforms Facebook owns, WhatsApp and Instagram.) in 2018 and contributed to worsening relations between the groups.
1.4.2.2.3.3.2. Pro: Hate speech [misinformation](https://www.vox.com/2021/1/16/22234971/trump-twitter-facebook-social-media-ban-election-misinformation-zignal)(In the wake of the deadly January 6 riot at the US Capitol that President Donald Trump heavily promoted on social media, platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and others finally moved to ban the president.\n\nThe result? A sudden drop in the online spread of election misinformation.\n\nAccording to research by Zignal Labs, which the Washington Post reported on Saturday, online misinformation about election fraud plunged 73 percent in the weeklong period following Twitter’s decision to ban Trump on January 8.) is often most successfully spread by large influential voices or media groups. Restrictions on hate speech can stop these influential actors.
1.4.2.2.3.3.3. Con: Those who spread hateful misinformation often use restrictions on their speech [as evidence](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/27/15695060/sam-harris-charles-murray-race-iq-forbidden-knowledge-podcast-bell-curve)(Harris’s conversation with Murray was titled, tantalizingly, “Forbidden Knowledge,” and in it, Harris sought to rehabilitate the conversation over race and IQ as well as open a larger debate about what can and cannot be said in today’s America. Here is Harris framing the discussion:\n\n"People don’t want to hear that a person's intelligence is in large measure due to his or her genes and there seems to be very little we can do environmentally to increase a person's intelligence even in childhood. It's not that the environment doesn't matter, but genes appear to be 50 to 80 percent of the story. People don't want to hear this. And they certainly don't want to hear that average IQ differs across races and ethnic groups. ") that what they are saying is true. Therefore, such laws may give their views more credence.
1.4.2.2.3.4. Con: England introduced the [Race Relations Act](https://freespeechdebate.com/discuss/why-hate-speech-should-not-be-banned/)(In 1965, Britain prohibited incitement to racial hatred as part of its Race Relations Act. The following decade was probably the most racist in British history. It was the decade of “Paki-bashing”, when racist thugs would seek out Asians to beat up. It was a decade of firebombings, stabbings, and murders. In the early 1980s, I was organising street patrols in East London to protect Asian families from racist attacks.\n\nNor were thugs the only problem. Racism was woven into the fabric of public institutions. The police, immigration officials – all were openly racist.) to eliminate hatred and racial violence against Asians in the 1960s, the decade to follow was the most violent in British domestic history.
1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Listening to provocative and disturbing speech allows one to reflect on and consider ideas they find objectionable.
1.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: People should be free to use [moral thought and reasoning](https://freespeechdebate.com/discuss/why-hate-speech-should-not-be-banned/)(In blurring the distinction between speech and action, what is really being blurred is the idea of human agency and of moral responsibility. Because lurking underneath the argument is the idea that people respond like automata to words or images. But people are not like robots. They think and reason and act on their thoughts and reasoning. Words certainly have an impact on the real world, but that impact is mediated through human agency.) to determine whether they find certain speech acceptable or not.
1.4.2.2.4.2. Con: Historically, bad ideas take root even when hate speech is allowed, especially when presented by a gifted speaker.
1.4.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.1.
1.4.2.2.4.2.2. Con: Oratory skill can also be used to promote positivity and hopefulness; [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://blog.oup.com/2012/01/martin-luther-king-jr-rhetoric-speaking/)(In short, it is rhetoric on a public stage. Dr. King, an impassioned orator, made use of a wealth of rhetorical techniques in order to communicate the messages of equality, justice, and peace during the divisive and violent civil rights era.) was excellent at employing positive messaging while speaking to the public.
1.4.2.2.4.3. Con: It is possible to monitor or examine rhetoric from an intellectual or academic perspective without publicly espousing it.
1.4.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Research is [conducted](https://www.research-live.com/article/news/shining-a-light-on-taboo-subjects--how-research-is-informing-and-effecting-change/id/5019902)(The ‘Report it to Stop It’ campaign by Transport for London to stop unwanted sexual contact on public transport followed extensive research among mainly female transport users, who told researchers from 2CV that such behaviour was commonplace, but was rarely reported to authorities.) on "taboo" subjects, like hate speech, giving experts and political decision-makers a greater understanding of which discriminatory views are influential, without those views needing to be widespread.
1.4.2.2.4.3.2. Con: Expressing and espousing ideas are radically different things; the mark of an intellectual being is the ability to entertain an idea without adopting it.
1.4.2.2.4.4. Con: People can be educated about the rhetoric of hate speech and its effects without permitting people to openly express hate speech without repercussions.
1.4.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: Historical myths that justify oppression should also be [challenged in the classroom](https://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/combating-racism-multicultural-classroom.shtml). This would make people less likely to believe hateful rhetoric.
1.4.2.2.4.4.2. Con: Education is often insufficient at stopping people from joining hateful movements. Well-educated people frequently [agree with hateful narratives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/18/racism-isnt-about-ignorance-some-smartest-minds-have-upheld-systemic-inequality/)(The highly educated designed America’s system of segregation and America’s prison system. Highly educated lawyers devise arguments to protect police who kill black and brown folks, highly educated prosecutors decline to bring charges, and highly educated judges assign light sentences. There is no good evidence that educating police about implicit bias works to lessen harm. And whites with high cognitive ability are no more likely to support practical policies that lessen racial inequality. But their education does allow them to offer more sophisticated justifications for privilege.) and engage in hateful actions.
1.4.2.3. Con: Banning something is the strongest stance that a government can take against an act. Therefore, this will demonstrate abhorrence towards hate speech, which may make more people less tolerant of it.
1.4.2.4. Con: By its nature, hate speech often cannot be meaningfully and convincingly refuted. As such, it should just be restricted.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Those who hold such extreme views are often the most [difficult to persuade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/how-is-arguing-with-trump-voters-working-out-for-you)(You and the person you’re arguing with don’t even share a common set of definitions, let alone discussion frameworks or worldviews. No movement can win in the 21st century without this understanding as a foundation.).
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: Hate speech is often couched in [misinformation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation)(I call this “manufactured” because it’s the consequence of a deliberate strategy. It was distilled almost perfectly by Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News and chief strategist for Donald Trump. “The Democrats don’t matter,” Bannon reportedly said in 2018. “The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.”). This makes refutation especially challenging as debunkers must wade through multiple hateful, incorrect statements.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: Hate speech is often predicated on irrational or [obviously false statements](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1874038)(First of all, it can be observed that the majority of content verified by fact-checkers has a mostly negative tone. This negativity bias is most pronounced in content flagged as untrue but occurs across all categories. The proportions further demonstrate that the higher the deviation from facticity, the higher the proportion of partisan attacks on Democrats. For partisan attacks on Republicans, however, the pattern is reversed: The more information deviates from facticity, the lower the proportion of partisan attacks on Republicans. Compared to the other forms of uncivil speech distinguished, attacks on the media are a relatively rare event, and are most likely to occur in false information. Hate speech – the attribution of negative qualities to out-groups – occurs relatively frequently in all distinguished categories of \(un\)truthfulness.) about the worth, intelligence, or existence of other peoples. These can be shown to be wrong.
1.4.2.4.4. Con: There are a [variety of ways](https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech)(One of the ways we can fight hate speech is by speaking up about equality, inclusivity, and diversity. Some refer to this method as counterspeech. The more we can undermine hate speech with loving words, logical arguments, and truth-telling, the more that hate speech will begin to lose its power.\n\nAnother method that can combat hate speech is education. When it comes to bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, and hate crimes, the more people are educated on these issues, the more we can prevent them in the future.) that people can fight against hate speech and convince others.
1.4.3. Pro: Hate speech can be used by politicians to instill hate in their supporters by finding an "enemy" in a minority group and justifying cruel policies \([p. 9](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/INGE/DV/2021/07-12/IDADisinformation_migrant_minorities_EN.pdf)(Disinformation poses a particular threat to minority groups that are vulnerable to victimisation and discrimination. These groups are already suffering from prejudices borne by the majority group; disinformation about them tends to aggravate the situation. As Chapter 3 will discuss, disinformation against minorities relies on longstanding stereotypes and well-entrenched biases. Moreover, as they are already marginalised, it is highly likely that they are not in a situation to defend themselves.\n\nSome of these marginalised minorities are also particularly vulnerable to disinformation as its ‘consumers’. For historical reasons, they often have strained relations with the state, characterised by an erosion of trust, which can make them more susceptible to conspiracy theories. They are also often deprived of necessary information, which opens up space for disinformation.)\).
1.4.3.1. Pro: Hungarian politicians have [weaponized hate speech](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-rights-idUSKCN1HC1AJ) to create restrictive immigration policies, unfairly and illegally targeting Muslim migrants.
1.4.3.2. Con: Neuroscientists claim that many politicians purposefully evoke [feelings of fear](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-neuroscientist-explains-how-politicians-and-the-media-use-fear-to-make-us-hate-without-thinking-2019-07-18)(If one undocumented illegal immigrant murders a U.S. citizen, some politicians use fear with the hope that few will ask: “This is terrible, but how many people were murdered in this country by U.S. citizens just today?” Or: “I know several murders happen every week in this town, but why am I so scared now that this one is being showcased by the media?”\n\nWe do not ask these questions, because fear bypasses logic.) to generate hateful responses among their constituent base, regardless of whether they use hate speech.
1.4.3.3. Con: Politicians often use [offensive innuendo](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/new-southern-strategy)(The so-called ‘solid South’ did not become solidly Republican overnight. Republican strategies began to stoke racial resentment and antipathy to civil rights. For example, Nixon campaign advisor Kevin Phillips and RNC Chairman Lee Atwater admitted appealing to white resentment to civil rights and even white racism. They did so not only by criticizing federal civil rights legislation and impugning federal desegregation orders, but by railing against busing, government dependency, and welfare, or by espousing such seemingly race-neutral ideas as “states rights” and “local control” as signals to preserve Jim Crow from federal intrusion. Even without making explicitly racist comments, the “dog whistle” was clearly heard by those who were its intended recipients. These strategies, combined called the “Southern Strategy”, was designed to create a national Republican majority, built, in part, on white resentment.), rather than explicit language, to communicate and campaign on hateful ideas. While not hate speech, this has the same effect.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Many politicians purposely use [vulgar and offensive](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262010156_Swearing_in_Political_Discourse_Why_Vulgarity_Works)(Results showed that a candidate’s use of swear words increased the perception of language informality and improved the general impression about the source. The latter effect was particularly strong for male candidate, as female candidate was already evaluated positively, irrespective of her cursing. In addition, though the manipulation of the politician’s vulgarity did not directly affect participants’ self-reported likelihood of voting for him or her, an indirect effect through language informality and impression about the candidate emerged.) language to try and win over disaffected and angry voters. This gives them an electoral incentive to engage in hate speech.
1.4.4. Pro: Hate speech, particularly against democratically underrepresented groups, can exacerbate discrimination.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Hate speech is likely to intimidate targeted individuals and discourage their participation in public spaces and debates.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Concern over becoming a victim of verbal abuse may [deter many](https://www.ravishly.com/free-speech-silences-marginalized-voices)(In other words, when marginalized people respond to hateful speech with more speech, they often risk their physical safety — not just their comfort.) from vocally expressing their views.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: If fewer marginalized people are willing to fight back against hateful groups, those groups will face less resistance and gain more power.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: Even if the prevalance of hate speech deters some from speaking out, it usually only requires a [small number of figureheads](https://hbr.org/2017/01/how-protests-become-successful-social-movements)(Throughout history, social movements — small groups that are loosely connected but united by a shared purpose — have created transformational change. Women’s suffrage and civil rights in the U.S., Indian independence, the color revolutions in Eastern Europe, and the Arab Spring all hinged on the powerless banding together against the powerful.) to push forward a movement. Therefore, such a deterrent may not have a huge impact.
1.4.4.1.2.2. Pro: If marginalized people are afraid to speak out, many people will hear less pushback against hateful views.
1.4.4.1.2.3. Pro: There may be less pressure for mainstream voices to disavow hateful views if those affected are less willing to speak out.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Mass movements, like the [Civil Rights Movement](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement), are not often discouraged by hate speech.
1.4.4.1.3.1. Con: While the Civil Rights Movement was not dissuaded, many paid a [high price](https://www.splcenter.org/what-we-do/civil-rights-memorial/civil-rights-martyrs)(On the Civil Rights Memorial are inscribed the names of individuals who lost their lives in the struggle for freedom during the modern Civil Rights Movement - 1954 to 1968. The martyrs include activists who were targeted for death because of their civil rights work; random victims of vigilantes determined to halt the movement; and individuals who, in the sacrifice of their own lives, brought new awareness to the struggle.) for supporting the cause. Had hate speech been banned, the outcome might have been different.
1.4.4.1.3.2. Pro: Having a large number of supporters can help people feel safer as they are [more anonymous](https://medium.com/\@keithcowley/crowd-behaviour-is-anonymity-always-associated-with-a-loss-of-self-78cf074c3e6f)(In contrast to both the deindividuation and contagion theories, SIT suggests individuals do not automatically feel anonymous or have a reduced perception of being evaluated. That when immersed in a crowd, members may express a social group identity.) in a crowd. This will influence people to a greater extent than fear caused by hate speech.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Hate speech contributes to the social exclusion of Middle Eastern and African migrants in Europe \([p. 9](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/INGE/DV/2021/07-12/IDADisinformation_migrant_minorities_EN.pdf)\).
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Hate speech in [Hungary](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-rights-idUSKCN1HC1AJ) has excluded Muslims and [Roma](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rom) from society, dehumanizing members of both groups.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: The majority of Western Europeans are accepting and open to having Muslims as [members of their family](https://www.pewforum.org/2018/10/29/eastern-and-western-europeans-differ-on-importance-of-religion-views-of-minorities-and-key-social-issues/)(in nearly every Western European country surveyed, more than half say they would accept a Muslim into their family.), indicating that hate speech has little overall effect in changing public opinion.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Prominent hate speech can lead to the normalization of hateful views in society.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: If hate speech becomes popular, it likely means that the hateful views it expresses were prominent and normalized before the acts of hate speech.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Much of hate speech explicitly references [old, prominent stereotypes or symbols](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hate-speech)(For example, the Nazi swastika, the Confederate Battle Flag \(of the Confederate States of America\), \[...\] have all been considered hate speech by a variety of people and groups.) against minority or discriminated groups.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: Hate speech is often much more explicit than the discriminatory biases that most people hold. Therefore, it can normalize more ardent offensive views and make people more likely to act upon them.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Hate speech is powerful and can lead to emulation, especially in societies which are experiencing economic difficulties.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: At-risk youth are [especially susceptible](https://educateagainsthate.com/which-children-and-young-people-are-vulnerable-to-radicalisation/) to hateful mentalities; they are indoctrinated and preyed upon by hateful individuals in order to further their hate-filled agenda.
1.4.4.3.2.1.1. Con: The key to keeping at-risk youth from being preyed on by hateful individuals is giving them [educational opportunities](https://en.unesco.org/news/role-education-transformative-journeys-youth-risk) to improve their ability to think for themselves.
1.4.4.3.2.2. Con: Education is an essential tool in helping lift communities out of economic hardships \([pp. 2-4](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b9b87f340f0b67896977bae/K4D_HDR_The_Contribution_of_Education_to_Economic_Growth_Final.pdf)\). It would also help teach young people about different cultures and ideas, making them less likely to commit hate speech.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: Political elites may seek to placate and even encourage those engaging in hate speech if they think they will face political costs for standing up against their views.
1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: For example, to stop voters from voting for far-right parties, French PM Macron has begun [mimicking](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/10/28/islamophobia-as-an-integration-strategy-in-france)(In the aftermath of the attack, Macron and his government launched a crackdown on Muslim civil society – or what they called “extremists”. Among the measures they took were “several dozen concrete actions … against organisations, associations or individuals who carry a project of radical Islamism”.\n\nAs a result, more than 50 charities – including the Collective Against Islamophobia in France \(CCIF\), a mainstream organisation that combats Islamophobia – dubbed by Minister of the Interior Gerald Darmanin as “enemies of the Republic”, may face dissolution.\n\nThroughout the process, Macron and his government have kept up their Islamophobic rhetoric, setting the tone for the public debate on the terror attack.) their hate speech.
1.4.4.3.3.2. Con: This encouragement will likely occur regardless of the legal status of hate speech as those in power will still be able to propagate hateful ideas for electoral gains.
1.4.4.4. Con: More explicit forms of desegregation and anti-discriminatory policies would more effectively mitigate existing discrimination.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: The United States has experienced measurable desegregation since [Brown v. Board of Education](https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment) \(1954\) without any need for limitation on the First Amendment.
1.4.4.4.1.1. Con: As demonstrated by the [Black Lives Matter](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10560-020-00690-4#Sec26)(Black people are not victims. We have survived in this country despite the Middle Passage, enslavement, and the numerous other attempts to make us the footstool that everyone who is not Black or American Indian/Native American \(survivors of numerous attempts at Indigenous erasure\) has the privilege of using to reach a ladder so they can climb unfettered and accomplish the American dream. If you are silent, you are complicit. If you fail to demand change, you are giving approval. If you fail to demand justice, just know, you are guilty, and you support injustice.) movement, progress has not continued at a sufficient enough rate to make up for hundreds of years of segregation and slavery.
1.4.4.4.1.2. Pro: With input from community leaders and parents, schools in Buffalo were reintegrated. As a result, the amount of hate and violence in these schools was [significantly lower](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/13/nyregion/school-integration-in-buffalo-is-hailed-as-a-model-for-us.html) than in others.
1.4.4.4.2. Con: Much of contemporary discrimination in rich countries does not take the form of legal exclusion, but rather manifests as implicit bias and [structural power imbalances](https://www.urban.org/features/structural-racism-america)(Throughout this country’s history, the hallmarks of American democracy – opportunity, freedom, and prosperity – have been largely reserved for white people through the intentional exclusion and oppression of people of color. The deep racial and ethnic inequities that exist today are a direct result of structural racism: the historical and contemporary policies, practices, and norms that create and maintain white supremacy.). Desegregation reforms may not target this.
1.4.4.4.2.1. Con: As many civil rights advocates have argued, this just means that more [radical anti-discriminatory policies](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/12/21283813/george-floyd-blm-abolish-the-police-8cantwait-minneapolis)(Abolition demands that we acknowledge that throughout US history, Black people have been disproportionately subjected to state-sponsored punishment — by design. That despite generations of mobilizing against a state complicit in enslaving, lynching, leasing, and excessively punishing and incarcerating Black people in particular, new incarnations of surveillance and punishment consistently emerge. Abolition demands that we imagine and actualize a state where this pattern finally ends.) must be pursued. These would be more effective than bans on hate speech.
1.4.4.4.2.2. Pro: Prominent, popular, and widespread hate speech may instead reinforce the implicit biases that lead to structural discrimination.
