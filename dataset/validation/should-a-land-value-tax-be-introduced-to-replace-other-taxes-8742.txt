Discussion Name: Should a land value tax be introduced to replace other taxes?

1. A land value tax should be introduced to replace other taxes.
1.1. Pro: Replacing several taxes with a land tax would make tax collection more effective and simple.
1.1.1. Con: Modern technology can make current taxes easy to process and collect.
1.1.2. Con: [Land value taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax#Revenue) as a single tax will not raise enough revenues.
1.1.3. Con: In some countries, a [land value tax](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512264919/article4.pdf) can be impractical because of uncertainty around land titles, land ownership and tenure.
1.1.4. Pro: Land value tax is hard to avoid because it's impossible to hide it in tax havens.
1.1.5. Pro: No deadweight losses, unlike taxes on income/production.
1.1.6. Pro: A more complex tax system means that more bureaucracy is necessary. With more bureaucracy comes more loopholes that people can use to cheat or abuse the system.
1.2. Pro: It would eliminate the boom-bust cycle in house and land prices.
1.2.1. Pro: Lan value tax reduces the vulnerability of economies to property bubbles by shiting real estate activity away from less productive activities such as [speculation](https://www.nicva.org/article/tax-land-not-houses).
1.2.2. Con: Countries, states and other areas, such as Hong-Kong and Denmark, have both LVT and boom and bust cycles.
1.2.3. Pro: Reduces land speculation
1.3. Con: Increasing the costs for landlords would prompt them to increase the amount they charge their tenants.
1.3.1. Con: If they could charge more for rent they would already be doing so. Rent is set by market demand, not costs to the landlord.
1.3.2. Con: Land value tax can't be shifted to the tenants, because the landowner has to pay it whether there's a tenant or not. [Why land tax can't be shifted onto tenants on Financial Review](http://blog.lvrg.org.au/2011/08/why-land-tax-cant-be-shifted-onto.html)
1.3.3. Pro: If all landlords passed on their costs to tenants, to maintain the margins, then the entire market would simply experience inflation.
1.4. Con: Making land ownership more expensive via the application of a tax renders it more difficult for poorer people to own their own land.
1.4.1. Pro: This would mean the poor would be at the mercy of rich landlords.
1.4.2. Pro: This would mean that the poor would be forced to rent, meaning money spent on accommodation would not be feeding into any future assets or investments.
1.4.2.1. Con: The poor are already forced to pay rent by being priced out of the housing market.
1.4.3. Con: Actually, a tax on land doesn't increase the cost of owning land. It lowers the price of land such that the total cost \(tax plus mortgage\) is the same. The landlord \(poor or rich\) pays more in taxes but less in mortgage due to the tax change.
1.4.4. Con: The new tax proposal would actually make life for the poor easier, by reducing their tax burden.
1.5. Pro: The change in tax policy would increase individuals' and society's economic efficiency and productivity.
1.5.1. Pro: The tax reform would encourage investment in productive economic activity, rather than in already existing assets.
1.5.2. Pro: Land is ideal for taxation because the supply of land is fixed, and therefore more taxation doesn't decrease the supply.
1.5.3. Pro: It would encourage people to make optimal use of their land, to make up for land taxes.
1.5.4. Con: The change in tax policy could yield less revenue for the government than the existing policy, which would limit the efficiency and productivity gains that they would be able to implement.
1.5.5. Pro: Land taxes don't discourage improvements to buildings, unlike other property taxes.
1.6. Con: Fast implementation of a high national Land Value Tax would cause land values to plummet and create an economic crisis.
1.6.1. Con: Land value tax could and has been implemented gradually.
1.6.2. Pro: Since land is used as a collateral for debt, vast sums of capital would be at risk of default. This would cause an economic crisis...not unlike what happened when housing prices crashed during the great recession.
1.6.2.1. Con: As soon as a land value tax is proposed and accepted, some assets will begin to shift into capital in productive areas of the economy.
1.7. Pro: A land value tax is a just and equitable tax, unlike other forms of taxation.
1.7.1. Pro: Land value tax can reduce economic inequality.
1.7.2. Pro: LVT is just because the value that attaches to land is derived not from the landlord's labor, but from society as a whole and from local advantages particular to the site. Therefore, a tax on land cannot be understood as "theft" since the individual landlord does not create the value he finds attached to his land. Other taxes, such as a sales tax or income tax, can be understood as theft, however, since those taxes take directly from the labor income of individuals.
1.7.3. Con: Its is not completely equitable, since it disproportionately taxes people who own a disproportionate amount of real-estate, especially if that land is a farm of a home in a gentrifying area.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Some poor people were able to buy homes that then greatly increased in value and would be forced out of there home to avoid the tax, meanwhile others like Warren Buffet only have a tiny portion of there assets in real estate.
1.7.3.2. Con: "Disproportionate" is different than "just and equitable." A LVT is just and equitable because it taxes individuals "in proportion" to the land value they control. Land value is not created by individuals, it's created by society generally, so it is just and equitable to capture that value from individuals and return it to society in a way that does it proportionately according to the distribution of the value within society.
1.8. Con: Multiple, more specific taxes would be more effective in dealing with varying contexts, as opposed to the more generalised tax system that a single land value tax would encourage.
1.8.1. Con: Specific taxes in varying contexts permit political involvement in markets which tends to be distortionary and inefficient. A single underlying tax on location rental values taps directly into national economic rent which varies with every site and the multiple economic activities which produce that land rental value, hence land tax is highly specific while being non-distortionary.
1.9. Con: Any tax that taxes static holdings is subject to abuse: in any application except a true one-time tax, the cycle or frequency of taxation will tend to drain resources endlessly, especially in the case of low-income citizens. A modest percentage income or increase tax would be far more equitable and sustainable.
1.9.1. Con: Since the value of land is produced by the economy, it replenishes in parallel with the frequency of taxation and provides an ongoing input into the value of the land.
1.9.2. Con: Low-income residents with high land value holdings could borrow against their holdings to pay the tax or move to a lower cost area. Low-income residents with low land value holdings would be subject to low taxation. LVT will fall toward zero at the margin, so there will be low cost land available for low-income residents in most metros. A Citizens Dividend would provide most low-income residents with the cash they need to cover their LVT burden. The others could move to lower cost areas.
1.9.3. Con: The cycle of taxation will have the tendency to relocate resources from owners of the taxed static holdings to citizens. Thus the greatest impact is on those who hold a perpetual right to occupy the largest amounts of the most valuable land \(typically finance corporations, churches, and the ultra-wealthy\), and the lowest impact is on those who own no land at all.
1.10. Pro: It is a progressive tax, as richer people tend to own more land and would therefore be hit the hardest.
1.10.1. Pro: The tax burden in [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax) falls on holders in proportion to the value of locations, which usually correlates with wealth and income.
1.10.2. Pro: Taxes unearned gains, rather than earned wages
1.10.3. Con: This is not necessarily fair, if the individuals have invested in land; their money is not necessary unearned.
1.10.3.1. Con: Income gains made on land rent by the wealthy is [unproductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) for the economy at large.
