Discussion Name: Should governments make an effort to reduce the gender pay gap?

1. Governments should make an effort to reduce the gender pay gap.
1.1. Con: The government is not the right actor to fix the gender pay gap.
1.1.1. Pro: Efforts to reduce the gender pay gap should be made by women.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Women are uniquely positioned to have an insider's view into the barriers that have precluded them from equal pay.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: To the extent that [social norms and roles](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/9/explainer-everything-you-need-to-know-about-equal-pay) preclude women from earning equal pay, women are responsible for making the choices that would bridge this divide.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In societies where women have the right to choose not to marry and have children, the power to make suitable work-related choices is in the hands of women themselves.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [Married men](https://qz.com/1508500/the-gender-wage-gap-is-between-married-men-and-everyone-else/) earn more than all other groups: unmarried men, unmarried women, and married women. Thus, women's choices appear to have little to do with the pay gap.
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: There is no pay difference between [married and single women](https://qz.com/1508500/the-gender-wage-gap-is-between-married-men-and-everyone-else/)(While married women are likely to have more children than single women, there was no pay gap between the two groups.).
1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Both marital and parental status are relevant to the gender pay gap, as this disparity reverses among young [single childfree women](https://abcnews.go.com/WN/reverse-gender-gap-study-young-childless-women-earn/story?id=11538401)(A growing number of women across the country are upending the conventional wisdom about a gender gap in pay.\n\nThese women earn 8 percent more on average than their male counterparts, according to a new study of Census data from Reach Advisors, a market research firm.).
1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Like men, women should not have to give up getting married and having kids to earn equal pay.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Social norms and roles are extremely [powerful forces](https://fcpablog.com/2019/11/12/social-norms-are-a-powerful-and-overlooked-compliance-tool/), and violating them can result in a host of [adverse reactions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17286-2), ranging from disapproval to social exclusion to even [murder](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57968350), in some regions of the world.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Just because women are better positioned to identify the barriers to equal pay does not mean they are empowered to remove them.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Achieving equal pay would allow women to claim this victory as their own.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Reducing the pay gap should be a collaborative effort and shared achievement without focusing on who did what.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Throughout [history](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/unheralded-women-scientists-finally-getting-their-due-180973082/), women have not been given credit for their achievements. Given that much of the fight for equal pay has been championed by [women](https://www.mic.com/articles/173024/equal-pay-is-widely-understood-to-be-a-feminist-issue-so-why-isn-t-the-fight-for-15), this effort must not be another statistic in the list of accomplishments not credited to women.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: In [mixed-gender contexts](https://hbr.org/2016/02/proof-that-women-get-less-credit-for-teamwork), women do not receive the credit due to them. Thus, including other actors in the fight against gender disparity will increase the likelihood of women not receiving credit for their role in reducing the pay gap.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Historic feminist achievements, such as the suffragettes' campaign, have served as an [inspiration for later generations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/29/nine-lessons-suffragettes-feminists)(In a movement defined by acts of daring, Davison's bravery was extraordinary. A hundred years later, votes for women are long since won in most countries – though not all – and the feminist revolution continues. Campaigners worldwide fight for equal political representation, an end to women's poverty, freedom from sexual violence, control over our own bodies, and – ultimately – for that most basic, yet radical, demand: for women to be treated as human beings. A century after Davison's funeral programme declared "She died for women," what can today's feminists learn from the suffragettes?). If women are responsible for fixing the gender pay gap, this will inspire the women of tomorrow.
1.1.1.3. Con: Women are at the receiving end of the pay gap. They should not be doubly burdened with the ordeal of fixing it.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Individual women should not be expected to fix such a large-scale problem that even powerful multinational organizations and governments have not been able to fix.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: In the past, women have come together to [collectively](https://time.com/4687509/day-without-a-woman-history-womens-strikes/) protest against gender [injustices](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/18/gender.uk)(A radical women’s movement called the Red Stockings first raised the question: “Why don’t we just all go on strike?” This, they argued, would be a powerful way of reminding society of the role women play in its running, their low pay, and the low value placed on their work inside and outside the home.) in society with varying degrees of succcess.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: If women are expected to fix a problem that requires collaborative action across multiple actors, women will be blamed for any resulting failure to bridge this divide.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Those at the receiving end of unequal treatment \(e.g., racial minorities, LGBTQ+ communities\) are often the ones involved in fixing the systemic barriers that deny them fair and equal treatment.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Straight women tend to want partners who [earn](https://ifstudies.org/blog/better-educated-women-still-prefer-higher-earning-husbands)(Women were 93 percent more likely to marry men in higher income deciles than themselves among couples in which the wife had more education than the husband than among couples in which the wife had less education than the husband.) more than them. The fight against pay disparity cannot be won when women are not unified in the call for equality on all fronts.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Higher financial status](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704919851139)(Men experience more distress than women when facing rivals’ economic dominance, such as apparent from better financial and job prospects and rivals’ higher status and prestige.) in a romantic rival is more likely to evoke jealousy in men than in women. This suggests that there may be an evolutionary basis to wanting to partner with wealthier men.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: That men are threatened by wealthier romantic rivals does not necessarily suggest that women want wealthier partners. Men \(and women\) may simply be [misinformed](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-myth-of-buying-beauty/374414/) about what the other gender finds attractive.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Higher financial status indicates to women that a man is capable of providing for her and her offsprings. Thus, from an [evolutionary perspective](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704919851139), possession of more resources is desirable to women.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: In the past, women were denied the opportunity to study and work. Thus, marrying rich may have been their only shot at financial prosperity. This may no longer hold true in modern society.
1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: There has been a significant increase in the number of women who [outearn their husbands](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/03/gender-wage-gap-more-women-out-earning-husbands/4933666002/) in recent years.
1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: As societies become more egalitarian, what men and women look for in a partner becomes "[increasingly similar](https://aeon.co/ideas/men-want-beauty-women-want-wealth-and-other-unscientific-tosh)(The results from the research are clear: mating preferences among men and women look increasingly similar. The trend is directly tied to increasing gender equality, as women gain greater access to resources and opportunities in business, politics and education. In more gender-unequal nations, such as Turkey, women rate the earning potential of partners as twice as important compared with women in the most gender-equal nations, such as Finland.)."
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Women want many things in a partner, such as [more responsibility-taking at home](https://ftp.iza.org/dp10832.pdf)(These effects are in line with our original hypothesis that she would respond positively to extra help he offers around the house over and above what is expected of him.) \(p. 21\). Selectively validating women's preferences only when they support existing gender inequities is disingenuous.
1.1.1.4.4. Con: Women may want to earn more than their husbands but prefer to be partnered with higher-income men to avoid the ramifications of violating social norms governing husband and wife pay disparity.
1.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Men whose [wives outearn](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/study-men-get-more-stressed-when-their-wives-make-more-money.html)(hey found that men felt the most anxious when they were the sole breadwinner in the family, and the least stressed when their women partners were contributing 40% to the household income. But as women made more money past that point, men become “increasingly uncomfortable” and stressed, according to the findings.) them experience higher levels of stress, because this violates the social norm that the man must provide for his family.
1.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: A 17-wave longitudinal study conducted in Australia found that [relationship satisfaction declines](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jomf.12653) in both marital partners when the wife begins to outearn her husband.
1.1.1.4.4.3. Pro: Among American couples, the [risk of divorce](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/can-american-men-ever-be-happy-if-their-wives-earn-more-than-they-do-2019-04-29) increases by about 33% when the wife outearns the husband.
1.1.1.4.4.4. Con: Women are [outearning their male partners](https://kslnewsradio.com/1905294/more-women-are-outearning-their-husbands-than-ever-but-we-arent-willing-to-talk-about-it/) at an unprecedented rate. Trends in this direction are likely to weaken the social norms that punish men and women for not adhering to norms regarding income generation.
1.1.1.4.4.5. Con: The notion that men feel threatened by partners who outearn them is unfounded; many women report that their partners are happy, proud, and supportive of them and even regard it as "[the sexiest thing in the world](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-9579819/Women-earn-husbands-reveal-affected-relationships.html)(One woman who makes three times as much as her husband said that 'he thinks it's the sexiest thing in the world' \[...\] One more high-earning woman said there are 'no weird dynamics attached' to the pay difference — and in fact, her husband thinks she should be making more. \n\n'The only comment he has ever made concerning my salary is that I should be getting paid more for all the toxic and misogynistic c**p I put up with,' she said. 'It's one of the many reasons I married him.'\n\nAnother man had a similar reaction when his wife took a new job that suddenly meant she was making more than he was.\n\n'He's thrilled for me and the opportunity I have; he knows how hard I worked for a promotion and has never mentioned that it bothers him. He's just happy we have more income to pay our mortgage!' she said. \n\nOne woman said her husband is 'proud' of her, while another called her husband her 'biggest supporter' and said that her success has motivated him as well.)."
1.1.1.4.5. Pro: If, on average, women want to marry men who are wealthier than them, then it is understandable that men, on average, would outearn women.
1.1.1.5. Con: Implicit biases, such as a preference to hire [more attractive employees](https://wol.iza.org/press-releases/does-it-pay-to-be-beautiful), underlie the wage gap. Women cannot fix the implicit biases that guide the decisions that other individuals make.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: The beauty premium, which contributes to the [attractiveness wage gap](https://wol.iza.org/press-releases/does-it-pay-to-be-beautiful), benefits men more than it benefits women.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: In the workplace, men and women are not held to the same [beauty standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/10/28/the-link-between-beauty-and-the-gender-gap/), which presumably underlie the attractiveness wage gap.
1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Gender differences in the beauty premium are not \(entirely\) attributable to employer bias.
1.1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Because of gender norms, men feel compelled to work, regardless of their attractiveness levels, and less-attractive women lack the confidence to enter the workforce. This [gender difference in variance](http://ftp.iza.org/dp8526.pdf)(Women’s self-selection into the labor force based on beauty endowments alters the distribution of observed female beauty in the labor market. Since more attractive women are more likely to appear in the labor market and vise versa, one observes less female beauty variation and, therefore, a smaller beauty premium. However, selection based on beauty endowment is less prevalent for men given men’s fairly high labor force participation rate, thus, one expects to observe larger beauty premium for men than for \nwomen.) in beauty between men and women explains the beauty premium divide between men and women \(p. 14\).
1.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: The [penalty for being unattractive](http://ftp.iza.org/dp8526.pdf)(p. 15) is the same for men and women \(7% reduction in wages\), but the premium for being attractive is almost double for men \(10.8%\), when compared to women \(4.5%\).
1.1.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Within the labor market, beauty demands are more pronounced for women than for men; yet, they are rewarded less than their male counterparts. This involves a [double penalty](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/10/28/the-link-between-beauty-and-the-gender-gap/): the cost of being beautiful and an incommensurate beauty premium.
1.1.1.5.1.4. Pro: Conventionally attractive women often feel like they are [not taken seriously](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/women-too-beautiful-stereotype-prejudice-sexist-dating-workplace-a7555676.html)(Conventionally attractive women have come together in their masses via social site Reddit to voice their negative experiences with one user asking, “Do you have any stories where your attractiveness has actually been a disadvantage?”\n\nThe most common response? Not being taken seriously at work – a place many women found to be fuelled by implicit sexist prejudices.) at work due to their appearance.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: The attractiveness gap may not be entirely attributable to biases. Instead, attractive people tend to be [more confident](http://ftp.iza.org/dp8526.pdf)(p. 13), which in turn could positively influence labor market outcomes.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The beauty premium is attributable to looks, not confidence, and affects men and women in [different ways](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241761028_Myth_or_Fact_The_Beauty_Premium_Across_the_Wage_Distribution)(There is a beauty premium at the bottom of the wage distribution for women and throughout the distribution for men.).
1.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: Attractive people appear to possess the characteristics that are relevant to important market outcomes, such as [firm revenue](https://wol.iza.org/press-releases/does-it-pay-to-be-beautiful)(One study shows that attractive workers increase a firm’s revenue by more than the money it takes to cover their higher wages, so their good looks do enhance the profitability and success of the firm.). Thus, attractive people may witness higher callback rates because they possess more of such desirable traits.
1.1.1.6. Con: It is difficult for women to reduce the gender pay gap on their own without working in high-level powerful positions within companies.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Without the power to actually make changes, women will not be able to close the gender pay gap on their own.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: There is power in numbers. Employees can band together to engage in [collective bargaining](https://www.epi.org/publication/fear-at-work-how-employers-scare-workers-out-of-unionizing/)(Employers—including many respectable, name-brand companies—collectively spend $340 million per year on “union avoidance” consultants who teach them how to exploit these weakness of federal labor law to effectively scare workers out of exercising their legal right to collective bargaining.) and demand changes from management, which is why many companies feel threatened by the concept of unions.
1.1.1.6.3. Pro: Having more women working in management helps reduce the gender pay gap within firms \([p. 17](https://ftp.iza.org/dp12026.pdf)(For private companies we find that a higher share of workers who are women correlates with a smaller \nfirm-level pay gap. This finding, which stands in contrast to theoretical predictions and some of the empirical evidence, relates particularly to private firms that already have large wage gaps and which employ large shares of low skilled workers. We believe this result may partly be driven by the matching methodology we applied, which allows us to account for between and within firm sorting of men and women. Moreover, it may pertain to the fact that in these companies the share of female workers tends to be low, so its increase may lead to more equal pay.)\).
1.1.1.6.4. Pro: "By mid-career, [men are 70% more likely](https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2018/05/new-research-promotion-gap) to have been promoted to executive roles compared to women." Towards the end of their careers, men are 142% more likely to be in VP or C-suite roles.
1.1.1.7. Con: Women, particularly feminists, have been fighting to [fix the gender pay gap](https://www.investopedia.com/history-gender-wage-gap-america-5074898) for centuries; yet, the pay gap has persisted. This underscores the insufficiency of action from women and the need for intervention from external actors, such as the government.
1.1.1.8. Con: Fixing the gender pay gap can be done by women who are in government. It does not need to be a choice between one or the other.
1.1.1.8.1. Con: Women leaders do not guarantee a decrease in the gender pay gap. In 2019, Germany had the [second-worst gender pay gap in the EU](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-gender-pay-gap-shrinks-but-still-higher-than-eu-average/a-55860947)(Germany's gender pay gap shrinks, but still higher than EU average\n\nGerman women made 19% less than men in 2019, a slim decrease from 2018. With the European Union average at 15%, Germany has the bloc's second-worst gender pay gap after Estonia.) despite Angela Merkel being chancellor for fourteen years.
1.1.2. Pro: Fixing the gender pay gap is not within the government's scope.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The government has no place dictating to businesses how things should be run.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Business and government coexist; each holds influence over the other.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The government provides critical services for the public that simultaneously benefit private businesses.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The government provides security and regulations to protect private property, as well as basic utilities like roads and the postal service.
1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The majority of infrastructure related to telecommunications and the distribution of natural gas, water, and electricity are supported or wholly owned by the government, even if some or all of the distributing companies are private.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Private businesses provide some essential services for the general public, filling in gaps where the government is lacking.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Private businesses stepped in to help people more quickly than the government [during the pandemic](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/private-companies-stepping-faster-federal-government-long/story?id=70122354).
1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: In a majority of the cases, private businesses, particularly big companies, [acted in their own self-interest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/50-biggest-companies-coronavirus-layoffs/) and turned a huge profit that benefited shareholders rather than their employees.
1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: A lack of separation between business and government can pose threats to the independence of these institutions, such as conflicts of interest, corporate lobbying, and cronyism.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The government and businesses have two very different values and objectives: increasing [social value and profitability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/10/05/government-vs-business/?sh=17b2ee202a54)(Profit is the realm of business, while unprofitable but socially useful tasks is the responsibility of government.), respectively. Thus, governments are not best suited to inform business practices and operations.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Government does have a place in [regulating businesses](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/workplace-health-safety-act-2606.html) when it comes to monopolies, community safety, fair business practices and discrimination.
1.1.2.2. Con: The government was established to protect all people; as it says in the [Declaration of Independence](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/white-papers/the-declaration-the-constitution-and-the-bill-of-rights): "all men are created equal."
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: James Madison, one of the founding fathers of the United States [once said](https://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-02-02-02-1924), "It is sufficiently obvious, that Persons and Property, are the two great subjects on which Governments are to act: and that the rights of persons, and the rights of property are the objects for the protection of which Government was instituted."
1.1.2.2.2. Con: The very fact that the Declaration still uses androcentric language \(all "men"\) suggests that the government is not adequately self-aware or informed to be addressing gender inequality.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: When the Declaration was written, minorities and women were unable to vote or hold any position of power within the government; it makes sense that they used this terminology back then.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Like any other document, the Declaration should be updated to reflect modern values and changes over time, especially since women and minorities are now considered equal to White men - at least on paper.
1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: The use of gender-neutral language is a [modern](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49754930) [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language). Thus, the use of androcentric language in a document authored centuries ago is forgivable.
1.1.2.2.2.1.3. Con: The fact that women were denied the right to vote or hold government office, until challenged by [women suffragettes](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/women-who-fought-for-the-vote-1), testifies to governmental incapacity to act as visionaries who can advocate for the emancipation of traditionally disadvantaged groups.
1.1.2.2.2.1.4. Con: The passage in which "[all men are created equal](https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/declaration-of-independence)(“We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”)" appears applies to basic human rights, not to anything specific for which the right to vote or hold office would have implications.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The word "created" has religious connotations. Thus, the use of androcentric language may reflect the use of male pronouns in the [Bible](https://margmowczko.com/masculine-pronouns-english-bible/).
1.1.2.3. Pro: The gender pay gap is a natural phenomenon due to individual choices and strengths.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Governments do intervene to influence [individual choices](https://www.who.int/activities/raising-taxes-on-tobacco) \(e.g., increasing tax on cigarettes to reduce smoking\) and, consequently, alter "natural" phenomena.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Traditionally, men have been disproportionately tasked with the responsibility of [being the breadwinners of their families](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00031224211012442)(Gender norms conventionally dictate that women prioritize family and men prioritize career success, resulting in the male-breadwinner norm that casts men as the primary- or higher-earner in the household \(Connell 1995, 2010; Gerson 1993\). This norm crystallizes into patterns of social recognition and reinforcement that benefit couples who conform to these norms and penalize those who do not.). The pay gap corresponds to this inequity.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Expecting men to be sole or primary breadwinners effectively condemns them to servitude as their primary social function.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Throughout history, people have consistently been condemned to servitude, [serving either a king, a landowner](https://www.ducksters.com/history/middle_ages_feudal_system.php), or their boss at work.
1.1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: There is no inherent or logical reason why this always has to be the case. Just because, historically, societies have assigned gender roles as such does not justify it being so.
1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Such notions of people, not just men, existing for "economic gain" are historically quite recent being born largely out of the industrial revolution and the need to [drive subsistence farmers off of common lands](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/industrialization-labor-and-life/12th-grade/) and into factories.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: This could explain why [married men](https://qz.com/1508500/the-gender-wage-gap-is-between-married-men-and-everyone-else/) earn more than unmarried men as well as married and unmarried women.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Management may be more sympathetic to married men, particularly those with children, because they have a family to support.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Parental status cannot be a determining factor for pay as only [fathers earn more](https://www.businessinsider.in/finance/having-a-child-increases-your-pay-but-only-if-youre-a-man/articleshow/51980772.cms) than mothers.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Recruiters are indeed more [lenient](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229866757_Mothers_and_Fathers_in_the_Workplace_How_Gender_and_Parental_Status_Influence_Judgments_of_Job-Related_Competence) toward fathers, but women are held to stricter standards, despite sharing the same marital and parental status.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Recent analyses suggest that the [parenthood penalty](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-gender-wage-gap-shrinks-while-the-parenthood-gap-grows)(Perhaps the most striking update is #3, tracing the demise of the fatherhood bonus. Fathers don’t earn more than their childless peers anymore; they earn less. Depending on the variables being considered, in 2018, men with children earnedas much as 13% less as those without kids. In the past, observers frequently interpreted father’s earnings advantage as evidence that employers see “family men” as reliable, committed workers, while they view women as distracted by divided loyalties. “One of the worst career moves a woman can make is to have children,” New York Times reporter Claire Cain Miller wrote in 2014. Now we can add fathers to that statement.) applies to fathers as well, as men increasingly try to be more involved in the lives of their children.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Women spend more money on [household upkeep](https://www.radstats.org.uk/no075/pahl.htm)(\[W\]omen are overwhelmingly responsible for paying for child care \[...\] Debates about the domestic division of labour have not so far acknowledged that 40 per cent men's clothing is actually bought by women, presumably because men cannot be bothered to buy their own. \[...\] The evidence suggests that women continue to be responsible for the collective expenditure of households, whereas men are more preoccupied with individual as opposed to collective expenditure.) than men.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Parents are more likely to be perceived as [less committed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229866757_Mothers_and_Fathers_in_the_Workplace_How_Gender_and_Parental_Status_Influence_Judgments_of_Job-Related_Competence) to their jobs than their childfree counterparts.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Across the world, [familial commitments](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/values-graphic-care-behaviour-family-love-tradition-free-speech/)(Across the world, family is what we value most.) are rated as the strongest and most important commitments that exist; therefore, it is natural for all other commitments to compete for second place.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.4. Pro: Failing to account for employee familial obligations when making hiring or promotion-related decisions could constitute [family responsibilities discrimination](https://www.workplacefairness.org/family-responsibilities-discrimination).
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.5. Pro: Men do in fact receive a breadwinner bonus, and women can also benefit from this by portraying themselves as the [breadwinners](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/breadwinner-bonus-and-caregiver-penalty-workplace-rewards-men-and-women) of their families.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.5.1. Con: Women shouldn't need to portray themselves as the breadwinner in order to receive a bonus for being a parent.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1.6. Pro: This is consistent with the societal expectations that pressure men into playing the role of the [household breadwinner](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/)(Roughly seven-in-ten adults \(71%\) say it is very important for a man to be able to support a family financially to be a good husband or partner.\n\nMen are especially likely to place a greater emphasis on their role as financial providers.) in order to be considered a good husband and father, while reflecting men's own internalization of this ideal.
1.1.2.3.2.2.2. Con: If being married is a condition warranting higher pay, then married women should also be making the same as married men, which is not the case.
1.1.2.3.2.3. Con: The pay gap is computed by comparing men and women who are already a part of the workforce. Thus, differences in workforce representation have no implication for the pay gap.
1.1.2.3.2.4. Con: Traditionally, women have been disproportionately denied the [right to education](https://www.bustle.com/p/heres-how-women-fought-for-the-right-to-be-educated-throughout-history-53150)(Women's pursuit of an equal, in-depth, high-level education as adults has met many stumbling blocks over the centuries: inferior standards \(or the complete absence\) of education for young girls, beliefs in women's intellectual inferiority, and worries that education in non-domestic subjects wouldn't adequately prepare women for their "natural" role as wives and mothers.) and [work](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-history-of-womens-work-and-wages-and-how-it-has-created-success-for-us-all/). If women were to demand restitution for what they have been denied for centuries, the pay gap would widen substantially.
1.1.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: At present, [more than two-thirds](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/104-countries-have-laws-that-prevent-women-from-working-in-some-jobs/)(The World Bank says there are 104 economies with labour laws that restrict the types of jobs women can undertake, and when and where they are permitted to work. It estimates that this affects the employment choices of 2.7 billion women.) of women worldwide are affected by discriminatory laws that limit their entry into certain fields.
1.1.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: Even today, in more than a dozen countries, women need to obtain their [husband's permission](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/18-countries-where-women-need-their-husbands-permission-to-get-a-job/) to be able to work.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: There are [average differences](https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap) between men and women that are important in the context of labor-market outcomes.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: Biological sex differences and gender disparities are [not causally linked](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/underdiagnosis-autism-women-and-girls)(You’d also find a correlation between foetal testosterone and who’s wearing pink or blue Pampers, but that doesn’t mean the relationship is causal.).
1.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Differences in the physical abilities of men and women contribute to the pay gap.
1.1.2.3.3.2.1. Con: There are also average [biological](https://www.insider.com/tallest-people-world-countries-ranked-2019-6) [differences](https://www.insider.com/shortest-people-in-world-by-country-2019-6) between other [demographic groups](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20961790.2019.1697060), such that anthropologists can determine their ancestry and race just from skeletal remains. This does not justify different pay based on race-specific biological endowment, as this is tantamount to discrimination.
1.1.2.3.3.2.2. Con: Biological impairments also limit those with disability from performing tasks their able-bodied counterparts can easily perform. The solution is to accommodate rather than exclude or penalize those with limitations and challenges, physical or otherwise.
1.1.2.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: Those with disabilities are entitled to [reasonable accommodations](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/employee-rights-book/chapter7-8.html), at least in the US.
1.1.2.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: This is the principle underlying [period leave](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-menstrual-hygiene-day-why-period-leave-is-important/383771): the intense [pain and discomfort](https://sifted.eu/articles/paid-period-leave/) that many women experience during menstruation should not be ignored or penalized.
1.1.2.3.3.2.3. Con: While there may be physical differences between the average man and the average woman, there is significant overlap between the two genders. This means that differences between the sexes are much less significant.
1.1.2.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: While measuring for differences in capabilities of running speed and endurance, men’s and women’s bell-curves [overlap](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm) for average speed.
1.1.2.3.3.2.3.2. Con: If a task requires an above-average amount of strength or speed, the position will be filled by an individual in the upper percentile of strength or speed and will disproportionately consist of males \(i.e. professional athletes, [coal miners](https://www.mineralscouncil.org.za/downloads/send/16-featured/896-women-in-mining-in-south-africa)(p. 2), lumberjacks, [firefighters](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/03/nyregion/despite-recruiting-few-women-do-well-in-firefighter-tests.html)\).
1.1.2.3.3.2.3.2.1. Con: There are plenty of professional women athletes; they compete against other women athletes, not men.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4. Pro: Jobs that require heavy lifting demand a certain physique, more commonly associated with men.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Due to their demanding physical nature and smaller labor pool meeting these characteristics, jobs that require heavy lifting are often well paid.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.1. Con: The pay gap is not specific to one particular industry. Instead, it is pervasive across almost [all industries](https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/simple-truth/).
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: The gender pay gap is most prominent and resistant to change [among white-collar workers](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/study-finds-white-collar-women-experience-the-biggest-gender-pay-gap)(Last week, the Wall Street Journal published a report concluding that women in white-collar, high-paying professions experienced a larger gender pay gap than women in blue-collar professions. Among the top 10 professions where women’s earnings lagged men’s,”doctors, compensation managers and personal financial advisers” were among those showing the widest earnings gaps.”\n\nAfter examining 446 major occupations, the Wall Street Journal discovered that highly educated women in elite jobs were among those with the largest earnings differentials.), whose jobs are unlikely to be physically demanding, particularly when compared to blue-collar, manual, or unskilled workers.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The job with the widest gender pay gap \(financial advisors\) presumably does not require heavy lifting. Yet, women make only [58.9%](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/the-10-jobs-with-the-largest-and-smallest-gender-pay-gaps.html) of what their men counterparts do.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.2. Con: If a woman is hired to perform a task that requires heavy lifting, this implies that she is perfectly capable of completing the required task. This does not explain why women in jobs that require heavy lifting should be paid less than their men counterparts.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.3. Con: Jobs that require heavy lifting aren't well paid at all, neither in the metaphorical, nor in the literal sense. Therefore, this can't explain the pay gap.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: Jobs that require unskilled labor are [decreasing](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/skilled-labor-vs-unskilled-labor-46154.html) due to technological and societal advances.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.3.2. Pro: Among the [lowest-paid jobs](https://www.myplan.com/careers/top-ten/lowest-paying.php) in the US, many include low-education and physically demanding jobs like farmworkers and laborers \(with a average hourly rate of $10.64\), construction laborers \($14.66\) or freight and stock movers \($13.39\).
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.3.3. Pro: Unskilled [manual](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/14299/labour-markets/factors-that-explain-wage-inequality/) labor is generally not well-paid.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.1.4. Con: Equating every worker's value on their ability to lift heavy things also discriminates against weak men and women, those with disabilities, and older workers.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.2. Con: New [technologies](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/22/20925894/robots-warehouse-jobs-automation-replace-workers-amazon-report-university-illinois)(It found that technology and automation can help workers by reducing the “monotonous and physically strenuous activities” of, say, lifting heavy packages. . . . Robotic arms can help by picking up packages and reducing the amount of heavy lifting and twisting that workers have to do.) are increasingly reducing the need for [heavy lifting](https://bygging-uddemann.co.kr/everything-to-know-about-heavy-lifting/)(When multiple activities need to be carried out simultaneously, hydraulic heavy lifting equipment makes tasks easier with the reduction in manpower. They are preferred over cranes and hoists to lift objects against gravity relatively easily. This reduces the manual work required along with the strain on construction workers.) in the workplace. The persistence of the pay gap, despite these technological advancements, suggests that physical attributes are not satisfactory explanations for the pay gap.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.3. Con: Gender socialization informs women that they must be [lean](https://www.livescience.com/18131-women-thin-dieting-history.html) and [fragile](https://dailycollegian.com/2013/11/gender-socialization-causes-women-to-feel-inadequate/)(Women are therefore socialized to feel inadequate. Because they are pressured to feel weaker, they are also pressured to fulfill that role by altering their bodies and minds. This is one of several reasons women may develop eating disorders and become obsessed with image. Society has socialized women to believe the most powerful thing they can be is beautiful.) rather than muscular and strong to be desirable. A pay gap attributable to gender differences in physical composition is at least partially attributable to these inequities.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: Women with "masculine" body attributes, which are essential for success in their chosen career pursuits, are punished.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Muscular women complain that they are called "[butch](https://www.wellandgood.com/lgbtq-terms-butch-strong/)(As a rugby player turned CrossFit athlete, I've been called many things—powerful, jacked, athletic, intimidating, muscular, bulky—because I look strong. And usually, I appreciate the acknowledgement of the hard work I’ve put in at the gym, the box, and on the rugby pitch. But there's one word that occasionally gets slung around that I'm sensitive to. That word is butch.)," even though they do not identify as such.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: Women with naturally high levels of [testosterone](https://www.phillytrib.com/sports/two-namibian-olympic-medal-contenders-ruled-ineligible-for-womens-400m-due-to-naturally-high-testosterone/article_5d3e193f-f673-5963-b06a-919123316e1c.html) have been banned from the Olympics.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: When men have "naturally high level" of biological features conducive to sports performance, they are celebrated. In contrast, such endowment in women is punished. This is a [double standard](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/05/olympics-testosterone-sprinters/)(Many have noted the stark contrast between the treatment she and a disproportionate number of Black women have faced over their natural hormone levels with the widespread celebration of Michael Phelps, whose body produces unusually low levels of lactic acid.).
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: Conversely, women who fail to adhere to [standards of femininity](https://www.verifythis.com/article/news/verify/sports-verify/norway-beach-handball-team-fined-shorts/536-56b9c94c-268c-4bc9-83cd-bff96a58b480)(Following the match, the Disciplinary Commission of the tournament imposed a fine of 150 euros, about $176, per player for a total team fine of 1,500 euros, nearly $1,800. The commission said the fine was for “improper clothing.”\n\nAccording to the rules of the International Handball Federation, “The Beach Handball female player’s uniform consists of tops and bikini bottoms and eventual accessories.” Furthermore, the rules state: “Female athletes must wear bikini bottoms that are in accordance with the enclosed graph, with a close fit and cut on an upward angle toward the top of the leg. The side width must be of a maximum of 10 centimetres \[sic\].”), irrespective of how irrelevant they might be to the task at hand, are penalized.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.4. Con: Women may compensate for any limitations in physical strength by making other equally valuable contributions.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.4.1. Pro: In the construction industry, [women bring different perspectives](https://esub.com/is-it-time-for-more-women-in-the-construction-industry/), adding value to their companies.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.5. Pro: Among [unskilled](https://www.myplan.com/careers/top-ten/lowest-paying.php) jobs, some of the [lowest paid](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38168029/ns/business-careers/t/lowest-paying-jobs-america/) ones do not [require](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-worst-paid-jobs-2061699) demanding physical tasks. Other unskilled jobs that do, are comparatively better paid.
1.1.2.3.3.2.4.5.1. Con: The jobs listed in the source are not linearly arranged along a continuum spanning from "not physically demanding" to "physically demanding." In the absence of a measurable unit of this attribute, the association between pay and the extent to which a job is physically demanding cannot be determined.
1.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Men and women differ in their interests and abilities. This difference underlies the pay gap.
1.1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: Gender differences in [competitiveness](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2183036)—a trait encouraged in boys but [not in girls](https://www.girlsglobe.org/2018/02/12/society-teaches-women-not-competitive/)—explain why men choose more prestigious careers, despite no differences in ability.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: Women, on average, are better than men at sales; [studies](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/men-vs-women-selling) have shown that women are more capable at closing a deal than men. Knowing this, firms would tend to prefer hiring women within their sales department.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.1. Con: Women represent just [11.7% of the senior sales executives](https://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/Gender_Diversity_2014.pdf)(Subject to those limitations, during the course of the survey, more women have served as the top sales executive in the SV150 than in the S&P100 in absolute numbers, but in some years, including in the 2014 proxy season, the S&P100 surges ahead in terms of the percentage of all sales executives that are women, due to the small number of companies in the S&P100 with sales executives \(SV150 = 11.7% of 77 companies with a senior sales executive and S&P100 = 16.7% of 12 companies with a senior sales executive in the 2014 proxy season\).) among Silicon Valley's 150 largest companies.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.2. Con: Firms could prefer to hire women because of the decreased cost; women in sales earn just [63 cents for every dollar](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf) that their male counterparts earn.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.3. Pro: Women are [better listeners](https://www.forbes.com/sites/falonfatemi/2018/01/29/3-definitive-advantages-women-have-in-sales/)(Most people assume it’s the smooth talkers who make the best salespeople. This is a fallacy. In reality, it’s those who have mastered the art of listening who are most successful in sales. Too many sales professionals come to the table with their own agenda. They are laser focused on attaining quotas and optimizing commissions, and quickly lose sight of the customer. The best salespeople take the time to listen to their customers.\n\nListening is a fundamental skill in sales. 74% of customers are more likely to purchase an offering if they perceive that they are being listened to. Listening enables salespeople to more effectively understand customer concerns and pain points, and strategize about what aspects of their offering will best resonate. They’re able to more effectively build rapport with customer because they demonstrate that they have prospects' best interests at heart. Customers need to feel that they matter.); people are more likely to buy from someone they believe is listening to their needs.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: Heschl’s gyrus, the part of the brain primarily responsible for listening, is [more voluminous](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/males-and-females-differ-in-specific-brain-structures) in women compared to men.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.3.2. Con: Women are [expected to listen](https://hbr.org/1995/09/the-power-of-talk-who-gets-heard-and-why) to what others have to say, while what they have to say often goes unheard. This is not innate but a price lower-status individuals pay when interacting with their higher-status counterparts.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.4. Pro: Women have [better emotional intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/falonfatemi/2018/01/29/3-definitive-advantages-women-have-in-sales/) and are better than men at identifying their own emotions as well as the emotions of others.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Women [outperform men](https://www.kornferry.com/about-us//press/new-research-shows-women-are-better-at-using-soft-skills-crucial-for-effective-leadership/) in 11 of the 12 emotional intelligence categories.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.4.2. Pro: Women are significantly better at [emotional self-awareness](https://www.kornferry.com/about-us//press/new-research-shows-women-are-better-at-using-soft-skills-crucial-for-effective-leadership/)(The greatest difference between men and women can be seen in emotional self-awareness, where women are 86% more likely than men to be seen as using the competency consistently \(18.4% of women demonstrate the competency consistently compared to just 9.9% of men\).) in particular.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.4.3. Con: Previously reported sex differences in self-reported emotional intelligence have been debunked as nothing more than a stereotype and "[backhanded compliment](https://www.hrzone.com/perform/people/women-excel-at-emotional-intelligence-or-do-they)" to women.
1.1.2.3.3.3.2.4.4. Con: Empathy is a learned behavior that girls and women are more strongly expected to demonstrate. Thus, all people, irrespective of gender, can be trained to be [more empathetic](https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/empathy-has-gender-bias-here-s-how-we-can-close-ncna1239205).
1.1.2.3.3.3.3. Pro: A sizeable portion of the pay gap can be attributed to [choice of industry and occupation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/29/men-say-they-work-more-than-women-heres-the-truth/)(Onto the anatomy of the female paycheck: Cornell University researchers Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, who’ve looked at the wage gap for years, found in a 2015 study that chunks of the gender wage gap can be attributed to industry choice \(17.6 percent\) and occupation choice \(32.9 percent\).).
1.1.2.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: Men are more [concentrated in higher-paying jobs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/29/men-say-they-work-more-than-women-heres-the-truth/)(We know that women often concentrate in lower-paying roles, while men gravitate toward higher-paying fields, such as technology and finance.) in finance and technology.
1.1.2.3.3.3.3.1.1. Con: These industries tend to be [openly hostile towards women](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/opinion/a-colleague-drank-my-breast-milk-and-other-wall-street-tales.html), who frequently experience harassment and constant confrontations in the workplace.
1.1.2.3.3.3.3.2. Con: A [substantial proportion of the pay gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/29/men-say-they-work-more-than-women-heres-the-truth/) \(38%\) remains unexplained even after choice of industry and occupation are accounted for.
1.1.2.3.3.3.4. Con: Tests of interests, on which men and women differ in their scores, appear to suffer from [androcentric biases](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50913954_Gender_Differences_in_Vocational_Interests_and_Their_Stability_Across_Different_Assessment_Methods).
1.1.2.3.3.3.5. Con: Differential pay that penalizes women for having interests that differ from those of men is evidence of gender inequality.
1.1.2.3.3.3.6. Con: Interests becomes [less gendered with age](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-gender-differences-vocational-decrease-age.html). This suggests that the pressure to conform, which is more pronounced during adolescence, rather than biology explains gender differences in vocational interests.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7. Con: Gender-related career preferences are influenced by [sociocultural norms](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-development/gender-and-careers/) rooted in unfair historical prejudices that may manifest under the guise of "individual decisions." Therefore, the government should intervene, because the decisions are not rationally based.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.1. Pro: Following the [Rwandan genocide](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/10/577018509/rwanda-ranks-in-the-top-5-for-gender-equity-do-its-teen-girls-agree)(Records show that immediately following the genocide, Rwanda's population of 5.5 million to 6 million was 60 to 70 percent female. Most of these women had never been educated or raised with the expectations of a career. In pre-genocide Rwanda, it was almost unheard of for women to own land or take a job outside the home.\n\nThe genocide changed all that. The war led to Rwanda's "Rosie the Riveter" moment: It opened the workplace to Rwandan women just as World War II had opened it to American women.), which claimed the lives of more men than women, women had to step in to play the roles previously played by men. This illustrates that changing social norms dictate if and how men and women are allowed to participate in the labor market.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.1.1. Pro: Prior to the genocide, [women](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/10/577018509/rwanda-ranks-in-the-top-5-for-gender-equity-do-its-teen-girls-agree) did not work outside the home. At present, they rank among the [top countries](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/how-rwanda-beats-almost-every-other-country-in-gender-equality/)(At 86%, Rwanda has one of the highest rates of female labour force participation in the world. In the US, for example, that figure stands at 56%, and has even been declining since the turn of the millennium.) in the world on indices of not only labor participation but also gender equality in general.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.1.2. Pro: The pay gap is significantly narrower in [Rwanda](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/how-rwanda-beats-almost-every-other-country-in-gender-equality/)(\[T\]he wage gap is narrower – in Rwanda, women earn 88 cents for every dollar men do; in the US, it’s just 74 cents.) than in many other developed nations, including the US.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.1.3. Con: Though sociocultural crises can force women to play the roles men typically play, that does not mean that women truly desire to play these same roles in the absence of such coercive conditions.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.2. Con: With this standard, no decision can be considered an individual decision because all decisions are influenced by social and cultural forces.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.2.1. Con: Some decisions are made because a person is directly and frequently told they should or should not do something on the basis of their sex, over which they have no control. This is unfair because it limits human agency and undermines individual uniqueness.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.2.2. Pro: Even if certain decisions are not rationally based but influenced by sociocultural factors, it does not follow that the government has a right to intervene.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.3. Pro: Parental profession provides cues about gender norms, which [influence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5403118/) career selection among adolescents.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.4. Con: Sex differences in career decisions are rooted in biology, as demonstrated by studies that show [sex differences in toy preferences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0018506X08000949?via%3Dihub) among infants, who have not been exposed to socialization.
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.4.1. Con: Differences present at birth do not imply that they are biological in origin because [gender](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0731121414564883) [socialization](https://www.proquest.com/openview/5db32c60ea27608c16fd2edf544ee801/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=31040) begins [in utero](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/gender-socialization/).
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.4.2. Con: Toy preferences are the product of [gender socialization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766397/) and gendered marketing strategies. Suggesting otherwise is detrimental to [optimal child development](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/toys-kids-girls-boys-childhood-development-gender-research).
1.1.2.3.3.3.7.4.3. Pro: Gender-related preferences that are influenced by innate predisposing factors cannot be changed by government intervention.
1.1.2.3.3.3.8. Pro: There are [differences in interests](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Baron-Cohen/publication/232430614_The_Essential_Difference_The_Truth_About_The_Male_And_Female_Brain/links/547cdb7a0cf2cfe203c1fde2/The-Essential-Difference-The-Truth-About-The-Male-And-Female-Brain.pdf), present at birth, which correspond to the differences in career choice between men and women.
1.1.2.3.3.3.8.1. Con: The article is authored by Simon Baron-Cohen, whose theory of men and women brains perpetuates [neurosexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosexism).
1.1.2.3.3.3.8.1.1. Pro: Sex differences in brain anatomy and physiology are a [myth](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00677-x).
1.1.2.3.3.3.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.3.7.4.1.
1.1.2.3.3.4. Con: Gender and sex differences may, themselves, be a product of gender inequality, as demonstrated by findings which suggest that [gender socialization affects the brain development](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190417102816.htm).
1.1.2.3.3.5. Con: Conceptual and operational problems cast doubt on the research findings yielded by studies testing gender and sex differences.
1.1.2.3.3.5.1. Pro: Studies on sex differences are highly ethnocentric, as findings generated using Western samples are generalized to all of humanity. In reality, however, sex differences found in one [culture](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/36/14786) do not exist in others.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2. Pro: Studies examining gender differences are fundamentally flawed in that they [conflate gender and sex](https://news.stanford.edu/2015/08/19/gender-sex-surveys-081915/) and fail to delineate the differential influence of nature and nature on the variables of interest.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2.1. Pro: It remains unclear whether gender differences in labor-market outcomes are [attributable to nature or nurture](https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap), and the extent to which they are malleable is yet to be determined.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2.1.1. Con: If there are biologically wired sex differences, then assessing women and men against the same standards would be unfair to the disadvantaged party.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Segregation is necessary](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4848&context=lcp) in sports. Specifically, because of biological sex differences, pitching a man against a woman would be unfair and unjust.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: For every labor market-relevant sex difference reported, the authors have emphasized the role that [social factors](https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap)(The available evidence here suggests these factors can only explain a relatively small fraction of the observed differences in wages.7 And they are anyway far from being purely biological – preferences and skills are highly malleable and ‘gendering’ begins early in life.8) play in gendering the occupation.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2.1.3. Pro: Even [minimal intervention](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5949257_Playing_an_Action_Video_Game_Reduces_Gender_Differences_in_Spatial_Cognition)(\[P\]laying an action video game can virtually eliminate this gender difference in spatial attention and simultaneously decrease the gender dispar- ity in mental rotation ability. . . . Given that superior spatial skills are important in the mathematical and en-gineering sciences, these ﬁndings have practical implica-tions for attracting men and women to these ﬁelds.) such as less than half a day of video game play can neutralize the most consistently reported sex differences.
1.1.2.3.3.5.2.1.4. Pro: [Research](https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap) findings suggest that skills associated with gender "can only explain a relatively small fraction" of the pay gap and are "far from being purely biological" since "preferences and skills are highly malleable and 'gendering' begins early in life".
1.1.2.3.3.6. Pro: Creating a "more equal" society would not reduce the gender disparity gap in [STEM professions](https://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/) due to the 'gender equality paradox.' The lack of welfare support in gender disparate countries causes women to choose high-paying professions in STEM.
1.1.2.3.3.6.1. Con: Efforts to promote equality often yield unintended consequences, such as greater segregation. This does not underscore essential differences between different groups of people but merely the complexity of creating an equal society.
1.1.2.3.3.6.1.1. Pro: School choice, which was intended to empower racial minority parents to be able to "choose" the schools their children attend, increased [voluntary racial segregation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-evidence-on-school-choice-and-racially-segregated-schools/)(\[T\]he pattern of associations reported here is consistent with the hypothesis that school district policies that allow parents to easily choose a school for their children can lead to schools that are more segregated than would be the case if school assignment were based entirely on zip code.\n\n\[T\]here is a lot of evidence that racial/ethnic groups prefer to live in areas in which their own group predominates, and that racial composition is very important when families search for schools. In that context, it would be surprising if school choice, which allows families to act on their preferences for schools, including their racial composition, did not to lead to more self-sorting by race/ethnicity in at least some cases.).
1.1.2.3.3.6.1.2. Pro: In [many](https://www.dw.com/en/tens-of-thousands-protest-against-gay-marriage-in-paris/a-36056358) [countries](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thousands-protest-in-mexico-against-gay-marriage-legalization-1457364), the legalization of gay marriage is followed by protests. This can cause LGBTQ+ community members to "segregate" themselves to create safe spaces for themselves.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2. Pro: The "[gender equality paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-equality_paradox)" has been observed across different psychological dimensions.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1. Con: Studies with findings supporting the gender equality paradox have typically used the [Global Gender Gap Index](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4839696/) \(GGGI\), which is an unreliable and invalid measure of gender equality.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: The [Global Gender Gap Index](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4839696/)(GGI is not only used as a measure of gender equality, but also used as a proxy for the satisfaction of basic needs \[15\]. As an additional and more direct measure of the satisfaction these needs, we also used the United Nations Human Development Index \(HDI, United Nations Development Programme, 2013\). The HDI is a composite measure of a number of indicators of the quality of living conditions, including life expectancy and health, education, and financial means. . . . The HDI and GGI are correlated, r\(35\) = .59, p \< .001. Similarly for the 2012 PISA dataset, the correlation between GGI \(of 57 countries\) and HDI \(of 61 countries\) is similar, r\(55\) = .56, p \< .001.) unduly penalizes poor countries, as evidenced by the fact that it shares a strong correlation with basic need satisfaction.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: The notion that "[WEIRD](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/joseph-henrich-explores-weird-societies/)" countries are more gender equal is ethnocentric.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The inverse correlation is not a paradox but a contradiction. The higher representation of women in STEM in poorer countries is in itself an indicator of greater equality in such countries. That researchers fail to describe it as such and test it against another metric of equality is ethnocentric.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: When researchers use the GGGI without acknowledging the underlying [ethnocentrism](https://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/)(The researchers, from Leeds Beckett University and the University of Missouri, believe this might be because countries with less gender equality often have little welfare support, making the choice of a relatively high-paid STEM career more attractive.), they unfairly \(mis\)attribute the increased representation of women in STEM in poorer countries to extrinsic contributors, such as financial rewards.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Countries with better ranks on the GGGI are more gender unequal.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Gender differences in [mathematics anxiety](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857) are wider in the so-called gender-equal countries than in "gender-unequal" countries.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Gender equal countries have [stronger gender stereotypes](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/31063), especially when it comes to men. These differences explain the so-called gender equality paradox.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.2.3. Con: According to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760), lower basic needs take precedence over higher psychological needs. Within this framework, the GGGI is a fair indicator of gender equality at the lower level of [need satisfaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4839696/).
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Some non-WEIRD countries such as [Rwanda](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/how-rwanda-beats-almost-every-other-country-in-gender-equality/) have a high rank on the GGGI.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Basic need satisfaction is strongly associated with gender inequality, as evidenced by the fact that women are more likely to be adversely affected by poverty and [hunger](https://www.wfpusa.org/women-are-hungrier-infographic/). These trends are so profound that they have been called the [feminization of poverty](https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm).
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.1.2. Con: The GGGI is a reliable and valid measure of gender parity in the domains relevant to those with which the [World Economic Forum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2021.pdf) concerns itself: "Economic participation and opportunity, educational Attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment." What is problematic is researchers' use of this index as a proxy for psychosocial gender inequality.
1.1.2.3.3.6.2.2. Pro: The gender equality paradox proposes that gender differences are wider in "gender equal" societies because, in the absence of [coercive influences](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/02/14/stems-ongoing-sex-difference-debate)(“We hypothesize that men are more likely than women to enter STEM careers because of endogenous interests,” Geary and Stoet wrote. “Societal conditions can change the degree to which exogenous interests influence STEM careers \(e.g., the possibilities of STEM careers to satisfy socio-economic needs\). But when there is an equal playing field and studying STEM is just as useful \(balancing income and career satisfaction\) as a degree in other areas, people are better able to pursue their interests and not simply their future economic needs.”), such as the need to ensure basic need satisfaction, men and women may naturally pursue different interests.
1.1.2.3.3.6.3. Con: The [source](https://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/)(The researchers, from Leeds Beckett University and the University of Missouri, believe this might be because countries with less gender equality often have little welfare support, making the choice of a relatively high-paid STEM career more attractive.) attributes this difference to welfare support rather than gender equality per se. Welfare support can strengthen traditionally sexist gender roles by giving funds to the specific role instead of equalizing it.
1.1.2.4. Con: The city of Boston, which attempted to become the [first city in the US to help women close the gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/13/boston-wants-to-teach-every-woman-in-the-city-to-negotiate-better-pay/) in 2015, would disagree that it is not within the scope of government.
1.1.3. Pro: Across the globe, sexism and gender inequality are [rife](https://www.wionews.com/world/how-governments-and-global-institutions-continue-to-remain-sexist-364630) in governments. Therefore, the government cannot be trusted to fix external problems associated with gender inequality.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Only slightly more than [10% of sovereign nations](https://www.wionews.com/world/how-governments-and-global-institutions-continue-to-remain-sexist-364630)(Out of the 195 sovereign nations in the world, only 21 have women as heads of states or government. 119 countries have never had a woman leader.\n\nConsider all the government ministers who are in office right now. Only 21 per cent of them are women. Only 14 countries have 50 per cent or more women in their cabinet.) have women leaders.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.8.1.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Women in these countries are generally better off than their peers in countries run by men.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Women are grossly [under-represented](https://www.wionews.com/world/how-governments-and-global-institutions-continue-to-remain-sexist-364630)(Consider all the government ministers who are in office right now. Only 21 per cent of them are women. Only 14 countries have 50 per cent or more women in their cabinet.) among government officials.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Women government officials are often assigned roles that are highly [stereotypical](https://www.wionews.com/world/how-governments-and-global-institutions-continue-to-remain-sexist-364630)(There is sexism in governments and it's evident in appointments. Women are often given departments like family, children, social affairs, environment.) of the female sex.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: The [proportion of women](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS) represented in national parliaments globally has been steadily increasing.
1.1.3.3. Con: Sexism and gender inequality are pervasive across all institutions. Requiring an actor to be free of these injustices would rule out every institution and consequently stall efforts to fix the gender gap altogether.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Due to the scale of the government compared to other institutions, it is better equipped to reduce sexism and other injustices, including the gender pay gap.
1.1.3.4. Pro: The government is [not immune](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/mike-causey-federal-report/2020/12/explaining-the-unexplained-reasons-for-the-gender-pay-gap-in-the-federal-workforce/) to the gender pay gap.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: In Britain, men in Parliament are paid on average [10.4% more](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/revealed-mps-gender-pay-gap-glzhtb0g7)(Male MPs earn 10.4% more on average than their female counterparts despite identical basic salaries, exposing the way the gender pay gap in British society runs right to the heart of government.) than their women counterparts despite identical basic salaries.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: The gender pay gap in US government has [narrowed significantly](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-67)(The overall pay gap between men and women in the federal workforce has narrowed considerably, from 19 cents on the dollar in 1999 to 7 cents in 2017, but the current pay gap is greater for certain groups of women, according to GAO's analysis of data from the Office of Personnel Management \(OPM\).) since the 1990s.
1.1.4. Pro: Men, who can be effective allies in the fight against pay disparity, should make more of an effort to tackle the gender pay gap.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Powerful and influential men celebrities, such as [Andy Murray](https://www.si.com/tennis/2019/01/12/andy-murray-retirement-feminism-gender-equality)(He strongly supports equal pay, even calling out fellow male players who believe men deserve a greater share of prize mone; He believes women deserve more leadership positions, including coaching roles; He has criticized tournament scheduling that favors men.) and [Benedict Cumberbatch](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/benedict-cumberbatch-will-only-take-a-job-where-women-are-paid-equally.html)(“Look at your quotas. Ask what women are being paid, and say: ‘If she’s not paid the same as the men, I’m not doing it,’” Cumberbatch said in an interview with Radio Times Sunday while promoting his latest series, “Patrick Melrose.”), have used their voices to draw attention to the gender pay gap and held their fellow male celebrities accountable in the fight against pay disparity.
1.1.4.2. Con: Espousing egalitarian ideals such as equal pay may render men [less attractive](https://www.psypost.org/2018/07/study-finds-women-including-feminists-attracted-benevolently-sexist-men-51693)(\[R\]esearchers found that women perceived a male romantic partner who held benevolent sexist attitudes as more willing to protect, provide, and commit for them, which in turn made him more attractive. Feminist women were as likely as non-feminist women to prefer benevolent sexist men over more egalitarian men.) to women, including feminists. This is tantamount to women punishing men for being an ally.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: As the researchers themselves have noted, what was considered as "[benevolent sexism](https://www.psypost.org/2018/07/study-finds-women-including-feminists-attracted-benevolently-sexist-men-51693)(In the study, benevolent sexist men were described as believing that women should be cherished and protected by men, and should be helped before men in emergency situations. They were also described as giving their coat to a woman in the cold and opening doors for her. . . .\n\n“There is a lot that still needs to be addressed. For instance, do women differentiate between male behavior that is genuinely benevolent and that which is intended to patronise and undermine them?” Gul explained.)" can also be construed as chivalry or kindness. The interpretation that these virtues are opposed to egalitarianism is unfounded.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Whether women find men less attractive for supporting egalitarian ideals is irrelevant; doing the right thing is what matters.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: The frequency with which a woman reportedly orgasms is related to her male partner's wealth. The likely explanation for this relationship is "[reporting bias](https://www.psypost.org/2010/07/wealth-frequency-of-orgasms-in-women-1011)(“Reporting bias can act in two ways, either by women with frequent orgasms overestimating their partner’s income or by women with high-quality mates overreporting their orgasm frequency.”)," meaning that having a rich partner causes women to inflate his ability to make them orgasm.
1.1.4.3. Pro: [President Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/equal-pay) drew the attention of government officials and the public to the issue of pay disparity and instituted several [policies](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-announce-new-rules-closing-gender-pay-gap-n506941)("I know we'll always have a powerful ally in President Obama," she said, adding that "we owe it to our daughters, our granddaughters and ourselves" to ensure the pay gap issue isn't forgotten.) to reduce the pay gap while he was in office.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: The Trump administration later [retracted those policies](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-killed-obama-s-equal-pay-rule-what-it-means-n797941), claiming they "lack practical utility, are unnecessarily burdensome, and do not adequately address privacy and confidentiality issues."
1.1.4.4. Con: If men were effective allies, the men in power in both the public and private sectors would have solved this issue already.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: In a [survey](https://time.com/5562171/pay-gap-survey-equal-pay-day/) conducted in the US, about 50% of the surveyed men denied that the pay gap exists. Men cannot be allies if they do not acknowledge that such a pay gap exists in the first place.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: In the [same survey](https://time.com/5562171/pay-gap-survey-equal-pay-day/)(\[R\]espondents were asked what they saw as major reasons for the pay gap. Women were more likely to cite unconscious bias and sexism, while men were more likely to say it was because women work fewer hours than men and are “generally in careers that don’t pay as much.”\n\nWhen asked what they thought of the fact that women were paid less than men for similar types of work, 71% of women characterized it as “very unfair,” compared to 48% of men. While a majority of women \(62%\) said that there are still significant obstacles that make it harder for women to get ahead, a majority of men \(58%\) said that obstacles that may have made it harder for women to get ahead in past are now “largely gone.”), men were also more likely to undermine the unfairness of the pay gap and attribute it factors other than systemic and implicit biases.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Looking at the glass half-full, more than 50% is still a considerable proportion of the population and implies that every other man is a potential ally for women in the fight against pay disparity.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Con: The corresponding figure for [women](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/46percent-of-american-men-think-the-gender-pay-gap-is-made-up.html) is only slightly less dismal: 30%.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: Powerful men in the public sphere, such as celebrities, cannot single-handedly solve this issue, when equally famous women celebrities do not even want to [acknowledge or discuss](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/11/kate-winslet-the-gender-pay-gap-debate-is-a-bit-vulgar)(The Oscar-winning actor addressed Hollywood inequality after the issue has gathered steam thanks to other stars, such as Jennifer Lawrence, Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep, venting their frustration.\n\n“I’m having such a problem with these conversations,” she said to BBC Newsbeat. “I understand why they are coming up but maybe it’s a British thing. I don’t like talking about money; it’s a bit vulgar isn’t it?”\n\nShe went on to discuss why she believes it’s an inappropriate topic to talk about in interviews.) the pay gap in the first place.
1.1.5. Con: The government is the only organization with the power and mandate to influence societal issues broadly.
1.1.5.1. Con: The government may have the power to enact regulatory policies, but their effectiveness will ultimately be determined by the extent of compliance and implementation by businesses themselves.
1.1.5.2. Pro: One of the best ways to improve gender equality is by enacting [laws, policies, and regulations](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth)(Six types of intervention are necessary to bridge the gender gap: financial incentives and support; technology and infrastructure; the creation of economic opportunity; capability building; advocacy and shaping attitudes; and laws, policies, and regulations. We identify some 75 potential interventions that could be evaluated and tailored to suit the social and economic context of each impact zone and country. Tackling gender inequality will require change within businesses as well as new coalitions. The private sector will need to play a more active role in concert with governments and nongovernmental organizations, and companies could benefit both directly and indirectly by taking action.).
1.1.5.2.1. Con: The existence of the pay gap despite the adoption of laws protecting equal opportunities suggests that governmental intervention may not be adequately effective in effecting the kind of change required.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.1.5.2.1.2. Con: [Some measures, policies, and trends](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/04/429825/international-approaches-closing-gender-wage-gap/) adopted by governments around the world have helped attenuate the pay gap.
1.1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Iceland is considered a model nation when it comes to [equal-pay legislation](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/04/429825/international-approaches-closing-gender-wage-gap/)(In March 2017, Iceland took its efforts to close the gender wage gap even further: It became the first country in the world to introduce legislation requiring companies to prove that they pay men and women equally. By 2022, employers with more than 25 employees would have to undergo audits to certify that they are complying with equal pay laws. Proponents of the legislation hope that by strengthening enforcement of existing laws, the new legislation will close the gap in five years.); yet, the [pay gap has](https://www.statice.is/publications/news-archive/wages-and-income/unadjusted-genger-pay-gap-2019/) persisted. Thus, governmental intervention may only be able to do so much when it comes to closing the pay gap.
1.1.5.2.1.2.2. Con: When compared to the pay gap, there are [issues that more actively harm women](https://www.who.int/news/item/09-03-2021-devastatingly-pervasive-1-in-3-women-globally-experience-violence)(Violence against women remains devastatingly pervasive and starts alarmingly young, shows new data from WHO and partners. Across their lifetime, 1 in 3 women, around 736 million, are subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence from a non-partner – a number that has remained largely unchanged over the past decade.) \(e.g., domestic violence and sexual assault\) worldwide. Therefore, governments should prioritize these issues over and beyond the pay gap, which has already attenuated considerably.
1.1.5.2.1.2.3. Pro: [Differences](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/04/429825/international-approaches-closing-gender-wage-gap/) in the [pay gap](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/genderwagegap.htm) between countries like South Korea, \(36.6%\), the US \(17.91%\), and the UK \(17.48%\) and countries with a lower pay gap like [New Zealand](https://www.employment.govt.nz/hours-and-wages/pay/pay-equity/gender-pay-gap/) \(5.6%\) indicate that [government policies](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/about-us/mfat-annual-report-2017-2018/case-study-gender-pay-gap/) likely have a profound effect.
1.1.5.2.1.2.4. Pro: In Denmark, a country with a [lower gender pay gap](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/genderwagegap.htm) than the US, the UK or Germany, "the Equal Pay Act 2014 fines businesses with more than 10 employees if they fail to comply with [gender audits](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/04/429825/international-approaches-closing-gender-wage-gap/) of their own workforce".
1.1.5.2.1.2.5. Pro: In OECD countries where [gender-responsive budgeting](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/04/429825/international-approaches-closing-gender-wage-gap/) has largely been implemented in recent decades, that is “explicitly encouraging countries to incorporate working women’s needs and interests into their budgets,” the pay gap has, on average, [decreased](https://www.oecd.org/gender/Gender-Budgeting-in-OECD-countries.pdf) from 2000 to 2013 \(Figure 1A, p. 35\).
1.1.5.2.1.2.6. Pro: Research suggests that inclusive and gender-equal markets are achievable through key legal, collective and voluntary [measures](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_540889.pdf), including salary transparency, improving workers' rights, measures to make family and work more compatible and increased support for working parents.
1.1.5.2.2. Pro: Governments can institute gender-based taxation to compensate for pay disparities \([p. 11](https://www.oecd.org/els/42029340.pdf)(Gender Based Taxation generates more equality in labor market outcomes and closes the gender gap in labor supply, training and wages. This shows that GBT can poten-tially substitute if not for all, then certainly for most of other gender based policies,such as gender based affirmative action, quotas, wage subsidies, child care subsidies,and maternal leaves, that are geared towards improving gender equity, and at a lower cost since the improvement in government finances is exclusive to our proposal.)\).
1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Gender-based taxation is outright sex-based discrimination \([p. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4845450_Against_%27Gender-based_taxation%27)\).
1.1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Gender-based taxation would not be discriminatory if it entails offering tax relief to women rather than increasing the taxes paid by men.
1.1.5.2.2.1.2. Con: Tax structures are often [progressive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp)(A progressive tax is based on the taxpayer's ability to pay. It imposes a lower tax rate on low-income earners than on those with a higher income. This is usually achieved by creating tax brackets that group taxpayers by income ranges.\n\nThe income tax system in the U.S. is considered a progressive system, although it has been growing flatter in recent decades. For 2022, there are only seven tax brackets, with rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. There were 16 tax brackets in 1985), meaning that lower income slabs entail lower tax liability. Thus, since women earn less than their male counterparts, it is only fair that they receive tax relief or rebate.
1.1.5.2.2.1.3. Con: In countries such as India, tax liability already varies based on the taxpayer's [age](https://cleartax.in/s/income-tax-slabs)(Indian Income tax levies tax on individual taxpayers on the basis of a slab system. Slab system means different tax rates are prescribed for different ranges of income. It means the tax rates keep increasing with an increase in the income of the taxpayer. This type of taxation enables progressive and fair tax systems in the country. Such income tax slabs tend to undergo a change during every budget.These slab rates are different for different categories of taxpayers. Income tax has classified three categories of “individual “taxpayers such as:\n\n- Individuals \(aged less than of 60 years\) including residents and non-residents\n- Resident Senior citizens \(60 to 80 years of age\)\n- Resident Super senior citizens \(aged more than 80 years\)) and [socioeconomic status](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/whats-keeping-indias-poor-poor-this-triple-tax-on-rich-could-be-the-solution-oxfam-interview/1865456/)(While tax on wealth and inheritance is a popular concept in Western countries with heavyweights such as Bill Gates backing the idea, it hasn’t gained much ground in India. However, a trio of wealth tax, inheritance tax and higher income tax could hold the key to solving India’s inequality issue, according to Amitabh Behar, Chief Executive Officer, Oxfam India. Oxfam International releases its annual report on inequality each year. India has performed poorly in this year’s report with 1% of India’s richest population having four times more wealth than 70% of the country’s poorest. The government can help the most underprivileged of its citizens by investing in them and keeping their needs in mind instead of just looking out for a handful of people, Amitabh Behar added. Edited excerpts of Amitabh Behar’s conversation with Shaleen Agarwal.). Since this is not considered discrimination, there is no reason why gender-based taxation should be considered as such either.
1.1.5.2.2.1.4. Pro: A [tax on men](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/snow-white-doesnt-live-here-anymore/201111/why-women-should-pay-lower-taxes) would violate the basic rights of men.
1.1.5.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: A man tax would discriminate on the basis of an immutable characteristic and punish men whose incomes do not contribute to the pay gap.
1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Existing tax systems unduly penalize women \([p. 1](https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/44896295.pdf)(The importance of gender equality and taxation, taken individually, has been widely acknowledged. However, they have rarely been discussed together and potential and existing links have largely been ignored in development cooperation. In order to promote sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, development efforts must ensure that policy interventions in the area of taxation do not negatively affect desired outcomes in the area of gender equality. For instance, efforts in practice to increase female labour force participation may be thwarted by tax policies that are motivated by objectives entirely unrelated to gender issues. As well may the way a government raises revenues have a different impact on women and men. Mainstreaming a gender equality perspective into general tax policy analysis can significantly improve the quality of public policy.)\).
1.1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Most women lack access to the tax deductions that are disproportionately claimed by men \([p. 2](https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/44896295.pdf)(With respect to direct taxation, eliminating tax exemptions in the corporate and personal income tax may also encourage gender equality in terms of the tax burden because men tend to benefit disproportionately from such exemptions. This is mainly due to the fact that they are more likely to run a business, be a share-holder or be a house-owner who can claim these deductions.)\).
1.1.5.2.2.2.2. Con: Many of the listed penalties are attributable to implicit biases involving women's social roles, norms, and status. These implicit biases necessitate societal change more than tax reform.
1.1.5.2.3. Con: Laws on equality already exist to ensure equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcome. The pay gap is evidence of inequality of outcome, not evidence of inequality of opportunity.
1.1.5.2.3.1. Con: Something being made illegal does not imply that what has been outlawed does not exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: The objective of instituting laws, penalties, fines, and jail time is to discourage the outlawed practices, not eliminate them. Without such laws, there would be no means to redress the situation.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: There are [documented](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/14/gender-discrimination-comes-in-many-forms-for-todays-working-women/)(About four-in-ten working women \(42%\) in the United States say they have faced discrimination on the job because of their gender. They report a broad array of personal experiences, ranging from earning less than male counterparts for doing the same job to being passed over for important assignments, according to a new analysis of Pew Research Center survey data.) cases of discrimination, and many go undetected, despite legislation prohibiting such actions.
1.1.5.2.3.1.3. Pro: Many [corporate crimes](https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/top100.html)(Every year, the major business magazines put out their annual surveys of big business in America.\n\nYou have the Fortune 500, the Forbes 400, the Forbes Platinum 100, the International 800 -- among others.\n\nThese lists rank big corporations by sales, assets, profits and market share. The point of these surveys is simple -- to identify and glorify the biggest and most profitable corporations.\n\nThe point of the list contained in this report, The Top 100 Corporate Criminals of the Decade -- is to focus public attention on a wave of corporate criminality that has swamped prosecutors offices around the country.) and [illegal labor-related activities](https://www.unionfacts.com/article/unfair-labor-practices/)(When most people think of labor law violations, they probably think of “Big Business.” But employees, employers, and labor organizations file thousands of charges each year called Unfair Labor Practices against unions and union officials.\n\nAn Unfair Labor Practice \(ULP\) occurs when a union or an employer violates Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. Union members commonly file ULPs against their union because the union failed to fairly represent its members. Employees also file ULPs against union leaders for intimidation, coercion, violence, and many other labor law violations.) and practices \(e.g., tax evasion, hiring undocumented immigrants, and paying less than the minimum wage\) occur despite the existence of laws prohibiting them.
1.1.5.2.3.2. Con: Certain labor practices are legal, yet some people find them unjust.
1.1.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: Americans are widely considered to have too few days of vacation, yet employer-sponsored time off is [not a legal requirement](https://www.grid.news/story/politics/2022/09/01/americans-are-terrible-at-taking-vacations-why-are-us-workers-so-bad-at-taking-time-off/)(The United States still has no federal paid vacation policy, making it one of only a handful of countries without guaranteed paid annual leave. Canada and Japan are also among the countries with the least paid annual leave, the report said, at 10 days each. Both countries, however, require employers to offer more vacation based on seniority.\n\nThe U.S. is also the only country within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development — an intergovernmental organization composed of 38 member countries promoting global trade — without a paid annual leave policy, according to “No Vacation Nation,” a 2019 report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.).
1.1.5.2.3.2.2. Pro: Employers are free to pay as much as the market allows; however, many people are paid [less than they're worth](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220204-the-salary-ignorance-that-keeps-many-workers-underpaid)(According to a recent study, most people significantly underestimate what people are earning in similar jobs elsewhere. The researchers argue this holds back people from seeking better paid jobs or higher pay for their current role, and that it particularly disadvantages the lowest earners. They suggest that if workers were more aware of salary disparities, at least 10% of low-paying jobs would simply not be viable at current pay rates. \n\[...\]\nAlthough people are increasingly aware of the benefits of salary transparency, particularly as a means of reducing the gender pay gap, in general we remain reluctant to talk about pay openly. There are also powerful reasons people don’t seek out salary information. Yet, it’s clear that in many cases, it would be to our advantage to be more informed about pay. With workers in greater demand than ever amid the upheavals of the pandemic, developing a little more salary curiosity could well pay dividends.), despite being above minimum wage.
1.1.5.2.3.3. Pro: Governments should protect women from inequalities in opportunities and treatment, not from inequalities in outcomes which could result from factors other than bias.
1.1.5.2.3.3.1. Con: The contention that inequality underlies the gender pay gap is supported by the systematic decreases in pay that accompany membership to a higher number of traditionally marginalized and disadvantaged groups.
1.1.5.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: Men enjoy a [pay increase](https://www.fastcompany.com/90450227/unemployed-men-who-take-traditionally-female-jobs-make-more-money)(Men who enter female-dominated jobs experience, on average, a 4% wage increase and significant boosts to the prestige of their job relative to their previous job before unemployment.\n\nIn contrast, men who entered male-dominated jobs or jobs that had an equal balance of men and women either maintained or lost ground in wages and occupational prestige. Examples of mixed-gender jobs include claims adjusters, property managers, and retail salespersons.) when they enter a women-dominated field. Conversely, when there is an increase in the percentage of women in a men-dominated sector, the wages are likely to [drop](https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2016/03/when-an-occupation-becomes-female-dominated-pay-declines)(During any debate about the gender pay gap, one argument will eventually emerge: women make less than men because they choose lower-paying jobs. But what if it turns out that women aren’t so much choosing low-paying jobs as working at jobs that are low-paid precisely because there are more women in those occupations? If that sounds far-fetched, one study, recently discussed at The Upshot in The New York Times, might change your mind. Researchers analyzed 50 years of U.S. Census data and found that pay drops when professions move from predominantly male to female – in short, if women do a job, it’s likely to be low-paid, for no other reason than that women’s work is undervalued.).
1.1.5.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: There are [racial](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryannreid/2019/08/22/black-women-are-paid-less-than-white-women-heres-why-it-matters/)(Much of the talk around gender pay centers on the fact that white men earn more than women overall. But the bigger, often overlooked, question is why black women are paid 21% less than white women.\n\nWhen we look at the challenges some black women face at work, knowing that a white female counterpart may be earning more for the same skills and education, getting paid less can pose a major concern. This can lead to black women distrusting their white female coworkers and feeling like their work is not valued. Looking deeply into studies that examine the gap between these black and white women exclusively is a challenge, as there are few. With the increasing numbers of black women earning degrees and entering management positions, this gap begs exploration. Black women also lose over $800,000 in lifetime earnings over the course of a career.) [disparities](https://leanin.org/data-about-the-gender-pay-gap-for-black-women)(Over the course of the average Black woman’s career, the lost income adds up to almost a million dollars compared to white men. \[...\] The average Black woman’s net worth is less than 1% of the average white man’s.) in the gender pay gap.
1.1.5.2.3.3.1.3. Pro: The gender pay gap is [wider](https://www.macleans.ca/society/for-transgender-women-the-pay-equity-gap-is-even-wider/)(About half of transgender individuals earn $15,000 or less per year, even though 71 per cent have some level of post-secondary education.) among [LGBTQ+](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2012/04/16/11494/the-gay-and-transgender-wage-gap/)(The Williams Institute finds that gay and bisexual men earn 10 percent to 32 percent less than similarly qualified heterosexual men, in a meta-analysis of 12 studies examining earnings and sexual orientation in the United States.

1.1.5.2.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: The salary for [trans women](https://www.macleans.ca/society/for-transgender-women-the-pay-equity-gap-is-even-wider/)(Ample evidence demonstrates a clear reduction in the earning power of the transgender community. About half of transgender individuals earn $15,000 or less per year, even though 71 per cent have some level of post-secondary education, according to the widely cited 2011 Trans PULSE survey conducted by Toronto’s Sherbourne Health Centre. The same survey found only 37 per cent of respondents were employed full-time, while the National Transgender Discrimination Survey in the U.S. found that trans people experience double the rate of unemployment compared to the general population. And while some female-to-male transgender workers earn more after their transition, male-to-female transgender workers can see their earnings drop by nearly a third, says research published in the B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy.) decreases by nearly a third once they transition.
1.1.5.2.3.3.1.3.2. Con: [Lesbian women](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/25/the-surprising-reason-why-lesbians-get-paid-more-than-straight-women/)(Evidence for the wife \(or husband\) penalty shows up in what researchers call the “lesbian wage premium.” Across years of research, women who have never lived with a male partner make more money than women who have.\n\nLast year, Marieka Klawitter, professor of public policy at the University of Washington, examined 29 studies across the Western Hemisphere on wages and sexual orientation and found a 9 percent earnings premium for lesbians over heterosexual women. \(Gay men, meanwhile, faced an 11 percent penalty, compared to straight men.\)) earn more than straight women, particularly if they have never lived with a man before.
1.1.5.2.3.3.1.4. Con: If the gender pay gap is compounded by factors such as systemic and implicit racism and homophobia, tackling gender bias and sexism alone would not be sufficient in closing the disparity.
1.1.5.2.3.3.2. Con: Inequality in outcomes is partially a result of devaluing the kind of work women do, such as teaching, which is demanding but [paid poorly](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/why-teachers-salaries-are-so-low-in-the-us.html)(According to the Economic Policy Institute, teachers make about 20% less than other college-educated workers with similar experience.).
1.1.5.2.3.3.3. Pro: Differential outcomes leading to differential treatment is the basis of meritocracy. On the contrary, seeking equality of outcomes is unfair because it fails to take into account performance or to reward behaviors beneficial to the employer.
1.1.5.2.4. Pro: The [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/policy/#race-and-gender-equity)(For too long, ordinary Americans have missed out on the gains of a growing economy. This wasn’t an accident. Policy choices allowed the rich to capture much more than their fair share of American income growth.

1.1.5.2.5. Pro: Policies that create and promote new careers that cater directly to the career preferences of women can be instituted.
1.1.5.2.5.1. Pro: Present-day industry evolved alongside the labor of a predominantly male workforce. Therefore, more careers cater to the career preferences of men rather than women.
1.1.5.2.5.1.1. Con: During the labor shortages provoked by WWII, women seamlessly took over roles on factory floors in typically male-dominated industries, including as precision toolmakers, lumberjacks, and crane operators \([p. 235](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/216507998703500508)(Women have always participated in physically strenuous work. When our\nsociety was largely rural and agrarian, women labored on farms. During World\nWar II, women were encouraged to participate in the labor force, often in traditionally male-dominated occupations. These examples are often used to exemplify women's endurance. According to one author, "Women have demonstrated – most notably in factories during World War II, the capacity to perform skilled and taxing physical work" \(Lebowitz, 1982, p. 53\). It was during this time that women became precision toolmakers, overhead crane operators, lumberjacks, and drill press operators.)\).
1.1.5.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: The flexibility, physical aptitude, and willingness demonstrated by women in taking on these roles suggest that women are more than capable of evolving; the workplace should follow suit.
1.1.5.2.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.3.7.1.3.
1.1.5.2.5.1.2. Pro: Because the workforce used to consist only of men, offices did not have spaces \(e.g., [restrooms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/number-of-women-in-workforce-on-the-rise-but-toilet-facilities-for-them-not-keeping-pace/articleshow/40723667.cms?from=mdr)(In the past, companies routinely refused to hire women on the grounds they didn’t have toilet facilities for them.)\) that accommodated the needs of women. This allowed recruiters to deny women jobs.
1.1.5.3. Pro: In the United States, the federal government was the [first entity to employ women](https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Womens-History-Month-Civil-War.aspx) in an official capacity during the Civil War.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: This government intervention [helped bring women into the workforce](https://www.britannica.com/video/195098/some-roles-women-spies-American-Civil-War)(Now not every woman who participated in the Civil War had to leave their town or their farm. Women took over businesses. They took over the running of their farms while their men were away at war. This was a huge step forward in the march for women's independence, because their actions during the war-- in running the family business, in running the family farm, in getting the crops out of the field-- showed that women were capable and could do more than Victorian society had previously guessed.) across the country as the industrial revolution took off.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: Many women were shut out of the workforce in the late 1800's as their [sexuality represented far too much temptation](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/167879)(Later events in the Treasury Department, including an 1864 sex scandal that garnered national attention, eventually led to what may have been the first attempt to curb workplace sexual harassment, but also helped give birth to the prevailing national stereotype that all female federal employees were sexually immoral. Today, women continue to be harassed at work and in the streets by men who view their mere presence as a solicitation for male attention and while laws now exist to protect women, laws only do so if they are effectively enforced and victims are believed.) for the men.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: In one fell swoop, the federal government began to employ women and simultaneously [created the gender pay gap](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1869/02/18/79386020.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0) by fixing the salaries of women to 50% of the lowest pay grade for men.
1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The women, employed by the Treasury Department to cut and finish newly printed currency, were not given a pay grade and paid just $600, [50% less than their male counterparts](https://www.fastcompany.com/90609641/the-long-and-frustrating-history-of-the-gender-wage-gap)(There were plenty of white women clamoring for work \(remember, at this point in history many Black women were still enslaved\), so the supply of candidates greatly exceeded demand. This only partly explains why women were paid $600 per year \(which works out to roughly $15,500 today, adjusting for inflation\)—about half of what men doing the same job were earning.).
1.1.5.3.2.2. Pro: The Secretary of the Treasury under President Lincoln stated that he had three women clerks who [carried out the same tasks just as well](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1869/02/18/79386020.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0) as their male counterparts who were paid three times as much.
1.1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: When questioned why he wouldn't compensate those women with the same salaries as the men, he responded saying that "[public opinion would not justify him, even if the laws permitted](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1869/02/18/79386020.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0)."
1.1.5.4. Con: [The UN](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/global-norms-and-standards)(Global Norms and Standards: Economic Empowerment\n\nA number of internationally agreed norms and standards relate to women’s economic empowerment.

A government policy mandating these practices across all companies could help resolve the pay gap.
1.1.5.6. Con: Advocates of government intervention have proposed quotas to increase or equalize the representation of women in traditionally men-dominated arenas. However, quotas are [largely immoral](https://www.ifa.com.au/opinion/17874-gender-quotas-are-immoral) and violate human rights.
1.1.5.6.1. Pro: Quotas are detrimental to women.
1.1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Quotas could create doubt in the mind of the newly hired employee, lowering their self-confidence while they question whether or not they belong.
1.1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: Women could also be emboldened by the opportunity and eager to prove themselves worthy of the position, regardless of whether they were hired to meet the quota or not.
1.1.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: Coworkers may look down on "[diversity hires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ruchikatulshyan/2016/10/18/what-to-do-when-youre-called-a-diversity-hire/?sh=2c07ae44d5ab)("Someone at work implied I only got this great job because I'm a 'diversity hire.' What should I do?" I was asked this question recently after I spoke on a panel about gender equality for women in science. The woman who posed the question was a research scientist at a prestigious university. "I've been subtly told by a peer that I probably got this coveted job because I checked two diversity boxes; female and Hispanic," she explained. "It's making me doubt myself even though I have a PhD.")," which could render them vulnerable to experiencing imposter syndrome.
1.1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Quotas could worsen jealousy and rivalries and [create intra-office conflicts](https://www.ifa.com.au/opinion/17874-gender-quotas-are-immoral)(Quotas tear at the fabric of an organisation's culture.\n\n“Is she here because she's good or because we need to get our quota up?” You might not hear people actually say this, but you can be damn sure they'll be thinking it.) between women who may have benefited from the quota system and their men colleagues, who could feel jilted by the system.
1.1.5.6.1.3. Con: There are many institutions and spaces, such as politics, from which women remain excluded by those with decision-making power. Quotas are essential to ensure that women [enter these spaces](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas) and [achieve gender equality](https://www.oecd.org/social/quotas-gender-equality.htm).
1.1.5.6.1.4. Con: Even if quotas are not mandated, organizations are increasingly being incentivized to [ensure diversity](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/), which is essentially just a more fluidly defined quota system.
1.1.5.6.1.5. Con: [Talented women exist](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/can-quotas-help-tackle-the-confidence-gender-gap/)(Despite glaring and persistent inequities in its corporate culture, Norway still had a surprisingly rich cache of talented women executives.

Quotas exert the pressure that is necessary for organizations to ensure that they are afforded an opportunity to excel in their chosen fields.
1.1.5.6.2. Con: [Quotas are necessary](https://www.oecd.org/social/quotas-gender-equality.htm)(Quotas in the business world can put an end to the “old boys” networks and ensure that qualified women are no longer denied access to management positions because of their gender. The quotas are by definition temporary measures, aimed at eradicating an inequality that has built up over time. Once that is done, the quotas will be lifted in accordance with the principle of equal treatment as it is interpreted by international courts of human rights.) because, in their absence, men have been reserving most if not all seats in positions of power for themselves. Excluding half of humanity from privileged spaces is more immoral and a more egregious human rights violation.
1.1.5.6.2.1. Pro: Hiring decisions are often guided by implicit biases, which can lead recruiters to prefer men candidates over women candidates with [identical](https://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474)(Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science.

Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the \(identical\) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student.) skill, knowledge, and experience levels.
1.1.5.6.3. Con: Allowing equally qualified and meritorious women to be denied raises and promotions because of implicit biases and discrimination is immoral; quotas counteract such mechanisms \([p. 8](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_540889.pdf)(The measures for inclusivity provide the framework in which gender specific measures \(see table 3\) may be more effective, in part as they may not need to be so intensive. The measures identified include gender pay audits which, if appropriately conducted, should expose the whole range of processes that generate gender pay gaps, from job grading to starting salaries, additional payments, pay and grade progression etc. Job evaluation can be used to address issues of the valuation of women’s work and measures such as mandatory gender quotas on promotion and selection committees can improve progression and access to jobs and limit the influence of gender stereotyping \(including stereotyping of mothers \(Grimshaw and Rubery 2015\).)\).
1.1.5.6.4. Pro: Quotas [violate the right](https://news.sky.com/story/cheshire-police-man-rejected-for-job-for-being-white-and-straight-tribunal-finds-11645525)(A man was denied his dream job in the police "simply because he was a white, heterosexual male", his lawyers said after Cheshire Police was found guilty of discrimination.\n\nMatthew Furlong, who hoped to follow in the footsteps of his father - a serving detective inspector in the same police force - had applied to join in 2017.\n\nThe 25-year-old passed the interview stage and said he was told "it was refreshing to meet someone as well prepared as yourself" and that he "could not have done any more".\n\nHowever, the applicant - who studied particle physics and cosmology at Lancaster University - was later told he lost out to other candidates, prompting his father to file a complaint.) to be judged independently of gender, which can be overturned in a court of law.

1.1.6. Con: Government intervention, such as legislation, has been necessary in resolving other matters of discrimination, such as race-based discrimination.
1.1.6.1. Con: Just because the government was involved in resolving other types of discrimination does not prove that its intervention was necessary or positive.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Without government intervention, [Jim Crow segregation](https://www.thenation.com/article/do-we-need-government-fight-discrimination/) would still be holding back Black domestic workers in the US.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Prior to overturning the Jim Crow laws in 1954, government intervention was [inherently responsible](https://time.com/5527029/jim-crow-plessy-history/) for the original "separate but equal" segregation.
1.1.6.3. Pro: The [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) was necessary to protect Americans against discrimination based on race, gender, or nationality. Without it, many Americans would be denied an education, voting rights, and even housing.
1.1.6.4. Con: The government was often the [cause](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america) of racial discrimination.
1.1.6.5. Con: There is a difference between outlawing discrimination and forcing companies to seek gender parity. This fundamental difference makes compelled action-oriented laws a false equivalence to anti-discrimination laws.
1.2. Pro: Governments are responsible for fixing inequities in all domains, including the pay gap.
1.2.1. Pro: Governments have a responsibility to all of their citizens to ensure that their opportunities and rights are not dictated by their gender.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Gender discrimination in the employment market means that the labor force does not operate at its maximum potential.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The [World Economic Forum](https://www.mindjet.com/blog/2013/04/gender-equality-and-productivity/) describes a strong correlation between competitiveness and how a country educates and uses its women's talent, asserting that "empowering women means a more efficient use of a nation’s human talent" and that "reducing gender inequality enhances productivity and economic growth."
1.2.1.1.2. Con: If private firms operate below their potential productivity or sacrifice the competitive advantages stemming from hiring the most qualified labor to pursue irrational bias, then such inefficiency would lead to diminished profitability, commercial viability, and market role.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Corporations are not necessarily rational actors that have awareness of the role and ramifications of implicit biases and access to all hireable populations. This is demonstrated by the fact that businesses that use gender-blind recruitment strategies [hire more women](https://hbr.org/2020/03/research-to-reduce-gender-bias-anonymize-job-applications)(As the existence of gender, race, and other biases becomes more widely acknowledged, many organizations are “blinding” their talent selection systems. Whether in a hiring process or an application for funding or other opportunities, there is some suggestions that anonymizing details about the applicant — removing their name, for example — leads to the selection of more candidates from underrepresented groups.\n\n\[...\]\n\nOur recently published research confirms that anonymizing can mitigate gender bias in the review of scientific research applications. Specifically, we found that when indications of candidates’ gender \(such as their first name\) were removed from applications for time on the Hubble Space Telescope, women were selected at a higher rate than when their gender was obvious.).
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.6.2.1.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: An Australian government-funded study with over 2500 candidates found that, when identifying characteristics were removed in a blind CV evaluation, the likelihood that a woman would be selected for an interview dropped by [roughly 3%](https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/projects/unconscious-bias.pdf)(\[I\]f applications were de-identified, we could expect that the likelihood of any female candidate being shortlisted would fall by 2.9%, on average, while likelihood of any male candidate being shortlisted would go up by 3.2%.).
1.2.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: With the identifying characteristics of [job applicants](https://www.cnet.com/news/when-tech-firms-judge-on-skills-alone-women-land-more-job-interviews/)(In blind auditions, candidates' identifying details are stripped away and employers judge on qualifications alone -- gender, race or even where applicants went to school aren't part of the hiring calculus.\n\nOn two different occasions, Speak With a Geek presented the same 5,000 candidates to the same group of employers. The first time around, details like names, experience and background were provided. Five percent selected for interviews were women.\n\nYou can guess what happened next, right? When identifying details were suppressed, that figure jumped to 54 percent.) added to resumes, just 5% of women in a recent study were selected for interviews. When resumes had the candidate names and other identifying characteristics removed, the figure jumped to 54%.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The cited study [was debunked](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232762/gender-diversity-tech-bad-research-recruiting-new-york-times)("In a 2016 experiment conducted by the tech recruiting firm Speak With a Geek, 5,000 résumés with identical information were submitted to firms.

1.2.1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: [Software programs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2018/04/03/the-benefits-and-shortcomings-of-blind-hiring-in-the-recruitment-process/?sh=4a311f2a38a3)(Silicon Valley entrepreneur Kedar Iyer created a software company called GapJumpers based on the same principle.

GapJumpers has since been used more than 1,400 times and company numbers suggest that compared to standard resume screening, its use increases the chances of minority and female applicants being offered a first-round job interview by around 40%.) that mask candidate identity reduce bias and increase the representation of women in men-dominated fields, like coding.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Job placement is not optimal if factors other than talent and ability, such as gender, are dictating who gets the job.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Gender bias has been [proven](https://gender.stanford.edu/news-publications/gender-news/why-does-john-get-stem-job-rather-jennifer)(Scientific objectivity and the cool assessment of facts are the hallmarks of the science, technology, engineering, and math \(STEM\) disciplines. So, of course, stereotypes have no place in these research labs and university departments. Or so you might think. But, when evaluating identical resumes, scientists may be significantly less likely to agree to mentor, offer jobs, or recommend equal salaries to a candidate if the name at the top of the resume is Jennifer, rather than John.\n\nCorinne Moss-Racusin, a social psychologist at Skidmore College, recently spoke at the Stanford University School of Medicine to describe her research on gender bias among STEM faculty, including an experiment that had scientists evaluate identical resumes of a candidate named either “Jennifer” or “John.” Moss-Racusin has devoted her career to understanding how implicit gender bias can lead to discrimination against women and men, especially in the workplace.) in the hiring of STEM students, who outearn their non-STEM counterparts \([p. 1](https://web.wpi.edu/Images/CMS/Business/HighDemandforSTEM.PDF)(As a group, STEM-educated \nworkers–those trained in \nscience, technology, engineering \nor mathematics–are in greater \ndemand and are making higher \nsalaries than other workers, but not \nall STEM jobs are created equal.)\).
1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Because of unconscious biases, STEM professors end up offering a [higher pay](https://ww3.aauw.org/2015/06/11/john-or-jennifer/)(Female and male science faculty members alike offered John a higher salary than they did Jennifer and were more willing to offer him mentoring opportunities.) to men candidates than to women candidates, despite their resumes being identical.
1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Within the tech industry, [gender-blind](https://www.bustle.com/articles/188243-gender-blind-job-applications-result-in-more-women-hired-theyre-one-part-of-the-solution-to) recruitment is effective in removing unconscious biases. This suggests that the pay gap \(at least within STEM\) can be rectified without government intervention.
1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Longitudinal studies have found that the [confidence gap](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30303) between women and men STEM graduates explains the pay gap in this sector.
1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.3.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Equal pay ensures that men and women have equal opportunities to be successful at work.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Women's career progress is stunted following childbirth in a phenomenon commonly known as "[the motherhood penalty](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleyzalis/2019/02/22/the-motherhood-penalty-why-were-losing-our-best-talent-to-caregiving/?sh=7825213746e5)(When women in the workplace talk about their children, they’re often seen as distracted. When men talk about their children, they’re viewed as caring dads. New research supports that the “motherhood penalty” is real: The latest Bright Horizons’ annual Modern Family Index found that:\n\n- 69% of working Americans say working moms are more likely to be passed up for a new job than other employees\n\n- 60% say career opportunities are given to less qualified employees instead of working moms who may be more skilled\n\n- 72% of both working moms and dads agree that women are penalized in their careers for starting families, while men are not)". Equal pay could counteract this trend.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Equal pay allows men to be stay-at-home fathers, because women can provide for the family.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Being dependent on someone else's income is always a form of domination, irrespective of whether the dependent party is a man or woman. This is not a desirable outcome for men or women.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Being unemployed](https://whatworkswellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Gender-and-unemployment-report_0157592800.pdf) \(p. 10\) may have a more damaging effect on men than on women, because of social norms that dictate that men should provide for their families.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Financial independence and security are [worthwhile goals](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/argument-for-couples-keeping-their-financial-independence.html) for both men and women. Earning their own incomes facilitates the achievement of this goal.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: [Many men](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2014/11/06/many-more-men-say-they-want-to-be-stay-at-home-dads-than-actually-are/) and [women](https://time.com/4068559/gallup-poll-stay-at-home-mothers/) desire to be stay-at-home parents.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: A number of women become stay-at-home moms not due to some inherent desire, but because they have very few alternatives; "for many, leaving the home would [cost more](https://time.com/4068559/gallup-poll-stay-at-home-mothers/)(So, we stay home. Not necessarily because we want to stay home, but because we would rather do this than all the groundwork it takes to do that, only to be told over and over again that we’re still not good enough.) than staying."
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Specialisation and cooperation is an effective way for couples to enhance their shared resources.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5. Con: Being dependent on someone else's income is not necessarily domination. People who benefit from charity, and children - who receive free housing and meals from their parents - would not be considered dominated.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Those dependent on charities and children represent some of the most vulnerable sections of our society, as they depend on the mercy of their parents and benefactors for survival.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: To the extent that women are dependent on their husbands for income, men are also dependent on their wives for the roles they play in running a home. Thus, this is a case of mutual dependence, not domination.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The [widowhood effect](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/the-widowhood-effect-a-spouse-dies-then-soon-another/)(Harvard sociologists say men are 22 percent more likely to die shortly after the death of a spouse, compared with 17 percent for women.) is more pronounced for men than for women. Thus, men appear to be more dependent on women within the context of romantic relationships.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: Not all romantic unions are based on mutual understanding. In an abusive marriage, a woman without an income is left with little to no resources to even seek the legal help she needs to end her marriage.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Many men](https://workplaceinsight.net/over-half-of-men-want-to-be-more-involved-in-childcare-major-new-report-claims/)(More than half of men who have children or other caring responsibilities want to be more involved in childcare, a new study commissioned by Business in the Community, in partnership with Santander UK, has found.) would like to be able to devote more time to child raising, and some women may prefer to work instead of being full-time caregivers.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: After raising children, women [return to the workforce well behind](https://workplaceinsight.net/women-less-likely-to-progress-at-work-than-their-male-counterparts-following-childbirth/)(Women and men experience a ‘large divergence’ in their career paths in the years following childbirth, according to a study following more than 3,500 new parents. Only 27.8 percent of women are in full-time work or self-employed three years after childbirth, compared to 90 percent of new fathers. And while 26 percent of men have been promoted or moved to a better job in the five years following childbirth, the figure is just 13 percent for women.\n\nThese are just two of the findings from researchers at the Universities of Bristol and Essex, who examined how childbirth affects employment and career progression. The findings suggest women still suffer economically and often become ‘stuck’ at work as a result of taking on childcare responsibilities, while there’s no impact on fathers.) their formerly same-level male peers; while the women were at home taking care of their children, the men were promoted and began to climb the corporate ladder.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: A man is [twice as likely to be promoted](https://workplaceinsight.net/women-less-likely-to-progress-at-work-than-their-male-counterparts-following-childbirth/)(And while 26 percent of men have been promoted or moved to a better job in the five years following childbirth, the figure is just 13 percent for women.) within five years of the birth of a child.
1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: Without flexible work schedules, women are [put at a disadvantage](https://hbr.org/2019/06/helping-stay-at-home-parents-reenter-the-workforce)(When it comes to working families, employers and politicians tend to focus on new mothers and fathers. Yet parents who leave the workforce when their kids are young but later want to reenter it might be corporate America’s greatest untapped resource. With unemployment rates near historic lows and companies bemoaning labor shortages, it’s time to tap into this talent pool. For the past year, I’ve worked with organizations trying to do just that. I have also interviewed scores of executives about the strategies they’re using to create more on-ramps.) upon reentering the workplace while continuing to care for young children.
1.2.1.2.1.4. Con: Career progress is only stunted if a woman chooses to take too much time off after childbirth.
1.2.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Women are [40% more likely](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/)(Child care challenges have become a barrier to work, especially for mothers, who disproportionately take on unpaid caregiving responsibilities when their family cannot find or afford child care.3 In a 2018 survey conducted by the Center for American Progress, mothers were 40 percent more likely than fathers to report that they had personally felt the negative impact of child care issues on their careers.4 Too often, mothers must make job decisions based on child care considerations rather than in the interest of their financial situation or career goals.) to have had their career impacted or truncated due to child care necessities.
1.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Women can follow the example of former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer; she only took [two weeks off after the birth of her son](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2218262/Yahoo-CEO-Marissa-Mayer-work-time-just-weeks-giving-birth-child.html)(Yahoo!

1.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: Ironically, even Marissa [Mayer isn't immune to the gender pay gap](https://fortune.com/2017/03/13/yahoo-new-ceo-marissa-mayer-net-worth-salary/)(But Mayer’s replacement, Thomas McInerney, seems in many ways to be getting an even sweeter deal.

That’s double the $1 million base salary that Mayer currently takes home.); the man who replaced her was given a salary double what she had earned as CEO.
1.2.1.2.1.4.2.2. Con: Two weeks is an extremely short amount of time to take off from work after childbirth; this is not realistic, [nor recommended](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/maternity-paid-leave-women-work-childbirth-us)(Rebeschini’s experience is far from rare for America’s mothers.

But with no federally mandated paid family leave, for many women maternity leave is an unaffordable luxury.), for the majority of new mothers.
1.2.1.2.1.4.2.3.

Each Member may subsequently deposit with the Director-General of the International Labour Office a further declaration extending the period of maternity leave.\n 4. With due regard to the protection of the health of the mother and that of the child, maternity leave shall include a period of six weeks' compulsory leave after childbirth, unless otherwise agreed at the national level by the government and the representative organizations of employers and workers.), allow for 14 weeks of maternity leave. Thus, career progress is unlikely to be affected by time off following childbirth.
1.2.1.2.1.4.3.1.

1.2.1.2.1.5. Con: The ramifications of motherhood cannot be called a penalty if women, despite being fully aware of the impact motherhood will have on their career, willfully make this decision.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: The gender pay gap makes life unjustifiably harder for women.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The gender pay gap makes it harder for [women who are single parents](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/05/mothers-working-part-time-hit-hard-by-gender-pay-gap-study-shows) to support their family.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Efforts to reduce the pay gap, such as the implementation of [positive discrimination programs](https://www.employmentlawworldview.com/mind-the-gap-tips-for-your-next-gender-pay-report/)(Including “multiple women” in shortlists for recruitments and promotions. Ok, but remember that positive discrimination is unlawful. If you include women on a shortlist at the expense of notionally better-qualified men, then even with the best of intentions, that will be less favourable treatment of the men on gender grounds. You can only “rig” shortlists in that way where the men and women are “as qualified”, i.e. where you are \(gender aside\) not much fussed as to who you recruit/promote. However, at the sort of senior level likely to make any difference to your pay gap, how often can it genuinely be said that an employer has no preference between candidates?), run counter to the very principle they aim to promote: equal treatment for both men and women.
1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Positive discrimination programs have been discussed, but not implemented, as a potential method of fixing the gender pay gap.
1.2.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Equality and equity are [two different values](https://onlinepublichealth.gwu.edu/resources/equity-vs-equality/). Equity requires that disadvantaged groups be provided with the required accommodations to ensure equality.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: The cumulative effect of the gender pay gap means that [women tend to be](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-stubborn-wealth-gap-between-men-and-women-1524099601) [less able to support themselves in retirement.](https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20180419/BLOG05/180419906/the-1-million-gender-wealth-gap)

1.2.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: In 2017, US household wealth was around [$100 trillion](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-stubborn-wealth-gap-between-men-and-women-1524099601). By 2020, it is estimated that women will control just [$22 trillion](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-stubborn-wealth-gap-between-men-and-women-1524099601) of this amount.

1.2.1.2.3. Con: Women entrepreneurs and employees define success in different ways than their men counterparts.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: There is a [28% discrepancy](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/women-entrepreneurs-pay-gap-freshbooks-survey-28-percent-less-than-men.html) in the amount of money that women and men entrepreneurs pay themselves.
1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: [Dolly Parton](https://www.thehandbook.com/dolly-parton-may-just-be-the-greatest-human-alive-heres-why/) would have likely been a billionaire had she not generously donated large sums of money to various charitable causes.
1.2.1.2.3.3. Pro: Businesses typically prioritize the profit bottom line over all else. In contrast, women appear to focus on other more benevolent ends, as evidenced by their greater involvement in [social entrepreneurship](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-014-2439-6).
1.2.1.2.3.3.1.

1.2.1.2.3.4. Con: Gender differences in the importance ascribed to money may be attributable to social norms, which differentially inform men and women about whether and to what extent valuing money is socially acceptable.
1.2.1.2.3.4.1.

1.2.1.2.3.5. Con: [Individual definitions of success](https://hbr.org/2014/02/what-does-success-mean-to-you) are subjective and influenced by social pressures. In contrast, granting equal opportunities and equal pay is objective and not affected by social pressures.
1.2.1.3. Con: The pay gap has little to do with discrimination by employers and is primarily the result of [child-rearing choices](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty)(Childbearing, the study estimates, accounts for 80 percent of the gender wage gap in Denmark.\n\nKleven’s research uses Danish data, but similar studies conducted in the United States have found similar results. Harvard economist Claudia Goldin has found that the gender wage gap in America is the largest for women in their 30s — in other words, their prime, childbearing years.) made by parents; the government should not dictate which parent reduces their work hours for child rearing.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Currently, traditional gender roles dictate [which parent](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/03/14/chapter-5-americans-time-at-paid-work-housework-child-care-1965-to-2011/) [reduces](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-more-unpaid-work-women-do-than-men-2017-03-07) work hours. Governments have some degree of power to facilitate changes in gender roles related to the job market, including childcare.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Some gender roles have to do with innate biological differences, such as the ability to breastfeed.
1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Children begin to rely on solid food around two years old, at which point they can be reasonably cared for by either parent.
1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm#how-long) is recommended for the first six months or complementary to foods for one year or longer, even up to two years.
1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Women can use [breast pumps](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/your-fertility-friend/why-working-mothers-should-opt-for-breastfeeding-pump-to-feed-their-baby/)(If you are having a hectic work schedule, you might have to leave your child under nanny’s supervision or in child day care. In this case, storing your breast milk through a breast pump is the best possible option.) to extract milk at a convenient time, which can later be fed to their infant by any caregiver.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.2.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: In New Zealand, which has one of the lowest pay gaps among OECD countries, about [80%](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/90138688/bias-against-women-accounts-for-80-per-cent-of-gender-pay-gap--research) of the pay gap is due to "unexplained factors" \([p. 8](https://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/Empirical%20evidence%20of%20GPG%20in%20NZ%20-%20Mar2017_0.pdf)\). Discrimination, through both conscious and unconscious bias, plays a significant role.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: The cited study did not identify the factors accounting for the unexplained proportion of the pay gap. Thus, its attribution to "discrimination \(conscious and unconscious bias\)" is pure [speculation](https://women.govt.nz/work-skills/income/gender-pay-gap/research-evidence-gap-new-zealand) about the nature of the unexplained results.
1.2.1.4. Con: Very few governments have adopted laws or constitutions which enshrine their obligation to provide men and women with [equal opportunities](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/02/europe/world-bank-gender-equality-report-intl/index.html).
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: In 2019, a [World Bank report](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/01/only-six-countries-in-the-world-give-women-and-men-equal-legal-rights)(If you’re a woman and want to be on an equal footing with men, it’s best to live and work in Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg or Sweden. The World Bank, which has tracked legal changes for the past decade, found these were the only countries in the world to enshrine gender equality in laws affecting work.\n\nThe bank’s women, business and the law 2019 report, published this week, measured gender discrimination in 187 countries. It found that, a decade ago, no country gave women and men equal legal rights.) found that only six countries in the world have enshrined gender equality in their laws affecting work.
1.2.2. Con: Government intervention could lead to unintended consequences.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Using legislation to correct the gender pay gap risks creating a reverse gender pay gap as the pendulum could swing too far.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Measures of the gender pay gap among recent college graduates show a reverse pay gap with young single childfree women [making 8% more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html).
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: It is difficult to determine when the playing field has been completely leveled because more senior women who have been disadvantaged for many years will still have earned less than their male counterparts.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: For these disadvantaged women, the gender pay gap will never close, unless some form of analysis were conducted to reinstate their unearned income over the years.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Even repaying their unearned income would not fully close the gap; in many cases, that unearned money would have been much more useful back when it would have been earned, to pay bills or invest in their future.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: How much women have earned in the past \(as opposed to how much they are currently earning\) has less to do with the pay gap and more to do with the [wealth gap](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/the-gender-wealth-gap-why-it-matters-and-what-you-can-do-to-change-it/).
1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: The generation to follow these pioneering women will be better off as a result of their efforts.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: According to men's rights activists, efforts to empower women have resulted in [sexism](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/men-s-rights-activists-are-attacking-women-s-scholarships-programs-n947886) against men. These affirmative actions are being challenged in a court of law.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: Not using legislation to correct the gender pay gap effectively ensures that women continue to earn a lower pay then men, which is fundamentally unfair.
1.2.2.1.5. Con: Equal pay legislation would only create a level playing field for men and women. Who out-earns whom would depend on their performance at work.
1.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: Everyone would have the same base salary under this scenario and any additional income would come from performance metrics, regardless of the gender of the individual.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Many government programs do not have sufficient oversight to run efficiently.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Many US governmental agencies are running on autopilot without being reauthorized. This allows [ineffective programs](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/02/government-agencies-programs-unauthorized-000036-000037) to continue for years without oversight.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Welfare programs often [do not achieve](https://blog.acton.org/archives/75645-keep-funding-ineffective-government-programs.html) their intended goal as many recipients become reliant on the assistance rather than self-reliant over time.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Many welfare programs, such as [Jobseeker's Allowance in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance)(What you need to do\n\n- Check you’re eligible.\n\n- Make a claim for ‘new style’ JSA and attend a phone interview with your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\n- Keep to your agreement to look for work. This agreement is called a ‘Claimant Commitment’ and you will create it at your phone interview.), are tied to the recipients demonstrating that they are seeking work.
1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: The [war on poverty](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/03/01/poverty-in-america) in the US has not seen substantial success since it was declared by President Lydon B. Johnson.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: The solution is to improve oversight, not rule out government programs altogether.
1.2.2.3. Con: No institution is better equipped and more powerful than the government to predict and mitigate any potential unintended consequence of promoting equality.
1.2.2.4. Con: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that, when faced with a public crisis, governmental intervention is essential, despite significant uncertainty about their effectiveness and outcomes.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Forcing society to adopt gender pay gap policies may breed resentment and cause an extension of sexist attitudes in subsets of the populace.
1.2.3. Pro: The gender pay gap will not solve itself naturally unless the government intervenes.
1.2.3.1. Con: Governments in [most developed countries](https://www.cloudpay.net/resources/a-guide-to-pay-parity-laws-around-the-world) have already intervened by creating and, to some extent, enforcing equitable legislation like "equal pay for equal work."
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [The Equal Pay Act](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm) of 1963, a United States labor law that amended the [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa), aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The UN Convention on the [Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_Against_Women#Reports) Against Women reviews country-level discrimination against women and ensures equal pay for equal work. This bill of rights has been ratified by 189 countries.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Iceland is the world's most gender-equal country; the government forces organizations with more than 25 employees to submit paperwork in order to [prove salaries are paid equally](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/20/iceland-equal-pay-law-gender-gap-women-jobs-equality) for equal work across genders.
1.2.3.1.4. Con: A [vast majority](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/beyond-equal-pay)(One of the first steps to address the gender pay gap is through law. The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law index evaluates the legislative framework that shapes women’s prospects as employees and entrepreneurs in 190 countries. Under its Pay indicator, Women, Business and the Law 2020 finds that the average score is just 66.1 out of 100. This means that 70% of countries in the world still have laws and regulations that may contribute to the gender pay gap.) of countries have laws that contribute to the gender pay gap.
1.2.3.1.5. Con: The gender pay gap is indeed smaller in developed countries than in [less-developed countries](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/csw61/equal-pay) without such laws. This only underscores the need for governmental intervention in reducing the pay gap.
1.2.3.1.6. Pro: [The UK](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/equal-pay-equal-work-matter-law) already has provisions mandating that employers pay people equally regardless of their gender.
1.2.3.1.7. Pro: The Treaty of Rome, which binds the 28 members of the European Union, includes a commitment that governments ensure that "[men and women should receive equal pay for equal work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286456)."
1.2.3.2. Con: It does not have to be the government that intervenes. A more obvious candidate is the labour union who should sue on behalf of their members every time they do not get equal pay for equal work.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Businesses are primarily driven by profit-making motives and often fail to be mindful of their impact on internal and external stakeholders. Powerful external regulatory authorities counteract this tendency.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Governments have the power to hold businesses accountable for their labor practices, such as by requiring them to publish [pay statistics](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/04/429825/international-approaches-closing-gender-wage-gap/)(Generally, pay data reporting is the process of requiring or incentivizing employers to collect and provide their pay data to government bodies, but the details can vary greatly from country to country. Reporting requirements hold employers accountable to examine and address their own pay practices.).
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.3.
1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: Governments can institute policies that protect employees from punishment for [sharing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2019/04/04/closing-the-gender-pay-gap-what-women-employers-and-government-can-do/?sh=674c27336c73) their salaries--information that is vital to negotiating and renegotiating salaries.
1.2.3.3.1.3. Con: Government-business nexus poses conflicts of interest, such as tax implications, that may make governments less likely to impose regulations that may not be well-received by businesses.
1.2.3.3.1.4. Con: Businesses can find easy workarounds to alter pay statistics, such as by hiring women as contractors rather than as employees on pay roll, to fudge the data in their favor.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Even without regulatory input, companies can close the pay gap by making it a priority like any other business case. Otherwise, it will never get done.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Several companies have made [closing the gap a priority](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/closing-wage-gap); the gap has been reduced to nearly nothing at those companies.
1.2.3.3.2.2. Con: In a classical capitalist sense, the pay gap cannot be prioritized by businesses unless it produces a [higher return than the initial investment](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/how-to-calculate-roi-for-a-project).
1.2.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Not only does prioritizing fixing the pay gap yield bountiful [returns on investment](https://blog.vantagecircle.com/gender-pay-gap/), such as improved financials, but also not prioritizing this disparity can be detrimental to [market outcomes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/07/26/how-the-gender-pay-gap-could-destroy-business-competitiveness/?sh=676a393b68dc).
1.2.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: In the absence of real incentives, companies may offer meaningless pay gap-related "[lip service](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/07/26/how-the-gender-pay-gap-could-destroy-business-competitiveness/?sh=330fbd3a68dc)(In fact, while many companies pay lip service to “doing the right thing,” a certain complacency permeates around gender pay and even culture that helps maintain the status quo.)," not unlike the [pride charade](https://www.businessinsider.in/retail/news/walmart-mcdonalds-and-amazon-are-among-companies-celebrating-pride-after-donating-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars-to-politicians-who-voted-against-the-equality-act/articleshow/83260999.cms) that businesses are known to put on during pride month.
1.2.3.3.2.2.3. Pro: Because of pervasive misogyny and sexism, supporting the rights of women could cost companies dearly. [Gillette](https://georgi-georgiev.medium.com/350-mln-in-6-months-the-cost-of-the-2019-gillette-advertising-fiasco-86785f29a4bf) incurred a loss of hundreds of millions of USD and more than 1.5 million dislikes on YouTube when they created an advertisement against sexual harassment.
1.2.3.3.2.3. Con: Just because companies can do the right thing does not mean they will. Companies will pursue profits at all costs, including human rights violations and [destruction of the planet](https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2019/the-profitability-of-destroying-our-planet).
1.2.3.3.2.4. Pro: Even when government laws and policies are to the contrary, companies have taken progressive action to counter social problems, such as [homophobia](https://www.zeebiz.com/companies/news-urbanclap-joins-other-indian-brands-in-backing-lgbt-rights-through-advertising-2178)(With the debate about the scrapping of Article 377 which criminalises homosexuality in the country \[India\] still raging, some brands have taken on the banner of supporting LGBT rights.). They could do the same when it comes to the gender pay gap.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Businesses do not have the incentives to compensate for the career disruption caused by childbirth and childcare; this necessitates government intervention.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Most businesses [do not offer](https://hbr.org/2018/09/how-companies-can-ensure-maternity-leave-doesnt-hurt-womens-careers) reintegration training to equip women for their return to work.
1.2.3.3.3.1.1. Con: If a woman is away only for a few weeks following childbirth, it is unlikely she would need any type of reintegration into the company.
1.2.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: Many businesses also fail to accommodate the new needs of new mothers \(e.g., [the need for lactation rooms](https://www.inhersight.com/blog/research/employers-not-proving-pumping-rooms-for-mothers)\). This could make reintegration into the workplace challenging for new mothers.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Con: Replacing talent could prove [expensive to employers](https://www.fastcompany.com/3064070/why-offering-paid-maternity-leave-is-good-for-business). This should be sufficient incentive to provide paid maternity leave to mothers.
1.2.3.3.3.3. Pro: Government subsidy for [parental leave](https://www.market-inspector.co.uk/blog/2017/06/decrease-gender-pay-gap) for both genders will ultimately increase personal freedom and lower the gender pay gap.
1.2.3.4. Pro: The gender pay gap has existed for a [very long time](https://www.investopedia.com/history-gender-wage-gap-america-5074898)(Early History of the Wage Gap\n\nThough the gender wage gap probably dates to the beginnings of civilization, it emerged as a political issue in the United States in the 1860s under the rallying cry of “Equal Pay for Equal Work.”\n\nAmong the movement’s most vigorous advocates were women’s rights activists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who made a case for bridging the wage gap in their newspaper, The Revolution, and other works.), possibly because independent mechanisms have not been able to solve it. Governments will be able to coordinate the concerted effort required to bring about this change.
1.2.4. Pro: Many states have taken practical steps to address the gender pay gap, due to increasing calls to have greater gender diversity in upper management.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The state of California instituted a law requiring all publicly traded corporations based in the state to have [at least one woman on their boards of directors](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/shareholders-take-baton-in-california-board-diversity-law-fight)(California will now have to defend in court S.B. 826, a 2018 law intended to accelerate board diversification. It requires publicly traded corporations based in California to have at least one woman on their boards of directors. By the end of 2021, corporations with six or more directors must have at least three female directors.), increasing to at least three women directors for companies with a minimum of six board members at the end of 2021.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: As the deadline nears, [few companies are compliant](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/women-of-color-missing-from-california-boards-as-deadlines-near) and minority women are conspicuously absent from nearly every board in the state; Black women hold just 2% of positions, and Latina women, 1%.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Women, [despite mixed feelings](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/25/california-companies-women-boards-quotas-00010745)(The company has since added two other women to its board. Ardisana has “mixed feelings” about California’s law. Women are “capable, and we bring unique perspectives, and we do a good job, so in that sense, we don’t need a mandate,” she said. But she thinks she probably benefited from it in this case, especially since boardrooms are often about candidates fulfilling a nebulous “fit” — which can lead the white men who are already there to pick people who look like them and have similar backgrounds — and less about specific skillsets. “In many cases, \[the mandate\] is a nudge,” she said.), ultimately feel that they benefited from the law, having been given the extra slight push they needed to be elected to the board.
1.2.4.2. Con: The government should not meddle in the affairs of private business; in capitalism, the top talent receives promotions and bonuses, regardless of the race or gender of the individual \([p. 185](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1028.8362&rep=rep1&type=pdf)(Our conception of fundamental differences in the allocation and reward of labor under capitalism and state socialism and, in particular, of the qualitatively distinctive features of careers and internal labor markets in the two systems, suggest that Hungarians generally have fewer opportunities for routinized career advancement. This situation results from the lack of performance pressure in Hungarian firms and from the emphasis on bargaining and networking that is produced by chronic shortages. By contrast, in the U.S., job ladders are designed to facilitate workers' advancement, thereby helping to overcome uncertainties associated with labor turnover. This reasoning underlies our first hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis 1. U.S. workers place greater importance on, and have greater opportunities for, promotions than Hungarian workers.)\).
1.2.5. Con: If the government is meant to ensure equality, it should do so across the board including dangerous or unpleasant jobs, not just when it affects women.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Given that men generally select higher-risk, [more-dangerous jobs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-conscious/202104/why-do-men-have-the-most-dangerous-jobs) \(that pay more\) and women select lower-risk jobs \(that pay less\), any move to equalize outcomes must be restrictive of individual choice and would, thus, be immoral.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: [Risk-taking](https://hbr.org/2015/04/not-taking-risks-is-the-riskiest-career-move-of-all) has been found to be a crucial part of having a successful career and getting senior jobs. Thus, given that men tend to take more risks, they may hold higher positions and earn higher salaries.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: About 90% of the workforce constituting the [four most dangerous jobs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-conscious/202104/why-do-men-have-the-most-dangerous-jobs)(According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the four most dangerous occupations in the United States in 2019 were fishing and hunting, logging, piloting a small plane or helicopter, and roofing. These occupations were the most dangerous because the individuals who did them had the highest likelihood of being killed on the job.) are men.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: The most dangerous jobs are not the [best-paid jobs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-conscious/202104/why-do-men-have-the-most-dangerous-jobs).
1.2.5.1.3.1. Con: Some [dangerous jobs may be the most well-paid option](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/dangerous-jobs-that-pay-well) available to those without a college education.
1.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: Poverty forces people to take on [extremely dangerous](https://blog.compassion.com/the-extreme-jobs-of-people-in-poverty/) jobs, which are unlikely to be chosen by their more privileged counterparts.
1.2.5.1.4. Con: Men choosing high-risk jobs is a factually inaccuracy.
1.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: The implicit association between risk and masculinity excludes the many high-risk low-pay jobs that are held predominantly by women.
1.2.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Sex work](https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/think-leicester/arts-and-culture/2017/is-sex-work-still-the-most-dangerous-profession-the-data-suggests-so) is arguably the most dangerous job in the world, and the [vast majority](https://prostitution.procon.org/questions/how-many-prostitutes-are-in-the-united-states-and-the-rest-of-the-world/) of sex workers are women [living in poverty](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/prostitution-poverty/).
1.2.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: Being a [nursing assistant](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/nursing-assistants)(89.4% of Nursing assistants are Female, making them the more common gender in the occupation.) is a [high-risk](https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/risk-without-reward-the-myth-of-wage-compensation-for-hazardous-work/)(Many high-risk workers are also poorly paid. For example, the 1.5 million nursing assistants, whose injury rates are over twice the workforce average, have median annual pay that barely exceeds the poverty level for a family of four.) low-payoff affair, and most nursing assistants are women.
1.2.5.1.4.2. Pro: [Immigrants](https://www.prb.org/resources/immigrants-work-in-riskier-and-more-dangerous-jobs-in-the-united-states/) and [the poor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3813007/)(\[C\]onsiderable evidence shows that less advantaged workers are more likely to be exposed to physically dangerous work \(Lipscomb et al., 2006\). Some studies also suggest that workers from lower status groups have more exposure to psychosocial stressors, as they are more likely to report low control or high strain at work.) are disproportionately burdened with dangerous jobs, not all men in general. This demography does not explain the gender pay gap but merely illustrates the unfair treatment of underprivileged classes in the labor market.
1.2.5.2. Con: Men and women do not face the same number, range, or variety of dangers to demand equal representation in dangerous jobs.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Being a military officer is a high-risk job, regardless of gender, but women are highly vulnerable to [sexual assault](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/us-military-sexual-assault-interviews/index.html)(In the Pentagon's latest report on sexual assault from 2018, one out of 16 women in the military reported being sexually assaulted in the last year. Lower-ranking female service members, ages 17 to 24, were especially likely to be victims.), in addition to the other dangers faced by their male counterparts.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: Fellow soldiers pose greater [threats to the safety of women soldiers](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/217724-invisible-war-fighting-rape-crisis-us-military)(A female soldier in combat zones today is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire.) than their enemies do.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Con: More than half of all rape victims in the US military are [men](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/09/10/38-men-raped-in-u-s-military-each-day)(While most of the fire from the public and Congress directed at the military addresses women who are sexually assaulted, more than half of victims are male. According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every single day.).
1.2.5.3. Con: Punishing women for not pursuing more dangerous jobs is unfair, when they are raised and socialized to be [risk averse](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/why-women-are-more-risk-averse-than-men-are)(Past research has shown the pressure to adhere to gender norms can curb women's economic attainment and make them less willing to strive for more. Risk-taking is particularly important for financial growth, both when it comes to taking bets on businesses that could potentially yield high rewards and when it comes to taking on big opportunities in the workplace that tend to get you noticed. Many experts believe women's risk aversion may be related to the gender pay gap and why men tend to make a lot more money than women do.).
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10788304) found that mothers are more likely to intervene when daughters take part in high risk activities than when sons do. From a young age, therefore, girls are taught to take fewer risks than boys.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Many jobs traditionally associated with women entail a high level of risk, such as serving as a frontline nurse, [even when pregnant](https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/covid19-claims-pregnant-doctor-two-nurses-in-tamil-nadu-1800770-2021-05-10)(Covid-19 claims 8-month pregnant doctor, two nurses in Tamil Nadu\nAs Tamil Nadu continues to battle the Covid-19 surge, a pregnant doctor and two nurses became the latest casualties of the virus as the state’s death toll crossed the 15,000-mark.), amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
1.2.5.3.3. Pro: Women are more risk averse for good reason, because rape culture renders them at risk for sexual assault, both within personal and professional contexts \([pp. 1-2](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_overview_sexual-violence-workplace.pdf)(Sexual violence is a societal issue that requires systemic change. Sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. It is influenced by our larger social systems, including the workplace.\n\n\[…\]\n\nWhile working or on duty, American employees experienced 36,500 rapes and sexual assaults from 1993 to 1999 \(Duhart, 2001\). Women are the victims in 80% of rapes and sexual assaults that take place in the workplace \(Duhart, 2001\). Between 2005 and 2009, rape/sexual assault accounted for 2.3% of all nonfatal violence in the workplace \(Harrell, 2011\). One study of employed women found that 38% had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace \(Potter & Banyard, 2011\).)\).
1.2.5.4. Pro: The lives of men are perceived as [less valuable and disposable](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/03/31/masculinity-traditional-toxic-trump-mens-rights/99830694/)("Every society that survived, survived based on its ability to train its sons to be disposable, " Farrell said. "Disposable in war, disposable in work — on railroads or oil rigs — and therefore indirectly disposable as dads. And in order to get men to be disposable — you couldn't get a man to be willing to sacrifice himself if he got in touch with his feelings — we had to disconnect men from their feelings and therefore who they are.").
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Men have a much [higher](https://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/how-come-nobody-talks-about-the-gender-workplace-death-gap/) rate of workplace deaths and accidents.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Con: Men's higher risk of workplace deaths is a result of [unnecessary risk-taking](https://www.livescience.com/49101-darwin-awards-are-men-idiots.html)(The researchers looked at 332 cases confirmed by the Darwin Awards Committee to be true incidents. For their analysis, they excluded 14 cases of deaths of adventurous couples, leaving them with 318 cases.\n\nOf those, just 36 were women. The other 282 winners, or 88.7 percent, were men, the researchers found.) and as such should not be rewarded with higher pay.
1.2.5.4.1.2. Pro: Of all the workplace fatalities in 2018, [92% were men](https://www.publichealthpost.org/databyte/men-hard-at-work/).
1.2.5.4.1.3. Pro: From 2003-2018, the statistics fluctuated somewhat; however, on average, men died in workplace accidents [ten times as often as women](https://www.publichealthpost.org/databyte/men-hard-at-work/).
1.2.5.4.2. Con: Men's lives are perceived as less valuable and disposable by other men, not by women. The conscription of men, for example, was instituted by governments that were, at the time, dominated by men.
1.2.5.4.2.1. Pro: Adolescent boys feel [lower levels of empathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112287/)(\[M\]ale adolescents reported less empathic sadness towards same-sex than towards other-sex targets . . . female adolescents reported . . . equal levels of empathic sadness towards both types of targets in the longitudinal study.) toward other boys than girls, whereas adolescent girls are likely to demonstrate similar levels of empathy toward both boys and girls.
1.2.5.4.3. Con: The value and disposability of life may have less to do with gender and more to do with socioeconomic status, as those performing the listed jobs do not presumably belong to the privileged classes.
1.2.5.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.4.2.
1.2.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.1.1.
1.2.5.6. Pro: If governments were responsible for ensuring equality, they would register women for the military draft in the same way they register men.
1.2.5.6.1. Pro: Governments should allow men and women to enlist in the military of their accord rather than be drafted solely on the basis of [sex](https://warontherocks.com/2018/05/the-greatest-sacrifice-why-military-service-should-not-be-an-obligation-of-citizenship/).
1.2.5.6.2. Con: The conscription of women assumes a level playing field for men and women, which is not the case.
1.2.5.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.2.5.6.2.2. Pro: Socialization practices render women [less military-ready](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sdut-women-draft-military-2016feb20-story.html). It would be unfair and counterproductive to draft women in the name of equality when there is a gender disparity in the experiences needed for military readiness.
1.2.5.6.2.3. Con: There are many equivalent non-combat roles within the military; women could easily opt for one of them if conscripted.
1.2.5.6.3. Pro: Extending military conscription to women would mean more women will have access to the benefits \(including financial benefits such as [tax relief and insurance](https://www.usa.gov/military-assistance)\), honors, and social prestige that come with being a military officer or war veteran.
1.2.5.6.4. Pro: An overwhelming [majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/23/fewer-than-a-third-of-countries-currently-have-a-military-draft-most-exclude-women/)(At least 11 of the 60 countries with active conscription programs draft both men and women. \(For four countries with conscription – Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Niger and Senegal – we couldn’t determine whether or not their draft systems include women.\) In addition, some countries, such as Sudan and Vietnam, authorize conscription of women in law but draft only men in practice. And several other countries without active conscription programs – including Burma \(Myanmar\), Chad, Ivory Coast and Portugal – provide that if they ever do start drafting anyone, men and women would both be subject to call-up.) of the countries with military conscription exempt women from being drafted.
1.2.5.6.5. Con: Women in Israel are [conscripted and serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Israel_Defense_Forces) in the Israeli Defense Forces.
1.2.5.6.5.1. Con: Equal conscription does not equate to equal roles or equal treatment.
1.2.5.6.5.1.1. Pro: Less than [4% of Israeli women serve in combat positions](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/gaza-a-mans-war-israel-gender/375689/); the majority are allocated to "combat-support" roles.
1.2.5.6.5.1.2. Pro: There is only [one woman general](https://idfspokesperson.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/israeli-army-celebrates-first-ever-female-major-general/) in the entire IDF.
1.2.5.6.5.1.3. Pro: Women in the IDF are subjected to extremely high rates of [sexual harassment](https://wri-irg.org/en/story/2013/one-boys-conscription-young-women-israeli-military)(The fact that hundreds of soldiers complain about sexual harassment in the military every year, and, according to military research in 2002, 80% of female soldiers were sexually harassed during their service, somehow does not make it into the top 50.).
1.2.5.6.5.1.4. Con: Full equality is a work in progress. Equal conscription is a first step in this regard, as it is a necessary antecedent to equal roles and treatment.
1.2.5.6.5.2. Pro: The conscription of women in Israel is founded upon their [right to equality](https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/israel-defense-forces)(In the Alice Miller Case in 1995, however, the High Court of Justice ruled that women had the right to equality in their military service, both formally and on the ground.), which protected by law.
1.2.5.6.5.3. Pro: Israel has one of the [widest pay gaps](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/gender-wage-gap-in-israel-among-highest-in-the-west-1.5457004) among Western countries. This indicates that military conscription does not explain the gender pay.
1.2.5.6.6. Con: War is more strongly aligned with [masculinity](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/711622) and reflects men's ideals and preferred conflict-resolution strategies. Women should not be expected to participate in efforts to further goals they have had no say in making.
1.2.5.6.6.1. Pro: Women may prefer to resolve conflict through effective [peace-making](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/women-and-war-securing-more-peaceful-future)(Peace processes that include women are more successful and sustainable, and societies that empower women are more peaceful than those that do not.), at which they are [particularly adept](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders)(States are also more likely to achieve lasting peace post-conflict when women are invited to the negotiating table. Although the number of women included in peace talks is minuscule \(a United Nations study found that just 2.4 per cent of mediators and 9 per cent of negotiators are women, and just 4 per cent of the signatories of 31 peace processes\), the inclusion of women can make a profound difference. Peace is more likely to endure: an analysis by the US non-profit Inclusive Security of 182 signed peace agreements between 1989 and 2011 found that an agreement is 35 per cent more likely to last at least 15 years if women are included as negotiators, mediators and signatories.).
1.2.5.6.6.2. Con: Historical analyses suggest that [queens](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders)(Although just 18 per cent of the monarchs were queens – making their analysis less statistically reliable – they found that polities ruled by queens were 27 per cent more likely than kings to participate in inter-state conflicts. Unmarried queens were more likely to engage in wars in which their state was attacked, perhaps because they were perceived as weak.) were more likely to initiate war than kings.
1.2.5.6.6.2.1. Con: War initiated by women is more likely to have been in retaliation to having been [perceived as weak](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders)(It seems that, no matter whether women are fighting for peace or for war, they must also battle against the assumption that they themselves are passive, weak or peculiar. History shows us that that isn’t true, and that, in the case of Isabella I and Ferdinand V, they could be relentlessly cruel: not only did the royal couple lead the Spanish conquest of the Islamic Kingdom of Granada in 1492, expelling both Jews and Muslims, they tortured those who remained and converted them to Christianity – in some cases burning them to death.). This merely suggests that women are not incapable of aggression but choose the path of peace for the greater good.
1.2.5.6.6.2.2. Pro: The notion that women \(leaders\) are more likely than men \(leaders\) to pursue peace is a [stereotype](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders)(It is, indeed, a stereotype to dismiss women as inherently peaceable.).
1.2.5.6.6.3. Pro: Across time and space, men have tended to favor [military interventions](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/01/19/men-and-womens-support-for-war-accounting-for-the-gender-gap-in-public-opinion/) more than women.
1.2.5.6.6.3.1. Pro: Women may oppose military interventions more vehemently because the [ramifications of war](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/01/19/men-and-womens-support-for-war-accounting-for-the-gender-gap-in-public-opinion/)(The political feminism perspective argues that \[...\] feminists \(which could include men\) tend to be against as military conflicts are usually fought in men’s interests and the costs of war fall heavily on civilian women and children.) are disproportionately borne by women and children.
1.2.5.6.7. Con: The US government is [being pressured](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/04/women-may-soon-have-register-draft-its-long-overdue/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ef3d8725bd1c) to register women for the military draft, and this [has been done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription#Drafting_of_women) in a few other countries.
1.2.5.6.7.1. Pro: One could argue that serving in the military is also their responsibility. If they’re not doing it, they’re failing this duty.
1.2.5.6.8. Pro: In many countries, the majority of the military is made up of men; therefore, their contribution to society is bigger and deserving of additional pay.
1.2.5.6.8.1. Con: In all countries, soldiers exist because their mothers carried them for nine months and gave birth to them. One might argue that their contribution to society is bigger and, thus, deserving of a higher pay.
1.2.5.6.8.2. Pro: Just [16% of enlisted members](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military) of the US military are women.
1.2.5.6.8.3. Con: If serving in the military is a significant societal contribution deserving of additional pay, this premium should explain the gap between military officers and civilians, not men and women military officers.
1.2.5.6.8.3.1. Pro: In the military, men and women officers receive "[the same pay for the same job](https://www.veteranaid.org/blog/2017/01/25/gender-gap-u-s-military/)."
1.2.5.6.8.4. Con: In the US, active-duty personnel comprise [less than 1%](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military) of the population. There is no reason why the contributions of this minuscule population within one sector would explain or justify a higher pay for men in general.
1.2.5.6.8.5. Con: By some estimates, civilians make more than their counterparts in the army. Thus, military pay is [not commensurate](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-vs-civilian-benefits-overview.html) to their contribution to society.
1.2.5.6.8.6. Pro: Active-duty personnel need to operate with the awareness that they may not make it back home alive. Thus, they need to make more money faster to leave behind enough wealth for their dependent family members.
1.2.5.6.8.7. Pro: Military personnel who have served in wars often return with [physical disabilities](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/vet.pdf) and [psychological problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638236/). A higher pay compensates for these additional healthcare costs that veterans will have to shoulder for the rest of their lives.
1.2.5.6.8.8. Con: Obligatory military service doesn't apply in many countries where the wage gap is still observed. Even where conscription happens, a large proportion of men are ineligible for a variety of reasons, such as disability and age.
1.2.5.6.8.9. Pro: Men enlisted in the military will be out of the labor market for a prolonged period of time. As such, they miss out on the opportunity to earn money and advance their careers compared to women.
1.2.5.6.8.9.1. Con: Oftentimes women have increased childcare and household responsibilities while their husbands are deployed overseas.
1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.3.
1.2.7. Pro: The government is partially responsible for the gender pay gap and has a corresponding obligation to correct it.
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.2.7.2. Pro: A lack of government policies ensuring parental leave contributes to the pay gap.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: In the United States, there is [no law guaranteeing women paid maternity leave](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/no-paid-maternity-leave/470889/). As such, many women need to take flexible or part-time jobs, which are [often low paying](https://qz.com/2023799/the-us-worker-shortage-shouldnt-surprise-low-paying-employers/).
1.2.7.2.2. Con: In Argentina, a government policy allows women to [retire by using the years spent at home taking care of children](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/8/5/argentinas-new-pensions-programme-pays-women-for-caregiving) in lieu of the years missing from requisite minimum of 30 years in the formal job market needed to retire. This policy gives an additional 155,000 women a pension.
1.2.7.2.3. Pro: Governments can play a role in requiring gender-neutral parental leave. When only maternity leave is required, it encourages a gender bias.
1.2.7.2.3.1. Pro: The [lack of paternity leave](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_242615.pdf)(p. 50) pressures women to take time off after a baby is born, while men continue to work.
1.2.7.2.3.1.1. Con: A lack of paternity leave pressures fathers and mothers equally, since both have a responsibility to care for their children.
1.2.7.2.3.1.1.1. Con: A lack of paternity leave forces the parents to use maternity leave or find a childcare service to compensate for the lack of time off. In this case, the pressure on the father would be financial, while the pressure on the mother would be physical and career-altering.
1.2.7.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.2.
1.2.7.2.3.1.2. Pro: Only around [half](http://time.com/3916511/parental-leave-map/) the countries requiring maternity leave also require paternity leave.
1.2.7.2.3.2. Con: In [traditional societies](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9553496.pdf), where norms require men to be breadwinners and women to be caregivers, governments may be disincentivized from enacting laws that might be unpopular with the masses and ultimately cost them votes in subsequent elections.
1.3. Con: The gender pay gap does not exist.
1.3.1. Pro: If the gender pay gap existed, it would be possible for women to create companies that would focus on hiring predominantly women and paying them the current average salary for other women in the workplace. These companies would be better positioned to generate profits compared to equivalent male-dominated companies simply based on decreased labour costs.
1.3.1.1. Con: Women would not be legally permitted to start such companies as prohibiting the employment of someone simply based on gender would be discriminatory and illegal.
1.3.1.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that women would be willing to shortchange women employees to compete with their men counterparts.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Women leaders paying their women employees a lower salary to compete with similar men-owned businesses is the definition of women oppressing other women, particularly those more vulnerable than them, by virtue of their lower position within an organizational hierarchy.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Even celebrated feminist icons such as [Beyonc](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1176905/exposed-sweatshop-slaves-earning-just-44p-an-hour-making-empowering-beyonce-clobber/)(Beyonce says she wants her Ivy Park gym gear to support and inspire women — while Topshop claims it “empowers women through sport”.\n\nBut poverty-stricken seamstresses making some of the clothes in the MAS Holdings ­factory in Sri Lanka earn just £4.30 a day.\n\nIt would cost them more than a month’s wages to buy a pair of Beyonce’s £100 leggings.)[é](https://www.beyonce.com/) contribute to the oppression of some of the most vulnerable women in the world in order to earn money and commercial success.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.3.1.3. Pro: A company founded by women could decrease the rates offered to customers based on lower labor costs, thus competing on price, all other factors held equal.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Decreased labor costs would not necessarily translate to increased competition; lower prices could be [perceived as poorer-quality](https://www.aninews.in/news/lifestyle/quirky/higher-price-means-higher-quality-in-consumers-minds-study20190724182315/) goods and services.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Established businesses with brand-loyal clientele are unlikely to be attracted to competitors offering slightly lower rates.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Women-owned businesses enjoy [government benefits](https://www.upcounsel.com/woman-owned-business-tax-benefits) such as tax relief, which further afford them the option of reducing their product or service rates.
1.3.1.4. Pro: These types of companies with a predominantly women staff do not exist in the market.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: There are some examples of [successful women-only companies](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/new-face-of-workplace-all-female-staff/articleshow/68309868.cms).
1.3.1.5. Con: In the past, [women earned much lower salaries](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104138513&view=1up&seq=1)(\(p. 30 onwards\)) than men and persisted for an extended period of time. If labor costs were the only significant determinant, it would not have been possible for such a large earnings gap to sustain itself over such a long period of time.
1.3.1.5.1. Pro: During the early 20th century \([p. 419](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2523398?seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents)\), with women's labour costs being very low, women-only companies should have been rapidly created, undercutting men's wages and creating a degree of wage parity. This did not occur.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Women's educational attainment in the early 20th century was [much lower](https://www.britannica.com/topic/education/Literacy-as-a-measure-of-success#ref281691)(Although international agencies and national governments have been active since the late 1980s in promoting education rights for girls and women, complex changes were not adopted swiftly. Of the 120 million children excluded from education systems at the turn of the 21st century, for example, approximately 60 percent were girls and nearly three-fourths were living in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, of the nearly 900 million illiterate adults in the world at the beginning of the 21st century, almost two-thirds were women.) than their men counterparts, they could not have been expected to attain similar achievements at that time.
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: Married women in England were barred from owning property till the [Married Women's Property Act of 1870](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/learning/medievalwomen/theme3/propertyownership.aspx). A lack of access to property, both as a store of value and source of income, was a factor unrelated to labour cost that kept women's incomes low.
1.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: Land and property have been the primary and most significant store of value for the entirety of modern history.
1.3.1.5.2.2. Pro: An inability to hold wealth creates a strong disincentive for work, because money cannot be retained for future expenditure and investment.
1.3.1.5.3. Con: Everyone was compensated the same when paid by the piece or item produced \([pp. 35-36](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104138513&view=1up&seq=47)\).
1.3.1.5.3.1. Pro: Any variation in overall pay when based on piece rates would have resulted from organizational issues and worker speed \([pp. 35-36](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104138513&view=1up&seq=47)\).
1.3.1.5.3.2. Con: This claim is demonstratively false, as we know of several cases where everyone \(in this context men and woman\) were not paid the same piecemeal rate.
1.3.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Support for Journeyman rates under the [Spitalfields Acts](http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/spital5.html) were only extended to women in 1811 - thus until then there is clear evidence of man and women of equal skill being paid different piecemeal rates.
1.3.1.5.3.3. Con: The source talks about in a general sense how piecemeal rates may obscure wage rate equivalents, it is beyond the scope of the commentary and a [hasty generalisation](https://owl.excelsior.edu/argument-and-critical-thinking/logical-fallacies/logical-fallacies-hasty-generalization/) to assume that means that all workers were paid the same by piece
1.3.1.5.3.4. Con: This argument fails to consider the idea that in the historical context there was a clear divide between the intristinic value of an item produced by men/women and the perceived value of those items.
1.3.1.5.3.4.1. Pro: As an example, despite there being women artists of [great talent](https://www.christies.com/features/beyond-the-brotherhood-female-artists-of-the-victorian-era-9291-1.aspx) during the Victorian era, they were paid nowhere near the same rates per piece than their men counterparts. Stigma, prejudice and an unequal accumulation of fame - all led to gross differences in piecemeal rates.
1.3.2. Pro: A gender pay gap among qualified individuals cannot exist in competitive markets.
1.3.2.1. Con: Feelings of inadequacy lead to "[imposter syndrome](https://passage2pro.com/6-warning-signs-impostor-syndrome-might-be-sabotaging-your-job-search/)(impostor syndrome involves doubtful feelings about one’s abilities, and fears of being labeled as a fraud. People who are affected commonly feel inadequate and that they only have ever achieved anything as a result of luck or other people liking them.\n\nMany jobseekers afflicted with impostor feelings are not aware, resulting in them being stuck for a long time in their current predicaments. If your job search is taking longer than it should, you may just be caught in an impostor loop. Addressing it sooner than later may help increase your chances of getting the job you want.)," making some job seekers undersell themselves based on an inability to see their true standing in the job market.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Women are more likely to experience [imposter syndrome](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200724-why-imposter-syndrome-hits-women-and-women-of-colour-harder) in the workplace.
1.3.2.2. Con: The gender pay gap exists even in competitive markets including among entrepreneurs, because women entrepreneurs have to offer [lower rates](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/women-entrepreneurs-pay-gap-freshbooks-survey-28-percent-less-than-men.html) than their men counterparts in order to stay afloat.
1.3.2.3. Pro: In general, women tend to report greater [fear of success](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318981196_Fear_of_Success_on_Women%27s_Career_Development_A_Research_and_Future_Agenda)(The higher fear of success, then the lower discourage women from competing for the achievements thus affecting the women's career development.) as well as [failure](https://www.elle.com/life-love/a36828/why-women-are-afraid-of-failure/)(When Harvard economics professor Claudia Goldin set out to determine why male economics majors outnumber women by almost 3:1, she discovered that women who earn below an A in introductory economics classes are far more likely than their male peers to switch majors. According to her analysis, women who earned B's were half as likely as those who earned A's to stick with the major. But their male classmates weren't nearly so dissuaded: a man who earned a B was just as likely to major in economics as a man who earned an A. "Women are less likely to major in the field if in their first course they don't do super well," Goldin said in an interview. Another study shows that women don't process feedback the same way as men; high-achieving women in particular derive less confidence from positive feedback than men of the same caliber, and negative feedback takes a greater emotional toll.) than men. Thus, they may be less likely or willing to take the risks that are necessary for achievement in competitive environments.
1.3.2.4. Con: In the real world, [markets are rarely truly competitive](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_principles-of-managerial-economics/s07-01-why-perfect-competition-usuall.html)(One reason so few markets are perfectly competitive is that minimum efficient scales are so high that eventually the market can support only a few sellers. Although the contestable market model suggests that this factor alone does not preclude aggressive price competition between sellers, in most cases there is not really free entry for new firms. A new entrant will often face enormous startup capital requirements that prohibit entry by most modest-sized companies or individual entrepreneurs. Many markets are now influenced by brand recognition, so a new firm that lacks brand recognition faces the prospect of large promotional expenses and several periods with losses before being able to turn a profit. To justify the losses in the startup period, new entrants must expect they will see positive economic profits later to justify these losses, so the market is not likely to reach the stage of zero economic profit even if the new entrants join.). Factually demonstrating that a given market is truly competitive is the only way to prove that a pay gap does not exist.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Real markets rarely behave like perfectly competitive economic models of infinitely divisible consensual trades between an infinite number of perfectly rational workers and employers. Firms can only estimate marginal productivity, and their estimates may be biased.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: Since markets can be ordered within a [spectrum of competitiveness](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/vccs-eco202-17fa/chapter/introduction-to-cost-and-industry-structure/)(The Spectrum of Competition. Firms face different competitive situations. At one extreme—perfect competition—many firms are all trying to sell identical products. At the other extreme—monopoly—only one firm is selling the product, and this firm faces no competition. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly fall between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolistic competition is a situation with many firms selling similar, but not identical, products. Oligopoly is a situation with few firms that sell identical or similar products.), those that are less competitive could still have a gender wage gap.
1.3.2.5. Pro: If there were equally qualified women that could be hired for less pay, corporations would take advantage of this labor arbitrage. Thus, the current pay gap must be attributable to extraneous variables.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: [Many companies outsource](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp) certain aspects of their labor force specifically to save money.
1.3.2.5.2. Con: A range of barriers to entry prevent equally qualified women from being hired \(for lesser pay\) by employers.
1.3.2.5.2.1. Pro: The pressure to conform, a lack of transportation, and inflexibility in workplace-family balance are [significant barriers](https://www.ilo.org/infostories/en-GB/Stories/Employment/barriers-women#persistent-barriers) to women's entry into the workforce.
1.3.2.5.2.2. Pro: The lack of affordable care for children or family members is an obstacle for women, meaning that they cannot gain access to employment while caring for their dependents.
1.3.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: The lack of affordable care alone decreases a woman’s participation chances by an estimated [5 percentage in developing countries and 4 percentage in developed countries](https://www.ilo.org/infostories/en-GB/Stories/Employment/barriers-women#persistent-barriers).
1.3.2.5.2.3. Pro: Women risk [facing harassment](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/152881/44067-012-tacr-19.pdf)(\(p. 12\)) and even sexual assault on their daily commute, and so sometimes do not take opportunities for jobs that require extensive travel. This artificially increases their geographic inflexibility.
1.3.2.5.3. Con: A woman with qualifications identical to those of a man is likely to be perceived as deserving of a lower salary \([p. 4](https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/science_facultys_subtle_gender_biases_favor_male_students.pdf)(Our results revealed that both male and female faculty judged a female student to be less competent and less worthy of being hired than an identical male student, and also offered her a smaller starting salary and less career mentoring.)\).
1.3.2.5.4. Con: It would be more profitable for businesses to maintain the status quo by not incurring additional expenses related to the implementation of policies and actual payments to reduce the gender pay gap.
1.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.3.2.7. Con: Utility maximization may bias employer decisions \(e.g., hiring decisions\) and consumer beliefs \([p. 87](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/16111699.2006.9636127)(Beckerís analysis of discrimination is inlayed within the conventional economic analysis of utility-maximizing individuals and profit-maximizing firms that often straiten their behaviour. Beckerís model suggests that employees, co-workers or customers have tastes for discrimination against women that lead to a segregated workforce. He analysed such sources of discrimination: employers who had tastes for discrimination regarding their employees \(employer discrimination\), employees who had tastes for discrimination regarding their co-workers \(employee discrimination\) and customers who had tastes for discrimination regarding the suppliers with whom they interacted \(customer discrimination\). Employers who\nwillingly employ women as secretaries may be reluctant to hire them as constructor.)\). Thus, everyone would be [maximizing their utility](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-20-0002/452000022019001-eng.htm)(One perspective, coming from economics, is that individuals are rational, self-interested, and preference or “utility” maximizing, meaning that they will always select the course of action from which they derive the most satisfaction, given their relatively stable preferences.), thereby allowing a gender wage gap to exist within a competitive market.
1.3.3. Con: Men and women do not have equal opportunities to enter certain \(high-paying\) sections of the labor market.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Opportunities presented to women are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those presented to men.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/a_equal_20050502.pdf)(p. 11-14) conducted by the [Open Society Institute](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/equal-opportunities-women-and-men) has found that in all EU countries, unequal economic and social opportunities for women exist due to factors such as their increased risk for sexual harassment and assault.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Women are under-represented in high-paying jobs.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: A pay gap attributable to the under-representation of women in high-paying jobs does not explain why a pay gap persists among [low-wage employees](https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/)(At the 10th percentile, women are paid 92 cents on the male dollar, whereas women at the 95th percentile are paid 74 cents relative to the dollar of their male counterparts’ hourly wages.).
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: There is [still a pay gap](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/the-gender-pay-gap-stretches-to-minimum-wage-workers-too)(Indeed, according to data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia \(HILDA\) Survey, women on a minimum wage earn roughly 10% less per hour than men on the minimum rate. While the minimum wage gap is smaller than the 19% gap among those paid above the minimum wage, it is still sizeable.\n\n\[...\]\n\nUnlike wages for workers earning above-minimum wages, the gap among minimum-wage workers cannot stem from employer discrimination, superior negotiating skills of men, or higher productivity of men, since everyone is being paid the minimum permissible rate of pay.\n\nIn fact, minimum wages are systematically lower in jobs more commonly held by women. For example, minimum wage workers in the health care sector earn substantially less than similarly skilled minimum wage workers in road transportation.) between men and women on minimum wage.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Using the median [accounts for up to half](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-resources/pay-and-pensions/pay-initiatives/2020-gender-pay-gap-report/mean-and-median-gender-pay-gap/) of the pay gap, showing that the source of the gap is the presence of more men in high-income jobs evidenced by the lack of a gap in middle-to-low-income jobs.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: The under-representation of women in [high-income jobs](https://www.hec.edu/en/knowledge/articles/why-so-few-women-occupy-most-lucrative-jobs) is in itself a manifestation of gender inequality in labor participation and should be fixed to reduce the pay gap.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.3.3.1.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.
1.3.3.3. Con: The focus should be on improving the equality of opportunity and reducing labor market rigidities, which will improve the gender pay gap over time \([p. 26](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/32800121/FULL_TEXT.PDF)(Reveal that of the gender pay gap, one third \(36%\) is accounted for by life-time working-patterns, one fifth \(18%\) by labour market rigidities, one tenth \(8%\) by formal education and over one third \(38%\) by other factors associated with being female, including discrimination.)\).
1.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.
1.3.4. Con: The pay gap has been [narrowing](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/)(As has been the case in recent decades, the 2020 wage gap was smaller for workers ages 25 to 34 than for all workers 16 and older. Women ages 25 to 34 earned 93 cents for every dollar a man in the same age group earned on average. In 1980, women ages 25 to 34 earned 33 cents less than their male counterparts, compared with 7 cents in 2020. The estimated 16-cent gender pay gap among all workers in 2020 was down from 36 cents in 1980.). This underscores not only the existence of a very real pay gap but also the effectiveness of different measures in attentuating this divide.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The pay gap narrows further when companies [remove ambiguity from salaries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/13/boston-wants-to-teach-every-woman-in-the-city-to-negotiate-better-pay/)(Research shows when companies remove ambiguity from wage-setting, such as establishing clear pay ranges for workers at every level, disparities between the sexes start to disappear.) and establish pay scales for each role.
1.3.4.2. Con: A narrowing pay gap does not necessarily imply an increase in women's pay. Instead, it can be caused by a [decline in men's pay](https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/)(\[A\]bout 30 percent of the reduction was due to the decline in men’s wages. The stagnation and decline of median men’s wages has played a significant role in the decline in the unadjusted gender wage gap.).
1.3.4.3. Con: The current pay gap may not have the same causative sexist preconditions as those that contributed to the pay gap across the past few decades. Thus, the pay gap may not reduce any further.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Throughout history, [women have been barred](https://littlethings.com/lifestyle/women-banned-from-jobs/2421916-1) from many professions.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: In the US, the [Equal Pay Act](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/equal-pay-act-1963) came into force only in 1963.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that the reduction in the pay gap has pleateaued. In fact, the past few years are among those that have witnessed the [most substantial gains](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/30/womens-lead-in-skills-and-education-is-helping-narrow-the-gender-wage-gap/) in terms of bridging the pay gap.
1.3.4.3.4. Con: Many sexist preconditions, such as gender roles \(e.g., greater [household work](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-men-household-chores-domestic-house-gender-norms-a9021586.html) undertaken by women\), continue to exist. Thus, as such inequities continue to reduce, the pay gap may attenuate and ultimately disappear.
1.3.4.3.5. Con: The hard-to-refute proof of a [historical wage gap](https://www.investopedia.com/history-gender-wage-gap-america-5074898) lends credence to the idea that a modern day one might still exist.
1.3.4.3.5.1. Pro: Classical labor theory has no ability to explain a difference of 60% \([p. 30](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104138513&view=1up&seq=42&skin=2021)\) in wage rates between groups with similar labor costs.
1.3.4.3.5.2. Pro: Classical labor cost theory alone cannot explain a rise in relative earning from to [53%](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2523398?seq=8#metadata_info_tab_contents) to [78%](https://patch.com/illinois/chicago/here-s-how-much-less-women-make-illinois-gender-pay-gap) for the same group \(i.e., women\) in a state like Illinois.
1.3.4.3.6. Pro: Victorian gender ideals suggested that [a woman's primary role](https://www.mckendree.edu/academics/scholars/issue18/appell.htm)(Women in the Victorian society had one main role in life, which was to marry and take part in their husbands’ interests and business. Before marriage, they would learn housewife skills such as weaving, cooking, washing, and cleaning, unless they were of a wealthy family. If they were wealthy, they did not always learn these tasks because their maids primarily took care of the household chores. Typically, women were also not allowed to be educated or gain knowledge outside of the home because it was a man’s world. One critic, Richard D. Altick states, “a woman was inferior to a man in all ways except the unique one that counted most \[to a man\]: her femininity. Her place was in the home, on a veritable pedestal if one could be afforded, and emphatically not in the world of affairs” \(Altick 54\). Patriarchal society did not allow women to have the same privileges as men.) was to marry and participate in their husband's interests. This directly discouraged upstanding women from taking part in paid work.
1.3.4.3.7. Pro: Early labour legislation actually [limited the work hours of women and barred them from entering certain occupations](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-work-organization-648000/Women-in-the-workforce).
1.3.4.4. Pro: [Changes](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/09/gender-pay-gap-facts/)(As has been the case in recent decades, the 2020 wage gap was smaller for workers ages 25 to 34 than for all workers 16 and older. Women ages 25 to 34 earned 93 cents for every dollar a man in the same age group earned on average. In 1980, women ages 25 to 34 earned 33 cents less than their male counterparts, compared with 7 cents in 2020. The estimated 16-cent gender pay gap among all workers in 2020 was down from 36 cents in 1980.) in the pay gap over time prove that it is not a natural side-effect but an artificial \(and rectifiable\) phenomenon.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Over time, the [pay gap narrows](https://www.investopedia.com/history-gender-wage-gap-america-5074898)(- The gender wage gap historically refers to pay disparities between men and women doing the same work. There is also a racial wage gap.\n\n- Congress didn’t take major action to address the gender wage gap until the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, although the “Equal Pay for Equal Work” movement dates back to the 1860s.\n\n- The gender wage gap has narrowed over the years, but women still earn about 83 cents for every dollar that men earn.) as public awareness of this gender inequity increases.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: Taking active steps to reduce the gender pay gap is [good publicity for businesses](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/19/gm-tops-new-gender-equality-ranking-at-americas-largest-companies.html)(You can’t fix what you don’t measure — so the saying goes — and a new study by Equileap crunches the numbers on gender equality at America’s biggest companies.\n\nGeneral Motors, Bank of America and Johnson & Johnson were awarded top marks across 19 criteria, including gender balance in the workforce \(senior management and the board\), as well as pay equity, parental leave and non-discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nFor investors and consumers looking for companies working to close the gender gap, the new ranking provides some guidance, Equileap CEO and co-founder Diana van Maasdijk tells CNBC Make It. “I hope that they will use this information to make the right choices \[about\] the companies that they should be looking at.”) and may earn them more customers.
1.3.4.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.2.
1.3.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Paying women employees less than men makes businesses look [bad to customers](https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1219). This should incentivize companies to prioritize equality and diversity.
1.3.4.4.1.1.3. Con: Many men think the pay gap [has been invented to serve a political purpose](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/46percent-of-american-men-think-the-gender-pay-gap-is-made-up.html)(Data from the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates that women earn, on average, 81 cents for every dollar a man makes.\n\nBut almost four in 10 Americans think the gender wage gap isn’t real.\n\nInstead, 46 percent of men and 30 percent of women believe the problem of equal pay and gender parity has been “made up to serve a political purpose” and is not a “legitimate issue,” according to a survey of 8,566 American adults conducted in March by SurveyMonkey.). These men will probably not look favourably on a company that is actively trying to address it.
1.3.4.4.1.2. Con: Public awareness can affect discernible changes even if no such issue exists in the first place.
1.3.4.4.1.2.1. Con: On average, women earn [$0.82 per dollar](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/03/24/482141/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/) earned by a White man.
1.3.4.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The very manner in which the statistic is framed is androcentric. In other words, these statistics could just as well be framed for each dollar a woman makes, but men's pay continues to be held as the standard against which women's pay is measured.
1.3.4.4.1.2.2. Pro: Public opinion on [governmental role in solving inequalities](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01972243.2011.548695) is significantly influenced by [how an issue is framed](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/framing-effect/). Thus, regardless of whether an issue is a genuine problem, public opinion can be swayed by framing it in such a way that it triggers the desired emotions and actions.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: The fact that something changes over time does not correlate with, let alone prove, any form of "naturalness."
1.3.5. Pro: The gender pay gap is the product of specific calculations, since it is a very complex and multi-factorial issue. Some [frameworks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karinagness/2016/04/12/dont-buy-into-the-gender-pay-gap-myth/?sh=7124b4722596)(It is no wonder college women buy into this 78 cent pay gap myth.\n\nBut the White House and others who promote the myth are manipulating statistics in a way to convince women that they are the victims of systematic societal discrimination, and, therefore, stand to benefit from further government action.\n\nUsing the statistic that women make 78 cents on the dollar as evidence of rampant discrimination has been debunked over and over again. That statistic doesn’t take into account a lot of choices that women and men make—education, years of experience and hours worked—that influence earnings. If we want to have a fruitful discussion about a gender wage gap, we should have it after the comparison is adjusted for those factors.) deny its existence.
1.3.5.1. Con: Most metrics used to assess inequality are grounded in complex multi-factorial frameworks. If anything, their complexity underscores rather than invalidates the robustness of such indices.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: The Gender Inequality Index, represented by a single score for each country, is computed based on scores on four major dimensions and several sub-dimensions \([p. 8](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf)(The index benchmarks national gender gaps on economic, education, health and political criteria \(see Figure 1\), and provides country rankings that allow for effective comparisons across regions and income groups. The rankings are designed to create global awareness of the challenges posed by gender gaps and the opportunities created by reducing them. The methodology and quantitative analysis behind the rankings are intended to serve as a basis for designing effective measures for reducing gender gaps.\n\nThis year’s 14th edition continues to build on the well-established methodology. While it would be important to measure differences in opportunities and conditions across the full spectrum of gender identities, data availability limits the possibility to convert these aspirations into statistical measurement. As such, the index and the analysis remain focused on benchmarking progress on disparities between women and men across the four dimensions mentioned above.)\).
1.3.5.1.2. Con: Most metrics used to assess inequality are quantitative rather than qualitative. Thus, they cannot capture nuanced differences in inequality that may be erased by composite quantitative metrics \([p. 7](https://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/object/ir-1023)(When the UNDP first introduced composite indices, people agreed that they had a high potential to spur academic research, policy analysis, and country monitoring and evaluation. As of the early 2000s, however, these indicators had not actually shaped much discussion or debate about gender equality, nor had they led to increased attention to and policies regarding the issue \(Schüler, 2006: 164\). Instead, they had resulted in confusion about and misinterpretation of the underlying causes of gender inequality. Experts and scholars continue to identify problems with composite \nindices, and they are frequently criticized and reworked. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that, despite these revisions, composite indices come with a host of drawbacks that are not worth their benefits.)\).
1.3.5.2. Pro: The methodology used to compute the pay gap metric is flawed as [income distributions](https://campuspress.yale.edu/sabrinacales/2015/08/03/the-negotiator-us-salaries-are-not-normal-ly-distributed/)(According to the US Census Bureau, the mean household salary is ~$50,000, with first and fifth quintile boundaries of ~$21k and $106k. This means that 20% of households make less than $21,000 per year and the 20% of the population make more than $106k. The highest earners make $196k or more and comprise of 5% of the population. The distribution is positively skewed with a sharp peak at lower salaries and an extended tail towards higher salaries \(distribution\). This is not a normal distribution but one that may be more closely approximated by a log-normal distribution. I’ll present the modeling analysis of the real data in a future post.\n\nFor the meantime, I use a normal distribution with mean of $50,000 and standard deviation of $20,000. The model and values now define an array of salaries with probability \(percent\) attached to them. With this model a salary of $70,000 has a z-score \(or standard score\) of 1.0 and thus lies higher than 84.1% above the other salaries in the distribution) are not [Gaussian](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-data-distributions/)(The Gaussian distribution, named for Carl Friedrich Gauss, is the focus of much of the field of statistics.\n\nData from many fields of study surprisingly can be described using a Gaussian distribution, so much so that the distribution is often called the “normal” distribution because it is so common.\n\n\[...\]\n\nRunning the example creates a line plot showing the sample space in the x-axis and the likelihood of each value of the y-axis. The line plot shows the familiar bell-shape for the Gaussian distribution.\n\nThe top of the bell shows the most likely value from the distribution, called the expected value or the mean, which in this case is zero, as we specified in creating the distribution.). As such, the median should be used as the basis of comparison because looking at the average is not useful in this context.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Though there are a number of [different ways](https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/)(The presence of alternative ways to measure the gap can create a misconception that data on the gender wage gap are unreliable. However, the data on the gender wage gap are remarkably clear and \(unfortunately\) consistent about the scale of the gap. In simple terms, no matter how you measure it, there is a gap. And, different gaps answer different questions.) to compute the pay gap, none of them suggest that the pay gap does not exist.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: Faulty methodologies yield faulty metrics. However, the gender pay gap metric fluctuates in accordance with the expected outcomes of corrective interventions, such as pay gap [reporting requirements](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_NEW/PUBLICATIONS/abstract.asp?index=7804)(This paper contributes to the debate by analyzing the UK’s recent reporting policy, in which employers are mandated to publicly report simple measures of their gender pay gap each year. Exploiting a discontinuous size threshold in the policy’s coverage, I apply a difference-in-difference strategy to linked employer-employee payroll data. I find that the introduction of reporting requirements led to a 1.6 percentage-point narrowing of the gender pay gap at affected employers. This large-magnitude effect is primarily due to a decline in male wages within affected employers, and is not caused by a change in the composition of the workforce. To explain this effect, I propose that a worker preference against high pay gap employers induces the closing of pay gaps upon information revelation.).
1.3.5.2.3. Con: When using the [median hourly rate](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-resources/pay-and-pensions/principles-of-pay-and-recognition/gender-and-ethnicity-pay-gap/gender-and-ethnicity-mean-and-median-pay-gaps/)(The median pay gap is the difference between the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings of men and women and BME and white staff. It takes all salaries in the sample, lines them up in order from lowest to highest, and picks the middle salary. We believe this is a more representative measure of the pay gap at Imperial because it is not affected by outliers – a few individuals at the top or bottom of the range.\n\nThe mean gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women and BME staff and white staff.\n\nThe main reason for both of these gaps is that we have more men than women in our senior, more well-paid roles. This is also true for having more white staff than BME staff in senior, more well-paid roles. There has however been a small shift, with a higher proportion of women represented in the upper-middle quartiles compared to 2020.), total pay for women is still lower.
1.3.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.
1.3.5.3. Pro: The gender pay gap is often conflated with the unadjusted pay gap. When other extraneous factors are controlled for, the pay gap attenuates.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: Attributing the pay gap to extraneous factors "gives people an [excuse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2020/03/30/on-equal-pay-day-what-is-the-real-gender-pay-gap/) to think there’s not a problem."
1.3.5.3.2. Con: An attenuated pay gap is still a pay gap.
1.3.5.3.3. Pro: The gender pay gap is largely attributable to gender differences in work-related factors, rooted in individual choice.
1.3.5.3.3.1. Pro: Controlling for employer- and job-level factors narrows the pay gap down to 5.4% for base pay \([p. 19](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf)\).
1.3.5.3.3.2. Con: If women are expected and forced by circumstance to take on more free labour, then that should be factored into the wage gap not dismissed as a mere "choice."
1.3.5.3.3.2.1. Pro: Placing all the blame on individual preferences ignores the discrimination women have been facing for centuries that impact their ability to gain respect, promotions, and raises in the workplace.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Individual choices are affected by [discrimination](https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap), and, even after accounting for choices, there is still room and evidence for discrimination.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2. Con: Individual preferences that create demonstrably different [work statistics by gender](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty) will have a negative influence on perceptions of equal workplace value.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.5.3.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Making decisions about individual capacity based on stereotypes about a group of people is the definition of discrimination, which is illegal.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2.3. Con: Being perceived as a member of a group with a weaker profile of desirable attributes can [trigger stereotype threat](https://www.npr.org/2012/07/12/156664337/stereotype-threat-why-women-quit-science-jobs) and cause women to underperform, thereby contributing to skill gaps where they exist.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: Until men and women demonstrate identical work outcomes, there will be a sentiment that discrimination is justified because it reflects workplace realities.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2.4.1. Con: All things considered, men and women [do not differ](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959285.2016.1224884?journalCode=hhup20) significantly on performance metrics.
1.3.5.3.3.2.1.2.4.2. Con: Feelings are not facts, and sentiments do not legitimize what has been prohibited by law.
1.3.5.3.3.2.2. Con: The fact that not all women become primary carers, and [many men do take on primary childcare responsibilities](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/25/stay-at-home-dads-fathers-childcarers), demonstrates that mothers are not forced into caring roles, and can choose to act as they see fit.
1.3.5.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: Some [companies](https://www.workingmother.com/working-mother-100-best-companies-2018) offer very good conditions for working parents that may allow women to share childcare tasks.
1.3.5.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: Many heterosexual couples "share the burden of childcare fairly [equally](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/24/health/couples-share-childcare-burden/index.html)" and, according to studies, they tend to be happier.
1.3.5.3.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: In recent years, even though women spend more weekly time on [childcare](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/24/health/couples-share-childcare-burden/index.html) \(13.7 hours\) than they did in the 1960s \(10.5 hours\), "men are putting in a lot more time now \(7.2 hours\) than before \(2.5 hours\)".
1.3.5.3.3.2.2.3. Con: While women are not forced to do so, research points out that even in dual-earner families that [share](http://theconversation.com/dual-earner-couples-share-the-housework-equally-until-the-first-baby-comes-41328) households tasks, the labour division becomes less equitable after the first baby is born.
1.3.5.3.3.2.2.4. Pro: In the UK, between 2001 and 2011, there was a [tenfold increase](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/25/stay-at-home-dads-fathers-childcarers) in the number of stay-at-home fathers. In 2011, one in seven fathers \(14%\) was the main childcare provider in his family.
1.3.5.3.3.3. Pro: [Research from Uber](http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/uber-gender-pay-gap-study/) illustrates that the 7% pay gap within their employee pool is due to factors other than gender discrimination.
1.3.5.3.3.3.1. Con: The "factors other than gender discrimination" that the authors refer to are largely driver behaviors, which in turn could be shaped by differential gender-linked socialization patterns and experiences.
1.3.5.3.3.3.2. Con: A [lead author](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16980072/uber-driver-gender-earnings-gap-study)(“Driving fast. But I also think it’s a mixture of constraints, and what I mean by that is men work more hours and take more trips than the average woman. So, why is that? Part of it is because women have more constraints — i.e, take the kid to school in the morning. Be responsible for taking Johnny to the soccer game. And I think those constraints then lead women to actually receive less experience and less learning-by-doing. So I think it’s actually a mixture of preferences and constraints. Now as policy makers, what we want to do is make sure that we can alleviate those constraints as much as possible.”) on the study himself acknowledged that women's roles and responsibilities can make it difficult for women to make as many trips as their male counterparts.
1.3.5.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: One of the factors for the observed pay gap was that men "[were more likely to chose to drive longer trips](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16980072/uber-driver-gender-earnings-gap-study)." This is not a luxury that would be available to women who are expected to be present at home and act as the primary caregiver.
1.3.5.3.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Longer trips could also mean that women have to drive at late hours or beyond city limits. These pose significant security risks to women.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3. Con: The corporation Uber, and subsequently their product, the Uber app, are both very biased and therefore, unreliable sources to carry out research that should be conducted independently.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: The interpretation of the research findings is founded upon the notion that [algorithms](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency)(But these systems can be biased based on who builds them, how they’re developed, and how they’re ultimately used. This is commonly known as algorithmic bias. It’s tough to figure out exactly how systems might be susceptible to algorithmic bias, especially since this technology often operates in a corporate black box. We frequently don’t know how a particular artificial intelligence or algorithm was designed, what data helped build it, or how it works. \n\[...\]\nAnother example of how training data can produce sexism in an algorithm occurred a few years ago, when Amazon tried to use AI to build a résumé-screening tool. According to Reuters, the company’s hope was that technology could make the process of sorting through job applications more efficient. It built a screening algorithm using résumés the company had collected for a decade, but those résumés tended to come from men. That meant the system, in the end, learned to discriminate against women.) are [gender-blind](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16980072/uber-driver-gender-earnings-gap-study)(The results are surprising, given that Uber has long argued that its algorithms that determine how much drivers earn are supposed to be blind to things like race, gender, and sexuality. The technology, however, did not take into account differences in driver behavior, which can vary between men and women.), which is not necessarily true.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2. Pro: The interpretation of the study findings is blind to the fact that the ride-sharing industry, particularly Uber, is not [women-friendly](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46990533), evidenced by the [low proportion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/04/09/female-uber-lyft-drivers/?sh=375a5616a28e) of women drivers.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: [Sexual harassment](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46990533) and assault are commonly experienced by women drivers who work for ride-sharing companies.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: If the strategies employed by women drivers to deter \(e.g., being cold or detached\) or retaliate against sexual advances are perceived negatively, it could result in low ratings and ultimately affect the trips that are made available to them.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.1.2. Con: The rate of sexual harassment and assault faced by women drivers is [low](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/04/09/female-uber-lyft-drivers/?sh=375a5616a28e)("Lyft, Uber and Sidecar combined are doing north of 1 million rides per day," Allen said. "If the perceived risk matched the actual risk you'd hear about a lot more incidents. But perception is reality in many cases. It keeps them away."). Incorrect perceptions of the scale of this problem make it difficult for women to pursue this line of work.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.1.3. Con: Women-only ride-hailing services could mitigate this problem.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Brazil, one of the world's largest ride-sharing markets, has several [women-only apps](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-42097521) for both drivers and riders.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.1.3.2. Con: Creating women-only spaces or services reinforces the idea that women can protect themselves only by isolating themselves from men. This is impractical in a world where men and women need to work alongside each other.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.2. Pro: Uber is notorious for its [sexist](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142081/susan-fowler-uber-whistleblower-interview-silicon-valley-discrimination-harassment) [corporate](https://www.glamour.com/story/uber-travis-kalanick-stepped-down) [culture](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/04/09/female-uber-lyft-drivers/?sh=375a5616a28e).
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.2.3. Con: Ride-hailing companies have taken [initiatives](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/04/09/female-uber-lyft-drivers/?sh=375a5616a28e)(Uber knows this is a problem. Last month, the company pledged to create 1 million driver jobs for women by 2020, a promise that was accompanied by a "global partnership" with UN Women and a rosy video highlighting women at the wheel. But that announcement hit a bump a week later when UN Women backed away from the partnership under pressure from union groups who called Uber driver jobs "precarious.") to increase the number of women drivers on their application.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.3. Pro: Three of the five authors have disclosed significant [conflicts of interest](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24732): two authors were employed by Uber, whereas one was Uber's Chief Economist at the time of the study.
1.3.5.3.3.3.3.4. Con: Uber has the [world's largest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111015/story-uber.asp) network of drivers; their accumulated data are particularly well-suited for this type of research.
1.3.5.3.3.3.4. Pro: The remaining one-sixth of the gap in earnings  is explained by differences in where people choose to drive, with men, on average, driving in locations with higher surge and lower wait times.
1.3.5.3.3.3.4.1. Con: Women may actively avoid driving in unsafe locations or late at night to avoid harassment and assault. They must not be penalized for making decisions that prioritize their [safety](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/dark-realities-of-uber-lyft-women-drivers-speak-about-on-job-harassment-118121801089_1.html) over profits.
1.3.5.3.3.3.4.2. Pro: Using these study findings to inform women drivers about the strategies their male counterparts use to earn a higher wage could help them increase their pay and bridge the pay gap.
1.3.5.3.3.3.5. Pro: According to the report, experience accounts for one-third of the earnings gap.
1.3.5.3.3.3.5.1. Pro: The gender difference in [driving experience](https://www.argionislaw.com/car-accidents/who-causes-more-car-accidents-men-or-women/) has also been observed among the general public.
1.3.5.3.3.3.5.2. Con: Stereotypes that women are bad drivers and on-road harassment may reduce the frequency and duration of driving among women.
1.3.5.3.3.3.6. Pro: About half of the earnings gap is explained by differences in driving speed, according to Uber.
1.3.5.3.3.3.6.1. Pro: Men, particularly younger men, drive [faster](https://www.argionislaw.com/car-accidents/who-causes-more-car-accidents-men-or-women/) than women.
1.3.5.3.3.3.6.2. Con: Faster speeds translate into more [accidents](https://www.argionislaw.com/car-accidents/who-causes-more-car-accidents-men-or-women/)(The faster you drive your car, the higher the possibility you will get in an accident. This is especially true with younger men, as those under age 34 are almost twice as likely to die in a crash caused by high speeds than women.); men drivers who choose to take such risks are being rewarded for unsafe driving.
1.3.5.3.4. Pro: Equal pay cannot be considered fair pay, as men deserve more for the work they do.
1.3.5.3.4.1. Pro: [Men work longer hours](https://www.statista.com/statistics/280749/monthly-full-time-weekly-hours-of-work-in-the-uk-by-gender-year-on-year/)(The overall number of hours worked by males and females in the United Kingdom fell sharply from January 2020 onwards, dropping to an average of 497 million hours for males, and 344 million hours for females in the three months to May 2020, a decline of 125 million and 85 million respectively when compared with the start of the year. In the most recent month, the overall number of hours worked by males was 603.7 million, and 437.8 million for females.), so their annual salaries should be higher.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1. Con: Studies that suggest men work more hours than women are methodologically flawed.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf) comparing hours worked, such as the commonly cited US Department of Labor Statistics, are generally self reported.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is [evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/) that men overestimate and women underestimate the hours they work at any given task.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: If working hours are not independently or objectively verified, they cannot be accepted as fact without scrutiny.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1.3. Con: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority stipulates the same hourly wages for all employees. Yet, analyses of their time cards suggest that women earn less because they tend to [decline overtime driving assignments](https://fee.org/articles/harvard-study-gender-pay-gap-explained-entirely-by-work-choices-of-men-and-women/).
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This study was conducted under specific circumstances at one entity and cannot be used to generalize across a variety of other industries and companies.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The study findings clearly suggest that [gender norms](https://fee.org/articles/harvard-study-gender-pay-gap-explained-entirely-by-work-choices-of-men-and-women/)(Fathers were more likely than childless men to want the extra cash from overtime, and mothers were more likely to want time off than childless women.) rather than gender per se explains this divide: fathers work more hours because they need to earn more money to support their families, whereas mothers work fewer hours because they need to care for their families.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.2. Con: Differences in productivity are incredibly difficult to completely prove one way or the other; any study is better than none, and the summation of a number of different studies helps paint a clearer picture.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Any study is not better than none. A methodologically poor study could yield misleading findings, which, if used to formulate policies, could have damaging effects on the target group.
1.3.5.3.4.1.1.2.2. Con: A summation of many different studies may not necessarily paint a clearer picture of the phenomenon of interest. Gender differences, for example, continue to be [hotly debated](https://family.jrank.org/pages/685/Gender-Conceptualization-Gender.html)(Maximalists believe that the differences between men and women are large and deeply rooted. Minimalists, in contrast, maintain that differences among men and among women are larger than the differences between men and women \(Anselmi and Law 1998\).) even within the scientific community.
1.3.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: Anyone, regardless of their gender, who does the same job as someone else but works longer hours deserves more pay. Thus, if men, on average, work longer hours, their higher pay is justified.
1.3.5.3.4.1.3. Pro: The US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that, among full-time workers, men worked an average of eight hours per day compared to women who worked slightly more than seven hours per day \([p. 15](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf)(Table 4)\).
1.3.5.3.4.1.4. Con: A portion of the difference in the number of hours worked has to do with the [part-time nature of many jobs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/29/men-say-they-work-more-than-women-heres-the-truth/)("This difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working part time," the authors explained.) that women work, often against their will.
1.3.5.3.4.1.4.1. Pro: Women frequently have to take [temporary jobs and part-time work](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/05/mothers-working-part-time-hit-hard-by-gender-pay-gap-study-shows), missing out on the potential earnings boost from staying in a full-time, permanent job.
1.3.5.3.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.
1.3.5.3.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: In Ireland, because childcare services "on average equate to over 50% of the average weekly wage, it is often more economically viable for one parent to either stop working, or to work part-time hours, and care for their children themselves”. This responsibility often falls on [mothers](https://www.accaglobal.com/an/en/member/member/accounting-business/2018/03/corporate/gender-pay.html) and contributes to the gender pay gap.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5. Con: Women, particularly married women with children, do not have the opportunity to work as many hours as men, because they do a disproportionate amount of childcare and housework. Thus, the situation is [gendered](https://www.statista.com/statistics/280749/monthly-full-time-weekly-hours-of-work-in-the-uk-by-gender-year-on-year/) and leaves women at a disadvantage.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1. Con: People should not expect to be economically compensated by the rest of society for caring for their own children.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.1. Con: In the past, many basic labor rights, such as those [relating to overtime](https://www.minimum-wage.org/articles/what-is-overtime)(Before overtime regulations were introduced in 1938, working hours were often exceedingly long and brutal for the average American worker. Blue-collar employees in industrial settings often worked 10-16 hours a day - many employers took advantage of high poverty rates to force their employees to work around the clock just to earn enough money to keep food on the table.), were also withheld. Just because we don't currently expect to be compensated fairly for our labor does not mean such actions are justified.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: The benefit reaped by society for the care of a child is minimal in comparison to the benefit reaped by the parent or child themselves.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Women may invest in childcare as children may offer a strong sense of security in their later years. Thus, what they may lose in income, they may gain in interpersonal support and security.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Not being financially independent renders women more [vulnerable to abuse](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/older-adult-abuse-gender) by family members in older adulthood.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: The most common perpetrators of [older adult abuse](https://www.apa.org/pi/prevent-violence/resources/elder-abuse) are adult children. Investing in childcare for post-retirement security is, thus, a gamble.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Many adult children](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinseatonjefferson/2017/04/30/new-survey-finds-adult-children-want-their-parents-to-age-at-home/?sh=10e5c21b44bf)(Some 60% of boomers admit they are concerned about juggling the responsibilities of caring for family with caring for aging parents and loved ones. Nevertheless, they still overwhelmingly said they would want them to age at home, with nearly 20 percent reporting they would want their parents to live with them as their parents grow old. Only 15% said they would want their parents to age in a senior care facility.) want to be there for their parents in their old age and care for them, despite other [significant commitments](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/8-point-2-million-parents-of-children-under-age-18-provided-eldercare-in-2017-18.htm).
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: The most common reasons to have children, such as having someone who will care for you in your old age, are highly selfish.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.3. Con: Many people choosing to not have children could lead to [significant decreases in the fertility rate](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53409521), which could prove detrimental to society and human sustenance.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.3. Pro: Having children is an individual choice that only the parents who made such a choice are accountable for.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.3.1. Con: In many cultures, [childcare falls to the grandparents](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol27/4/) so that the parents are able to work and support the extended family.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.3.2. Con: Religious, socio-cultural, legal, and medical factors can all limit the level of freedom that couples can exercise when it comes to parenthood.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.3.3. Con: It is not always the case that both parents decide to have a child. Both men and women can be "[tricked](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2059548/Four-men-reveal-trauma-dad-deception.html)" into childbearing.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.4. Pro: Women \(and men\) are compensated with the time spent with their child and the ability to watch them grow up and develop.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Studies have repeatedly and consistently found that having children makes people less happy. This phenomenon is so robust yet counterintuitive that researchers have called it the "[parenthood paradox](https://positivepsychology.com/parenthood-paradox/)."
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: Having children makes people less happy in certain countries; in others, it has been known to [increase overall happiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222535/).
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: Among parents aged 50 to 70 years, only those whose [adult children had left home](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2213655-having-kids-makes-you-happier-but-only-when-they-move-out/) were happier than their childfree counterparts.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.4.2. Pro: Spending more time with their children means that childcare costs would be lower, [increasing overall happiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222535/)(The negative effects of childcare costs on happiness are significantly exacerbated for parents; this means that nations reducing the cost of care with some form of social provision from the top percentage \(24.7% of median wage\) to the bottom percentage \(4.5% of median wage\) in our sample increased parental happiness by .081.).
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.4.3. Con: Being able to spend time with one's children and watch them grow up is not compensation if it wasn't desired in the first place.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.5. Con: For people to have children is the single highest social imperative to continue a society. It, therefore, has economic value which goes unpaid.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.4.1.4.1.2.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3. Pro: Men should choose to do more childcare and housework so that women are able to work more hours and earn higher salaries.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: A similar sentiment is echoed by the [contention](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/47/78/a7/4778a78c357590bc471ebc8c05ed1ec5.jpg), "It's impossible for women to have it all, if they have to do it all."
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.2. Con: Men have no incentive to do more childcare and housework.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.2.1. Con: Women have no incentive to do childcare and housework either. Instead, they appear to take on these responsibilities out of a sense of moral obligation. Men should hold up their end of the bargain.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.2.2. Pro: Moral obligations aside, men who avoid taking care of their [domestic responsibilities](https://evoke.ie/2021/06/17/extra/study-shows-that-married-men-who-avoid-housework-earn-more)(Researchers have discovered that married men who don’t help out around the house tend to earn higher salaries than husbands who do more domestic chores.\n\nAccording to the new study, ‘disagreeable’ men are less likely to do household chores which allows them to dedicate more energy to their jobs and hence, results in higher pay.) are monetarily rewarded.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.2.3. Con: Greater participation and childcare and housework confers benefits on individual and interpersonal functioning among men.
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: Equal responsibility-taking on the domestic front [improves marital relationships](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/heres-what-women-could-earn-if-household-chores-were-compensated.html): "partners are happier and less depressed, conflicts are fewer, and divorce rates are [lower](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/506417?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21105365505861)."
1.3.5.3.4.1.5.3.2.3.2. Pro: Doing more childcare and housework has a positive impact on [men's health](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/heres-what-women-could-earn-if-household-chores-were-compensated.html)(\[F\]athers who spend more time with their children experience greater satisfaction at work, as well as lowered blood pressure and rates of cardiovascular disease.), including improving their longevity.
1.3.5.3.4.2. Pro: Men are promoted more often and work [at higher posts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18187449); they deserve higher pay.
1.3.5.3.4.2.1. Con: Women are discriminated against, consciously or subconsciously, and [passed over for promotions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/29/men-say-they-work-more-than-women-heres-the-truth/).
1.3.5.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: Managers choose to promote men over women because they worry [she might become pregnant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/21/why-women-are-afraid-to-tell-employers-theyre-pregnant/).
1.3.5.3.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.3.5.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: When men and women interview for promotions using the same script, unconscious bias causes the men to be perceived as smooth, while the [women are considered too demanding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/13/boston-wants-to-teach-every-woman-in-the-city-to-negotiate-better-pay/)(In a 2005 study, Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon and co-author of “Women Don’t Ask,” famously showed people videos of men and women asking for a raise, using the same words. Among male viewers, the men’s negotiating style won approval, while the women registered as too demanding.\n\nThese judgments, Babcock wrote, probably don’t happen on purpose. In some ways, that makes them harder to fend off, which is why some scholars advise business owners to entirely ban salary negotiations.\n\n“People will think, ‘I’m not sexist’ or ‘I’m not racist,’ ” said Hannah Bowles, a public policy professor at Harvard University, “but certain biases can creep into their perceptions.”).

1.3.5.3.4.3. Con: Men are inefficient workers; they deserve to be paid less than women if worker productivity is considered as the determining factor.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1. Pro: Some manufacturing companies prefer to hire women, who are [far more productive](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/new-face-of-workplace-all-female-staff/articleshow/68309868.cms) than men.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.1. Con: The article provides [no evidence](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/new-face-of-workplace-all-female-staff/articleshow/68309868.cms) that women are actually more productive than men. It merely reflects the opinions of the company authorities who were interviewed.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The opinions of the interviewees are deeply entrenched in [gender stereotypes](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/new-face-of-workplace-all-female-staff/articleshow/68309868.cms), such as the notion that men are less hygienic, which is categorically [untrue](https://www.today.com/health/women-are-less-hygienic-work-men-according-new-study-t50631)(Based on a survey of 5,500 people, men are more likely than women to clean the toilet seat after using it, as well as lowering it. . . .\nIn addition, men are just as likely to wash their hands at work as women after using the toilet. . . . This is a stark contrast from expectations; 45 percent of women believed their male colleagues would be the unhygienic ones, while 89 percent of men thought women would have the higher standards.) and perpetuates incorrect notions about the behavior profiles of men and women.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.1.2. Con: The phenomenological experience is still valid; anecdotal evidence is still considered evidence by the person\(s\) who experienced it.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The views of the company authorities who were interviewed are particularly significant, as the policies they institute are likely to be reflections of these perceptions. Indeed, their preference to hire women is attributable to such perceptions.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Opinions about the capabilities of other groups of people cannot be considered valid subjective evidence based on phenomenological experiences. If the genders were swapped, the opinions of the authorities would be considered sexist and inflammatory.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.2. Con: Worker productivity and efficiency are individual performance metrics. Decisions regarding hiring and pay should be made on a case-by-case basis, not based on stereotypes associated with different demographic groups, such as men and women.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.3. Pro: Women are held to [stricter performance standards](https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/9307/study-women-say-y-need-to-work-harder-than-men). Thus, women self-reportedly have to work harder than men.
1.3.5.3.4.3.1.4. Pro: A study serendipitously found that, across industries, women get [more work done](https://www.tesh.com/articles/do-women-work-harder-than-men/) per unit of time.
1.3.5.3.4.3.2. Pro: Women are assigned more work than men but [complete their work at the same rate](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/women-are-more-productive-than-men-at-work-these-days).
1.3.5.3.4.3.3. Pro: Toxic masculinity is [detrimental to workplace culture](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/all-things-work/pages/how-toxic-masculinity-is-ruining-your-workplace-culture.aspx) and can lead to decreased productivity across the board.
1.3.5.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: Men are difficult to manage; yet, [their aggression is often rewarded](https://www.pcma.org/you-dont-have-to-be-mean-to-lead/). Women who show aggression are considered "unladylike."
1.3.5.3.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: This observation is resonant with the verdict rendered in an infamous case involving the denial of a promotion to [Ann Hopkins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ann-hopkins-who-won-supreme-court-gender-bias-case-after-being-denied-a-promotion-dies-at-74/2018/07/18/eb70f81a-8a99-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html)(“An employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible Catch-22: out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they don’t. Title VII lifts women out of this bind.”) on the grounds that she was, among other things, "unladylike."
1.3.5.3.4.3.3.2. Con: [Toxic femininity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drnancydoyle/2021/07/13/we-need-to-talk-about-toxic-femininity-at-work/) can be equally [damaging](https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/women-vs-women-toxic-femininity-is-real-and-its-time-to-talk-about-it-1952023.html)(When we speak of change, of equality, of fairness, we must include all of humanity. We cannot do that by pitting the genders against each other as believable vs. unbelievable, victim vs. perpetrator, good vs. bad, saint vs. sinner. These binaries do a disservice to women as well as men.) to workplace culture.
1.3.5.3.4.3.4. Con: Neither efficiency nor productivity is an unchangeable trait. They can both be addressed and improved through appropriate [managerial interventions](https://blog.hubstaff.com/employee-productivity/).

1.3.5.3.4.3.6. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.4.3.1.2.
1.3.5.3.4.4. Con: The word "deserve" implies merit, while "work" describes a quantitative unit. A unit of work should not be compensated differently based on the gender from which it was derived. Men are no more or less meritorious than women.
1.3.5.3.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.4.1.1.1.3.
1.3.5.3.5. Con: Educational attainment does not close the gender pay gap.
1.3.5.3.5.1. Pro: Girls often do not have the same [access](https://theirworld.org/news/why-girls-are-still-denied-equal-chance-of-education)(“It is estimated that 15 million girls – mainly those living in poverty – will never set foot in a classroom, compared to 10 million boys.”\n\nThe gap is even wider in conflict zones, where girls are nearly two and a half times more likely to be out of school than boys.\n\nThe report, produced this month by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights \(OHCHR\) is titled “Realisation of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl”.\n\nIt highlights the obstacles to girls getting a quality education and puts forward a series of recommendations to remedy the issues.) to educational opportunities as boys. Thus, individual choices and strengths are not the only factor in a woman's professional attainment.
1.3.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: Some vocational programs lead women and men to [choose different paths](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/01/why-are-women-still-choosing-the-lowest-paying-jobs/551414/)(So where are all the female students? They’re in the salon next door, learning about cosmetology, and in the nursing classroom nearby, administering “rag baths” to mannequins. And when they graduate, they’ll earn barely two-thirds of what Hinely stands to make, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAt a time when there is an acute shortage of welders and other tradespeople, hardly any women are being trained for these and other well-paying jobs. This more than 40 years after Congress banned sex discrimination in American education.\n\nExperts offer several reasons for this split, including gender stereotypes and the threat of workplace harassment in male-dominated jobs.\n\nBut employers and advocates agree it’s hurting both women and the economy, leaving families stuck in poverty and businesses scrambling for workers in fields, such as IT and advanced manufacturing, where they’re growing troublingly scarce.); women typically end up with "inferior" low-paying jobs.
1.3.5.3.5.2. Pro: In the private sector, the gender pay gap between graduates and non-graduates is [nearly equal](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/research-report-109-the-gender-pay-gap.pdf)(As Table 4.9 shows, female graduates in the private sector gain little from their education in terms of parity of pay with men. \(p. 39\)).
1.3.5.3.5.3. Con: Education can help [close the gender pay gap](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/es/resources/article/making-unconscious-conscious-how-education-can-help-close-gender-pay-gap-good/)(Here's where education comes in. Women need to be encouraged to advocate for themselves and managers need to be educated about the self-rating and career advancement tendencies of both genders \(and how they can help change that\). Additionally, women need to educate themselves about salary expectations using substantiated data. Otherwise, we'll continue to see a perpetuating cycle that harms female advancement.\n\nOf course there are a lot of other things contributing to the pay gap—including, but not limited to, the fact that women's earnings drop significantly after they have children and the lack of females in leadership positions across industries. Oftentimes the outlook feels grim. In fact, the World Economic Forum reports it will take over 200 years to close the gap. Despite this, though, there is real power in knowledge and self-advocacy. I see it when female employees are armed with the facts and are urged to believe their work is exceptional when it is \(and to talk about it\).) through self-advocacy.
1.3.5.3.6. Pro: [Women and men are paid more or less equally for the same jobs](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/08/daily-chart); the tiny gap that exists is attributed to women being less likely to [negotiate](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/do-women-avoid-salary-negotiations-evidence-large-scale-natural-field-experiment) than men.
1.3.5.3.6.1. Pro: [Research](http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/do-women-avoid-salary-negotiations-evidence-large-scale-natural-field-experiment) studies have found that, when job applications do not contain an explicit statement that wages are negotiable, men are more likely to negotiate than women.
1.3.5.3.6.1.1. Pro: Negotiation necessitates assertiveness. Women may feel apprehensive about demonstrating assertiveness, as it violates norms surrounding femininity, and ultimately risks making a bad impression on the recruiter.
1.3.5.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: Consequently, women find themselves in a [catch-22 situation](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/salary-negotiations-a-catch-22-for-women): “If you’re not assertive enough, you don’t get your desired outcome, and if you are assertive, you risk getting this backlash.”
1.3.5.3.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.4.3.3.1.1.
1.3.5.3.6.1.1.2. Pro: Women are perceived negatively only when they [negotiate](https://hbr.org/2014/06/why-women-dont-negotiate-their-job-offers)(Women get a nervous feeling about negotiating for higher pay because they are intuiting — correctly — that self-advocating for higher pay would present a socially difficult situation for them — more so than for men.\n\nBut here’s a twist: we love it when women negotiate assertively for others. It’s just when women are negotiating assertively for themselves — particularly around pay — where we find a backlash.) for their own benefit, not when they do so for others.
1.3.5.3.6.1.2. Con: The opposite was also true; when "salary negotiable" was added to the job posting, [women were more likely to negotiate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/13/boston-wants-to-teach-every-woman-in-the-city-to-negotiate-better-pay/)(Labor economists at the University of Chicago found in a 2012 study when “salary negotiable” appears on a job listing, women negotiate more than men.).
1.3.5.3.6.2. Pro: Women are less likely to have [negotiated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/07/13/why-dont-more-women-negotiate/#502a79c9e769) their salary than men, as 68% of women accepted the salary they were offered without negotiating, while 52% of men did the same.
1.3.5.3.6.3. Con: An [in-depth analysis](https://hired.com/gender-wage-gap)(Looking back to our first report in 2017, and then again in 2018, men were offered higher salaries than women 63% of the time. Last year, we saw our first glimmer of hope that this gap had narrowed to 60% but this year’s data showed a disappointing return to the status quo: 63%.\n\nThis means that 6 times out of 10, women are offered less money than men to do the exact same job at the exact same company. On average, that salary figure is 3% less.) of data concerning wage inequality in the US found that "63% of the time men receive higher salary offers than women for the same job title at the same company."
1.3.5.3.6.3.1. Con: The analysis examined gender differences without controlling for extraneous factors such as age, experience, and education, which are likely to affect the wages offered to candidates.
1.3.5.3.6.3.2. Con: The report focuses on higher offers for men without revealing how often women received higher offers. The implication of not presenting this statistic is that only men received higher offers, which might not have been the case.
1.3.5.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: Publishing more reports on women who receive higher offers may incentivize women to negotiate a higher pay and alleviate fear of discrimination from potential employers.
1.3.5.3.6.3.2.2. Con: It is unlikely that women would be receiving higher offers than men, en masse, and turning them down in favor of lower pay. Therefore, these data points may have been excluded, as such a trend is improbable.
1.3.5.3.6.3.2.3. Con: If 63% of the time men received higher offers, then statistically 37% of the time women received either and equal or a higher offer—around half as often as men.
1.3.5.3.6.3.3. Pro: The salary offer disparity increased from [60% to 63%](https://hiredprod.wpengine.com/h/wage-inequality-report/2020/#discrimiation-cloud) between 2019 and 2020.
1.3.5.3.6.4. Con: Women are less selfish than men; many opt for [team-based earnings potential](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19277) as opposed to individual-based earnings when given the option.
1.3.5.3.6.4.1. Con: [Research](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them) findings from Australia suggest that, although men and women ask for raises as frequently, men receive raises 20% of the time, while women do so only 15% of the time.
1.3.5.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: Denying women raises would not only widen the pay gap but also discourage them from trying to renegotiate higher pay.
1.3.5.3.6.4.2. Pro: The US Women's National \(soccer\) Team requested a [revenue-sharing agreement](https://ussoccerplayers.com/2019/03/usmnt-statement-on-wnt-players-lawsuit.html) as a more fair compensation package compared to their current contracts.
1.3.5.3.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.4.
1.3.5.3.6.5. Pro: The US Women's National \(soccer\) Team \(USWNT\) were [unable to negotiate their playing contracts](https://time.com/5653250/uswnt-equal-pay-lawsuit/)(“Women’s national team players are paid differently because they specifically asked for and negotiated a completely different contract than the men’s national team, despite being offered, and rejecting, a similar pay-to-play agreement during the past negotiations,” the federation said.) and ended up earning much less than the men.
1.3.5.3.6.5.1. Con: The per-match, "pay to play" contract offered by the US Soccer Federation \(USSF\) to the USWNT was [significantly less money than the men](https://time.com/5653250/uswnt-equal-pay-lawsuit/)(“In the most recent CBA negotiations, USSF repeatedly said that equal pay was not an option regardless of pay structure. USSF proposed a “pay to play” structure with less pay across the board,” Levinson said. “In every instance for a friendly or competitive match, the women players were offered less pay than their male counterparts. This is the very definition of gender discrimination, and of course the players rejected it.”). That is the definition of gender bias.
1.3.5.3.6.5.1.1. Pro: This bias is even more apparent when noting that beginning in 2016, the USSF started [earning more revenue](https://techpedia.in/muq/usmnt-vs-uswnt-viewership)(In fact, in the fiscal years 2016 and 2017, the USWNT will bring in significantly more revenue for the USSF than the USMNT. And I wish more channels would cover our … Cable Soccer Viewership, Mar 30 - Apr 5 Larry W Johnson II. Prior to 2016 - a year that saw the USWNT generate US$1.9 million more than their male counterparts) through USWNT sponsorships, TV contracts, and advertising than the USMNT, $1.9 million that year alone.
1.3.5.3.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: The USWNT is more popular on TV as well; the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final had [22% higher viewership](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/us-viewership-of-the-womens-world-cup-final-was-higher-than-the-mens.html) in the US compared to the 2018 Men's Final.
1.3.5.3.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The 2019 Women's Final was the [most-watched soccer match](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/us-viewership-of-the-womens-world-cup-final-was-higher-than-the-mens.html) in the US, of either gender, since the 2015 Women's Final.
1.3.5.3.6.5.1.1.1.2. Con: That is an unfair comparison. The Women's Final [featured the USWNT](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48897032); the Men [didn't even qualify](https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/us-national-team-eliminated-2018-fifa-world-cup) in 2018.
1.3.5.3.6.5.1.1.2. Con: This is due to recency bias; prior to 2016, the USMNT was always the [major breadwinner](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-womens-soccer-games-now-generate-more-revenue-than-mens.html) for the USSF.
1.3.5.3.6.5.2. Con: The women's contracts have a [number of provisions](https://time.com/5653250/uswnt-equal-pay-lawsuit/)(According to the statement, the women’s national team’s agreement includes, among other things, guaranteed annual salaries, medical and dental insurance, paid child-care assistance, paid pregnancy and parental leave, severance benefits, multiple bonuses — benefits that U.S. Soccer says are not provided to the men’s national team.) absent from the men's contracts including guaranteed annual salaries, medical and dental insurance, paid child-care assistance, paid pregnancy and parental leave, among others.
1.3.5.3.6.5.3. Pro: If the USWNT and USMNT each won all the games they were contractually obligated to play, they would have earned a maximum of [$99,000 \($4,950 per game\) and $263,320 \($13,166 per game\)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-womens-soccer-games-now-generate-more-revenue-than-mens.html)(men’s and women’s teams won each of the 20 non-tournament games they are contractually required to play, women’s team players would earn a maximum of $99,000 \($4,950 per game\), while men’s team players would earn $263,320 \($13,166 per game\). The suit also states that from 2013 to 2016 women players earned $15,000 for making the national team while the men earned $55,000 in 2014 and $68,750 in 2018.), respectively.
1.3.5.3.6.5.3.1. Pro: [Bonuses for making the respective teams](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-womens-soccer-games-now-generate-more-revenue-than-mens.html)(The suit also states that from 2013 to 2016 women players earned $15,000 for making the national team while the men earned $55,000 in 2014 and $68,750 in 2018.) were also grossly uneven - $15,000 for women and $55,000 to $68,750 for men.
1.3.5.3.6.6. Pro: Men and [women](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/salary-negotiation-gender-wage-gap) are not on [equal](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-differences-in-salary-negotiation-2013-11?IR=T) footing in [salary](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/07/13/why-dont-more-women-negotiate/#502a79c9e769) [negotiations](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/salary-negotiations/salary-negotiation-skills-different-for-men-and-women/).
1.3.5.3.6.7. Con: The pay gap is [derived from the types of work](http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/do-women-avoid-salary-negotiations-evidence-large-scale-natural-field-experiment) men and women do, not unfair wages. However, the pay gap was confirmed to exist in the form of unequal pay for unequal work.
1.3.5.3.7. Con: The relevant extraneous factors cannot be determined to be independent of the sexist preconditions that inherently contribute to the pay gap.
1.3.5.3.7.1. Pro: Recent campaigns to encourage women to believe in their abilities to pursue STEM subjects have resulted in a [10% increase](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/18/female-students-science-engineering-sixth-formers-stem-subjects) in women pursuing those paths. This illustrates that prior choices for non-STEM subjects were motivated by something societal or perceptual rather than innate ability.
1.3.5.3.7.2. Pro: Controlling for all potential confounds would [diminish](https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/)(Models that control for a much larger set of variables—such as occupation, industry, or work hours—are sometimes used to isolate the role of discrimination in setting wages for specific jobs and workers.\n\nBut switching to a fully adjusted model of the gender wage gap actually can radically understate the effect of gender discrimination on women’s earnings. This is because gender discrimination doesn’t happen only in the pay-setting practices of employers making wage offers to nearly identical workers of different genders. Instead, it can potentially happen at every stage of a woman’s life, from girlhood to moving through the labor market.) the significant socialization history behind women's occupational choices that contribute to the wage gap.
1.3.5.3.7.3. Pro: Over the past decades, sexist preconditions have decreased, and the pay gap has also [decreased](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/09/gender-pay-gap-facts/).
1.3.5.3.7.3.1. Pro: Skills typically associated with women, such as [people skills](https://www.cpb.nl/sites/default/files/publicaties/download/cpb-discussion-paper-253-people-skills-and-labor-market-outcomes-underrepresented-groups.pdf)("\[T\]he large increase in the importance of people tasks at work from the late 1970s to the early 1990s helps to explain the rapid decline in the gender-wage gap over this period. Similarly, the slowing convergence of the gender-wage gap since the mid-1990s, seems to be consistent with a slowdown in the growth rate of the importance of people tasks.), tend to be undervalued. Greater recognition of these skills in the labor market contributes significantly to the attenuation of the pay gap.

1.3.5.3.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.6.
1.3.5.4. Con: The framework in question suggests that hours earned solves the gap. However, using the [quoted article's data](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120110.htm)(In 2010, women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $669. This represented 81 percent of men's median weekly earnings \($824\).), the wage gap remains at 10-20%.
1.3.5.5. Con: No 'mathematical framework' exists in the article, just a list of factors which are either unquantified or insufficient to bridge the measured gap.
1.3.6. Con: Direct gender discrimination contributes to the gender pay gap.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.2.
1.3.6.2. Con: The gender gap may not stem from explicit gender discrimination as that is already regulated and illegal.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: Ensuring equal pay for equal work is sufficient government intervention. There is no need to ensure that the average pay earned by men and women is also equal.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: Total compensation should always be considered before determining equality; [job flexibility](https://fairygodboss.com/Articles/when-to-give-up-money-for-flexibility-and-when-to-stand-firm) and other preferences should be considered part of the compensation package.

1.3.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.
1.3.6.2.5. Pro: If there is evidence of discrimation that can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, then the women in question can take the employer to court. If there is reasonable doubt, then there is no need to take any action.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Direct discrimination explains a portion of the gap, and indirect discrimination affects other explanatory variables, such as employment choices \([pp. 112-116](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242534277_Final_Report_to_the_DfEE)(Throughout this report, it has been argued that the gender pay gap is caused by discrimination and by gender differences in the pattern of employment, but that both the causes and the consequences of these differences may themselves embody discrimination. Analysis of the extent to which gender differences in employment ‘explain’ the gender pay gap provides an important starting point for identifying the causes of the gender pay gap but consideration must also be given: to the causes of the differential patterns of employment: whether these are due to gender differences in preferences \(and, if so, whether these are innate, socialised or constrained\) or to discrimination; and to the reasons for differences in pay across characteristics, skills and jobs: whether these are a product of genuine differences in value added or due to discrimination \(e.g. the undervaluing of women’s skills or work\), crowding or other factors related to gender.)\). These violate the right to equal opportunities.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.3.1.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: Women taking on a disproportionate amount of [childcare and housework](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319687)(They saw that for 35 percent of the time in which women were doing housework, the men were engaged in leisure activities. The same did not hold true for women, who engaged in leisure activities for 19 percent of the time that men spent engaged in routine housework.) results in skewed employment patterns that explain three-quarters of the pay gap \([p. 28](https://economics.virginia.edu/sites/economics.virginia.edu/files/anderson/adcontfinal102605.pdf)\). Governments should intervene to weaken such norms and secure equal rights and opportunities.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Con: The type of governmental intervention required to weaken stereotypes could be harmful to women.
1.3.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: Interventions, whether governmental or otherwise, may involve targeting "girls and women." This makes their gender more [salient](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9526-z) and could induce [stereotype threat](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40063382).
1.3.6.3.2.1.2. Pro: Interventions are typically provided to groups that "lack" something. Thus, implementing women-only interventions might perpetuate the notion that women lack the strength to resist norms and stereotypes.
1.3.6.3.2.1.3. Con: There is no documented empirical evidence to suggest that governmental intervention to weaken gender stereotypes has proven to be detrimental to girls and women.
1.3.6.3.2.2. Pro: Men are more likely to be spending time on [leisure-time activities](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319687#Men-engage-in-leisure-more-than-women)(They saw that for 35 percent of the time in which women were doing housework, the men were engaged in leisure activities. The same did not hold true for women, who engaged in leisure activities for 19 percent of the time that men spent engaged in routine housework. \[...\] Fathers relaxed for 47 percent of the time that their partners were looking after the child, while mothers did the same for only 16 percent of the time that their partners were performing childcare duties.) when their partners are doing housework or taking care of their children than vice versa.
1.3.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: Leisure plays a significant role in improving [employee productivity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334487227_Leisure_time_and_labor_productivity_a_new_economic_view_rooted_from_sociological_perspective). Thus, having less time for leisure robs women of opportunities for not only rest, relaxation, and rejuvenation but also improved performance and productivity.
1.3.6.3.3. Con: Governments should intervene only when discrimination against a person can be proven. Taking a proactive stance would ensure that citizens' opportunities are dictated by their gender.
1.3.6.3.4. Con: In the cited study, discrimination was just one of several factors contributing to the pay gap \([p. 113](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Kirby-2/publication/242534277_Final_Report_to_the_DfEE/links/54ba9c0c0cf253b50e2d040c/Final-Report-to-the-DfEE.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(Below, the evidence on the patterns of employment and personal characteristics which affect the gender pay gap and the contribution of discrimination to these patterns and returns, is summarised. In doing this, the differing results from the quantitative studies of the contribution of employment patterns have had to be reconciled and we move away from consideration of the exact contribution that a particular characteristic makes to the gender pay gap to indicate the relative importance of the different characteristics in contributing to the gender pay gap.)\).
1.4. Pro: Having equal pay between men and women would increase economic growth in the long run.
1.4.1. Pro: The incentive of equal pay would lead to greater participation of women in the workforce, which would be good for the economy.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Increased representation of women in the workforce [increases pay](https://hbr.org/2018/01/when-more-women-join-the-workforce-wages-rise-including-for-men)(\[A\]s women’s share of the labor force increases by 10%, real wage growth increases by nearly 10%. This result also indicates that the impact of increasing women’s labor force participation is distinct from the impact of increasing men’s labor force participation; in fact, a 10% increase in male labor force participation rates is associated with a 3% decrease in median real wages, likely due to a shift in the supply curve — more men are competing for the same jobs.) for both men and women.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Advancing gender equality could [add $12 trillion to the global economy](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth); if women were to play an entirely equal role to that of men, up to $28 trillion could be added by 2025.
1.4.1.3. Pro: African economies would benefit immensely if women were to gain access to paid, meaningful work at the same rate as men.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Gender equality increases productivity and sustainable growth according to [research](https://www.rw.undp.org/content/rwanda/en/home/ourperspective/ourperspectivearticles/2019/gender-equality-for-increased-productivity-and-sustainable-growt.html) undertaken in several African countries.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Reports estimate that the [economic costs of gender gaps](https://www.rw.undp.org/content/rwanda/en/home/presscenter/articles/2019_/3/gender-equality-for-increased-productivity-and-sustainable-growt.html) in the labor market \(2010-2014\) "were nearly $95 billion annually in sub-Saharan Africa alone—equivalent of about 6% of GDP, which is almost twice the amount of official development assistance that goes to the continent."
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: By 2025, the equivalent of [10% of their collective GDP could be added](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/the-power-of-parity-advancing-womens-equality-in-africa)(Accelerating progress toward parity could boost African economies by the equivalent of 10 percent of their collective GDP by 2025, new research from the McKinsey Global Institute finds.) to African economies if they begin to narrow the gender pay gap.
1.4.1.3.3. Pro: Women comprise more than 50% of the population of Africa; yet, they [only produce 33% of its GDP](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/the-power-of-parity-advancing-womens-equality-in-africa).
1.4.1.3.3.1. Pro: Though African women participate in the labor force at a [relatively high rate of 0.76](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/the-power-of-parity-advancing-womens-equality-in-africa), many women are employed in low-paid, labor-intensive, subsistence jobs in the informal economy.
1.4.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Some countries, like Rwanda and South Africa, are showing signs of improvement; each country has respectively [increased women’s representation in middle-management](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/the-power-of-parity-advancing-womens-equality-in-africa)(Rwanda and South Africa have increased women’s representation in middle-management roles by 27 percent and 15 percent, respectively.) roles by 27% and 15%.
1.4.1.3.3.2. Con: This discrepancy is not specific to Africa. Women comprise 50% of the global population; yet, they contribute only [37% of the global GDP](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/ten-things-to-know-about-gender-equality).
1.4.1.3.4. Con: Africa faces several unique challenges, such as high rates of [sexual harassment and abuse](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/gab/article/view/203347), which could make gaining access to paid meaningful work very problematic for women.
1.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: South Africa, particularly mining regions, are [extremely unsafe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37097941) for women. Working alongside men could further increase their risk of assault.
1.4.1.3.4.2. Con: Recently, an [all-women team of miners](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/23/fashion/jewelry-women-aquamarine-miners-zimbabwe.html) was created in Africa. Creating more such groups could help women protect themselves from sexual predators.
1.4.1.3.5. Con: Following the Rwandan genocide, [women outnumbered men](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/10/577018509/rwanda-ranks-in-the-top-5-for-gender-equity-do-its-teen-girls-agree) in the workforce. Yet, the [pay gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality_in_Rwanda)(Rwandan women make eighty-eight cents to a man's dollar.) has persisted.
1.4.1.4. Con: This argument implies that knowledge about the pay gap discourages women from participating in the workforce. There is no evidence to this effect.
1.4.1.5. Con: Women who don't work play important civic roles. If women go into the workforce, society might miss the valuable work they do outside of the economy.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Vacant civic roles can be replaced by paying someone to fill the gap.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: Denying women the opportunity to earn a living so that others can reap the benefits of their unpaid labor is immoral.
1.4.1.5.3. Pro: Child care, childbirth \(worker production\), and care of older people are all economically critical but undervalued services that are generally unpaid labor; women should be compensated for the significant economic value these services provide.
1.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: During [heterosexual intercourse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stress-and-sex/201510/the-orgasm-gap-simple-truth-sexual-solutions), women [orgasm](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicebroster/2020/07/31/what-is-the-orgasm-gap/) so much more infrequently than their male partners that this phenomenon has been dubbed the "pleasure gap" or "orgasm gap." In the absence of little to no benefit for the woman, sex is an under-acknowledged act of unpaid labor shouldered by women.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: As much as [80% of women](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ouch-80-percent-of-women-faking-orgasms-says-study/) fake their orgasms during sex. [Marital industrial peace-keeping sex](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-the-name-love/201607/the-role-one-sided-sex-in-relationships) is an additional performance intended to maintain relational harmony for which women are not compensated.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Faking an orgasm can be [instrumental](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/04/orgasm)(Faking isn’t always bad for your sex life. Depending on a woman’s motivation, pretending to orgasm can actually increase her sexual satisfaction, according to research by Erin B. Cooper, a clinical psychology doctoral student at Temple University.) in helping a woman achieve sexual satisfaction.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: In general, straight women are more likely to perform sexual acts that center around male pleasure, such as providing [oral sex](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-orgasm-gap)(England’s study found that women give oral sex to their male partners in all contexts—from casual hookups to relationships—at higher rates than men do, sometimes dramatically higher. The study’s anecdotal evidence backs this up. “The ratio of oral sex was 4-to-1 in his favor,” says writer Kimberlee Auerbach, 36, of her last long-term relationship. \(She adds that despite the lopsided ration, he was still invested in her orgasm.\)\n\nIn casual hookups it’s much worse—during the first few times they hook up with a man, women are far more likely to give him oral sex than to receive it. Men receive oral sex about 80% of the time in first-time hookups, whereas women receive it less than half the time. This discrepancy goes a long way toward explaining the orgasm gap, according to the study’s authors.) and wearing lingerie, which are often not only not reciprocated but also [detrimental](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-32/october-2019/psychology-underwear)(A qualitative study published in 2006 by Jantzen and colleagues reported that women spend considerable effort choosing, buying and putting on specific underwear for specific occasions and that underwear can be a representation of ‘who I really am’. However, the effort and money spent on underwear is not always pleasurable. Adverts for underwear generally involve images of models with slim, toned and youthful bodies so our self-esteem and self-confidence might be reduced when we don’t match up to this.) to their well-being.
1.4.1.5.3.1.2. Pro: The orgasm gap is [wider](https://www.prweb.com/releases/astroglides_new_survey_reveals_surprising_info_about_orgasms_and_how_the_orgasm_gap_between_men_and_women_is_still_wider_than_the_wage_gap/prweb16155222.htm)(ASTROGLIDE surveyed 7,535 people about their orgasms, or lack thereof, including how often they “fake it” and why. The results suggest that more than twice as many women have faked orgasms with partners during intercourse, and approximately 10 times more women than men admit to faking orgasms “many times.”) than the pay gap.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3. Con: Not all women believe that an orgasm is [essential](https://spsp.org/news-center/blog/satisfaction)(In a sample of young adult heterosexual women, Wongsomboon and colleagues found that the majority of women believed that sex could be pleasurable without orgasm: nearly three-quarters of women endorsed this idea in the context of a committed relationship, while just over half believed this to be true about casual sexual encounters. These positive attitudes towards orgasm-free sex were not just endorsed at a general level, but also in regard to one’s own specific sexual experiences. In a sample of middle-aged women, about half of these women reported having enjoyable to really enjoyable sex without orgasm in the past. Furthermore, women enjoyed sex without orgasm more when they felt more confident about their sexual performance with a partner and placed less value on the experience of orgasm.) to an enjoyable sexual interaction.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: Many women [experience great amounts of pleasure during intercourse](https://www.nbcnews.com/healthmain/its-not-just-hookups-some-women-never-orgasm-all-2d11577334)(Yet many of these women find great satisfaction in intercourse, which can set off a cascade of brain responses facilitating a sense of well-being, closeness, pleasure.), regardless of whether they orgasm or not.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3.2. Con: Women may believe that an orgasm is not essential, but a recurrent inability to experience an orgasm is likely indicative of an [underlying condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816679/).
1.4.1.5.3.1.4. Con: A significant number of women have [never experienced an orgasm](https://www.nbcnews.com/healthmain/its-not-just-hookups-some-women-never-orgasm-all-2d11577334) - neither from their partner nor on their own.
1.4.1.5.3.1.4.1. Con: Women are [more likely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stress-and-sex/201510/the-orgasm-gap-simple-truth-sexual-solutions)(There is an orgasm gap between women who identify as lesbian versus straight. Lesbian women have significantly more orgasms than straight women. \(For men, orgasm rate doesn’t vary with sexual orientation\).\nWomen Alone vs. With a Partner: Women have more orgasms when they masturbate than when they are with a partner.) to experience an orgasm when induced by another woman or by themselves.
1.4.1.5.3.1.4.2. Pro: An inability to achieve orgasm may have a [genetic basis](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17165-six-things-science-has-revealed-about-the-female-orgasm/).
1.4.1.5.3.1.4.3. Pro: The inability of a woman to have an orgasm on her own has nothing to do with men.
1.4.1.5.3.1.5. Con: When it comes to heterosexual intercourse, men do more "[work](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/love-sex/study-shows-men-burn-more-18636843)" than women, who tend to be "lazy lovers."
1.4.1.5.3.1.5.1. Pro: The gender dynamic underlying the giving and receiving of sexual pleasure also explains some lesbian relationships, in which the more "masculine" partner provides sexual pleasure to her more passive "feminine" counterpart called the "[pillow princess](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/pillow-princess/)(Evidence for pillow princess appears as early as the 1990s in LGBTQ media about lesbian dating. In 1992, one publication, Deneuve, defined a type of dynamic in lesbian relationships “where the butch would initiate and give sexual pleasure while the femme would play ‘pillow princess’ and receive.” Pillow, here, implies passive while princess, in addition to suggesting special treatment, has been a slang term for a gay or lesbian person since the 1960s.)."
1.4.1.5.3.1.5.2. Con: Men [burn more calories](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508)(Men usually have less body fat and more muscle than do women of the same age and weight, which means men burn more calories.) than women even when they both perform the same activities. Thus, calories burned, which is the metric used in the cited study, is not a fair indicator of the amount of work women invest in their sexual interactions.
1.4.1.5.3.1.6. Con: Because of [rigid social norms](https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/what-we-get-wrong-about-men-and-sex/)(Most men don’t know what sex is like for other guys. Their only way of knowing is through porn, and that’s not real. With very rare exceptions, guys don’t talk about anything important sexually with other guys. There’s a lot of vulnerability in that. And even among friends, there’s always an element of competition. One can talk about vulnerable things, but the way guys do it still typically gives them the sense of being in control. It is exceedingly rare for a man to tell a friend about his sexual failures in any kind of detail.) surrounding masculinity, men are left without safe spaces where they can access the information they need to improve their sexual performance.
1.4.1.5.3.1.6.1. Con: The rigid social norms that hamper access to information about sex may also preclude men from wanting to use such information, even if it were widely available.
1.4.1.5.3.1.6.2. Pro: Information about sex acquired from problematic sources such as [pornography](https://irispublishers.com/oajap/fulltext/the-effects-of-pornography-on-adult-males-relationships.ID.000530.php)(Pornography is always available, never talks back, never has a headache, and is never too tired. It never makes small talk or asks one to have foreplay or does not depend on being close to another human being. Pornography is always there for a person waiting with anything imagined needed or wanted. It is exciting, and one does not have to share the feelings. And one can go as many times per day without even buying flowers. Men using pornography for entertainment watching, then faping may not understand that they are making pathways in their brain connections from the arousal and then meeting that sexual satisfaction.) distort how men view sex, which in turn could exacerbate their ability to be [effective lovers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334723558_The_Effects_of_Pornography_on_Adult_Males%27_Relationships).
1.4.1.5.3.1.7. Pro: If monetized, women would earn about [£27,000 a year](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-much-prostitutes-earn-revealed-11902009) for less than 10 hours of "work" per week.
1.4.1.5.3.1.8. Pro: Orgasms have economic value, of which women are deprived.
1.4.1.5.3.1.8.1. Pro: Experiencing an orgasm enhances [employee productivity](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/orgasm-effect-on-productivity/). The infrequency with which straight women orgasm is, thus, a deterrent to their productivity in the workplace and a contributor to the pay gap.
1.4.1.5.3.1.8.2. Pro: Beyond organization-level effects, efforts to increase orgasm frequency among women will contribute to the [economy](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/orgasm-effect-on-productivity/)(Research by Swedish sex and intimacy brand Lelo has suggested that if workers had more orgasms it could add £90 billion to the economy.).
1.4.1.5.3.1.8.3. Con: Women do not need to rely on their partner to achieve an orgasm and reap the [benefits it confers on them](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/orgasm-effect-on-productivity/)[.](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/orgasm-effect-on-productivity/)(More than three quarters \(78%\) of 2,000 Britons surveyed said orgasms make them happier, whether they have them alone or with a partner.)
1.4.1.5.3.1.8.4. Pro: Increased participation in the labor force is associated with [higher rates of orgasms](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/all-about-sex/201602/why-so-many-women-don-t-have-orgasms)(And as women move from traditional roles into the labor force and from fundamentalism toward religious liberalism, their rates of orgasm also increase—again because they are less likely to feel cowed by convention and more likely to assert their needs.) among women.
1.4.1.5.3.1.8.4.1. Pro: The [sexual liberation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/thats-patriarchy-how-female-sexual-liberation-led-to-male-sexual-entitlement)(The restrictions placed on female agency at the time – especially through the institution of marriage, which women entered younger and were less enfranchised to leave than now – are staggering to imagine. Only in 1965 did married women in France obtain the right to work without their husbands’ consent. In Australia, married women could not apply for passports without their husband’s approval until 1983. Britain did not make marital rape illegal until 1991.) of women goes hand in hand with their participation in the workforce.
1.4.1.5.3.2. Con: If women are choosing to engage in what is explicitly classified as unpaid labor, they cannot expect to be compensated for these activities, as the term "unpaid" would lose its meaning.
1.4.1.5.3.3. Con: Compensating women for certain caregiving tasks \(e.g., caring for a child\) but not other activities \(e.g., caring for a pet\) incentivizes and reinforces adherence to traditional norms among women.
1.4.1.5.3.3.1. Con: There are companies that offer "[pawternity leave](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/pawternity-leave-acknowledges-pet-owners-needs.aspx)."
1.4.1.5.3.3.2. Pro: Maternity leave is unfair to women who have given up getting married and having children to increase their odds of career success.
1.4.1.5.3.4. Con: Many self-chosen domestic activities, including [leisure and hobby pursuits](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334487227_Leisure_time_and_labor_productivity_a_new_economic_view_rooted_from_sociological_perspective), are economically valuable but are not compensated. Domestic activities such as child care are no different in this regard.
1.4.1.5.3.5. Pro: Women [put in more than double](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/womenshouldertheresponsibilityofunpaidwork/2016-11-10)(Women carry out an overall average of 60% more unpaid work than men, ONS analysis has shown.\n\nONS analysis1 of time use data shows that women put in more than double the proportion of unpaid work2 when it comes to cooking, childcare and housework.\n\nOn average men do 16 hours a week of such unpaid work, which includes adult care and child care, laundry and cleaning, to the 26 hours of unpaid work done by women a week.) the amount of unpaid work than men when it comes to cooking, childcare and housework.
1.4.1.5.3.5.1. Pro: During the 2020 pandemic, women took on [more than 100 more hours](https://www.romper.com/life/moms-more-childcare-in-2020-study) compared to men in order to take care of children.
1.4.1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: Women in [lower- and middle-income families](https://www.romper.com/life/moms-more-childcare-in-2020-study) took on more than 200 additional hours of childcare.
1.4.1.5.3.5.1.2. Pro: These statistics refer to families with just one child; [families with multiple children](https://www.romper.com/life/moms-more-childcare-in-2020-study) took on significantly more hours during the course of the pandemic.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2. Pro: If women were compensated for their unpaid labor, they would earn an additional [40,000 USD per year](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/heres-what-women-could-earn-if-household-chores-were-compensated.html), as opposed to men who would earn less than an additional 25,000 USD per year.
1.4.1.5.3.5.3. Con: Things are changing. Compared to any other time in history, [men are spending more time](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-men-are-doing-more-housework-than-ever-hs56pfs5v)(Men are taking to the kitchen and changing nappies as never before, according to a study.\n\nThey are spending an extra five and a half hours a week on childcare and housework compared to 40 years ago. Women do nearly three hours less of domestic work. \[...\] Women are also working harder than in the 1970s because they have increased the time spent in paid employment by more than five hours.) on housework and childcare, thereby enabling their partners to spend more time at work.
1.4.1.5.3.5.4. Con: Men do more of certain types of chores, such as [maintaining the garden or car](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/us/the-household-work-men-and-women-do-and-why.html)(I wonder if male-aligned chores like, say, washing the car, end up being more “desirable.”\n\nIt’s striking to me how much chores break down along gender lines. The chores men do more of are usually outdoors, like car upkeep and yard work. The chores women do more of are indoors, like cleaning and cooking. But there’s a big reason men’s tasks are more desirable — the chores they do happen weekly or less often, and the ones women do happen daily or several times a day.).
1.4.1.5.3.5.5. Pro: In [2013](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/), among working parents of children under 18 years, mothers spent an average of 14.2 hours per week on housework, while fathers spent 8.6 hours. Mothers also spent 10.7 hours per week actively engaged in child care, compared to 7.2 hours from fathers.
1.4.1.5.3.6. Con: Women are compensated by their husbands, who usually do not let them and their children starve to death.
1.4.1.5.3.6.1. Con: This creates unequal opportunities for the genders, which is unacceptable in a modern society.
1.4.1.5.3.6.1.1. Con: They have same opportunities. What this advocates for is unequal choices. Forcing somebody to make choices they don't want is actually unacceptable ethically.
1.4.1.5.3.6.2. Con: A problem with this sort of "compensation" is that it creates a dependency to the working member of the family. This dependency is fine when it's voluntary, but it can easily become involuntary \(ex. when wanting to leave a partner, or when wanting to go back to the labour marker but being unable to do so because their partner is unwilling to change arrangements\).
1.4.1.5.3.6.3. Con: Not all households have two adults.
1.4.1.5.3.6.3.1. Pro: The gender pay gap [exists](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/moms-beware-the-gender-pay-gap-hits-you-hardest_n_59403045e4b0d99b4c920f34) when [single-parent households](https://www.drnancyoreilly.com/closing-the-wage-gap-brings-families-out-of-poverty/) are compared: married mothers earn 73.3 percent of married fathers’ earnings, while [single mothers](https://www.drnancyoreilly.com/closing-the-wage-gap-brings-families-out-of-poverty/) earn 70.7 percent of what single fathers earn.
1.4.1.5.3.6.4. Pro: In the [US](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/), men are still seen and expected to be good providers for their families, even if the woman earns a equivalent salary.
1.4.1.5.3.7. Pro: The government should support women during childbirth and childcare as having children is good for society as a whole.
1.4.1.5.3.7.1. Con: Women should not be held responsible for saving the economy and sustaining society through childbirth and childcare.
1.4.1.5.3.7.1.1. Pro: There has been an increase in the number of women who are opting to remain [childfree](https://www.today.com/parents/child-free-choice-why-women-intentionally-opt-out-parenthood-t210203), with growing awareness that their identity is not solely contingent on their ability to create and nurture another lifeform.
1.4.1.5.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: The more intelligent and educated a woman is, the more likely she is to be [childfree](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/07/smart-women-not-having-kids)(Research emerging from the London School of Economics examining the links between intelligence and maternal urges in women claims that more of the former means less of the latter. In an ideal world, such findings might be interpreted as smart women making smart choices.). This suggests that being childfree is the smarter lifestyle choice for women.

1.4.1.5.3.7.3. Pro: Society is dependent on people raising children because, without new workers, the economy is likely to be adversely affected.
1.4.1.5.3.7.3.1. Con: Creating new life to ensure that society and the economy can sustain is selfish, as this involves creating a new stream of consciousness and forcing them into a life cycle they can never consent to.
1.4.1.5.3.7.3.1.1. Pro: More and more people are identifying as [anti-natalists](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change) because not procreating not only saves a life from becoming a wage slave but also [counteracts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis) the effects of [climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children), thereby helping society.
1.4.1.5.3.7.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.4.1.5.1.2.3.
1.4.1.5.3.7.3.2. Pro: Society, on the whole, exists because of parents.
1.4.1.5.3.7.4. Pro: Society is better off when more children are raised in abundance than poverty.
1.4.1.5.3.8. Pro: Some professions like childcare, cleaners, and domestic workers that typically employ women are considered [socially and economically inferior](https://www.epsu.org/article/concentration-women-low-paying-jobs)(For example, taking the five lowest paid occupations, women they make up 98.8% of the lowest paid group - childminders; 68.5% of nursery assistants, 88.1% of health and social care assistants, 90.9% of cleaners and domestic helps employed by the municipalities and 88.9% of cleaners and domestic helps employed by the regions.); thus, their salaries are lower, accounting for part of the gender pay gap.
1.4.1.5.3.8.1. Pro: Following women's emancipation, men and women began to compete for higher paying jobs. However, many women are forcibly [concentrated](http://sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk/SRU16/SRU16.html) in low-wage jobs [typically reserved for them](http://eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/segregation), such as [secretary](http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/31/news/economy/secretary-women-jobs/index.html), [maid](http://datausa.io/profile/soc/372012/), [receptionist](http://datausa.io/profile/soc/receptionists-information-clerks), and [kindergarten teacher](http://datausa.io/profile/soc/preschool-kindergarten-teachers).
1.4.1.5.3.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.5.1.1.
1.4.1.5.3.8.3. Pro: When women enter a previously [men-dominated industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html), the wages in that industry go down for everyone. When men enter a previously women-dominated industry, the opposite happens.
1.4.2. Pro: Equal pay is good for business.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Equal pay would benefit the economy because it would allow for more diversity in the workplace.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: According to the standard supply-demand economic model, increasing the cost of hiring women would disincentivise companies from hiring them. This would reduce the demand for women and result in less diversity.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Increased demand for women workers because they are cheaper to employ is wholly unacceptable.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.5.1.
1.4.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Increasing the cost of hiring women so that their pay matches those of men is a moral imperative. Companies should not have to feel incentivized to do what is right and ensure equality.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: More than likely, the reduced demand would force more women into unemployment and keep them there.
1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.1.2.
1.4.2.1.1.4. Con: Companies would not be disincentivized from hiring women if the increased cost of hiring women is offset by the [increased revenue](https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf) they bring to the company.
1.4.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: In failing to offer benefits and aid that could attract women high-paying work, employers both private and public are missing out on a full half of the societal talent pool - a great wellspring of new innovations and potential growth increase.
1.4.2.1.1.5. Con: Equal pay only demands that women's pay be raised to match that earned by men. If companies do not hire women for these reasons, they would still end up paying the same amount to a man. Thus, there is no real reduction in cost to company.
1.4.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: Hiring more men to avoid equal pay for women directly reduces diversity.
1.4.2.1.1.5.2. Con: Equal pay may necessitate providing women employees with special benefits such as period leave or maternity leave, which would not be applicable to men.
1.4.2.1.1.6. Pro: Equal pay would increase the cost of human capital, which would make businesses less profitable and stifle their growth.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Countries with [high levels of gender equality in the workplace](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth)(MGI’s new Gender Parity Score \(GPS\) measures the distance each country has traveled toward gender parity, which is set at 1.00. The regional GPS is lowest in South Asia \(excluding India\) at 0.44 and highest in North America and Oceania at 0.74. Using the GPS, MGI has established a strong link between gender equality in society, attitudes and beliefs about the role of women, and gender equality in work. The latter is not achievable without the former two elements. We found virtually no countries with high gender equality in society but low gender equality in work. Economic development enables countries to close gender gaps, but progress in four areas in particular—education level, financial and digital inclusion, legal protection, and unpaid care work—could help accelerate progress.) also have high levels of gender equality in society overall.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Firms with a higher ratio of women in their managerial or administrative positions [demonstrate](https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/publications/summary/11100003.html) better performance than firms with a higher ratio of men.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: [Diversity](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-numbers-dont-lie-diverse-workforces-make-companies-more-money-2020-07-30)(Maintaining a diverse workforce is imperative for modern organizations to succeed. Companies with a diverse staff are better positioned to meet the needs of diverse customer bases, and the cash flows of diverse companies are 2.3 times higher than those of companies with more monolithic staff. Diverse companies are 70% more likely to capture new markets than organizations that do not actively recruit and support talent from under-represented groups.) has [significant positive implications](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/01/25/more-evidence-that-company-diversity-leads-to-better-profits/?sh=7cd26b4b1bc7)(That a company with more diverse representation in senior management will likely achieve greater profits is not breaking news. Those realities came to light in a 2015 report from McKinsey & Company, and in another, a year later, from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nCompounding these findings is another report from McKinsey, a management consulting firm, titled “Delivering Through Diversity,” released last week, which shows that gender diversity in management positions actually increases profitability more than previously thought. In the firm’s previous analysis, companies in the top 25th percentile for gender diversity on their executive teams were 15% more likely to experience above-average profits. The latest data shows that likelihood has grown to 21%.) for [company profitability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annapowers/2018/06/27/a-study-finds-that-diverse-companies-produce-19-more-revenue/?sh=4c5276a9506f)(But what if we look at diversity from a workplace perspective - how does diversity help companies achieve their goals? A recent study by the Boston Consulting Group \(BCG\) has found that diversity increases the bottom line for companies. The study found that "increasing the diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better innovation and improved financial performance." It looked at 1700 different companies across 8 different countries, with varying industries and company sizes. They have found that increasing diversity has a direct effect on the bottom line. Companies that have more diverse management teams have 19% higher revenue due to innovation.).
1.4.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4.2.1.4.2. Pro: Gender equality in the workplace increases [productivity](https://blog.mindmanager.com/blog/2013/04/gender-equality-and-productivity/) and [profits](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gender-diversity-business-study_n_5945312?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJaLIhLq8YsM9bAa6Eri1ccxU7ZjcsrBlxJwUGFNyTtn075C7_kN_rxT42mwhXJSpFP-umJJ8tn3x1_ud3K4K0lXTmdTTeeKVBqhF-uH8wdkYN46ao22TE-ncCL1yMvdCd4zl0tkIp-MQTdq8US0jCnRmPBsqFHU_u8shMMl4xje).
1.4.2.1.4.3. Con: Diversity is inherently valuable because life exists in diversity. Companies should prioritize equitable representations of all kinds of people, regardless of company profitability.
1.4.2.1.4.4. Pro: Investors increasingly favour companies with [diverse boards](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/24/investors-warn-top-uk-firms-over-ethnic-and-gender-diversity)(Investors are turning up the pressure on companies to improve ethnic and gender diversity on their boards ahead of the annual meeting season, according to an influential shareholder adviser.\n\nThe Investment Association \(IA\) will issue “amber-top” warnings – the second-highest level of alert – to the biggest 350 listed firms if they do not disclose the ethnic diversity of their boards or have a credible action plan to address the issue.\n\nThe advisory group, which represents 250 members with £8.5tn under management, is hoping to use the voting power of its members to encourage listed companies to adopt the Parker Review target of having at least one director from an ethnic minority background by the end of 2021.).
1.4.2.1.4.5. Pro: Diversity promotes innovation \([pp. 5-6](https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf)\), which drives profitability.
1.4.2.1.4.5.1. Con: With increased spending on wages to close the gender pay gap, companies would have less capital to invest in research and development projects, driving innovation down.
1.4.2.1.4.5.1.1. Con: This is a classical view of capitalism, one that has been [debunked multiple times](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjRxqCe8LzxAhW4wAIHHXydAEcQFjAKegQIIRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeaweb.org%2Fconference%2F2020%2Fpreliminary%2Fpaper%2Fe6RA7tar&usg=AOvVaw0GkWP9L7CyB-O5EroksvKl) \(p. 5-8\). Firms will never stop innovating, regardless of the economic model or increased costs.
1.4.2.1.4.5.2. Pro: Diversity in the workforce brings about a diversity in approaches to work. This increases innovation and decreases xenophobia and workplace boredom.
1.4.2.1.5. Con: Diversity does not necessarily equate to a positive economic benefit.
1.4.2.1.5.1. Con: Diversity is an intangible benefit, not measurable on the balance sheet.
1.4.2.1.5.2. Pro: Diversity brings unique problems to the workplace including difficulty assimilating to the dominant culture, which significantly increases [turnover rates](https://www.ere.net/diversitys-revolving-door-with-2x-the-turnover-a-diversity-retention-program-is-needed/) and can ultimately cost companies tens of millions of dollars per year.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Equal pay improves the overall [performance](https://www.peoplematters.in/news/diversity/no-gender-pay-gap-50-better-performance-report-28660) of a company.
1.4.2.3. Con: Every cent not paid to a woman for work she has done is a cent the company has saved. Thus, unequal pay directly contributes to company profits.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Profiting off underpaid workers is immoral.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Capitalism is built off [profiting from the underpaid labor](https://isreview.org/issue/95/political-economy-low-wage-labor) of others.
1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: The implicit unfairness of selectively underpaying certain groups of people explains why [equal wages are protected by law](https://clc.gov.in/clc/acts-rules/equal-remuneration-act).
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.5.4.
1.4.2.3.3. Con: If businesses made pay equal by [cutting men's salaries](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/powers-be/201902/are-men-overpaid)(Imagine a woman who earns $80,000 per year and a comparably qualified man who brings home $100,000. Many of us might call her underpaid. But could thinking of him as overpaid make more sense? We’ve been assuming that a man’s wage is the gold standard against which others should be compared. But perhaps her salary—not his—is where we should be setting our mark.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThinking about men as overpaid instead of women as underpaid reminds us that merit should be the core of compensation. It also points to different solutions for the gender gap in wages. The old way puts the burden on women. The message is that women should be asking for more, negotiating harder, and continually self-advocating until the problem is fixed. Those strategies are important but exhausting.\n\n\[...\]\n\nWhen organizations develop salary systems that more closely tie pay to work, the wage gap will shrink. In the meantime, we can all work on leaning in—or staying right where we are.), the company would save money.
1.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.2.
1.4.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.1.2.
1.4.3. Pro: If women, on average, earned as much as men, the economy would benefit as women could consume more goods and services.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.2.1.2.
1.4.3.2. Con: That is not necessarily the case; women could choose to save or invest the additional income if their expenses have been covered already.
1.4.4. Con: Employers should ensure that pay is fair rather than equal, irrespective of whether it corrects the gender pay gap.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.4.
1.4.4.2. Con: "Fairness" is a highly subjective term and cannot be enforced in such a way that it satisfies the varied ways in which it is defined.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: To some people, "fairness" might mean paying everyone in a society the same amount of money, regardless of occupation. To others, it might mean letting employers and employees negotiate their wage individually, even if this results in wide pay disparities.
1.4.5. Con: Economic growth is neither a worthwhile goal in itself nor a necessary condition for ensuring equal pay.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Equality is a worthwhile goal in itself and should not be justified based on economic benefits. Rather, the government should ensure equality even when economic costs are likely to be incurred.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: In the past, governments have legislated in favor of equality, regardless of the high cost entailed. This implies that economic costs have never precluded equality-promoting legislation.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The abolition of slavery cost the British Government roughly 40% of its annual expenditures \([p. 1](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/680456/FOI2018-00186_-_Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833_-_pdf_for_disclosure_log__003_.pdf)(The Government used £20 million to fund the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. In 1833, this was equivalent to approximately 40% of the Government’s total annual expenditure. This information is available online.)\).
1.4.5.1.2. Con: If equality has a heavy economic cost, people who were previously neutral towards the equality campaign may become actively hostile to it if they [suffer from the consequences](https://thedispatch.com/p/people-love-big-spending-packages?utm_source=url)(Cheap socialists aren’t the story here. Americans in general don’t want to pay much of anything—out of their own pocket—for the stuff progressives constantly say America is demanding.\n\nA Washington Post poll in 2019 found that 68 percent of Americans supported taxing “wealthy families” to pay for fighting climate change. But when asked if they would agree to pay an extra $2 a month on their electric bills, support fell to less than 47 percent. That same year, an AP-NORC poll asked people if they’d be willing to spend $10 more a month on their energy bills to fight climate change. Some 68 percent of respondents said nope.).
1.4.5.2. Con: Even if economic growth is not objectively worthwhile, it is important to governments and relevant stakeholders. Thus, framing the issue of the gender pay gap within an economic framework might trigger action more effectively.
1.4.5.3. Con: Economic crises disproportionately affect women \([pp. 1-2](https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/46460668.pdf)(Despite the important role women play in driving development, women living in poor countries are likely to bear a disproportionate burden in an economic crisis. According to the UN Development Program, women make up a majority of the world’s poor. Since women will likely suffer most during the ongoing economic crisis, there is a great need for USAID and other donors to help developing countries expand economic opportunities for women. Furthermore, women can play a major role in rebuilding the world economy. World Bank Group Managing Director Ngozi N. Okonjo-Iweala says that it is not just about fairness, it is “smart economics.”)\). Economic growth, particularly that driven by women's participation in the workforce, counteracts this.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Moral issues, including solving the gender pay gap, are arguably more important than economic growth.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: Rapid economic growth is not beneficial in terms of helping people meet their basic needs \([p. 1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600881)(\(1\) Does basic needs achievement compromise future growth? \(2\) Does rapid growth undermine future needs achievement? We find no evidence for the orthodox view that basic needs fulfilment or improvement compromise growth. To the contrary, we find that basic needs attainment facilitates long-term economic growth. The evidence is somewhat less clear regarding the second question, although it appears that rapid growth does not produce substantial basic needs improvements.)\).
1.4.5.4.2. Con: Economic growth is instrumental in resolving many moral issues \([p. 22](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bfriedman/files/the_moral_consequences_of_economic_growth.pdf)(For our society’s moral values to nurture the behavior that spurs its economic growth seems especially apt if, as I argue here, rising living standards, in turn, make our society more open, tolerant, and democratic. Because we value these qualities in moral terms rather than market terms, market forces on their own produce insufficient growth. Some further impetus is required. Weber argued that familiar moral principles foster economic growth. My argument here goes further: economic growth not only relies upon moral impetus, it also has positive moral consequences. That we may depend at least in part on moral means to satisfy our moral ends, even when the link that connects the two is economic, has a particularly satisfying resonance.)\).
