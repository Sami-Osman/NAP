Discussion Name: Is Undocumented Immigration Into the United States a Problem?

1. Undocumented immigration into the United States is not a problem.
1.1. Pro: Undocumented immigrants make substantial economic contributions.
1.1.1. Pro: Half of the startups worth [$1 billion](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/over-half-1-billion-startups-are-founded-immigrants-n544446) or more in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. It stands to reason that, if given the opportunity, undocumented immigrants would also contribute to the economy.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Collectively, these companies are [worth](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/over-half-1-billion-startups-are-founded-immigrants-n544446) $168 billion and employ over 33,000 people.
1.1.1.2. Con: Those are largely legal immigrants. Indeed, one of the entrepreneurs cites his wait for a green card as a frustration.
1.1.1.3. Pro: There are numerous [undocumented](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-undocumented-immigrants-share-american-startup-stories-134941080.html) [entrepreneurs](https://documentedny.com/2018/10/09/undocumented-entrepreneurs-how-they-started-businesses-without-papers/) and [businesses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandafabian/2018/03/04/undocumented-entrepreneurs-how-deportations-could-hurt-the-u-s-economy/#1915ba6e22ff) owned by undocumented immigrants.
1.1.2. Con: Illegal immigrants cost tax-payers money because of the resources and benefits that they utilize in the country they've immigrated to.
1.1.2.1. Con: Undocumented immigrants pay taxes and are thus entitled to such benefits.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-6-immigration.pdf) found that unauthorized immigrants in New York State paid an average of 15% of their income in federal, state, and local taxes; other immigrant groups paid between 21% and 31% \(p. 2\).
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The same study also states that between 25% and 50% of illegal immigrants do not comply with taxes \(pgs 6-7\).
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Another study found that undocumented immigrants collectively contribute an estimated [$11.74 billion](https://itep.org/immigration/) to state and local coffers each year via a combination of sales and excise, personal income, and property taxes, according to Undocumented Immigrants’ State and Local Tax Contributions by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: In 2015, according to the IRS, [4.35 million](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/15/us/taxes-undocumented-immigrants/index.html) tax returns were filed using Individual Taxpayer Identification Number \(ITINs\) \(which is the medium illegal immigrants use to pay taxes\).
1.1.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.foxnews.com/us/the-cost-of-illegal-immigration-migrants-cost-us-taxpayers-billions-a-year) in 2017 found illegal immigrants are a net consumer of taxpayer benefits worth more than $100 billion a year.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The study in question \(to which Fox does not provide a direct link\) is so riddled factual and methodological errors that even the right-wing, Koch-funded Cato Institute issued a [thorough refutation](https://www.cato.org/blog/fairs-fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-study-fatally-flawed) of it.
1.1.2.3. Con: States can refuse to provide individuals with services on the basis of their status.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The [Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996](https://www.nilc.org/news/the-torch/8-22-16/) greatly restricts the provision of many federal, state, and local public services to undocumented immigrants.
1.1.2.4. Con: The amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Spending for unauthorized immigrants accounted for less than [5%](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-6-immigration.pdf) of total state and local spending for those services \(p. 3\).
1.1.2.5. Con: In 2010, undocumented immigrants paid [$13 billion](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf) into the retirement trust fund that year, and only got about $1 billion in benefits.
1.1.3. Pro: Immigrants have contributed up to [$300 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/do-illegal-immigrants-actually-hurt-the-us-economy.html) to the Social Security Trust Fund.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Without the contributions of immigrants going into the system, it is estimated that full benefits would not be able to be paid out [beyond the year 2037.](https://www.unidosus.org/issues/immigration/resources/facts)
1.1.4. Pro: A compiled 2016 [report](https://www.uschamber.com/report/immigration-myths-and-facts-0) by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stated that immigrants "significantly benefit the U.S. economy by creating new jobs and complementing the skills of the U.S. native workforce, with a net positive impact on wage rates overall."
1.1.5. Pro: Undocumented immigrants primarily only take the jobs that Americans are unwilling to do.
1.1.5.1. Con: This shouldn't be seen as reason why undocumented immigrants are not a problem. This kind of employment is exploitative, taking advantage of undocumented workers. Thus this is a problem.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Taking advantage of undocumented workers is an employer problem, not an undocumented immigration problem.
1.1.5.2. Pro: About [77% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/10/a-majority-of-americans-say-immigrants-mostly-fill-jobs-u-s-citizens-do-not-want/) say undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs U.S. citizens do not want.
1.1.5.3. Con: Only by virtue of Americans being unwilling to work under the minimum wage and them demanding decent labour standards. [Undermining labour standards](https://nationaleconomicseditorial.com/2017/05/06/illegal-immigration-hurts-economy-depresses-wages/) itself is a problem.
1.1.6. Con: If undocumented immigrants make economic contributions they should be allowed to remain as legal immigrants, otherwise, it can create problems linked with the [underground economy](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/557/labour-markets/immigration-and-the-black-market/).
1.1.7. Pro: Undocumented migrants are a [necessary mainstay](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-immigrants-us-jobs-economy-farm-workers-taxes/) in the domestic labor market. Without their labor, we would have shortages and price hikes.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Without undocumented labor [carrying out](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/do-illegal-immigrants-actually-hurt-the-us-economy.html) routine tasks and unskilled labour, products and services would be more expensive.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Self-interested companies are likely to compensate for increased production costs by hiking prices for consumers in order to maintain profitability.
1.1.7.2. Con: In today's economy, subject to low inflation even with rock-bottom interest rates, any source of inflation could be beneficial.
1.2. Con: Accepting undocumented immigration undermines the integrity of the legal process and authority of law.
1.2.1. Pro: Populations have an interest in controlling who enters their country as an aspect of their [national sovereignty](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2547466). Illegal immigration trespasses on that interest.
1.2.1.1. Con: Populations also may [disagree on illegal immigration](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2013/03/28/most-say-illegal-immigrants-should-be-allowed-to-stay-but-citizenship-is-more-divisive/) in terms of the existence of the concept itself, its actual occurrence, and the people who engage or purportedly engage in it. Their interest, then, is not absolute and so may not actually be trespassed on by illegal immigration.
1.2.2. Con: Undocumented migration is not a problem [compared to](https://www.saddleback.edu/faculty/agordon/documents/Bowling_Alone.pdf) [large scale](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00717.x) [legal immigration](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/intelligence-a-unifying-construct-for-the-social-sciences-richard-lynn-and-tatu-vanhanen.pdf).
1.2.2.1. Pro: Any kind of migration has the potential to [reduce social cohesion](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/258355/social-cohesion-integration.pdf), saturate the labor force, reduce the value of middle and lower-class labor, and increase crime and poverty. This is not solely or even largely an undocumented immigration issue alone.
1.2.2.2. Pro: It is [estimated](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/how-many-undocumented-immigrants-are-in-the-united-states-and-who-are-they/) that under 25% of total migrants living in the US are undocumented migrants.
1.2.2.3. Con: [Undocumented migration and legal migration](https://www.dshs.wa.gov/faq/what%E2%80%99s-difference-between-legal-and-undocumented-immigrants) are distinct issues. One involves breaking the law while the other does not.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Not knowing who is entering your country can allow potentially dangerous people to enter and disrupt the life of American citizens.
1.2.2.4. Con: Legal immigration is not a problem, as it could resolve [America's border problems](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/legal-immigration-will-resolve-americas-real-border-problems).
1.2.3. Pro: Undocumented immigrants are breaking the law by being undocumented.
1.2.3.1. Con: Deporting these undocumented immigrants will be a [massive cost](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mass-deportation-would-cost-families-u-s-billions-study-n715236) to the government, so it is better to let them stay.
1.2.3.2. Con: The mere fact of having broken the law is not, alone, a sufficient reason to consider someone problematic.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: If someone is breaking the law they are undermining the glue that maintains social order. Thus, they are problematic.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: If a law is unjust, the social order held together by that law would be problematic, justifying undermining that glue.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if a single law is unjust, this does not justify undermining that law. For this would permit citizens to go against any law they thought were unjust and undermine the utility of laws in general.
1.2.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: If a law is unjust, it ultimately has negative utility.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: Breaking the law is considered an act of [civil disobedience](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/wrlae/9/1/article-p75.xml?language=en).
1.2.3.2.2. Con: The situation however, by nature of being in conflict with the law, is a problem.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Not necessarily. If you went over the speed limit today, you violated the law, but it was not necessarily a problem. Millions of people do this every day, and it is not considered a national problem.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: [Civil disobedience](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/12/archives/is-it-right-to-break-the-law-the-question-is-raised-by-recent.html) understood as the act of breaking certain laws, can sometimes lead to positive changes.
1.2.3.3. Con: Sometimes laws are inappropriate, and should be changed. So, using this as the basis of why they should leave makes no sense.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Interracial marriage at one point was illegal. That does not mean that it was wrong for people to do it. Just because something is currently illegal does not mean it is wrong.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Right or wrong, the functioning of our system of government relies on complying to the law that is passed. Disputes with the law are made through the political process.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Laws are also challenged through adjudications. To do so, the law may need to be violated \(e.g. Minoru Yasui breaking curfew\). In this way, violating the law is not necessarily a problem.
1.2.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The overall topic is whether or not undocumented immigration is problematic, and just how we are not up in arms over people jaywalking or speeding, we do not need to view undocumented immigration as a problem \(even though it is not complying with the process\).
1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: [Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States) were in place until 1967.
1.2.3.4. Pro: [45% of the total unauthorized migrant](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/undocumented-immigrants-not-necessarily-criminal/index.html) population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. This means that more than half of undocumented immigrants broke the law.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Being undocumented does not necessarily mean that one has done something wrong.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: Many immigrants enter the US legally and only [become undocumented](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html) when a legal visa expires.
1.2.4. Pro: Many legal migrants to the US went through long and demanding procedures in order to gain their status. It is unjust to allow others to circumvent these rules.
1.2.4.1. Con: If effort is the determining factor, the journey that undocumented immigrants make is long, gruelling and dangerous.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: As many as [20,000 migrants](https://www.amnestyusa.org/most-dangerous-journey-what-central-american-migrants-face-when-they-try-to-cross-the-border/) are kidnapped every year while making their journey to the US.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: As many as [six in ten](https://www.amnestyusa.org/most-dangerous-journey-what-central-american-migrants-face-when-they-try-to-cross-the-border/) migrant women and girls are raped on the journey.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: At least [4000](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/least-4-000-migrants-way-u-s-have-died-or-n944046) migrants have died or gone missing en route to the US.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Some types of legal immigration have [annual numerical caps.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-how-us-legal-immigration-system-works) Assuming that there is a limited number of people that can reside in a country, illegal immigration may contribute toward these caps being lower than they otherwise would be.
1.2.4.3. Con: That some had to suffer through a grueling process does not necessitate that others do the same.
1.2.4.4. Pro: If a prospective immigrant were to review the possible methods of immigration, and the option to come into the country illegally was the most direct and feasible method to escape their current situation, then it would undermine our nation's desire to have people follow the regular path of immigration.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Allowing some immigrants to enter illegally will only encourage more to follow this dangerous path.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: If entering illegally is seen by so many as the easier and more direct path, despite its many dangers, that suggests more of a problem with the U.S. immigration system than with undocumented immigration itself.
1.2.4.5. Con: It is possible to have both an efficient immigration process that documents immigrants \(thus making them legal immigrants\) and sufficiently demanding requirements for full citizenship.
1.2.5. Pro: [Rule of law](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2019/07/22/472378/restoring-rule-law-fair-humane-workable-immigration-system/) is one of the fundamental characteristics of our nation that makes it so attractive to immigrants. If a law is "bad" it should be changed, not ignored.
1.2.6. Con: [Civil disobedience](https://law.jrank.org/pages/5234/Civil-Disobedience.html) is a just response to injustice. People don't choose where they are born, and should not be held accountable as such. Undermining the authority of law, in this case, is good.
1.2.7. Con: The relevant "legal process and authority of law" has no integrity upon which to rest.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Recent US policies have made it extremely difficult for immigrants to legally enter the US.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Under a [new rule](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/immigrants-at-the-southern-border-have-to-apply-for-asylum-outside-the-us-new-interim-rule-says), immigrants at the southern border must apply for asylum in at least one country they enter while on their way to the United States. The rule effectively ends asylum for any migrant at the southern border who isn’t from Mexico.
1.2.7.1.2. Pro: Generally, when people feel they have no viable alternative but to try to enter the U.S., policies that act as roadblocks to legal immigration will cause more people to immigrate illegally.
1.2.7.2. Pro: The U.S. immigration system is [severely flawed](https://www.cato.org/blog/why-legal-immigration-system-broken-short-list-problems).
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: The mere existence of undocumented immigration--including the often severe life-threatening risks that such migrants will bear when entering the US--entails that the system is unable to facilitate orderly migration to satisfy the legitimate needs of the domestic labor market.
1.2.7.2.2. Pro: The system continues to operate in the same way year after year, never changing course in spite of its total failure to properly address the issue.
1.2.7.2.3. Pro: Mass migration is an [inherent behavior of humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_migration) and any policy or institution that attempts to prevent or severely restrict that behavior must acknowledge this reality. The [current policy fails](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/06/24/471322/getting-migration-americas-right/) to adequately do this.
1.2.7.2.3.1. Con: Just because a behavior is "inherent" or "natural" does not mean it should be legally acceptable nor that institutions should accommodate such behaviors. So, the prevention or restriction of inherent behaviors should not be a measure of the failure or success of an institution or policy.
1.2.7.3. Con: The [problem of undocumented migration](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/global-struggle-illegal-migration-no-end-sight) is very difficult or impossible to eliminate. It's unfair to blame this reality on an institution that is doing its best to grapple with such an intractable problem.
1.2.8. Con: If people are trying to flee the dangerous countries they are from, it should not be so difficult for them to get into and stay in the US.
1.2.8.1. Pro: If laws were passed that declared [open borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border) or [amnesty for undocumented residents](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-any-amnesty-undocumented-immigrants-available-now.html), there would be no threat to 'the law', merely a change in what is considered legal and illegal.
1.2.8.2. Pro: The percentage of asylum-seeking adults with children in tow and without children, especially from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, has [increased](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2019/09/23/immigration-issues-migrants-mexico-central-america-caravans-smuggling/2026215001/). There is a high rate of violence and poverty in these countries.
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: The Guatemalan government, under pressure from the United States, has [eradicated](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2019/09/23/immigration-issues-migrants-mexico-central-america-caravans-smuggling/2026039001/) the poppy fields that were a vital source of income for families. This has plunged a number of families into poverty.
1.2.8.2.1.1. Pro: [20%](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2019/09/23/immigration-issues-migrants-mexico-central-america-caravans-smuggling/2026039001/) of Guatemala's population lives in extreme poverty.
1.2.8.2.2. Pro: [67%](https://time.com/5582894/gender-violence-women-el-salvador/) of Salvadoran women have suffered some form of violence in their lifetime, including sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and abuse by family members. Many women are seeking refuge from this violence in the US.
1.2.8.2.2.1. Pro: In 2016, [65,000](https://time.com/5582894/gender-violence-women-el-salvador/) women attempted to seek asylum in the U.S. after fleeing gender-based violence in the El Salvador and its neighbors Honduras and Guatemala, which together make up a region known as the Northern Triangle.
1.2.8.2.3. Con: There are [refugee programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Refugee_Admissions_Program_\(USRAP\)) specifically designed for these cases.
1.2.8.3. Con: Rather than emigrating undocumented, they should seek asylum and refugee status for according to the UNHCR, states have an obligation to not return individuals "where they face serious threats to their life or freedom."
1.2.8.3.1. Con: Many immigrants enter with the intention of [seeking asylum](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html) only to find out that the US denies most requests and that they likely face deportation if they try access the asylum seeking process. This incentives against pursuing an asylum application rather than encouraging legitimate asylum applications.
1.2.8.3.2. Con: 'Serious' threats to life or freedom are highly subjective. What a migrant from an unstable country has deemed a 'serious' threat may be deemed only a mild threat by US asylum law. This is a risk too great for many desperate migrants who might otherwise have tried seeking asylum.
1.2.8.3.2.1. Con: The [Refugee Status Determination](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-status-determination.html), or RSD, is the legal or administrative process by which governments or UNHCR can determine whether a person seeking international protection should be considered a refugee under international, regional or national law.
1.2.8.3.3. Con: Seeking asylum is different than immigration.
1.2.8.3.3.1. Pro: Many migrants leave their home country for different reasons to those of asylum seekers.
1.2.8.4. Con: If the U.S. welcomes undocumented immigrants from dangerous countries it could hurt international relations and jeopardize its [diplomacy](https://www.cfr.org/report/us-immigration-policy).
1.2.8.5. Pro: Resources should be allocated to making the path of least resistance the legal one, and to making the process as efficient as possible. This helps to ensure most people coming into the country are accounted for and given the right direction to contribute to society as an American immigrant as soon as possible.
1.3. Pro: Undocumented immigrants reduce crime rates.
1.3.1. Pro: Empirical [studies](https://www.cato.org/blog/immigration-crime-what-research-says) of immigrant crime rates find that immigrants do not increase local crime rates, and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.
1.3.1.1. Con: Only reported crime rates can be used as evidence for this; since undocumented immigrants are harder to track than documented immigrants or native-born Americans, it is possible that they commit more crime than can be seen from empirical studies.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Historically [Hispanic immigrants have been stereotyped](http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Warner_2005-6.pdf) as criminals, however, studies show the contrary. \(p.1\)
1.3.1.3. Pro: Undocumented immigrants are [half as likely to be arrested](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/undocumented-immigrants-are-half-as-likely-to-be-arrested-for-violent-crimes-as-u-s-born-citizens/) than U.S born citizens when it comes to violent crimes.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Unauthorized immigrants in Texas](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/criminal-immigrants-texas-illegal-immigrant) committed fewer crimes than their native-born counterparts.
1.3.2. Pro: Studies have found that in areas with high undocumented immigrant populations, there are [reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Relationship_between_illegal_immigration_and_crime) rates of crime as compared with other areas.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Due to the fear of deportation and the gratitude at having successfully escaped their previous life, undocumented immigrants have far less incentive to commit crime than relatively privileged native-born Americans.
1.3.2.2. Con: These types of studies [struggle with data constraints](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/51/32340.full.pdf) as undocumented immigrant populations are harder to track.
1.3.3. Con: Illegal immigration itself is "either a [civil violation or a misdemeanor](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/05/13/is-there-a-connection-between-undocumented-immigrants-and-crime), depending on whether someone overstayed a visa or crossed the border without authorization."
1.3.4. Con: An estimate of [64% of all federal arrests](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/non-citizens-account-64-percent-all-federal-arrests-justice-department-n1045286) involved non-citizens and immigration violations.
1.4. Con: Not knowing the real number of people living in a country can eventually result in overpopulation.
1.4.1. Con: It could be argued that because American [fertility is in decline](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/22/u-s-fertility-rate-explained/), undocumented immigration would hardly result in overpopulation.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Because of the decline in births and the economic crises, experts researchers expect the US to face [underpopulation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/us-may-see-underpopulation-not-overpopulation-due-falling-birth-rate.html).
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a "[baby bust](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56288038)" in the US.
1.4.1.2. Con: It could also be argued that because American fertility is falling, undocumented immigration could lead to an overpopulation of immigrants.
1.4.2. Pro: The Census Bureau predicts that the nation's [population will grow](https://cis.org/Report/100-Million-More-Projecting-Impact-Immigration-US-Population-2007-2060) from 325.5 million to 403.7 million by 2060 — and 96% of that increase will be due to immigration.
1.4.2.1. Con: If the Census Bureau can predict the population growth, it means that there are ways of estimating the real number of people living in a country.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/12/how-pew-research-center-counts-unauthorized-immigrants-in-us/) has refined their method to measure illegal immigration.
1.4.2.2. Pro: In the last 50 years, "[nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived in the United States, pushing the country’s foreign-born share to a near record 14%.](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2015/09/28/modern-immigration-wave-brings-59-million-to-u-s-driving-population-growth-and-change-through-2065/)"
1.4.3. Con: The overpopulation caused by undocumented immigration in some areas creates a [secondary domestic migration among native-born residents](https://www.nap.edu/read/5985/chapter/11).
1.4.3.1. Con: Undocumented immigrants tend to stay in "[areas that are not attractive destinations for domestic migrants](https://www.nap.edu/read/5985/chapter/11#389)."
1.4.3.2. Pro: It is considered that close to 40 million Americans, roughly 14% of the entire population, [move from one place to another](https://www.thespruce.com/organize-plan-prepare-household-move-2436542) in the US every single year.
1.4.4. Pro: Overpopulation exacerbates the problems of traffic congestion, increased energy and fuel consumption, as well as [rising rents and housing prices](https://www.fairus.org/issue/population-environment/united-states-already-overpopulated).
1.4.4.1. Pro: There is a strong link [between between population growth and environmental degradation](http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/salton/Immigration_PopGreenParty.html).
1.4.4.2. Con: [Gentrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) exacerbates many of these problems.
1.5. Con: Undocumented immigrants harm American workers.
1.5.1. Pro: Undocumented immigrants increase the total supply of workers, [lowering wages](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216) for everyone.
1.5.1.1. Con: The [impact of immigrant labor on the wages of native-born workers is low](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/08/24/do-immigrants-steal-jobs-from-american-workers/) because undocumented workers often work unpleasant jobs that native-born workers do not want.
1.5.2. Pro: Since undocumented immigrants are able to work for less money, companies [hire them instead](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216) of Americans. This results in American workers not having jobs.
1.5.2.1. Con: Decades of data have actually contradicted the [myth that immigrants create unemployment](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Why-we-think-immigrants-steal-jobs-increase-crime-13071416.php) and lower wages for American laborers.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: A study found out that removing a half-million Mexican workers from the U.S. labor force did not [improve employment or wages](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170765) in the U.S.
1.5.2.2. Pro: According to an investigation, major American companies recruit [immigrant warehouse workers](https://www.marketplace.org/2013/04/30/major-american-companies-benefit-undocumented-workers/) through temp staffing companies.
1.5.3. Con: Undocumented immigrants are good for the American economy as they [contribute to taxes and raise productivity](https://www.aclu.org/other/immigrants-and-economy).
1.5.3.1. Pro: Undocumented immigrants pay an average of [$11.64 billion in state and local taxes a year](https://www.unidosus.org/issues/immigration/resources/facts).
1.5.3.2. Pro: Undocumented immigrants [contribute more in payroll taxes](https://money.cnn.com/2014/11/20/news/economy/immigration-myths/) than they will ever consume in public benefits.
1.5.3.3. Con: Undocumented immigrants can hurt the economy as they can boost [low-cost labor](https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-unskilled-immigrants-hurt-our-economy-12946.html).
1.5.3.4. Con: Illegal immigration can have a negative effect on particularly vulnerable segments of the U.S. working population, specifically [low-skill black workers](https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/docs/IllegImmig_10-14-10_430pm.pdf). \(p.7\)
1.5.4. Con: The [geographic mobility](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/immigrants-contribute-greatly-to-us-economy-despite-administrations) of undocumented immigrants benefits the U.S. economy because it helps local economies respond to worker shortages.
1.5.4.1. Con: American workers are just as able to relocate for good paying jobs. For example, many thousands of people moved to the oil fields of West Texas to take very difficult manual labor jobs to support the fracking that made those oil fields productive again.
1.6. Pro: Undocumented immigrants contribute to richer culture and ethnic diversity.
1.6.1. Pro: The migration of a variety of people [increases mutual cultural tolerance, understanding, and respect](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/immigration-beneficial-or-detrimental-to-the-host-country), contributing to a more open-minded and compassionate population.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In a [study](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2006/05/immigration_see.html) conducted in 2006 in all 50 US states, Americans living in areas with higher percentages of immigrants were more likely to recognise the positive contributions of immigrants than those living in areas with fewer immigrants.
1.6.1.2. Con: Migration only contributes to a more open-minded and compassionate population if the country and its politics promote such attitudes, which wasn't the case under [Trump's administration](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/20/why-the-trump-administrations-anti-immigration-policies-are-the-united-states-loss-and-the-rest-of-the-worlds-gain/).
1.6.2. Con: Undocumented migrants can in fact have entirely the opposite effect: their presence can increase societal and cultural divides.
1.6.2.1. Pro: [44%](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US) of illegal immigrants in the US do not speak English well, or at all. This maintains and often exacerbates social divides: it causes misunderstandings and prevents migrant social integration.
1.6.2.2. Con: Many surveys and studies conducted over time show that Americans increasingly believe migration to their country to be a force for social good.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: A poll that has been running in the US since the 1960s shows that desire for immigration rates to decrease has been [steadily falling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx) over time, with 76% of respondents in 2019 saying that they believe immigration to the US is a good thing.
1.6.3. Pro: In a 2016 [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/12/in-views-of-diversity-many-europeans-are-less-positive-than-americans/), 58% of American respondents said increasing diversity made the country a better place to live.
1.6.4. Con: A culturally homogenous society is more likely to be stable as people are more likely to agree with one another.
1.6.4.1. Con: If a culture is homogeneous, implying the same or similar values, etc. among individuals, the society adhering to that culture is would be prone to a lack of innovation and artistic merits.
1.6.4.2. Con: A culturally homogeneous society would be impossible as the United States has a [heterogeneous societal culture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434713/).
1.6.4.3. Pro: [Culture clashes](https://www.nature.com/articles/457129b) can create conflicts and wars.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Within the diversity of the world, there is already an important differentiation regarding [the West and the East](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/abs/eastwest-conflict-in-historical-perspective-an-attempt-at-a-balanced-view1/CF93E88A6640530DCEF76FAC079A0F39) which is causing many conflicts.
