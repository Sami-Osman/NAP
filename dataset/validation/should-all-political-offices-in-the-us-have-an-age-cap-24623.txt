Discussion Name: Should all political offices in the US have an age cap?

1. All political offices should have an age cap.
1.1. Con: Any age picked to cap the age of political candidates would be arbitrary.
1.2. Pro: This would give more weight to younger generations who are disproportionally affected by any legislation simply because they live longer.
1.2.1. Con: This would be a negative outcome as the legislature is meant to represent society as a whole, not only specific generations.
1.2.2. Pro: It is fair that young people become more entitled to decide on the future of their society.
1.3. Pro: This would result in a legislature that is more representative of the population.
1.3.1. Pro: Differences in societal values will be less pronounced and this will be reflected in proposed legislation and court rulings
1.3.1.1. Con: There would still be people with vastly different worldviews, which would be reflected in policies and rulings.
1.4. Pro: The legality of this rule has already been upheld by the courts regarding a [Michigan law](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/6th_circuit_panel_upholds_mandatory_retirement_at_70_for_Michigan_judges/) requiring judges to retire at the age of 70.
1.4.1. Con: Judges are not politicians. This situation is therefore not comparable.
1.5. Con: This rule has the potential to lead onto a slippery slope.
1.6. Con: It is by no means clear that a higher age leads to lower ability or expertise.
