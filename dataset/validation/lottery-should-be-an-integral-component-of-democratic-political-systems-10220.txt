Discussion Name: Lottery should be an integral component of democratic political systems

1. Lottery should be an integral component of democratic political systems
1.1. Pro: Politics would be more representative under a lottery system.
1.1.1. Pro: A lottery system would increase faith in politics which would encourage more people to vote.
1.1.1.1. Con: Lottery-elected politicians come with no political mandate, so may be less popular than elected politicians.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The current system has created a lot of cynicism against politics. A system based on lottery would bring common people to power, thus alleviating this tension.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Right and left wing populist often shout that '[elites](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/8ge3ap/who-exactly-are-the-elites-rich-populist-politicians-are-complaining-about)' are running the country and that they would replace them. Lottery would solve this automatically.
1.1.1.3. Pro: People not voting is a [big issue in democratic systems](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/why-people-dont-vote/).
1.1.2. Con: Given this system is random, it is possible for groups to not have any representative for their beliefs.
1.1.3. Con: It is possible for a lottery based system to be rigged, allowing a particular group or ideology to gain an unfair advantage.
1.1.4. Pro: Many common election systems make it unnecessarily difficult for members of minorities to get elected.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Pursuing a political career in voting-based democracies requires a huge time investment. On average, this time investment is much easier to make for individuals from privileged backgrounds.
1.1.5. Con: Ordinary citizens may have less of an understanding of issues important to minorities \(of all kinds\). We may end up with more majoritarian democracies, even if minorities were proportionally represented in assemblies.
1.1.5.1. Con: Representatives will be disassociated with the mobs. Neither will mobs of discriminatory people be able to influence the representatives nor will the representatives be able influence the mobs. This would imply that only institutional discrimination will be in practice and that could be reduced by global shaming of bad faith laws.
1.1.6. Pro: This system would genuinely be democratic: a situation in which all citizens have equal influence on public policy.
1.1.6.1. Con: People already have the ability to have a say by voting for politicians.
1.1.6.2. Pro: If citizens are directly influencing public policy, they are also motivated to participate in democratic systems.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.6.3. Con: Except that not all citizens would have an equal influence on public policy. All citizens would have \(theoretically\) an equal chance of being drawn, and then* an influence on public policy.
1.2. Pro: Elections would be run better using a lottery system.
1.2.1. Pro: It's a very scalable system, as long as statistical representation is maintained.
1.2.1.1. Pro: It can be run on a local, municipal, regional, provincial, national, continental or even global level, without many changes and without hurting the democratic underpinnings of the lottery.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Even better it can be run in parallel on every level.
1.2.2. Pro: Sortition \(lottery based selection\) costs less than elections, e.g. nothing to print.
1.2.3. Con: The intense media attention during a contested election can help [spot](http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/me/onePage) inefficiencies.
1.3. Pro: Politicians elected via lottery would be better at their job.
1.3.1. Pro: By randomly nominating or selecting a person from a qualified or valued group of individuals we are able to remove the ego & advertising that so often dominates a political campaign.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Our current political system selects for certain personality traits in politicians that are not necessarily good for rational decision making. Successful politicians must dominate their opponents and raise funds from individuals and organizations with self-interests in the election outcome. This drowns out the voices of experts, such as scientists, who are not interested in, or adept at, attaining political power.
1.3.1.2. Con: There will be strong resistance against a qualification exercise, on grounds that in todayâ€™s direct democracy everybody can participate.
1.3.1.3. Con: A desire for power is necessary to be a good politician.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Desire motivates to outsmart opponents. This is especially relevant when dealing with non-democratic states.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: With such desire for power, comes corruption.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Corruption undermines ones power base because one becomes dependent on the one that offers the bribe.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: Receiving funds is necessary to distribute them to loyal elites.
1.3.1.4. Con: People with egos or who use advertising don't necessarily do a worse job of governing.
1.3.1.5. Con: Randomly drawn people, once given power, will develop similar superiority traits as career politicians in a short time.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: This model makes making a career in politics impossible. You can only hold the position for a limited amount of time. This means that the feeling of superiority can only be sustained for a short while. Career politicians can sustain it by feeding on the praises of his voters.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Career politicians are better politicians.
1.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: This would require an actual metric to evaluate the quality of a politician.
1.3.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Career politicians aquire skills how to deal with other actors throughout their career.
1.3.1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Inexperienced politicians drawn by lottery are likely to be more influenced by those with knowledge in particular interest areas.
1.3.1.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Being influenced is not necessarily a bad thing if these people are more experienced in the given area.
1.3.1.5.1.1.3.2. Con: The skills acquired by politicians focus on how to deal with other politicians who also have acquired these skills. It's a zero sum game.
1.3.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: Career politicians have a vision for change; otherwise they wouldn't join politics.
1.3.1.5.1.1.4.1. Con: Visions of change can be important inputs for public debate, but there is no reason why we specifically need career politicians to advocate visions, debate them, and decide on their implementation.
1.3.1.5.1.1.5. Con: Carreer politicians are more concerned with their [re-election](https://www.cheatsheet.com/politics/do-american-politicians-just-care-about-donors-and-reelection.html/) or their job prospects after non-reelection than the general good.
1.3.1.6. Con: What filters the eligible population for those that are "qualified" or "valued" ?
1.3.2. Pro: A lottery system would remove the issues of outsiders influencing political decisions.
1.3.2.1. Pro: A system based on lottery would effectively ban career-politicians. At least from gaining too much influence.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.1.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: In a party system, politicians' priority is to keep their well-paid job and grow their power.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Politicians are often forced to make decisions which compromise their own beliefs and what they may think is best through the pressures of future elections, fitting into their party apparatus, pleasing those who funded their campaigns and vote sharing and voting compromise. The time lost in the voting process, image forming and maintenance and focusing on approval would be better suited to forming good law and policy.
1.3.2.2. Con: Outsiders can still influence those chosen by lottery. E.g. what would stop the latter from being bribed?
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.1.
1.3.4. Con: There's no way of ensuring capable and knowledgeable people in office.
1.3.4.1. Con: You don't have to: a statistical representation of the population will result in solid policies for the collective good.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: There is no agreed measure of what is a "solid" political policy.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: People are different believes on what policies are and are not good. It is impossible to pick policies which everyone will think are good.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Other forms of participatory democracy have shown this to be the case, like in [Porto Alegre in Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/participatory-democracy-in-porto-alegre).
1.3.4.1.3. Con: This is a statistical fallacy, the "expected value" of the characteristics of a sampled individual are equal to the "population average" for those characteristics. But the concept of [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) allows for sampled individuals to have characteristics that deviate from the population average.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: There is always error and from many sources. A sampled individual could make a wrong choice, e.g. out of cognitive limitations. Yes, a sampling error will also be present but it is a known and very small factor as confidence level can be set to say 95% or 99% simply by choosing an appropriate sample size.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The random selection of incapable politicians would likely result in instability and minimal progress.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Random citizens may not know how politics works.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Representatives, whether elected or drafted by lot, do not only need to be or become knowledgeable on the specific topic at hand, they also need to be well aware of how life is for the "regular, average citizen", and how decisions work out "on the ground". Thus, that kind of knowledge is also important, and a group of citizens drafted by lot guarantee having this kind of knowledge much better than a group of elected politicians usually do.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: The [majority](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2016/06/27/american-voters-are-ignorant-but-not-stupid/#69e00a717ff1) of Americans are uninformed about politics.
1.3.4.2.1.3. Pro: Lack of knowledge of politics could lead to delays in passing legislation.
1.3.4.2.1.4. Con: It would be easy to have a transition period where they can be taught about politics before before taking office.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: In todayâ€™s specialized world most random people would be not qualified enough, on a specific topic, to judge with sufficient knowledge.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Politicians often rely on outside expertise. Even unskilled politicians can do so.
1.3.4.2.2.2. Con: Citizens drafted by lot usually start out as being not very knowledgeable on a specific topic, but gain the necessary knowledge during the process of conversation with other drafted citizens and by being informed by experts.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: A single incompetent individual would be a small voice in a greater allotted group of people.
1.3.4.2.4. Pro: Representatives who are inherently apathetic, indifferent or incompetent, will not exert a positive influence on process or outcome of government.
1.3.5. Pro: Knowing that there is a negligible chance to get reappointed, politicians could focus on maximizing their impact to solve the issues of the day without wasting time and energy on strategizing for their long-term careers.
1.4. Con: Being appointed to a position of power by lottery would leave many people overwhelmed and unprepared.
1.4.1. Con: This could be realized by allowing the option to refuse. Then the system will select another random individual in their place.
1.5. Pro: This could cause a higher reliance on experts in their respective fields to guide policy decisions, because regular citizens will not have the requisite knowledge to create specific public policies.
1.5.1. Con: It is possible that the officials chosen by lottery will be ignorant, but not bother with expert opinions, or even actively resist expert opinion as "elitist"
1.5.2. Con: Even if the officials who are chosen by lottery do rely more on experts, that's not necessarily a good thing; the experts they use could be corrupt. Or even just incompetent; if the officials are entirely ignorant in the field, they might not be able to tell apart real experts from hoaxes.
1.6. Con: The political tides would turn every time a new "lottery" takes place. It would be impossible to issue a multiple-decade plan for a government.
1.6.1. Pro: False. If a majority of Americans believe something, the lottery will typically reflect these values. As such, the lottery will only change as fast and be as diversified as the culture it represents, assuming the basic beliefs of the culture will last a couple of decades, you can have a multi-decade plan.
1.7. Pro: There would be less corruption as every time the lottery happens, all the corruption would leave.
1.7.1. Con: There is likelihood of corruption even when lottery systems are employed.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The [African](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55154525) lottery system is undergoing investigation for alleged scam.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Machines or software that run lottery systems can be [tampered](https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0715/agam6-f.html) with.
1.8. Con: Representatives would not be held accountable for their actions.
1.8.1. Con: If average citizens are well meaning and decent people, then the selected by lot parliament or congress will also be well meaning and decent. Also global naming and shaming could work to some degree on influencing the representatives to adhere to a more palatable position.
1.8.2. Con: Laws can be passed to make individuals responsible.
1.8.3. Pro: Representatives can blame their incompetence for failure and therewith deflect from direct criticism.
1.8.4. Con: Elected representatives can be held accountable, and are held accountable, but that has not stopped them from making bad decisions, i.e. decisions that are not in the interest of the common good.
1.8.4.1. Con: The current systems of accountability are increasingly inadequate. Too blunt and infrequent, and increasingly manipulable through media and fomenting of public sentiment.
1.8.4.2. Con: Just because it hasn't stopped them doesn't mean it hasn't discouraged them \(is reduced the likelihood they will\).
1.9. Con: Political parties would cease to exist, which would be harmful to politics.
1.9.1. Con: -> See discussion #16863: There should be no political parties in the USA.
1.9.2. Pro: Party membership is a significant motivator that inspires people to vote. Without parties, people are likely to vote less.
1.9.2.1. Con: Voters whose views were not represented before, are likely to come out and vote as a result of the ability to vote for individuals.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Currently more people in the US [identify](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths) as independent than a Republican or Democrat.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: [Studies](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths) have shown that independent voters often have politician preferences which line up with those who identify as a Republican or Democrat.
1.9.2.1.3. Pro: Many potential voters do not [vote](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote) as they feel the current options within parties do not represent them.
1.9.2.1.4. Pro: In recent years, the two political parties in the US have become more [divided](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/upshot/how-we-became-bitter-political-enemies.html?mcubz=1). This leads to a lack of representation in the middle ground for people.
1.9.2.2. Con: Candidates having to stand on their own opinions rather than that of a party platform makes them more personally connected, as the electorate often does not fully agree with the platform of either party.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Parties provide easily digestable information to voters.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: The best place to get information about a candidate, is from the candidate themselves.
1.9.2.4. Pro: Party events foster a sense of community.
1.9.2.5. Pro: Political parties help voters feel more connected to politics.
1.9.3. Pro: Political parties allow for elected officials to form majorities and pass agendas through Congress as opposed to individuals who will disagree and block governance.
1.9.3.1. Pro: [Party whips](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/03/what-does-a-congressional-whip-actually-do.html) keep elected party members in line and limit their ability to vote autonomously and often in support of legislation proposed by the other party.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Office-holders are not bound to vote a certain way just because of their party affiliation. They can, and [often do](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/upshot/two-senators-willing-to-defy-the-party-line.html), cross party lines to vote their conscience.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: Office holders that vote against their party are often replaced by their party during the next voting cycle.
1.9.3.2. Pro: It would take far more time to convince individual members of Congress to vote on a specific bill than it would to convince a party.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: Parties help to unify a plethora of individual interests and therewith make package deals possible.
1.9.3.2.2. Con: If a bill takes longer to pass, it can be modified over a longer period of time.
1.9.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/) have shown that politicians rarely vote out of line with their parties position.
1.9.3.3. Con: Political parties may actually prevent legislation from passing by disallowing members to vote against party lines.
1.9.4. Con: Political parties could still exist based on policies, which people can join if they are selected in the lottery.
1.9.4.1. Pro: A lottery system is compatible with the party system.
If someone is selected by lottery to be a politician, she could have party affiliation.
1.9.5. Con: Politics would be more representative without political parties.
1.9.5.1. Con: Selecting politicians for political roles will be more difficult as there are likely more applicants for each position. This could result in the election of politicians that are less representative.
1.9.5.1.1. Pro: According to [The Paradox of Choice,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) a 2004 book about shopping behaviors, being presented with a wide variety of options tends to result in consumers more frequently choosing nothing at all, and, when they do choose, more frequently being dissatisfied with their choice. If this applies to choice of elected officials, then more candidates would result in lower voter turnout and lower approval ratings.
1.9.5.1.1.1. Con: Attempts to replicate the research in "The Paradox of Choice" have been mixed, and it's not necessarily true that a phenomenon that emerges in shopping behavior would also emerge in the voting booth.
1.9.5.2. Con: There will be uncertainty as to how an office holder might vote in the future.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: Office holders will still have to run in elections and declare their stances on issues.
1.9.5.2.2. Con: If an office holder votes on an issue such that their constituents disagree, then they can be voted out.
1.9.5.2.2.1. Pro: Voters can use many different sources to verify if politicians are adhering to their campaign promises, such as the media or website such as [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/).
1.9.5.2.3. Pro: With no party mechanism to bind them to their word and electoral promises, elected officials may choose to shift stances.
1.9.5.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.9.5.2.2.
1.9.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.9.5.2.2.1.
1.9.5.3. Con: Political parties allow for elected officials to form majorities and pass agendas through Congress as opposed to individuals who will disagree and block governance.
1.9.5.3.1. Pro: [Party whips](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/03/what-does-a-congressional-whip-actually-do.html) keep elected party members in line and limit their ability to vote autonomously and often in support of legislation proposed by the other party.
1.9.5.3.1.1. Con: Office-holders are not bound to vote a certain way just because of their party affiliation. They can, and [often do](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/upshot/two-senators-willing-to-defy-the-party-line.html), cross party lines to vote their conscience.
1.9.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Office holders that vote against their party are often replaced by their party during the next voting cycle.
1.9.5.3.2. Pro: It would take far more time to convince individual members of Congress to vote on a specific bill than it would to convince a party.
1.9.5.3.2.1. Pro: Parties help to unify a plethora of individual interests and therewith make package deals possible.
1.9.5.3.2.2. Con: If a bill takes longer to pass, it can be modified over a longer period of time.
1.9.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/) have shown that politicians rarely vote out of line with their parties position.
1.9.5.3.3. Con: Political parties may actually prevent legislation from passing by disallowing members to vote against party lines.
1.9.5.4. Pro: There are many voting schemes that could be used to select a winner.
1.9.5.4.1. Pro: Australia uses a points system on their ballots, so voters can rank parties. Runoff ballots become unnecessary and the voter's intentions are represented acurately.
1.9.5.5. Pro: A wider range of issues is likely to be discussed in a world where the political agenda is not shaped by just two parties.
1.9.5.5.1. Pro: Parties often choose to ignore issues due to fear of a democratic backlash and electoral loss. Independent candidates are likelier to bring these issues up and discuss them.
1.9.5.5.1.1. Con: Independent candidates may also fear electoral defeat and therefore may not shed light on certain issues.
1.9.5.5.1.2. Pro: Independent politicians can remind voters they are not being played by big money from outside influences and they donâ€™t have to follow a party platform, they can think independently on all issues.
1.9.5.5.2. Con: The media has influence over the political agenda through their editorial choices.
1.9.5.6. Pro: Voters whose views were not represented before, are likely to come out and vote as a result of the ability to vote for individuals.
1.9.5.6.1. Pro: Currently more people in the US [identify](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths) as independent than a Republican or Democrat.
1.9.5.6.2. Con: [Studies](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths) have shown that independent voters often have politician preferences which line up with those who identify as a Republican or Democrat.
1.9.5.6.3. Pro: Many potential voters do not [vote](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote) as they feel the current options within parties do not represent them.
1.9.5.6.4. Pro: In recent years, the two political parties in the US have become more [divided](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/upshot/how-we-became-bitter-political-enemies.html?mcubz=1). This leads to a lack of representation in the middle ground for people.
1.9.5.7. Con: Banning parties would reduce transparency of the political system. Without parties [political circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanahoe) would form which are less accountable to the people.
1.9.5.8. Pro: [Straight party voters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-ticket_voting) are defined as voters who vote along political party lines, rather than candidate by candidate. If there are no political party lines from which to vote based on, voters would need to vote candidate by candidate and would be more likely to become more informed on each candidate's positions prior to casting their vote.
1.9.5.9. Pro: Laws which are passed without political party interference are likely to be more representative of the people.
1.9.5.9.1. Pro: More views may be represented in legislative bodies as candidates with opinions distinct from those of parties now stand a chance of getting elected.
1.9.5.9.1.1. Pro: Parties are better able to advertise their candidates due to greater financial resources meaning that third party candidates stand [little](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/gary-johnson-jill-stein-third-party-candidates-us-election-a7393961.html) chance of being elected.
1.9.5.9.1.2. Pro: Candidates aligned with a specific party also enjoy a head start, as people may choose to vote for them regardless of whether they know them or not due to party identification.
1.9.5.9.2. Pro: Republicans [previously](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/09/09/how-republicans-opposed-to-medicaid-expansion-hurts-children/#40c62ae83674) have had to vote for policies which harmed members of their districts.
1.9.5.9.3. Con: Laws are still likely to not be representative due to the influence of [lobby groups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States). As a result of the large amount of money given to fund politician's expensive political campaigns, these politicians often choose the interests of their lobby over their constituents.
1.9.5.10. Con: Competition between parties encourage parties to be more representative.
1.9.5.10.1. Pro: Competition gives parties [incentives](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/9/5/16227700/hyperpartisanship-identity-american-democracy-problems-solutions-doom-loop) to respond to voters as they wish to make sure the other side does not get these votes.
1.9.5.10.2. Con: Competition would still be present in a system without political parties as politicians would still need to win elections.
1.9.5.11. Con: Parties help in representing underrepresented people by using [collective action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action) to better define their common problems and more clearly characterize them in ways that would not be possible if people worked independently.
1.9.6. Pro: Political party ranks serve as training ground for future politicians.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.1.
1.9.6.2. Con: Municipal and regional administrative positions could also serve as training grounds for future professionals in higher level administrative positions.
1.9.6.3. Con: There will be less need for politicians as we know them today, because the number of elections will decline.
1.9.6.4. Con: While the role for political parties as training grounds will decline, the deliberative decision making process by more and more citizens drafted by lot from the local to the national \(or even super-national\) level will increase the general public's involvement in and knowledge of the political process, and therefore strengthen democracy.
1.9.7. Con: They would cease to exist in their current form: as fundraising and voteraising apparatuses that consolidate power and career-politicians. They would most likely evolve in lobby groups.
1.9.7.1. Pro: It is quite conceivable parties would become much larger as to influence a larger part of the population of their programme.
