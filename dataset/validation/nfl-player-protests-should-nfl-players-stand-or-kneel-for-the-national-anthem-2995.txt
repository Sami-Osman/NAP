Discussion Name: NFL Player Protests: Should NFL Players Stand or Kneel for the National Anthem?

1. NFL players should be forced to stand during the National Anthem.
1.1. Pro: Standing for the National Anthem is tradition.
1.1.1. Pro: Tradition is important in that it forms a sense of community. In [families](https://bay.ifas.ufl.edu/newsletters/2013/02/13/traditions-help-bind-us-together-as-a-family/), for example, traditions bind them together.
1.1.1.1. Con: Breaking tradition is a time honored way of showing how an important message or voice needs to be heard. Breaking such tradition in a nonviolent way is the epitome of Martin Luther King's philosophy of nonviolence.
1.1.1.2. Con: When an entire race of fellow Americans are subjugated to second class citizenry and harassed without recourse or due process of law, we cannot expect them to adhere to these standards of how to build community. In fact, we should be building community by kneeling as well.
1.1.2. Con: The audience isn’t required to stand or pay attention during the national anthem
1.1.3. Con: Tradition isn't always worth following, especially during a protest.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Slavery was also a tradition, but not at all a good one. Our past can inform our future, but it should not dictate it.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Slavery is not comparable to the question of standing or kneeling. After all, it is a choice for the individual alone while slavery affected another person.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is an apt comparison to the excuse that we should stand because of tradition. The point was made to emphasis that traditions are not always better and some traditions deserve to be changed or eliminated all together especially when harmful to others.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: The kneeling is an act of protest against a racist institution \(the police\), which is, in fact, comparable to the institution of slavery, as both of them are racist institutions.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Traditions do not have intrinsic moral value.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Before 1942, it was tradition to address the flag with a [Bellamy salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamy_salute), but this was stopped, due to its similarity to the Nazi salute.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Times of protests are times when society and its tradition changes. Traditions like the system of estates of the [Ancien Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien_R%C3%A9gime#Downfall) in France were overtaken by the protests of the French Revolution, for example.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Protests are often directed against traditions. For example, the [1968 protests in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_student_movement) were directed against the conservative traditions of the protesters' parents.
1.1.4. Con: By going against the grain of tradition, the action -- and thus the cause -- gain a lot of extra attention that it might not otherwise.
1.1.4.1. Con: Political protests should take place off the field so that the subject can be explained further and questions about why kneeling during the national anthem is necessary. People are confused as to what exactly is being protested.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Their actions have incited anger because the disrespect to the flag, which has eclipsed the issues that are important to them.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The opinion that kneeling \(or any other form of protest\) during the national anthem is disrespectful is not universally held; seeing the athletes being forced to participate also incites anger.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: The protest itself is more visible, and therefore more effective, on the field
1.1.4.1.3. Con: The protest and the explanation for that protest do not need to take place at the exact same time.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: There is no reason for anyone to be confused about the reason behind players kneeling given the intense following of the protest by media. [nfl.com](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem), [vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/15/17619122/kaepernick-trump-nfl-protests-2018)
1.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The protest was hijacked by making believe it was about the National Anthem, soldiers, and patriotism, instead of the abuse of an entire race of people.
1.1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: A [CBS/YouGov poll](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-do-americans-feel-about-the-nfl-protests-it-depends-on-how-you-ask/) showed "A large majority \(73 percent\) of respondents said the players were trying to call attention to racism … 40 percent said the protests were trying to disrespect the flag". Therefore, some people simultaneously believe that players are trying to call attention to racism and that the protests are disrespecting the flag.
1.1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: They are trying to speak out against apparent racism and inequality, but by protesting this way, they protest everything the US stands for.
1.1.4.1.4.1.2.1. Con: They have specifically stated what they are protesting, which justifies their actions because they are taking a stance on a specific claim, not disrespecting all of America.
1.1.4.1.5. Pro: Protesting during the national anthem is counterproductive to the protests' goals by adding a new source of conflict.
1.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Kneeling during the National Anthem is not bringing attention to the issue \(police brutality\) that it was intended to bring. When NFL teams are kneeling, practically no is talking about police brutality, they are talking about how disrespectful it is to kneel during the Anthem.
1.1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: When NFL teams kneel, those who watch have a choice on what to talk about -- police brutality, or "disrespect". NFL players cannot force the president, the vice-president, and those watching to address findings of [Ferguson](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/justice-department-finds-pattern-of-police-bias-and-excessive-force-in-ferguson.html), and cannot force those watching to not talk about disrespect. The fact that \(not all\) people are talking about police brutality doesn't mean the protest is ineffective, just that there's political reasons to discuss "disrespect", not fix the problems.
1.1.4.1.5.1.2. Con: [Many NFL teams and individual players have meaningfully contributed](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-134152884.html) towards the causes brought up by the protests. While the public debate often focuses on the issue of respect, there is more debate and action on these issues than there would be in the absence of the protests.
1.1.4.1.5.2. Pro: A better solution would be to publicly embrace the national anthem itself, specifically to further the end goal of unity, while finding a different avenue to draw continued attention to the cause of eliminating racism that does not produce the same unintended consequence of increased divisiveness.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Protest only works when it's disruptive. Players know that kneeling will incite a reaction, which necessarily brings attention to the issue of systemic racism.
1.1.5. Pro: Following the sentiments of the [Town of Greece Vs Galloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Greece_v._Galloway) Supreme Court ruling -- where prayer is allowed in town meetings, so long as it is consistent with tradition -- then it would be reasonable to assume the NFL can oblige people to stand during the anthem.
1.1.5.1. Con: This decision is actually not applicable to this case. In Greece v. Galloway SCOTUS held that a town may permit volunteers to open legislative sessions with a prayer. This is entirely different than \(a\) forcing congress to open with a prayer or \(b\) forcing legislators or citizens to stand for a prayer. SCOTUS, citing the establishment clause and the first amendment, has actually ruled that the State cannot force prayer. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_v._Vitale)
1.1.5.2. Con: This is really only relevant to official government events, not private events, even televised ones, like the National Football League.
1.1.6. Pro: Tradition [honors your ancestors' struggles](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katharine-rose/why-traditions-matter_b_6993290.html).
1.1.6.1. Con: Tradition honors our ancestor's struggles, but we do not all have the same ancestors. Some ancestors protested injustice and discrimination, so kneeling can be seen as an honorable way to demonstrate and respect their struggle.
1.1.6.2. Con: Our ancestors are dead. There is no need for every person to honor them in every way.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Ancestors might be dead, but the memory of them is what defines us today.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Even though the Founding Fathers are long dead, their ideals keep thriving in Americans and the way they look at the world.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: It's an incorrect assertion that not only is every ancestor's action and memory sacred, but that everyone is defined by and agrees with their progenitors.
1.1.7. Con: Players were never expected to be on the field [until 2009](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/25/us/nfl-national-anthem-trump-kaepernick-history-trnd/index.html) when the military asked owners to have their players take part in order to boost recruitment numbers.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Neither the NFL nor the government factored in that someone was paying attention to the hypocrisy and was willing to sacrifice his career to highlight it and had the courage to utilize a venue with a massive national audience.
1.2. Con: Playing the national anthem at game openings is a choice made by the stadium and the franchise. No action should be dictated in response.
1.2.1. Con: Playing the national anthem isn't just a preference of the league, it is a custom that all professional sports recognize.
1.2.2. Pro: Each team should be allowed to decide if and how they might enforce the national league's stand-up policy. Players can add that factor into their decision when deciding what team to join.
1.2.2.1. Con: Everyone should freely decide for himself. If they want to kneel, they will. The teams shouldn't focus on politics.
1.2.2.2. Con: The NFL values homogeneity with its owners and teams. Allowing individual teams this autonomy could be a Pandora's box in other decisions normally voted on at owners' meetings.
1.2.2.3. Con: Though a player can decide whether to join a team or not, a player is not simply able to join any team that they wish. This certainly complicates the player's ability to decide if a team's policy matches their preference when it comes to protests.
1.3. Pro: NFL players are role models to younger athletes and should respect national ceremonies.
1.3.1. Con: They are role models to younger athletes and should model non-violent protest of unequal conditions in our country when their conscience demands it.
1.3.2. Con: Being a role model is a matter of personal, moral conviction.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Standing up for your beliefs and practicing free speech is being a good role model.
1.3.3. Con: Respecting ceremony is not an ethical argument for encroaching upon a peaceful and just protest.
1.3.4. Con: Role models are often criticized for their actions at first, but honored later.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Muhammad Ali is considered to be a role model. In the 1960s, he was [vilified](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/19/1968-project-muhammad-ali-vietnam-war/334759002/) for refusing to be drafted into the military to fight in Vietnam. Over time, American society realized it was wrong and opinions changed. The same thing is likely to happen with Kaepernick.
1.3.5. Con: More important than respecting national ceremonies, NFL players should [commit fewer felonies](https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/arrests/) if they want to be good role models.
1.4. Con: Standing minimizes the issue of police violence against black citizens.
1.4.1. Pro: Standing implies that it is more important to respect a symbol than it is to address a real problem.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Respecting a symbol does little for the community, but protest has a chance to bring real change and help to those that need it.
1.4.1.2. Con: Symbology is completely subjective. The feelings you have towards one symbol or symbolic gesture may be completely different from the conclusions and judgements made by others.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Especially among white conservatives, rejection of the national anthem is seen as a desire to not be unified, to not have a shared sense of belonging, and to reject their own status as equal citizens.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: This perception is born of \(often willful\) ignorance.
1.4.2. Pro: Forcing the players to stand would show contempt for the players' protest.
1.4.3. Pro: In light of the nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell [supported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/sports/football/trump-anthem-kneeling-kaepernick.html) players' right to protest during the national anthem.
1.4.4. Pro: Kneeling allows players to give voice to the racial injustice that affects both their lives and the lives of others within their Black community. Change begins with awareness and kneeling encourages awareness.
1.4.5. Con: There is no special violence of the police against African Americans.
1.4.5.1. Con: The protest issue is quite valid. 35% of unarmed people killed by police were black, almost triple the percent of black people in the population. [www.diversityinc.com](https://www.diversityinc.com/news/data-police-disproportionately-killed-black-people-2017)
1.4.5.2. Pro: Once an encounter has begun, black people are not more likely to get shot than white people. There is therefore no systemic racism during an encounter with police. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/upshot/surprising-new-evidence-shows-bias-in-police-use-of-force-but-not-in-shootings.html)
1.4.5.2.1. Con: However, the likelihood of an encounter with police beginning is significantly higher for people of colour than for white people.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Con: That is not necessarily attributable to racism. Alternative explanations seem more reasonable to account for this disparity. For instance, black people are more likely to live in urban areas than white people. Urban areas are more heavily policed. Police encounters are more likely when police and citizens are in closer proximity.
1.4.5.2.1.1.1. Con: It would be nice to think that was true, but actual studies controlling for racial populations have found that it [generally](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/data-police-racial-bias) [isn't.](https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/new-data-reveals-milwaukee-police-stops-are)
1.4.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The first link does not offer any support for the notion that racial disparities in the rates that police encounter citizens is attributable to police racism \(or if there is any support it’s buried among enormous amounts of irrelevant studies\).
1.4.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Article one has many mentions of studies which controlled for race in the area. Several are copied and pasted below. They are not hidden or hard to find.
1.4.5.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Article one](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/data-police-racial-bias): "The scathing report found that the department was targeting black residents and treating them as revenue streams for the city by striving to continually increase the money brought in through fees and fines."
1.4.5.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The second link purports to offer evidence for police racism, but only as it relates to a single city — Milwaukee. It’s not possible to draw conclusions about the entire country based on such a limited study.
1.4.5.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The Milwaukee article, by itself, cannot be used to draw conclusions about the entire country, it is, however a very intensive case study, which, taken in combination with the many, many studies mentioned in article one, paints a meaningful picture.
1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: Black Americans are statistically more likely than their white counterparts to be stopped, shot, and subjected to greater degrees of force in encounters with police.

Here is a [compendium](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/data-police-racial-bias) containing links to a variety of studies that explore this issue.
1.4.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Investigations, such as [DOJ investigation of system racism in Ferguson](http://time.com/3730894/ferguson-investigation-justice-racism/) show systemic bias in many police forces.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: Included in title of cited article is acknowledgement that violence is more prevalent. Also, according to this [source](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/do-police-kill-more-whites-than-black-people/) black Americans are two and a half times more likely than whites to be shot and killed by police.
1.4.5.3. Pro: 50% of police shootings involve white men, while only 26% involve black men. African Americans make up only 13% of the population, while whites make up 62%. However, 67% of burglaries, 57% of murders, and 45% of assaults are committed by African Americans. When all that is taken into account, it is clear police are far harder on whites than on African Americans. [ucr.fbi.gov](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43)
1.4.5.3.1. Con: The argument above argues that African Americans commit 67% of the burglaries, but the link states that African Americans are arrested and charged in 67% of the burglary arrests. These are fundamentally different statistics, and [biases in arrest rates](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/) mean that we cannot assume they mean the same thing.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: [Studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/study-supports-suspicion-that-police-use-of-force-is-more-likely-for-blacks.html) have shown that law enforcement are more likely to use force against Black people.
1.4.5.3.3. Con: Black people are [more likely](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-cops-race-injury-20160725-snap-story.html) to get stopped by police \(and therefore killed by police\) and it has been proven that police are [more polite](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/police-respect-whites-blacks-traffic-stops-language-analysis-finds/) to white people during traffic stops.
1.4.5.3.4. Con: African-Americans are incarcerated at [5 times the rate](http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/) of white people.
1.4.5.3.5. Con: As of August 2017, [581 people had been killed by the police](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/). Of these, 127 victims were black, which is 20.8% of people shot by police that year. As black people make up only 13% of the population, they are over represented in police shooting statistics.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Police violence against African American men is rare. For example, only [19 unarmed African American men](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/451466/police-violence-against-black-men-rare-heres-what-data-actually-say) were fatally shot in the US in 2016.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: There is no uniform guidelines set for data collection when it comes to shootings by the police. Any broad sets of data making claims about the total number of shootings should be viewed with giant grains of salt.
1.4.5.4.1.1. Pro: In 2016, James Comey claimed reports on this topic were under-reported, and therefore such trends aren't discoverable. [edition.cnn.com](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/16/politics/fbi-director-police-shootings/index.html) Therefore, it is misleading to say they don't support the claim, as they are incomplete and that's not their purpose.
1.4.5.4.1.2. Pro: Numerous articles and studies have covered the inaccuracies in police-involved shootings that the FBI records. [themarshallproject.org](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/07/02/is-google-more-accurate-than-the-fbi)
1.4.5.4.2. Con: The issue is not so much the absolute number of deaths, but rather the proportion of deaths for each subset of the population \(in this case, Whites vs. Blacks\). Regardless of the absolute numbers, if the number of deaths per person or even per police contact is higher, then disparity exists and needs to be addressed.
1.4.5.4.3. Con: In addition to the 19 unarmed African Americans listed in the article cited by the article linked to, there were 13 killed who had a toy weapon, 13 whose status as armed or unarmed is simply listed as 'unknown,' and 22 who are listed as 'other.'
1.4.5.4.4. Con: Of the 266 Black men killed by cops in 2016, [42 were unarmed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database).
1.4.5.4.4.1. Con: The study cited by the Washington Post suggests that only [19 unarmed Black males](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/) were killed, whereas the study presented above by the Guardian claims that only 39 unarmed black males were killed. It's clear from their reports that there are significant disparities between their methodologies. Both these studies need to be highly scrutinized before being presented as viable evidence for either pros or cons.
1.4.5.5. Pro: Black and White males do have roughly equally contact with the police. On average, [~0.3 times](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/451466/police-violence-against-black-men-rare-heres-what-data-actually-say) per year.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: Equal contact does not mean equal outcomes. Here's an extreme example: If White males were to have a rate of contact at 20 times per year and experience non-lethal force half the time and Black males only once per year and always experience non-lethal force, then there is a disparity that favors White males.
1.4.5.5.2. Con: Black Americans are [more than twice as likely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-americans-more-susceptible-to-nonfatal-force-by-police-doj-says/2015/11/14/07eb61ee-8b18-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html?utm_term=.3163845e5306) as white Americans to experience non­fatal force or the threat of force from police.
1.4.5.6. Pro: Only [0.6%](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/451466/police-violence-against-black-men-rare-heres-what-data-actually-say) of black men experience physical force by the police in any given year.
1.4.5.6.1. Con: The very study quoted above claims that 0.2% of White men experience physical force. Though the absolute numbers may be small, the disparity exists and must be discussed and addressed in order to get to the root of the issue.
1.4.5.6.2. Con: A physical force rate of [0.6%/year](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/09/police-violence-against-black-men-rare-heres-what-data-actually-say/) means the average African American male had a 35% chance the police will use force on him in a lifetime \(72 years\). The claim uses “only” to minimize the perceived likelihood, but a 35% chance in a lifetime is much too common, and supports the claim that there is special violence by police against African American men.
1.4.5.6.2.1. Pro: A chance of 0.6% that force is used means that there's a 100%-0.6%=99.4% chance force isn't used, every year. If we assume events are independent, the chance someone doesn't have force used against them for 2 years is \(1-0.006\)^2. Extending, the chance to not have force used against a person for n years is \(1-0.006\)^n. The chance of having force used against you at least once for n years is 1-\(1-0.006\)^n. Substituting for n=72, [probability=35%.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(1-Power\(1-0.006,72\)\)*100)
1.4.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: It's likely that the probability isn't 0.6%/year for a lifetime \(since 1 year olds rarely have force threatened/used against them\), so NFL players are likely at the age where their probability is higher than 0.6%/year. Without some understanding of how that probability changes over a lifetime, we can't calculate anything specific, but only realize that an NFL player probably experiences a value of much higher than 0.6% for his friends.
1.4.5.6.2.1.2. Con: It's unlikely the events are independent, which means it's likely that some people are threatened with force multiple times, and the parent claim overestimates the probability. Without knowing how regular it is for police to threaten the same person multiple times in a lifetime, it's impossible to calculate the actual percentage, and the percentage of people who are threatened repeatedly.
1.4.5.6.3. Con: Police physical force rate of [0.2%/year](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/09/police-violence-against-black-men-rare-heres-what-data-actually-say/) for White men means a lifetime rate [of 13%.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(1-\(1-0.002\)%5E72\)*100) Comparing this against the 35% for African American men, the statistics show that there is special violence by the police against African Americans.
1.4.5.6.4. Con: A high percentage of African Americans stopped by police [reported](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/11/police-nonfatal-force-doj-report.html?gtm=bottom&gtm=top) excessive force of some kind.
1.4.5.6.4.1. Con: The study claims that "About 75 percent of those who had encountered force from the police perceived the force to be excessive." This is not limited to Black males, but is explicitly stated to be referring to ["44 million U.S. residents older than 16 who had at least one face-to-face contact with police between 2002 and 2011."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-americans-more-susceptible-to-nonfatal-force-by-police-doj-says/2015/11/14/07eb61ee-8b18-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html?utm_term=.3aaba6244e1a)
1.4.5.7. Pro: African Americans are [more likely](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/punf0211_sum.pdf) to perceive police action as unjustified.
1.4.5.7.1. Con: African-Americans' perceptions of police actions being unjustified arise because police actions actually are unjustified.
1.4.5.7.2. Con: Without knowing what force was applied and what injuries were sustained, we can’t determine if black Americans perceptions were correct or not. From the [article](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/punf0211_sum.pdf), “those who were injured \(94%\) were more likely to believe the force was excessive than those who were not injured during the contact with police. \(74%\). Overall, blacks \(2.8%\) were more likely than whites \(1.0%\) and Hispanics \(1.4 %\) to perceive the threat or use of nonfatal force was excessive.”
1.4.5.8. Con: Blacks are [more likely](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/punf0211_sum.pdf) to experience threat of force, verbal force, and physical force than Whites or Hispanics, during face-to-face contact with police.
1.4.5.9. Con: -> See 1.4.5.5.2.
1.4.5.10. Con: -> See 1.4.5.6.4.
1.4.6. Con: Kneeling is often interpreted as rejecting the unity and shared sense of belonging the national anthem ritual is meant to foster. This is especially true among white conservatives, which is the very subculture BLM most wants to influence to change. Kneeling only makes the sense of division that BLM seeks to eliminate in society even worse.
1.4.6.1. Con: Black Lives Matter strives to reverse systematic oppression many minorities face, not change the culture and beliefs of white conservatives.
1.4.7. Con: Kneeling during the anthem of a football game has nothing to do with police violence unless one already preconceives that notion.
1.4.7.1. Con: All symbols require context to interpret. That context has been given, and the meaning expressed openly. To feign ignorance of the correlation is dismissive and frankly dishonest. It is the expression of a bias/ contradictory belief, not a legitimate observation of a lack of correlation.
1.4.7.2. Con: Many of the players have voiced strong opinions about the violence and are striving to make that connection in people's minds by making kneeling associated with it.
1.5. Pro: Political protests should not happen at the workplace.
1.5.1. Pro: The NFL, as an employer, [has the legal right](http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/389495-nfl-has-every-right-under-law-to-push-new-national-anthem-policy) to deny employees political protests while at work.
1.5.1.1. Con: The NFL has a [collective bargaining agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Collective_Bargaining_Agreement) that governs its relations with the players. It has to abide by the agreement so some options available to some businesses are not an option for the NFL.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Changes to the agreement's terms are subject to appeal by the union which is exactly what happened \([npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/10/627717067/nfl-players-union-files-grievance-over-leagues-new-national-anthem-policy)\) when the league tried to change the rules. As a result, the changes are currently on hold, so this form of protest is not currently forbidden.
1.5.1.2. Con: Since the players are not officially 'at work' until the game officially starts, the players should have the right to kneel, sit, talk, run, drink water or whatever they choose to do before the game \(they are being paid for\) actually starts.
1.5.1.3. Pro: One goes to work to exchange services for money, not to share their personal issues. Employers like for employees to leave their personal baggage at home.
1.5.1.4. Pro: It's inappropriate. No company lets employees make major public political statements, esp over something controversial.
1.5.2. Pro: The field is their workplace. The employer sets the rules; it is up to the employee to accept them or not.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The NFL is a business and any action besides standing subjects the business to a political morass. Discipline and/or termination of employees that threaten the public relations of a company is normal, and NFL players are no different.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Forcing players to stand would also subject the business to a political morass and threaten the public relations of the company.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: You are not an individual as an NFL player. You’re the face of a franchise. Your actions can negatively or positively impact your company and the general livelihood of thousands of other people.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: Discipline and/or termination of employees may be illegal if it is considered discriminatory in nature. \([www.alllaw.com](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/employment/article21.asp)\) Since standing or kneeling is a form of speech that does not attack or prevent others from their own speech, it is likely discriminatory to discipline them for such acts, regardless of the PR implications.
1.5.2.2. Con: This is less about adhering to your employment contract, and more of like if your employer was Muslim \(or any other religion\) and demanded that you engage in prayer. It would not be part of the job that you were hired to do.
1.5.2.3. Pro: If a company wants to pay you $1 a day for back breaking work and the employee agrees to it, then that is a valid contract. If the employer changes the rules to include favors, even after being hired, then the employee can quit or agree to perform them.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: These kind of contracts would be illegal in countries with minimum wage and labor laws.
1.5.2.4. Pro: If an employee decides not to wear a uniform to make a statement, he or she would be fired.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: Standing, or sitting, or kneeling during the anthem is outside the description of their contract. This is markedly different than if they decided to not wear their jersey, or replace it with another.
1.5.3. Pro: Players have ample opportunity to protest outside of their workplace.
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.3.2. Con: There is something fundamentally different about a workplace in which literally millions of people watch you do your work. It becomes less of a workplace and more of a public forum, where expressions of conscience and censorship take on public significance.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Political protests are only meaningful when they gain public attention. The most reliable ways to gain attention are to create a spectacle, or to do something where there already is a spectacle.
1.5.4. Con: Military advertisements should never happen at the workplace, and the playing of the National Anthem is an advertisement that is paid for by the military for the sole purpose of recruitment.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Documented in painstaking detail [by report by two senators](https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/12de6dcb-d8d8-4a58-8795-562297f948c1/tackling-paid-patriotism-oversight-report.pdf) re: overspending. "In all, the military services reported $53 million in spending on marketing and advertising contracts with sports teams between 2012 and 2015." Also covered many other places, exemplified by articles like [this](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/us/nfl-national-anthem-trump-kaepernick-history-trnd/index.html).
1.5.4.2. Con: A military advertisement is not political or partisan. US forces protect every US citizen and their right of freedom. Recruitment for the military is a civil service, not political.
1.5.4.3. Con: Advertising recruitment in the military attracts new recruits, future soldiers who protect every citizen of the United States at home and abroad. Driving awareness for recruitment is a necessary component of any entity that wants to sustain and survive.
1.5.5. Con: Standing for the Anthem is a political act in itself. If political protests should not happen in the work place then demanding one to stand should not be allowed.
1.5.5.1. Con: We stand to focus on what unites us. That is the one moment we set all our differences aside. It is not about an administration, political affiliation, or the President; it is about the unity of a people in spite of our political or social ideas.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: That is exactly why they feel like they shouldn't stand, because they would be pretending that there is unity even where there isn't. By kneeling, it reminds people that there is more work to be done and standing and pretending everything is alright doesn't help anyone.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.5.7. Con: Historically, political protests have occurred at workplaces on many occasions. Saying they shouldn't is kind of like saying political protests shouldn't take place.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Both the women's movement and civil rights movement had forms of protest that took place at work.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: The workplace protests by the women's movement and civil rights movement addressed the disparity they endured AT the workplace - discrimination, wage inequality, and opportunity.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Political protests have historically taken place at work because often a disruption in the status quo or economic systems are needed for people to pay attention and thus instigate change.
1.5.7.3. Pro: Many successful protests, such as the [Bread and Roses strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Lawrence_textile_strike), and [General Motors strike](http://listverse.com/2011/11/17/top-10-famous-strikes-in-recent-history/) have been at work.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: Unlike these strikes, the NFL protests are a collective bargaining issue, the success of which depends on the complaint process. As such, the NFL is justified in not condoning political speech in the workplace.
1.5.7.4. Con: Such political protests at work are often related to the work/pay relationship between the employer and employee. It is actually a dispute rather than a protest. The loss inflicted on the employer are the results of different views between employer and the employee. This is not the case with the NFL.
1.5.7.4.1. Con: All labour actions are political protests at the workplace. They pit individuals with one idea of how work should be organized vs another, and they are instrumental in providing us with many labor rights we enjoy.
1.5.8. Pro: The NFL can't solve the problems that the players are protesting against, so the players should stand, rather than hurt their employer's business.
1.5.8.1. Con: The NFL is a multi-million dollar corporation. With that amount of capital, much could be done to lobby congress to address the issues that the players are protesting against. Whether the NFL or it's board/shareholders will do such a thing is a different issue.
1.5.8.2. Con: Even if the NFL cannot solve the problems that the players are protesting against, the 16.5 million people who watch the NFL game can solve the problems that the protesters are protesting about.
1.5.9. Pro: Failing to stand is harmful to their company's brand and undermines the justification for the pay they receive.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Kneeling leads to a lot of NFL fans becoming unhappy, leading to a drop in ratings, causing a drop in profit by the NFL, and in turn, decreased pay for the players.
1.6. Con: Attempts to dissuade players from protesting could actually encourage more people to join the movement by increasing the public's sympathy for them.
1.6.1. Pro: Throughout history, attempts to control protests have backfired.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The [sit-in movement](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sit-in-movement), begun in Greensboro, NC, started with just four people, but the attention paid to their protest eventually led to 70,000 black and white Americans participating.
1.7. Pro: The flag and the National Anthem are symbols of the nation. The offences being protested are not.
1.7.1. Con: The offences being protested are in large part the result of systemic racism. The federal government and its national institutions exert tremendous influence on systemic factors, so protests on the national stage are appropriate.
1.7.1.1. Pro: They are protesting targeted violence and killings- it's crime of epidemic proportions. They should be allowed to do so.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: The magnitude of the issue is hardly “epidemic.” For the past three years, the number of police shooting fatalities has been just shy of 1000 nationwide.[www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/police-shootings-2018/?utm_term=.32bf3752cf78). For context, Americans are more than 3.5 times more likely to die of drowning than they are of being victims of police shootings. [www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6119a4.htm)
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Cases of police fatalities are not the only thing being protested. There are, for example, non-fatal shootings, which appear to be [twice as common](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3jjpa/nonfatal-police-shootings-data), non shooting fatalities, which is harder to find statistics for, and non-shooting, non-fatal violent encounters.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if that’s the case, we’re a country of 330 Million people. All the incidents described, even if combined, would only affect a few thousand people nationwide per year. And the number affected by unjustified police violence is undoubtedly far lower, since it seems beyond reasonable dispute that at least some — if not most — exercises of police violence are justified by a reasonable fear that the victim would harm the officer or others.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Because police aren't required to provide a lot of information, finding reliable sources for non-fatal events and non-shooting events can be tricky. Finding evidence of racist practices is easy, finding evidence of disproportionate fatalities is easy, but getting precise numbers on general violence is a bit more difficult.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If, as the above point admits, it’s not possible to get real numbers on the magnitude of the problem, this counsels against protesting in such a divisive manner until we are confident that the scope of the harm protested exceeds the harm to national unity and pride caused by the protest itself.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The scope of the problem is hard to gauge, and attempts to make those numbers more readily available meets with resistance from people in the police and administration. Hopefully protests against police violence, based upon case studies, which at present is what is available, will force more transparency.
1.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Given that police are supposed to be acting as law enforcement, and are supposed to be trained to protect the populace, it is reasonable to hold them to a higher standard.
1.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The specific point under debate is whether the problem of police violence is an “epidemic.” We can believe that police should be held to a high standard while at the same time recognizing that there are relatively few instances annually where officers fail to live up to these standards and cause an unjustified civilian death. The problem can’t be characterized as an “epidemic” unless it is widespread, and statistics clearly show that it is not.
1.7.1.2. Con: Statistics do not support claims of systemic racism that is the basis for the kneeling.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: The protest isn't about systemic racism, it is about racial inequality and that many Americans choose to ignore that inequality.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The protest is about systemic racism. Kaepernick [said](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem): "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color." Purposeful social inequalities amounts to systemic racism.
1.7.1.2.2. Pro: Black people are statistically more likely than their white counterparts to commit crimes.
1.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: In 2013, there were 6,214,194 white Americans and 2,549,655 black Americans [arrested](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43) for crimes. Based on [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) ratios at the time, whites commit 2,668 crimes per 100K citizens and blacks commit 6,389 crimes per 100K citizens. Blacks are 2.4 times more likely to commit crimes than whites.
1.7.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: In 2013, there were 228,782 white Americans and 151,627 black Americans [arrested](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43) for violent crimes. Based on [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) ratios at the time, whites committed 98 violent crimes per 100K citizens and blacks committed 380 violent crimes per 100K citizens. Blacks are 3.9 times more likely to commit violent crimes than whites.
1.7.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: These statistics only show that black people are arrested at a higher rate. They do not show that black people commit crime at a higher rate. [Drug usage is roughly equal between white and black people](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/quicktables/quickconfig.do?34481-0001_all), but [black people are more likely to be arrested for it](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43).
1.7.1.2.2.1.2. Con: A large percentage of crimes [go unsolved](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/01/most-violent-and-property-crimes-in-the-u-s-go-unsolved/) in the US. Because black people are arrested more frequently does not necessarily indicate that more crimes are committed by black people.
1.7.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Convictions are [overturned at a higher rate for black people](http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf).
1.7.1.2.2.1.4. Con: African Americans are [incarcerated](http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/) in state prisons across the country at more than five times the rate of whites, and at least ten times the rate in five states, which shows that even if we assume African Americans commit crimes at 2.4 times the rate of white Americans, they are still twice as likely to be incarcerated.
1.7.1.2.2.1.5. Con: Racial disparities in arrest rates are [sometimes ruled discriminatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/opinion/racial-discrimination-in-stop-and-frisk.html). The parent claim conflates arrest statistics and crime rate statistics, showing only that African American men are arrested more,[not that they are more likely to commit crimes.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/06/04/marijuana_possession_laws_aclu_report_why_blacks_are_four_times_more_likely.html)
1.7.1.2.2.2. Con: Whether black people are more or less likely to commit crimes does not excuse the use of unreasonable force, especially when that force leads to death. Unreasonable force is being used. [Video evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/19/us/police-videos-race.html) shows several instances when black people were not resisting an arrest \(lawful or otherwise\) and were still abused or killed.
1.7.1.2.2.3. Con: This is not a matter of race; it's one of societal advantage versus disadvantage.
1.7.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Disparities in crime rates of blacks vs. whites stem from the [systemic racism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/09/bill-clinton-black-culture-systemic-inequality-problems) in the US that has kept so many black people in economic and social duress. Many turn to crime because they feel they have no alternatives.
1.7.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: [Studies](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/09/bill-clinton-black-culture-systemic-inequality-problems) have shown that in actuality, the crime rates of Blacks and whites are similar when the people being compared are of a similar income. It's only when the comparison is putting upper-middle-class people against middle- and lower-income people that the rates are skewed to make Black people appear more likely to commit crime.
1.7.1.2.2.4. Con: Higher rates of policing in black communities, as well as more stringent policing, lead to bloated statistics that would make one believe that people of color commit more crimes than whites.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: A history of systemic racism is well documented, including such practices as [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), [Racial Restrictive Covenants](http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants.htm), and [disparities in the GI Bill.](https://www.demos.org/blog/11/11/13/how-gi-bill-left-out-african-americans)
1.7.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.1.2.1.
1.7.1.2.3.2. Pro: This financial systemic racism has lead to a society where African Americans have less wealth, less home ownership, and less educational opportunities, which is systemic racism.
1.7.1.2.4. Con: People do not have be to be right about an issue to be allowed to demonstrate their perception of it, so such a point would be irrelevant anyway.
1.7.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.7.2. Pro: The goals of the protest are wrong.
1.7.2.1. Con: Even if the goals of the protest are "wrong," it is still allowed by free speech. Therefore, kneeling is fine.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Freedom of speech also protects the NFL's right to regulate players' conduct while representing the NFL. Opponents can argue that their rules are immoral or selective, but it would be difficult to challenge their legality.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: These players give of their bodies willingly for what is essentially territorial pride and entertainment. In a sport that is catching more and more flak with the concussion issue, they should save face and allow those who choose to protest kneel.
1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #10143: American football should be banned.
1.7.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The players are paid quite well to sacrifice their bodies and health; they are not doing it for altruistic reasons. Individuals trade their time and health everyday for money, so it goes without saying that it does not give them a right to cause a PR nightmare for their employer.
1.7.2.1.1.2. Con: Freedom of speech does not include the right to infringe on the rights of others. The players are not infringing on anyone else's rights; the owners are attempting to suppress the players' rights.
1.7.2.1.1.3. Con: "Freedom of speech" is about more than rights. It's about the goal - open debate and not shutting down criticism. If owners fire players who criticize the US, the spirit of freedom of speech isn't honored.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Allowing such a thing as "wrong goals" to dictate free speech leads to authoritarian governing.
1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.1.
1.7.2.3. Con: The goal of the protest is controversial; however, the protest itself is peaceful, to the point, and not harming anyone.
1.7.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.1.2.
1.7.2.5. Con: A protest, by definition, is not goal oriented. It is simply a display of disapproval over a certain object/subject.
1.7.2.5.1. Con: Protests are goal-oriented, by definition.  One does not protest for the sake of protesting, but rather to force a change.
1.7.2.5.2. Con: To protest is to object to or reject something that is otherwise accepted or allowed. The goal of any protest is change what is accepted.
1.7.2.6. Pro: What these NFL players are protesting is not a real issue in America today.
1.7.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.7.2.7. Con: Racial inequity in America is a significant social ill that requires change, and any form of non-violent protest of that inequity, even one that makes others uncomfortable, should be supported.
1.7.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.7.2.7.2. Con: Kneeling draws attention to the player and allows those who disagree with the protest to react against the individual, rather than the issue being protested.
1.7.2.7.2.1. Con: Kneeling in a [group](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=V%2fAHQ6no&id=6162569F2530F03D9AB692EA124FC318F56EA2CB&thid=OIP.V_AHQ6nogRxdf9auGQT9oAHaFj&mediaurl=http%3a%2f%2fcontent.khou.com%2fphoto%2f2017%2f10%2f29%2f636448907149525739-USP-NFL-HOUSTON-TEXANS-AT-SEATTLE-SEAHAWKS-94947561_1509310280231_11506911_ver1.0.JPG&exph=401&expw=534&q=kneeling+nfl+groups&simid=608051377496787144&selectedIndex=2) does not draw attention to the individual, but shows strong group solidarity.
1.7.2.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.1.1.
1.7.3. Pro: The National Anthem is not about police brutality. It is about the entire country. Therefore, NFL players should stand for their country rather than kneel against just the police.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.1.2.
1.7.3.2. Con: The police are a symbol of the power of the state. Protesting during the anthem, which is a recognition of the state, is more than acceptable to draw attention to the issue.
1.7.4. Pro: The offenses being protested are not under the control of the Federal Government, so players should focus their protests on the community where an incident happened, rather than on the nation.
1.7.4.1. Con: [Protests are also occurring at city halls](http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/blm_city_hall_occupation.php). Protests aren't either/or, only occurring at city halls or during the National Anthem. Protests can, and do, occur at different locations, with slightly different constituents, until positive change occurs.
1.7.4.2. Con: Actually, the offenses are under the control of the Federal Government by way of the 14th amendment, which prohibits depriving "any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law" or denying "any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: When an officer working for the city, county, or state government kills unarmed citizens without the benefit of a trial, they are violating both of those tenets of the 14th amendment.
1.8. Con: Forcing someone to stand would be an actively oppressive gesture.
1.8.1. Pro: Forcing players to stand will just support their point that they're oppressed, victimized and unfree.
1.8.1.1. Con: They would be no less free and no more oppressed than the tens of millions of other Americans who are also required to follow workplace rules.
1.8.2. Con: If the NFL is a private institution, people who work and/or participate in their events should follow their rules.
1.8.2.1. Con: There are limits to what private institutions can require from their employees. For example, restricting employees from engaging in political debate is one thing, but requiring employees to speak in support of a specific candidate is another. Requiring people to stand for the pledge of allegiance could be viewed as forcing them to espouse a belief that they do not hold.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: One's personal belief, no matter its sacredness, should in no way be forced on another.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: Freedom is more important than trying to prevent offending people. This means people can believe players should stand without believing they should be forced to stand.
1.8.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: If free speech is quelled whenever someone is offended by it, it is a meaningless right.
1.9. Pro: People watch football to escape from politics. Viewers want to watch a game, not a protest.
1.9.1. Con: People are opposed to the manner of the protest because it is difficult to ignore. Arguments against it are examples of [motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning): people look for reasons to avoid confronting something they don't want to confront.
1.9.2. Con: Politics are inherently imbued in every aspect of life.
1.9.2.1. Pro: When you watch a football game, you support the NFL, [a powerful organization with its own political impact](http://www.cracked.com/article_21720_5-reasons-nfls-way-more-evil-than-you-thought-possible.html).
1.9.3. Pro: Studies have [shown](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/sunday-review/elections-partisanship-exhausted-majority.html) that the majority of Americans are "exhausted" with politics.
1.9.4. Con: Avoiding politics is a privilege. Being uncomfortable with politics and distancing yourself from them is exactly why these players kneel. They are trying to bring the problem to society's forefront.
1.9.4.1. Con: Being unable to escape political issues can result in apathy and [fatigue](https://blog.politicsmeanspolitics.com/how-to-avoid-political-fatigue-in-the-age-of-over-politicization-cd686d6690a8?gi=75758cf6d4ea), which reduces one's ability to incite change.
1.9.5. Pro: Sports and other entertainment are some of the few activities that unite people. If the players stand, the sport is again uniting people.
1.9.5.1. Pro: The players are hijacking a game that everyone enjoyed.
1.9.5.2. Con: People can also unite to fight against systemic injustice. If the goal is uniting people, a better solution would be for NFL watchers to unite with NFL players to protest injustice.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: Injustice causes disunity.  The players are kneeling to bring attention to injustice.  Telling people to ignore injustice so some feel better is a loathsome sentiment.
1.9.5.3. Con: Unity isn't a worthy goal in a democracy.
1.9.5.3.1. Pro: Division is not only natural and beneficial to democracy, but an inherently democratic value. Lopsided results where nearly everyone agrees on something are often indicative of rigged elections and totalitarianism.
1.9.5.3.2. Pro: Uncritical unity is dangerous. By interrupting the nation's uncritical consumption of sports/entertainment, the players are highlighting injustice in a very public and impactful manner.
1.9.5.4. Pro: When people protest demonstrations of patriotism, they turn their back on the system that ensures we have these freedoms and create division among all people. There are more constructive ways to protest.
1.9.5.4.1. Con: American patriotism is born of political demonstrations - from the Boston Tea Party to anti-Vietnam protests. Failing to protest injustice isn't "turning your back on the system that ensures we have the freedom", but instead, "patriotically exercising your right to political demonstration".
1.9.5.4.2. Con: Kneeling does not prevent anyone from standing or participating in the Anthem. It is thus peaceful, non-violent, and only disruptive in the sense of people reacting to the protest; not the protest occurring itself.
1.9.5.4.3. Con: Attacking the method of a protest is often just an excuse to try and silence the message.
1.9.5.5. Pro: Patriotism binds the nation together.
1.9.5.5.1. Pro: Patriotism makes the population more willing to sacrifice for the nation as a whole, be it by paying taxes or going to war. This helps to overcome [collective action problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem).
1.9.5.5.1.1. Con: The actions of the nation as a whole are often unethical.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1. Con: The US acts ethically internationally.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US allows many countries to freeride on security, in particular the EU, and has not taken serious action to stop this.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: The US is the only power that was willing to engage militarily abroad to stop genocides from happening.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: The US has build an institutional international order that allows other countries to grow.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.4. Con: Only under a very [odd](https://chomsky.info/20101026/) [inconsistent](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-ever-growing-list-of-admitted-false-flag-attacks/5578473) ethical code.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5. Con: There are numerous examples throughout recent history of the US acting unethically, usually in an effort to further its self-interest.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: The US [supports](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/02/a-reminder-mubarak-isn-t-the-only-u-s-backed-dictator/342401/) several dictatorial regimes.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Under Realpolitik, the US supported and expedited the [Indonesian invasion of East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor#US_involvement) \(which cost upwards of 100,000 lives\) as well as the [Bangladesh genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) \(which cost upwards of 300,000 lives\) because these were considered to be in America's best national interest.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: From 1965-1973 the [bombing campaign](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/khmer-rouge-cambodian-genocide-united-states/) that the US led against Cambodia in an effort to eliminate North Vietnamese strongholds cost an untold number of civilian lives and laid the groundwork for the Khmer Rouge to secure power, leading to the Cambodian genocide of 1975-79 and the infamous "killing fields".
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5.4. Pro: Fearing the spread of communism in South America in the 1970s, the US initiated a [bloody coup](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/henry-kissinger-and-american-foreign-policy) against Salvador Allende, the democratically elected socialist leader of Chile. Under American support, the government that replaced him started a program of organized terror to imprison and murder all opposition -- even those who were non-communist.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5.5. Pro: Realizing that the Vietnam War was a lost cause, Nixon and Kissinger [applied Realpolitik](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/henry-kissinger-and-american-foreign-policy) in order to secure an exit that would preserve the credibility of American power. This meant negotiating with Vietnamese communists under the threat of violent retaliation should they not compromise. Ultimately, this policy continued the conflict until 1973; and although the US managed to preserve its image, it came at the cost of thousands of lives.
1.9.5.5.1.1.1.5.6. Pro: When the US invaded Iraq in the early 2000s, it was under the [false pretense](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/28/iraq.usa) of trying to destroy WMDs but was actually about fears over oil and the preservation of the US dollar. This war cost hundreds of thousands of lives and created a [power vacuum](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/intelligence-files-support-claims-iraq-invasion-helped-spawn-isis) that led to the rise of ISIS and other terrorist groups.
1.9.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: The US is [force-feeding Guantanamo detainees](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/force-feeding-guantanamo-detainees-unethical).
1.9.5.5.1.2. Con: If the sacrifice is for an ignoble cause, however, then patriotism can be incredibly dangerous.
1.9.5.5.2. Con: A world where citizens are increasingly patriotic is a world likely to go to war with nationalist fervor. "Patriotism" is just a better word for "Nationalism". Nationalism is dangerous.
1.9.5.5.2.1. Con: Nationalism is [a harmful form of patriotism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/#PatNat). While patriotism is a devotion to a particular place and a way of life one thinks best, but has no wish to impose on others, nationalism is accordingly aggressive.
1.9.5.5.2.1.1. Con: Nationalism/Patriotism allows for the self-confidence to accept foreign cultures and people. South Koreans, for example, have a very strong sense of [national pride](http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120425001114) but at the same time are open and eager to [incorporate](https://thediplomat.com/2014/07/korea-redefines-multiculturalism/) foreign people and cultures.
1.9.5.5.2.1.1.1. Con: South Koreans are eager to accept foreigners because of long-term collaboration with the US, as opposed to patriotism.
1.9.5.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Many foreigners South Korea accepts are not from the US. In fact, immigration statistics show that the US represent less than [10%](https://esa.un.org/miggmgprofiles/indicators/files/Korea.pdf).
1.9.5.5.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Intercultural exchanges were not started by the US in Korea but by Japan's colonization.
1.9.5.5.2.1.1.2. Con: South Koreans are eager to accept foreigners because of economic wisdom, as opposed to patriotism.
1.9.5.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Logically, being insecure about one's identity will undermine one's confidence that a country can handle problems that arise with it.
1.9.5.5.2.1.2. Pro: Participation in a national identity can lead to negative results. [Jingoism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jingoism), a form of ultra nationalism, can lead to individuals thinking their country is always right and other countries are wrong, which can lead to conflict and war.
1.9.5.5.2.1.3. Con: Nationalism is not necessarily a bad thing, as the shared sense of norms, mores, and identity that it gives citizens not only strengthens communities but helps to prevent feelings of isolation and anomie.
1.9.5.5.2.1.4. Con: This is a sweeping overgeneralization. There are multiple forms of nationalism; and while some might tend more towards aggression or intolerance, others do not.
1.9.5.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: Although the exclusive nature of [ethnic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism) tends to be more harmful, [civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism) is far more inclusive since its membership is voluntary and revolves around shared social values rather than shared heritage. This type of nationalism is thus less likely to be harmful or xenophobic as it is compatible with progressive values like freedom, equality, and tolerance.
1.9.5.5.2.1.4.2. Pro: [Sports nationalism](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nationalism-is-not-necessarily-a-bad-thing/article/2599075), best illustrated by the Olympic games, is a type of nationalism that has positive attributes. Not only does it easily embrace ethnic and racial diversity, but it offers an opportunity for people from nations suffering political or economic divides to unite in celebration of their fellow countrymen's athletic prowess.
1.9.5.5.2.1.4.3. Con: The forms of nationalism that do not tend toward aggression and intolerance, however, are generally the ones that do not see refugees as a threat to their national identity and would see new cultures in their country as enriching rather than eroding their heritage.
1.9.5.5.2.1.5. Pro: [Nationalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism) extends the notion of patriotism by also including “exalting one nation above all others, placing primary emphasis on its culture and interests,” and nationalism places more emphasis on symbols and icons over the people who live in that nation.
1.9.5.5.2.1.6. Pro: The anthem is just another show of nationalism, which enforces imaginary boundaries.
1.9.5.5.2.1.6.1. Con: Since the boundaries are enforced by law and protected by force of arms, they are real, even though they may not be physical.
1.9.5.5.2.1.6.2. Con: The sovereignty of a nation necessitates boundaries, whether marked on the ground or only on a map.
1.9.5.6. Con: Forcing everyone to stand would only cause more disunity because those that supported kneeling would feel silenced by an already unjust government.
1.9.5.6.1. Pro: Because of people kneeling, the idea that there is a civil disconnect has been brought to the forefront of political debate. This disunity existed before NFL players were kneeling, but was not acted upon until this movement.
1.9.5.7. Con: Rituals and ceremonies don't create lasting, meaningful bonds. We bond when we talk and come together to solve problems. Kneeling has started us talking by pointing out a problem we need to solve.
1.9.5.7.1. Pro: Unity comes from understanding each other. Making a sincere effort to listen to them and understand why they are kneeling brings unity; not forcing them to shut up.
1.9.5.8. Con: Standing during the national anthem doesn't affect the game itself in any way. If the sport itself is the activity that unifies people then only actions that impact the sport will impact its unifying effect.
1.9.5.8.1. Con: Regardless of whether or not the game play itself is altered, it is self-evident that the players' choice to stand or kneel has influenced the sport's unifying effect on the masses. Otherwise, this very debate would not exist.
1.9.5.8.2. Con: By standing, NFL players enhance the unity of the nation.
1.10. Pro: Standing for the National Anthem expresses patriotism.
1.10.1. Con: Standing is a completely arbitrary action, and is devoid of any meaning that could be construed as negative or positive.
1.10.2. Pro: Kneeling disrespects the flag that many have died for.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The flag holds a great emotional and sincere value to millions of Americans, many of whom tie the sacrifices of veterans on behalf of their nation as woven into the symbol of the flag.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Kneeling was taken from the act of kneeling at a fallen soldier's grave by Kaepernick, [after talking to Nate Boyer](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/heres-how-nate-boyer-got-colin-kaepernick-to-go-from-sitting-to-kneeling/), a former Green Beret.  This was done as opposed to sitting, in order to get the message out while still being respectful.
1.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: Specifically, Boyer offered that kneeling would be seen as more respectful because it's something that soldiers do at military grave sites to show respect.
1.10.2.1.2. Con: The message against police brutality is being deliberately redirected to veterans in an attempt to silence a legitimate protest.  That redirection itself is disrespectful to veterans who fight for justice and not for the flag.
1.10.2.1.3. Con: For a protest to be effective, it must be conspicuous.
1.10.2.2. Con: Just because people die for something does not make it worthy of respect. Many ISIS fighters have made great personal sacrifices for their cause, it does not mean they are necessarily worth of respect.
1.10.2.2.1. Pro: One must protest when it is apparent that the global and internal actions of any nation are such that its active influence appears counter-productive to global efforts of peace and stability. Arguably, the U.S. has, and continues to influence the international community negatively, and under unethical and inconsistent maxims. Protesting its symbol, therefore, is a refusal to blindly believe that the U.S. continues to be in the business of developing peace, freedom and prosperity for all.
1.10.2.3. Con: The flag is only a symbol of the ideals this country was founded on. Those ideals are found in the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and Bill of Rights. If you're exercising a right to free speech, this honors the flag.
1.10.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.
1.10.2.4. Con: There are so many instances of people breaking the [flag code](http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html) at every game that no one ever talks about.
1.10.2.4.1. Con: It seems that we are being distracted by the act of taking a knee when we should actually be discussing the reason that the players are taking a knee.
1.10.2.4.2. Pro: The draping of the field with the flag pregame is against flag code, thus disrespectful. Anyone wearing attire other than military, PD, or FD, that has a flag on it is against flag code.
1.10.2.5. Con: Police brutality undermines the respect people have for that flag, as police are supposed to be upholders of the peace, not dissidents of it. It is more patriotic to kneel in protest of this injustice than it is to condemn those doing the kneeling.
1.10.2.6. Pro: By kneeling during times of [national crisis](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4942970/Three-Kansas-City-Chiefs-players-not-stand-anthem.html), such as after the Las Vegas shootings, many see kneeling NFL players as a sign of disrespect to the victims.
1.10.2.6.1. Con: They are kneeling as a sign of acknowledgement and respect for the victims of unnecessary police brutality. How can kneeling to pay respects to some victims, be considered disrespectful to other victims?
1.10.2.6.2. Con: It's not the fault of the NFL players if some of their audience misinterprets the meaning of their protest, and this is no reason for them to stop the protest entirely.
1.10.2.6.2.1. Con: No, but they should change the form of protest to one that does not seem disrespectful. The [original purpose](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/sep/25/short-history-national-anthem-and-sports/) of playing the national anthem at sporting events nationwide was a tribute to the troops during WW2, and after 9/11, players would stand for similar reasons. To kneel now with the understanding of what the anthem means can be seen as disrespect to the troops. The leap from the original intention to how it's being viewed is not far enough to be trivialized as a mere misinterpretation.
1.10.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Any form of protest can be seen as disrespectful if people try hard enough. Each person must decide how they view the kneeling protest -- they can view the kneeling as an American symbol of protesting injustice, or view it as disrespecting the troops. Fundamentally, the protest isn't disrespectful or respectful, except that a viewer makes it so.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2. Con: When Mr. Kaepernick first protested, he sat on the bench until he met with a group of veterans who suggested he kneel to [show respect but still protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._national_anthem_protests_\(2016%E2%80%93present\)#2016_preseason).
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.1.1.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2. Con: When explaining his protest, Kaepernick stated, ["I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color"](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem). This indicates he explicitly did not want to show respect for America.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2.1. Con: "Pride" and "Respect" are different things.  He can show respect by working to change the system he feels does not work, rather than express blind, bland patriotism.  He is not required to feel proud of what the flag stands for.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2.2. Con: In stating the aspect of America that he has no pride in he defined his protest. Generalization of his actions as a lack of pride in America generally is therefore incorrect or disingenuous.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Kaepernick [retweeted](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/kaepernick-takes-stand-civil-rights-sits-during-national-anthem) images of the U.S. and the Confederate flags with the message: “The fact that you really believe that there is difference in these flags means that your \[sic\] ignoring history.” Given that he believes the US is no better morally than a slave state, his lack of pride in the country would seem rather complete and not compartmentalized to just police shootings.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The American flag represents the same country that the confederate flag did. There is no part of confederate history that is not part of American history. By that interpretation, pretending like they're different things is ignoring history.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Another part of this country literally fought a war to end the unjust practices of the Confederacy. Americans sacrificed their lives in enormous numbers to move our nation towards a more racially just society. Kap is the one ignoring history by saying we’ve not substantially evolved morally as a nation since the days of slavery.
1.10.2.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The Confederacy sought to become another country specifically because they knew that this country was evolving morally to the point that it would no longer tolerate its racially unjust practices.
1.10.2.6.3. Con: And yet, historically, kneeling in mourning has happened so prominently that art \(statues and paintings\) has been made of the act.

[Angels Kneeling in Mourning at a Memorial](http://www.classichostess.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/w/u/wu75628vb-l.jpg)

1.10.2.7. Con: They died to protect freedoms, not the flag. Pretending NFL players don't have this right disrespects the people who died.
1.10.2.7.1. Pro: Those who died "for the flag" died for the freedom and safety of its people. Ruling a protest that highlights uneven distribution of freedom and safety illegitimate on technical grounds \(flag code\) is more disrespectful than the protest itself.
1.10.2.8. Con: Kneeling is a sign of respect.
1.10.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.1.1.
1.10.2.8.2. Pro: Kneeling can be just as respectful as standing, hence the saying "Take a knee". That it flouts tradition just draws attention and is not in and of itself inherently disrespectful.
1.10.2.8.3. Pro: When a player is seriously injured in a game it is customary for players to kneel out of respect. Our justice system \(i.e. government\) is itself injured right now, and the flag is the manifestation of that government. As such, it is respectful to kneel in protest of injustice. They are supporting the flag by providing critiques of what they love dearly in the hopes that they can help make it better.
1.10.2.8.3.1. Pro: This demonstrates how kneeling is already established as a mark of respect within the context of a football game.
1.10.2.8.3.2. Con: This is a communication problem. Kneeling instead of standing doesn't send the same message to all people. Instead of hearing this message that the country is sick, a lot of people hear the message that these players don't respect the flag/anthem and, by extension, they don't respect America.
1.10.2.8.3.2.1. Con: When protesting injustice, effective communication is always a problem. Those who support the status quo will always misunderstand and misconstrue the intent of the action.
1.10.2.8.3.3. Con: Comparing our etiquette to injured players to an injured political system is just an unfair comparison. Comparing two unconnected things and then personifying a political entity doesn't justify kneeling. We should be standing because of the good things we have done, giving people rights, making people equal, etc. Those are reasons to stand for our flag, the current political climate should not discourage us from uniting around great American values.
1.10.2.8.3.3.1. Con: The idea is that people are, in fact, not treated equally, making it harder to stand for that. Demanding respect is not an effective way of earning respect.
1.10.2.8.4. Pro: Kneeling is a posture that evokes prayer/silent thought about a subject. During the national anthem, kneeling shows the person is praying for the nation or wishing the nation well.
1.10.2.8.4.1. Pro: Kneeling is humbling, and professional athletes seldom express such humility. It is a show of humility and reverence for those that suffer at the hands of others.
1.10.2.8.4.1.1. Con: The same action can have different meanings in different contexts. In the context of football, kneeling means “I give up” on a play. The symbolism is, thus, not the reverence in the context of religious kneeling. It is instead a message of giving up on being proud of the country.
1.10.2.8.5. Pro: Throughout history, kneeling has frequently been used to show respect and reverence.
1.10.2.8.5.1. Pro: Kneeling has a long history of meaning worship and honor \([thankgodforjesus.org](http://www.thankgodforjesus.org/spiritual-meaning-of-bowing-kneeling-down/)\), \([Kneeling for queen](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wkms/files/styles/card_280/public/Columbus-before-Queen-Isabella.jpg)\), and \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneeling)\). The claim that kneeling is disrespectful is not supported by facts.
1.10.2.8.5.2. Pro: In sects of both Christianity and Islam, [kneeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneeling) is the proper position to take when praying as a means to show reverence for God.
1.10.2.8.5.3. Pro: [Genuflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuflection) -- the act of taking a single knee -- has not only been used in a variety of religious practices but has also been used for centuries as a way to show respect for royalty.
1.10.2.8.5.3.1. Pro: Genuflection is also the standard pose taken when the folded flag of a fallen veteran is presented to the veteran's family.
1.10.2.8.5.3.1.1. Pro: It is highly hypocritical to say that those who kneel during the anthem are disrespecting veterans and the flag when that same exact pose is used by military members as a means of conveying respect for their fallen comrades.
1.10.2.8.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: [We're all hypocrites](https://www.thomasvan.com/human-psychology/everybodys-a-hypocrite), each and every one of us! The 'key' is to keep 'judging others' to a minimum.
1.10.2.8.5.4. Pro: Kneel for the king, kneel for the person in power \(usually a dictatorship, but still\). Individuals kneel when they are knighted. And out of respect for fallen soldiers, we kneel or bow our head.
1.10.2.8.6. Pro: Kneeling is a sign of total respect to a superior, so NFL players should kneel.
1.10.2.8.7. Con: Kneeling during the tradition to stand is not respect.
1.10.2.8.7.1. Con: -> See 1.10.2.6.2.1.2.
1.10.2.8.8. Pro: The protesters could be raising their middle fingers during the anthem to express their discontent. Rather, they are maintaining a level of respect for the flag/anthem/country by kneeling, while also making themselves stand out, which brings attention to their cause. This was their intent all along.
1.10.2.8.9. Pro: We kneel when we propose. That is not disrespect.
1.10.2.8.9.1. Con: The meaning of a symbol is contextual.  What may be interpreted as an A-OK sign in some cultures is offensive in others.  Kneeling during a proposal does not imply that kneeling at all other times is respectful.
1.10.2.8.10. Pro: Kneeling and/or bowing before authority is a subservient and/or prostrate action.
1.10.2.8.10.1. Con: In the context, it's generally understood by most that they are kneeling as a protest. It's an act of defiance, not subservience.
1.10.2.8.10.2. Con: In this case standing could be seen as being subservient to the establishment that is telling them to stand. By kneeling they are, apologies for the pun, standing up to the authority that tells them to stop trying to be political and do your job.
1.10.2.9. Pro: Standing acknowledges the sacrifices of American servicemen and women.
1.10.2.9.1. Con: Servicemen and women sacrificed for Americans' rights to protest, not so that our differences would be silenced and stifled.
1.10.2.9.1.1. Pro: There is no reason that players should be obliged to acknowledge these individuals. They are worth acknowledging, to be sure, but they fought so Americans could be free, including from their memory.
1.10.2.9.2. Con: Honoring our servicemen and women is not necessarily a good thing. It would first have to be established that the military is worth honoring.
1.10.2.9.2.1. Pro: The US doesn't act in a way that justifies to celebrate it with pride.
1.10.2.9.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.5.5.1.1.1.
1.10.2.9.3. Con: Neither the national anthem nor football games have anything to do with American servicemen or women.
1.10.2.9.3.1. Pro: The National Anthem holds no real relation to the United States military. It doesn't represent their sacrifices or how millions of men and women dying in lands thousands of miles away correlates to preserving free speech.
1.10.2.9.3.2. Pro: There is no link between why the players are kneeling and soldiers and veterans. They have clearly stated they are protesting racism and police brutality.
1.10.2.9.4. Con: The National Anthem is for everybody, not just the military. Servicemen and women, and veterans, are supposed to stand just like everyone else.
1.10.2.9.5. Con: Not all [soldiers and veterans](https://theundefeated.com/features/an-open-letter-from-american-military-veterans-in-support-of-colin-kaepernick/) are of the opinion that kneeling during the anthem is wrong.
1.10.2.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.6.2.1.2.
1.10.2.9.6. Con: There are many ways we honor our servicemen and women; it is heavily ingrained in our culture. One aberration isn't a problem.
1.10.2.9.6.1. Con: Communication is a two way protocol and the message given by disrespecting known patriotic displays is disrespect to the country, its defenders and citizens alike. Even if that is not the intention.
1.10.2.9.6.1.1. Con: Communication is a two-way protocol, and the players have taken [reasonable efforts to clarify their intent is not to disrespect,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/opinion/colin-kaepernick-football-protests.html) and have chosen forms which are intentionally not disrespectful. Each person who watches has the power to determine if they hear a peaceful protest during the anthem as "disrespecting the country, its defenders, and its citizens". The players cannot force the watchers to take offense or not - that right is the watchers only.
1.10.2.9.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.10.2.6.2.
1.10.2.9.6.1.3. Con: Free speech dictates that it is okay to disrespect America.
1.10.2.9.6.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.
1.10.2.9.6.1.3.2. Pro: America is great because we have the right to kneel or burn the flag if that's how we want to communicate. If they do not have the right to kneel, America is not free.
1.10.2.9.6.1.3.2.1. Con: The guarantee of freedom of speech  only protects one from actions of the government, not from an employer.  An employer has the right to regulate how its employees conduct themselves.
1.10.2.9.6.1.3.2.2. Pro: Standing for the national anthem, in and of itself, is not harmful. It is mandating it and lambasting opponents that is.
1.10.2.9.6.1.3.2.3. Pro: In the Supreme Court case of [Texas v. Johnson](http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-texas-v-johnson), it was determined that burning the American flag peacefully was legal under the First Amendment right to free expression.
1.10.3. Con: An expression of patriotism loses meaning when it becomes obligatory.
1.10.3.1. Pro: The concept of coerced \(forced\) behavior, specifically nationalistic patriotism, is itself antithetical to the premise of a free and democratic society.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Patriotism is by definition voluntary; it is an organic emotion that a person either feels or does not.
1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Authoritarian nationalism, that is, being required/forced by authorities to outwardly exhibit devotion to one's homeland, is a characteristic of fascism.
1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.1.1.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Standing for the flag has become rote. For an action to having meaning or propel a set of values that action must be done in a thoughtful and deliberate manner.
1.10.3.3.1. Con: Positive, meaningful actions or values need not only arise after every person cogitates his assent, collectively. \(ex. consider the vacuity and role of pleasantries we exchange, and forms of nonchalance in observation of religious worship with lukewarm attendees\)
1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.5.
1.10.5. Con: Peaceful protest is actually a form of patriotism because it is pushing to make the USA a better place.
1.10.5.1. Pro: The protest specifically highlights the fact that the system is failing to ensure the freedoms guaranteed to all Americans.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Kneeling for the anthem is a way for professional athletes to fight for the same freedoms our veterans have fought for.  Kneeling athletes and American soldiers ultimately fight for the same thing, just in very different ways.
1.10.5.2.1. Pro: American soldiers swear an oath to protect and defend the constitution, not traditions, values or "our way of life". The constitution was designed to protect man's natural rights and soldiers protect the constitution, hence protecting the rights of man. Kneeling athletes and soldiers are fighting for the same principle...the natural rights of all men.
1.11. Con: America grants the individual the freedom to stand, kneel or avoid action during an anthem.
1.11.1. Con: It is normal, common, and legal for employers to discipline and/or terminate their employees for causing problems with their public relations. Nothing about the national anthem or America's freedoms make this situation any different.
1.11.1.1. Con: If this is true, then the NFL's position as a private enterprise means that their choice to not fire people should be respected.
1.11.1.2. Pro: Free speech and other civil rights are more accurately conceived, not as grants to the people, but as limitations upon government. Laws cannot prevent or compel the content of speech, with a few narrow exceptions such as defamation or perjury.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.
1.11.3. Pro: The players should avoid the National Anthem entirely.
1.11.3.1. Pro: The anthem is a largely symbolic gesture in sports all over the world. If it's going to be politically polarizing, it should be avoided entirely.
1.11.3.2. Con: If the players' contract says stand, they are on the clock, and they should honor the contract and stand.
1.11.3.2.1. Con: It's actually illegal to force someone to participate in a patriotic display, so even if it is in their contract, it's not an enforceable clause.
1.11.3.2.1.1. Con: It’s illegal for the government to force individuals to engage in patriotic conduct. Nothing in the law bars private employers from making patriotic conduct a condition of employment.
1.11.3.2.2. Pro: Standing for the National Anthem is part of the job.
1.11.3.2.2.1. Pro: NFL players are protected against government, not private, censorship. The National Football League's rules allows franchises \(teams\), which are considered private enterprises, to dictate terms of behavior for their employees \(players.\)
1.11.3.2.2.2. Con: It cannot be part of anyone's job to support or express opinions which are not his own.
1.11.3.2.2.2.1. Con: [Kim Davis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Davis) was dismissed and jailed for failing to perform her duties as a marriage clerk due to her personal opinions of marriage differing from the institution she worked for.
1.11.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: We would find it unacceptable if people in other jobs, such as those in the service industry, were forced to partake in the National Anthem before each shift.
1.11.3.2.2.3. Pro: Players are entertainers, paid to perform per standards set forth by their employers and, in this case, the NFL.  If the player doesn't want to perform to the standards, the employer is free to fire them for breach of contract.
1.11.3.2.2.3.1. Con: This, like some other pro arguments, is an argument about the legal right of the NFL to dictate standards and behaviors. It says nothing about whether it should be done.
1.11.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Teams are restricted to terminate players because football players are rare.
1.11.3.2.2.3.2.1. Con: This is a false statement. There are plenty of really good players. Uniquely great ones, by definition, ok. That is not the bulk of the players.
1.11.3.2.2.3.2.2. Con: Appeasing fans is necessary to the continuation of the financial goals of the NFL. Their business will suffer without appeasement.
1.11.3.2.2.3.2.2.1. Con: The best way to appease the fans is to appease the players.
1.11.3.2.2.3.2.3. Pro: Yeah, but the players have a much smaller market for their skill set, and a much shorter career life, so not many players would test the theory that they are too critical to the success of the overall business and that owners would not take action against them.
1.11.3.2.2.3.2.3.1. Con: They are testing it.
1.11.3.2.2.4. Con: It was not part of the job until [very recently](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533/nfl-owners-approve-new-national-anthem-policy). Though the owners have now made it part of the job, that doesn't mean they have the right to force that upon the players.
1.11.3.2.2.4.1. Con: As a result of the new anthem policy referenced above, there was a [grievance filed](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/10/627717067/nfl-players-union-files-grievance-over-leagues-new-national-anthem-policy) by the NFL Player's Union on July 10, 2018. Then on July 19, 2018, there was a [joint announcement](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/7/19/17593624/miami-dolphins-national-anthem-protests-discipline-suspensions-union-grievance-policy) by the NFL and the Player's Union that "the league will temporarily freeze the enforcement of any new rules related to players protesting during the national anthem." Separately, the Union's grievance process was paused.
1.11.3.2.2.4.2. Con: This is not a valid argument. Even if the job description changed yesterday, it's still part of the job. And if it's part of the job, of course the employer has the right to enforce his employee to do it.
1.11.3.2.2.5. Con: NFL players are not paid to stand during the anthem.
1.11.3.2.2.5.1. Con: All actions NFL players perform anywhere "on the gridiron" are for what they are paid. Saying they are not paid to stand for the anthem is akin to saying employees aren't paid to do anything but work, so they are not allowed to do anything else \(e.g., use restroom, make or drink coffee, take a break, socialize\).
1.11.3.2.2.6. Con: It is not during the actual play time of the game. And the players are respectfully utilizing their limited platform to the benefit of less fortunates.
1.11.3.2.2.7. Con: Kaepernick used to sit out, and there was no controversy there. So, standing for the Anthem is not reasonably part of their job. The question is whether football players deserve the First Amendment right to make a demonstration.
1.11.3.2.2.7.1. Con: Although Kaepernick got plenty of attention, it was negative and the real reason for his protest was not conveyed because it was viewed as disrespect. There are other platforms that could have conveyed the message and voices would have been heard.
1.11.3.2.2.7.2. Con: The First Amendment applies to a.o. laws Congress may pass. It does not mean a private company cannot penalize a private employee for their choices.
1.11.3.2.2.7.2.1. Con: The first amendment exists because it is the right thing to do, saying that someone isn't legally bound to it does not make it right for them not to follow it.
1.11.3.2.2.8. Con: It may well be in the league/team's legal right to fire players who don't stand for the anthem. But that doesn't change the fact that kneeling may be the right thing to do.
1.11.3.2.2.8.1. Con: The players are contracted to the teams, not the league. Therefore, it is the duty of the teams to make this call.
1.11.3.2.2.8.1.1. Con: The league sets forth strict uniform guidelines on uniforms, conduct, and fines individuals for non-compliance.
1.11.3.2.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: The NFL prohibited [Dallas Strong stickers](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-wont-let-cowboys-wear-decals-supporting-dallas-police-in-regular-season/) on helmets.
1.11.3.2.2.8.2. Pro: Players in the NFL or other leagues have a unique national platform that reaches people with differing views. It is up to the league whether to discipline but it is a very effective form of protest for those players who feel it necessary to do so.
1.11.3.2.2.8.2.1. Con: NFL players should voluntarily refrain from hijacking a huge audience that's paid to see them perform as athletes and using it as an opportunity to broadcast their political views. If they feel "forced" to do something they can't abide, they should resign their positions.
1.11.3.2.2.8.3. Pro: The Department of Transportation had a legal right to arrest Rosa Parks, but many would still agree she was doing the right thing by protesting.
1.11.3.2.2.8.4. Pro: Sometimes, a good cause is more important than a good job.
1.11.3.2.2.8.4.1. Pro: Progress is very rarely made without action. This is where trade unionism was born from; coming together to work for progress and change.
1.11.3.2.2.8.4.2. Pro: There is a norm in American society that personal belief and morality can supersede professional obligation in some circumstances. This protection has even occasionally extended to whistleblowers in high security circumstances \(e.g [Presidential Policy Directive 19 \(PPD-19\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Policy_Directive_19)\).  It does not seem proportionate to not offer the same protections to a group of people refusing to partake in a seemingly non-essential component of work because they feel the need to peacefully protest.
1.11.3.2.2.8.4.2.1. Pro: Gaining national attention gives us an opportunity to reflect on these laws.
1.11.3.2.2.8.4.2.2. Con: Leaving the decision about whether to allow protests at the workplace to the individual morality of the protester opens the door to protests in favor of causes that many who currently support kneeling would find immoral.
1.11.3.2.2.8.4.2.3. Con: While it is a reasonable argument that whistle-blowers and similar conscientious objectors should be free from prosecution when acting to the benefit of society, there are not many \(if any\) cases where they retain their job afterwards.
1.11.3.2.2.9. Con: Employers do not have an absolute right to determine what their employees "do during work." There are numerous laws that limit this right and protect the rights of employees.
1.11.3.2.2.9.1. Pro: The National Labor Board [provides](https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/whats-law/employers/interfering-employee-rights-section-7-8a1) extensive lists of what is and is not allowed by employers.
1.11.3.3. Con: Avoiding the topic entirely is dismissive of the valid concerns of players protesting racial injustice.
1.11.3.3.1. Con: There are ways for people to protest social injustice and inequality independently from choosing a side in the kneeling vs standing debate.
1.11.3.4. Con: Refusing to take a stand is implicit acceptance of the status quo. If the status quo is unjust, then inaction is complicit in injustice.
1.11.3.4.1. Con: Just because one refuses to engage in a particular form of protest, or chooses to avoid a particular controversy, does not mean they are doing nothing to address the problem.
1.11.3.4.1.1. Pro: The same can be said for protesting. Just because one engages in a peaceful form of protest or chooses to address a particular controversy, does not mean that they are being disrespectful or inconsiderate.
1.11.3.4.2. Pro: Admitting there is a problem is the first step in fixing it. Exhibiting such behavior can activate a domino effect leading to a stronger voice for reform which hopefully would lead to a consensus to change the status quo.
1.11.3.4.2.1. Con: ID’ing a problem isn’t enough. We also need to gauge the problem’s magnitude, the likelihood a response will mitigate the problem, and the likely negative repercussions of a specific response to assess if the response is warranted.
1.11.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Police shooting fatalities are one example of police racism - the most extreme cases. There are plenty of [problems](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/data-police-racial-bias) in how police handle race.
1.11.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: Given a relative small number of police shooting fatalities, an unlikelihood of significant further reduction from kneeling, and the harm caused by kneeling in eroding national pride and promoting civil division, kneeling is an unjustified overreaction to the problem.
1.11.3.4.2.1.2.1. Con: There is little to no harm caused by the eroding of national pride.
1.11.3.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Were this country attacked by a foreign power or were its leaders \(hypothetically\) colluding with foreign enemies, it would matter a great deal whether the American people were proud of their country. Contrary to the above opinion, if Americans were misled by this protest into a belief that the country is not worth fighting for, the harm caused could be catastrophically great.
1.11.3.5. Con: Avoiding the anthem can be viewed as a political statement in and of itself.
1.11.3.5.1. Pro: When the Pittsburgh Steelers stayed in the locker room during the national anthem they were [considered by many](http://nypost.com/2017/09/26/steelers-desperately-try-to-get-out-of-anthem-protest-spotlight/) to be boycotting in an even more defiant manner than those taking a knee -- even though they did so in an attempt to steer clear of the controversy entirely.
1.11.3.6. Pro: Avoiding the anthem avoids the associated political controversy.
1.11.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.5.
1.11.3.7. Pro: Sports should be apolitical.
1.11.3.7.1. Pro: The national anthem should not be played at every game.
1.11.3.7.1.1. Pro: It adds more time at the start of the game. This feels appropriate at finals and special occasions but is an incongruous, unnecessary prelude to an average league game.
1.11.3.7.2. Pro: Patriotic feelings should not belong in the international sports world.
1.11.3.7.2.1. Con: If this were the case, then national anthems should be banned completely.
1.11.3.7.2.1.1. Pro: It is hypocritical to say that anthems -- which are a display of patriotism -- should be allowed in sporting matches but citizens shouldn't be allowed to voice other patriotic concerns at that time.
1.11.3.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: To allow anthems but ban protestation of them is to demand blind allegiance to a nation. As history has shown us repeatedly, this is a dangerous thing.
1.11.3.7.2.2. Con: Sports are inherently a display of civic pride; whether it be local, national, or international.
1.11.3.7.2.2.1. Pro: The Olympics is the most international of all sporting events and is the ultimate display of national pride since it is literally a competition to see which country has produced the best athletes.
1.11.3.7.2.2.1.1. Con: The most popular team sports \(Association Football, Cricket, Rugby\) do not care about the Olympics and their mass fanbase derive pride from the respective World Cups.
1.11.3.7.2.2.2. Pro: Many sports are intimately linked to nationalist ideals, and thus the success or failure of international teams can literally shape a nation's identity.
1.11.3.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: The popularity of certain sports is often linked to a nation's cultural and political history.
1.11.3.7.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: For example, cricket was, and still is predominantly played by [nations which were colonised by Great Britain](http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/not-quite-cricket-%E2%80%93-crickets-relationship-with-british-colonialism/).
1.11.3.7.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Some sporting competitions, like the [Commonwealth Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games), are directly linked to a nation's political and diplomatic alliances.
1.11.3.7.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: The [South African rugby team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team#Apartheid_and_transformation) has come to function as a symbol of the post-apartheid nation.
1.11.3.7.2.2.2.2. Pro: The victory of a national sporting team is often portrayed as a victory for the entire country.
1.11.3.7.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: For example, when Australia first won the America's Cup sailing race in 1983, Prime Minister Bob Hawke [declared a public holiday](http://www.smh.com.au/sport/hawke-relives-cups-glory-days-when-no-boss-wanted-to-be-labelled-a-bum-20130926-2ugzt.html) for citizens to celebrate.
1.11.3.7.2.3. Con: The NFL is a US-American sports event, not an international affair, as there are no teams outside the US.
1.11.3.7.2.3.1. Con: Many NFL players are [non-Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_players_in_the_National_Football_League). They give the NFL an international dimension.
1.11.3.7.2.3.2. Con: The NFL is very popular [outside the US](http://www.americanfootballinternational.com/top-10-countries-nfl-fans-outside-us/) in countries such as Mexico and Brazil.
1.11.3.7.2.3.2.1. Con: This report is not accurate. There is no way there are almost 20 million NFL fans in Brazil. In Brazil, the NFL is only broadcasted through subscription-based TV, which covers only [49 million](http://www.brasil.gov.br/economia-e-emprego/2012/08/cerca-de-49-milhoes-de-brasileiros-tem-tv-por-assinatura) people. The largest Brazilian public opinion research company Ibope says that only [3,3 Million Brazilians are a Football fan](http://www.theplayoffs.com.br/nfl/pesquisa-do-ibope-aponta-que-33-milhoes-de-brasileiros-sao-fas-de-futebol-americano/).
1.11.3.7.2.4. Pro: Sport builds bridges among cultures.
1.11.3.7.2.5. Con: Patriotic feelings in sport can help reconcilliation.
1.11.3.7.2.5.1. Pro: At the Olympics in 1956, 1960 & 1964 a [United Team of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Team_of_Germany) competed. This helped to preserve a spirit of common bonds between the otherwise divided countries.
1.11.3.7.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.5.2.1.4.2.
1.11.3.7.2.5.3. Con: When the patriotism in question is controversial or partisan in nature, it creates conflict that is unrelated to the game. This is negative because sports are often appreciated as an escape from the more consequential conflicts of politics and everyday life.
1.11.3.7.2.6. Con: There is no clear reason why any place should be devoid of free expression.
1.11.3.7.3. Con: Avoiding the issue is, by itself, a political stance.
1.11.3.7.3.1. Pro: ["All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke)
1.11.3.7.4. Con: Everything is interrelated, so avoiding politics is impossible.
1.11.3.7.5. Pro: During the National Anthem, TV cameras should only show the flag or the performer\(s\) of the Anthem, and remove the politics from the broadcast.
1.11.3.7.5.1. Con: What to broadcast and not broadcast is at the sole discretion of the broadcast network, aside from any regulatory restrictions \(e.g. FCC\).
1.11.3.7.6. Con: When sports are a source of pride on the international stage, they can have huge political significance.
1.11.3.7.6.1. Pro: Anthems, when used for teams in a competition between countries, makes sense. When used for national sports as opposed to international sports, it seems strange from outside the US, particularly as athletes could be from anywhere in the world and are not representing the US specifically.
1.11.3.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.7.2.2.1.
1.11.3.7.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.7.2.5.1.
1.11.3.7.7. Con: Racism has been a part of professional sports since its beginning. Sports has always been political.
1.11.3.7.7.1. Pro: There was a Negro League in baseball. From 1891 to the 1940s, blacks were [excluded](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=vXi1BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA85&dq=colored+basketball&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=colored%20basketball&f=false) from playing on white teams. There were also [segregated](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=GoeQeMBbSiAC&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=henry+armstrong+segregated+arenas&source=bl&ots=6XMydmeizd&sig=qW5OePjfEuRlKvaD2xUxBLgkWAk&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=henry%20armstrong%20segregated%20arenas&f=false) boxing arenas.
1.11.3.8. Con: Not coming out for the anthem would take away the attention from the players that are protesting. If they want to protest then they should be on the field so people can see them.
1.11.4. Pro: In a country where freedom is praised and defended, peaceful protest should be allowed.
1.11.4.1. Pro: When we take away the option for people to protest peacefully, we inevitably push them to more violent forms of protest. As [JFK said](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9100&st=&st1=), "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."
1.11.4.1.1. Con: The players should incite violence during the National Anthem.
1.11.4.1.1.1. Con: Historically, peaceful protests are most effective.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi achieved political success through non-violence.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Ghandi and Martin Luther King Jr. were murdered as a direct result of their pacifist activism. While members of their ideological rivals like Malcolm X and the Black Panther Party were murdered as well, peaceful protests are not exactly the most effective.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Ghandi achieved a liberated India.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Indian liberation was achieved gradually, through acts of [anti-colonial violence](http://theconversation.com/the-forgotten-violence-that-helped-india-break-free-from-colonial-rule-57904).
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Irish fought a thirty year guerrilla war to preserve the autonomy of their free state.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The Irish were unsucessful to preserve a common state since it is still divided.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Sudanese fought a ten year genocidal conflict to become the youngest country on the planet.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The Sudanese way of separation continues to lead to death and war within South Sudan.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The vast majority of progress on race in America was made by leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., who fought for justice using a message of humility, kindness, and reconciliation.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: [Martin Luther King Jr](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/575942968/american-democracy-productive-conflict-or-a-dumpster-fire). went into places of extreme prejudice and basically challenged people to act against him and those with him. It is not a traditional way to incite violence, but it was, in fact, inciting violence.
1.11.4.1.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.11.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.11.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Peaceful protests work.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/05/peaceful-protest-is-much-more-effective-than-violence-in-toppling-dictators/?utm_term=.62c266ac89e4)
1.11.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: Historically, advocating civic-wide violence is counterproductive. Calls for such violence led to the election of Richard Nixon on a so-called "law and order" platform \([Wasow, p. 1](http://www.omarwasow.com/Protests_on_Voting.pdf)\).
1.11.4.1.1.2. Con: A violent outbreak would remove a lot of public support for their cause, ultimately being counterproductive.
1.11.4.1.1.3. Con: Violence during the Anthem would indicate attacking the fans. If the real target of the violence was the owners, then violence during the Anthem would be counter-productive.
1.11.4.1.1.4. Pro: All lives matter equally, and it has been demonstrated that black lives don't matter, therefore, neither does anyone else's. As such, there is no cost to the players using violence to achieve their goals.
1.11.4.1.1.4.1. Con: There does not appear to be definitive proof that black lives do not matter. Currently there is a robust and active [legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) to ensure equal rights to black citizens of the US. Without objective and definitive proof that black lives don't matter, the pretense for the argument \(thus the argument for violence\) is false.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: The police are treating black Americans as if they are [lesser than other races](https://ips-dc.org/african-americans-still-treated-second-class-citizens-law/). If that's all society is willing to acknowledge them as, there is no benefit in acting better than that standard.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.1. Con: It remains unproven that the police treat black people "lesser than other races".
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Statistics bear this out; police kill proportionally more black people. [cdn.vox-cdn.com](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dtqEE-Zd9EZj_8YXf1L3zFXA4-c=/1200x0/filters:no_upscale\(\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6877233/police%20killings%20by%20race.png)
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.2. Con: This is a flawed strategy leaving it up to others to define who you are. You should act with integrity no matter how others treat you. This strategy gives one inner strength to disregard how others view them and act in an ethical, humanistic way. If people were to only be nice to those who are nice to them, our society would fall apart as arguments broke out over trivial matters. This happens less when we counter ignorance with composure.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Never engaging any form of retaliation regardless of what the world puts before you turns out to be a pretty bad [strategy](http://ncase.me/trust/).
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: That person who tried to rape someone 3 times already isn't going to stop trying to rape just because they are told no, no matter how nice one is to them.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: Abusive partners in relationships don't stop being abusive if you just do what they want.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.3. Con: Acting "lesser" by committing violence validates the very false claim allegedly driving police behavior.
1.11.4.1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Doing nothing does not dismantle the claim. Police didn't need an excuse to start doing this, and they don't need one to keep doing it either.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3. Con: Violence against other humans is always wrong, except in immediate self-defense.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.1. Con: Cops do this all the time to black people, and there is seldom any justice. This would be, indirectly, self-defense.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.2. Con: Always selecting peace over violence has historically been a mistake, such as the [Appeasement Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement) toward Hitler's Germany illustrates.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Violence comes with costs for the community, as security forces need to be paid.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.4. Con: The [responsibility to protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect) is a morally right reason to engage in warfare.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.5. Con: Political violence could be used to prevent a state where self-defense would be impossible or difficult, as it currently is for persons who are targeted by police.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.6. Pro: The use of violence only further validates the use of violence in retaliation, perpetuating an ever escalating cycle of violence that can only ever end in more negative outcomes than almost any peaceful resolution.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.1.1.4.2.3.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.6.2. Con: The cycle of inaction being retaliated against with more violence and oppression is just as vicious.
1.11.4.1.1.4.3.6.3. Con: A peaceful resolution is not a necessary condition. The dead can't retaliate.
1.11.4.1.1.4.4. Con: Using violence \(or any other inherent wrong\) in pursuit of a goal gives those against that goal an excuse to delegitimize the pursuit.
1.11.4.1.1.4.4.1. Con: Evidently, kneeling gives those against that goal an excuse to delegitimize the pursuit. Everything is too extreme, so might as well go for broke.
1.11.4.1.1.4.5. Con: The cost is the loss of their political credibility, careers, and platforms for protesting.
1.11.4.1.1.4.6. Con: Additionally, violence would galvanize white supremacist groups like neo nazis and the KKK. It also estranges would be allies and supporters of black rights supporters.
1.11.4.1.1.4.6.1. Con: Doing nothing about the neo nazis and KKK also galvanizes them. When nothing is done about them, they feel emboldened and become more violent.
1.11.4.1.1.5. Con: The extent of violence players can inflict is limited. Police and private security staff is present at any game and would suppress violence immediately.
1.11.4.1.1.5.1. Con: This claim conflates "inciting violence" with "being violent". Perhaps security staff may not intervene to stop a player from asking the crowd to be violent. And security staff is certainly inadequate if the crowd does become violent.
1.11.4.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Security at a football game is not large enough or equipped to handle a full-scale riot.
1.11.4.1.1.6. Con: If people of a certain race incite violence against another race, those people are no better than the race that started the whole thing.
1.11.4.1.1.6.1. Con: It's is not like football players are all black, and it's not only black people that have a problem with the injustice towards black people. There are white people willing to stand by black football players, and together, fight for their rights.
1.11.4.1.1.6.2. Con: According to this logic, the only appropriate thing to do when one is being attacked is to let it happen, to let one's self be killed, because to raise a hand to their attacker would make them just as bad as them. Failing to let one's self be killed is not immoral.
1.11.4.1.1.6.2.1. Con: This goes back to a debate regarding \(in physical terms\) where self defense becomes offense. It is one thing to tell a group to defend their right. It is another thing to expand that "right" into the allowance to hurt a group of people.
1.11.4.1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Someone stealing a pencil does not justify coming back and destroying all of their pencils, note books, and calculators.
1.11.4.1.1.7. Pro: With each occurrence of police brutality, the rights and lives of African Americans are in increasing danger. They have to treat it as a threat to their lives, because ultimately it is.
1.11.4.1.1.7.1. Con: This is analogous to saying "it's only a matter of time before somebody punches me so I'm going to go out on the street now and punch a random person and that way I'll get even." It makes no sense.
1.11.4.1.1.7.2. Con: Anyone who commits violence against African Americans is subject to punishment under the law. People accused of crimes are supposed to have the right to a fair trial by an impartial hurt. Bypassing that system in favor of vigilante justice is wrong, even if the outcomes don't always seem to serve justice the way we define it.
1.11.4.1.1.7.2.1. Con: [Police are not](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/18/us/police-involved-shooting-cases/index.html) subject to punishment, or even trial, for the violence they commit against African Americans the vast majority of the time.
1.11.4.1.2. Pro: The suppression of peaceful protest is inextricably oppression, which is anti-American.
1.11.4.1.3. Con: Most of these players are not interested in action except when they are on the clock. Violence would not be the next step if they can't get paid to protest.
1.11.4.2. Pro: Kneeling is a non-violent form of protest that is effective.
1.11.4.2.1. Con: Different social groups attribute different meanings to the flag. Choosing the flag as the focal point of the protest dilutes the protest's meaning since some people assume you are protesting something else.
1.11.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.11.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.
1.11.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.5.1.
1.11.4.2.5. Con: It's also a relatively quiet form of protest. The intention and desire can get lost, e.g., following the President's tweets and speeches regarding kneeling, teams remaining in the locker rooms was seen as protest against those statements, not about the original issue.
1.11.4.2.5.1. Pro: Some things are better left unsaid. People can’t always listen in this loud world. People will remember what someone’s action is.
1.11.4.2.6. Pro: It draws attention to the cause by committing the person to an action rather than inaction. To stay seated is not an action but to kneel while others stand shows they are actively committed to the cause.
1.11.4.2.7. Pro: Taking a knee during the national anthem is a social platform for people showing the injustice in minority communities, systemic oppression against people of color, police brutality and the criminal justice system.
1.11.4.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.11.4.2.8. Con: Its effect has been more net negative than positive, because it was not coordinated. Kaepernick was able to be pointed out as an isolated case and put in a negative light to many people, to the point where his message was diluted and derailed.
1.11.4.2.8.1. Con: Lack of coordination is not what caused the negative attention. A coordinated lie that the kneeling was disrespectful and people's desire to believe that lie instead of the truth, \(which is that the kneeling was done to bring attention to disproportionate police brutality against minorities\) combined with a lack of desire to have an honest and open dialogue is what makes the entire message negative.
1.11.4.2.8.2. Con: The effect is not quantifiable.
1.11.5. Con: America doesn't prohibit private contracts between consenting individuals that would require parties to that contract to stand for an anthem.
1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.1.1.
1.11.7. Con: Active duty members of the military are required to stand and face the flag, with salute if in uniform, when proximate to the raising of morning colors \(anthem\), and evening colors \(taps\).
1.11.8. Pro: Kneeling is a form of free speech.
1.11.8.1. Con: This is not protected speech, it's political activity at an employer in the private sector. The Union and a dozen players have exposed an incoherent ownership model. Some owners are firing, suspending players and others are tolerating it.
1.11.8.2. Pro: [Citizens United v. FEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) equated money with speech. As a result the wealthy have a larger platform than the general public by virtue of their wealth. Stifling an athlete's speech while allowing the wealthy to leverage his platform does not respect our right to speak freely, nor does it respect the listener's right to choose not to listen.
1.11.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.3.
1.11.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.9.6.1.3.
1.11.8.5. Con: The only explicit rights employees have to free speech while on the clock are related to [wages, hours, and working conditions.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/08/technology/google-workplace-free-speech/index.html) All other types of speech are not protected and up to the employer to decide whether allowed or not.
1.11.8.6. Pro: Soldiers and veterans are not a protected class of citizens when it concerns speech.
1.11.9. Pro: There are many religions in the US that preclude their members from engaging in the pledge or anthem, which is why they cannot be forced in schools. Not supporting the ability of any American to also abstain based on conscience puts religious liberty at risk.
1.11.9.1. Pro: Supreme Court Case [West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette) in 1943 ruled that an individual cannot be compelled to participate in the pledge or any other flag salute, nor punished for failing to do so.
1.11.9.1.1. Con: Few people would argue that players should be forced to stand as a matter of law.  Rather, they criticize the kneeling as disrespectful and/or a nonsensible conflation of ideas.
1.11.9.1.2. Con: WV Board of Education vs Barnett only applies to individuals who are students in compulsory education of the United States and has no bearing on voluntary employees at work.
1.11.9.1.3. Con: In a private business, \(which the NFL is\) an individual can be punished for what they say. See [www.americanbar.org](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/15/winter-2015/chill-around-the-water-cooler.html)
1.11.9.1.3.1. Pro: Professional athletes have extensive employment contracts, and the owners could add the requirement to stand in them.
1.11.9.2. Con: Schooling the United States is compulsory, which is why the State cannot require or limit most types of speech in the classroom. Playing national-level football is decidedly not compulsory, and is a profession, and as such not subject to most free speech limitations.
1.11.9.2.1. Con: Free speech is not contingent on whether or not the activity is compulsory. It is only contingent on whether or not physical or serious psychological harm is done, e.g. yelling fire in a theatre when there is no peril or engaging in speech that meets the definition of bullying or harassment.
1.11.9.2.2. Con: Standing for the National Anthem is not an integral part of playing national-level football, and therefore should not be required of players.
