Discussion Name: Is the United States on the brink of a revolution?

1. The United States is on the brink of a revolution.
1.1. Pro: Revolutions are usually preceded by an [upsurge in protests](https://theconversation.com/is-the-united-states-on-the-brink-of-a-revolution-123244). The US is currently seeing such a rise in protests.
1.1.1. Con: Revolutions, such as the [Russian revolution](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/revolutions_russian_empire), usually occur in the aftermath of war and deprivation. The US is not in such a condition right now.
1.1.1.1. Con: The social and economic conditions created due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/revolution-only-getting-started/609463/) are similar to conditions that precede revolutions.
1.1.1.2. Con: Relatively smaller events can also be a precursor to revolutions, such as the taxation conflict that led to the [English Civil War.](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars)
1.1.1.3. Pro: The US is not currently amongst the [countries suffering from starvation](https://www.oxfam.org/en/world-midst-hunger-pandemic-conflict-coronavirus-and-climate-crisis-threaten-push-millions).
1.1.2. Pro: The last few years in the US have seen some of the [largest protests](https://mashable.com/2018/03/27/largest-protests-american-history/) in history.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The Black Lives Matter movement has been [claimed to be the largest movement in US history](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/news/black-lives-matter-may-be-largest-movement-us-history).
1.1.3. Pro: Major global powers have seen revolutions in the past. Therefore, the United States is likely to see one as well.
1.1.3.1. Pro: [Social revolutions](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244014548845) tend to happen because of a decrease of economic development, disagreement with a regime type and state ineffectiveness. The United States is currently experiencing those three factors.
1.1.3.2. Con: While the end is inevitable, the end of the United States could occur in other ways than a revolution.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: A revolution wouldn't mean the end of the United States. It could result in a renewed country.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: If the country breaks apart in a way that leaves no one clear successor state, as in the Yugoslav wars, it cannot be meaningfully said that the USA has undergone a revolution, even if some of the breakaway states were formed by revolutionaries.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: The United States might be destroyed in a war - either conventionally by being invaded and conquered, or by a nuclear war destructive enough that it ceases to meaningfully exist as a state.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Geopolitical rivals of the United States already exist, and have armies, whereas the organisation that would be behind a hypothetical second American revolution is itself hypothetical, which inherently lends more plausibility to the former defeating the US government than the latter.
1.1.3.2.3.2. Con: The United States is separated from any plausible rivals \(e.g. Russia, China\) by a vast ocean, making an invasion of the continental united states logistically difficult to the point of being implausible even if such an enemy could defeat the United States' armed forces.
1.1.3.2.3.3. Con: The United States has the most powerful military on Earth, making a conventional military defeat implausible.
1.1.3.2.3.3.1. Con: The strength of the United States' military would also be pitted against any revolutionary forces, so the point is moot.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: An existential catastrophe might destroy the USA \(and all other human civilisation\) before a revolution occurs; e.g. a pandemic much worse than covid-19, unfriendly AI, an asteroid strike, runaway global warming, supervolcanic eruption.
1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Philosopher Toby Ord, in his book [The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Precipice:_Existential_Risk_and_the_Future_of_Humanity), estimates humanity faces a 1 in 6 chance of an existential catastrophe by the end of the century.
1.2. Pro: As the United States becomes more diverse and minorities are given more power, the system is likely to change.
1.2.1. Con: If minorities already have more power, there wouldn't be a need for revolution.
1.2.2. Pro: A number of ideologically aligned states are likely to form [secession movements](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-12-13/column-are-republicans-like-rush-limbaugh-serious-about-a-secession-movement).
1.2.3. Con: The system is then more likely to go through an [evolution instead of a revolution](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-evolution-and-revolution/).
1.2.4. Pro: The Black Lives Matter movement has gained a lot of [support](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/netflix-hulu-amazon-hbo-black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protests-1234621292/).
1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.2.4.2. Con: The rise in prominence of the '[Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)' movement suggests that minorities in the United States have not been given more power.
1.3. Con: Changes in the United States are likely to be incremental, at best, and not revolutionary.
1.3.1. Pro: Since [Joe Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/joe-biden-sanders-americans-aren-t-looking-revolution-n1143681) was chosen the Democrat nominee for the general elections, it is unlikely that the Democratic party will support revolutionary reforms.
1.3.2. Con: If change does not arise through the conventional political system, it's possible that people will seek to bring about change in unconventional and revolutionary means.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [Trust in the current political system](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/) in the US is at an all-time low.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Many Americans have [lost faith](https://www.inquirer.com/news/democrats-2020-poverty-poor-peoples-congress-20190624.html) in the current politicians and do not believe that they are acting out of good intentions.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Even if Americansâ€™ views of the government are linked to low trust levels, they still give some [positive performance ratings when it comes to the handling of terrorism and disasters](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/).
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: This survey was from September 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unlikely that Americans still support the government's handling of 'disasters'.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: According [to Pew Research Center,](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/) a majority of Americans are happy with how the government has been keeping the country safe from terrorism \(72%\), responding to natural disasters \(62%\), ensuring safe food and medicine \(62%\), strengthening the economy \(54%\) and maintaining infrastructure \(53%\).
1.4. Pro: Increasing economic inequality in the United States makes a revolution more likely.
1.4.1. Con: There are many countries with [higher economic inequalities than the United States](https://espas.secure.europarl.europa.eu/orbis/sites/default/files/generated/document/en/0115391e.pdf) that haven't been through a revolution. \(p.25\)
1.4.1.1. Pro: [Greece has gone through two decades of a nepotistic government](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/11-countries-with-more-problems-than-america?slide=4)(Two decades of nepotistic government hiring and swelling union wages have left the Greek economy in a shambles, with debt levels Greece can't possibly pay off on its own. Even with a European bailout, living standards will decline for years.) that has created a lot of economic inequalities, however Greece hasn't been through a revolution yet.
1.4.1.2. Con: Social tensions, caused by increasing [wealth inequality](https://doc-research.org/2017/11/inequality-economic-models-russian-revolution/), were a major reason why many countries experienced revolutions in the past. Since [economic inequality is rising](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/income-inequality-continues-to-grow-in-the-united-states.html) in the United States, it is possible that it could go through a revolution as well.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: [Wealth inequality is nothing new](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110215/brief-history-income-inequality-united-states.asp) for the United States, and it has never caused big revolutions in the past.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Even though the United States has experienced economic growth, it has not been accompanied by a [decrease in economic inequality](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/764654623/u-s-income-inequality-worsens-widening-to-a-new-gap).
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: The [toxic class-divide](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-9-9-percent-is-the-new-american-aristocracy?utm_source=pocket-newtab) in the US makes it ripe for a revolution.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Pro: Historically, one of the preconditions for revolution was the growing sentiment that [ruling classes serve themselves](https://theconversation.com/is-the-united-states-on-the-brink-of-a-revolution-123244) at the cost of everyone else.
1.4.2. Con: A revolution would likely result in the breakdown of existing social, political and economic structures and thus would not resolve the issue of economic inequality.
1.4.3. Pro: [From 19th place in 2011 to 28th place in 2020](https://mahb.stanford.edu/library-item/were-no-28-and-dropping/), the U.S. ranking in quality of life is rapidly declining.
1.4.3.1. Pro: During the same time, [American billionaires have seen their fortunes multiplied massively](https://inequality.org/great-divide/bernie-3-billionaires-more-wealth-half-america/). The growing anger and disaffection of the masses is likely to boil over and lead to a revolution.
1.4.3.2. Con: Part of the decrease can be [attributable to the worsening psycho-social problems that are not specific to Whites](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6221922/). Therefore it might show that the inequality hasn't worsened, instead the methodology to calculate the inequality might have changed.
1.4.4. Pro: When different political alternatives fail at addressing inequality, the [use of violence](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/11/is-violence-the-only-way-to-end-inequality.html) comes across as increasingly legitimate.
1.4.4.1. Con: [Historically speaking migration](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/world/20200624STO81906/exploring-migration-causes-why-people-migrate) has been more common than revolution when political alternatives have failed at addressing inequality.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly [increased unemployment levels](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52570600) in the United States.
1.5. Con: The United States has frequently gone through cycles of social turmoil and peace. Yet, there hasn't been a revolution.
1.5.1. Pro: Revolutions do not happen unless there is a major cause \(starvation, severe economic depression, tyranny etc.\). And even then, more often than not revolutions do not arise even from these causes.
1.5.2. Pro: Poor government policies were a major reason for why the [Great Depression](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression) occurred. Even when the US had one of the highest rates of unemployment in its history, a revolution still did not occur.
1.5.3. Con: Just because there has not been a revolution yet, it does not necessarily mean a revolution cannot occur in the future.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The continuing widespread use of social media makes it easier to carry out a revolution.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Social media can allow revolutionary movements that gain more [support](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316511433_The_Impact_of_Social_Media_on_Social_Movements_The_Case_of_Anti-Consumption).
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Social media makes it easier for revolutionary movements to [organize protests](https://sociable.co/social-media/impact-social-media-modern-protest-movements-democracy/) and rallies.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: [Face-to-face mobilization](https://www.e-ir.info/2013/08/15/can-social-media-sustain-a-revolution/) is important for revolutions to be successful. If social media is used as an essential medium through which a revolution is brought about, it makes face-to-face mobilization difficult.
1.5.3.1.4. Con: Government surveillance has compromised privacy and anonymity on the internet. Governments can use social media surveillance to easily [identify dissidents](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/social-media-revolution-tech-activists-arab-spring-dictators-a7433476.html) and target them effectively. This makes it difficult to organize a revolution.
1.5.3.1.4.1. Pro: Using social media, the [Russian government](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/16/how-social-media-helps-dictators/) monitored activists' communications and, as a result, crushed protests.
1.5.3.1.5. Con: Social media keeps activists engaged in an issue for a short [period of time](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/16/how-social-media-helps-dictators/). In order to carry out a successful revolution, having the trust and support of marginalized communities is important. However, building that requires more time and effort, which "clicktivists" are unable to do.
1.5.4. Con: Actually, there was a [pretty famous one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution) just a couple centuries ago.
1.6. Con: Even if a revolution was started the full force of the country would be used to squash it.
1.6.1. Pro: The US military is one of the [strongest armies](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-worlds-20-strongest-militaries-ranked-2015-9) in the world. It is likely that it will be able to quell a revolution.
1.6.2. Con: If the United States uses force against its people, it will have to face severe consequences. Therefore, the full force of the country is unlikely to be used.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The people in the US have been [losing faith in enforcement agencies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/us/border-patrol-culture.html). This makes it difficult to use force effectively and can escalate violence.
1.6.2.2. Con: The police, which represents the government has already [used force against its peopl](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01846-z)e, without having to face severe consequences.
1.6.2.3. Pro: If a revolution is violently quashed by the government, they will lose legitimacy.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: If a revolution is not quashed by the government, the government could be seized.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: [In a democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy), a government is based on the will of people and is it a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation.
1.6.2.3.3. Con: The government is already trying to squash potential revolutions by [limiting free expression online](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/10/16/governments-are-finding-new-ways-to-squash-free-expression-online).
1.6.3. Con: 43% of the general public '[report living in a gun household](https://news.gallup.com/poll/264932/percentage-americans-own-guns.aspx)'. Thus, a significant portion of the population would have the weaponry to sustain a revolution.
