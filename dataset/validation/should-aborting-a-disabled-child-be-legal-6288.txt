Discussion Name: Should Aborting a Disabled Child Be Legal?

1. Aborting a disabled child should be legal.
1.1. Pro: One or both parents may not be emotionally or psychologically stable enough to handle the personal costs of caring for a disabled child.
1.1.1. Pro: A woman with an increased risk of [postpartum depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/tc/postpartum-depression-what-increases-your-risk) may not be able to handle the stress and extra responsibility of taking care of a disabled child. It is in her best interest to abort.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Women [suffering](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/postpartum-depression#1) from postpartum depression can be a danger to their newborn.
1.1.2. Pro: The child can often destroy a healthy marriage with the increased demands, and thus not only indirectly but directly affect the healthy upbringing of siblings.
1.1.3. Con: They can give the child up for adoption, thus giving him/her a chance at life with a stable set of parents. This is a better option than aborting.
1.1.3.1. Con: Most care homes struggle as it is, as do most children struggle to be rehomed. It should be seen as a safety net for unavoidable problems, not an equal alternative to parenting your offspring yourself.
1.1.3.2. Con: Caring for a disabled child may require large investments to improve the child's quality of life. Only someone loving the child would be willing to sacrifice a large sum of one's own money.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: It is more ethical to put the child up for adoption because they get a chance to be adopted into a family that loves him or her.
1.1.3.3. Con: Many foster homes are not a good environment for a child.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Not all foster homes are bad for children, many foster home can turn into forever homes for the child.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: Even if there are difficulties in a foster home, it is better than having their life taken away prematurely.
1.1.4. Con: A great deal of support for parents of disabled children is available through charity.
1.1.5. Pro: Disabled or not, if the parents cannot provide a healthy and progressive environment for a child, it should be their decision if they go through with it or not.
1.1.6. Con: Disabled children are not the only children who are difficult, and it isn't only the parents of disabled children who find themselves unprepared. This logic would excuse the abortion of anybody whose parents were not entirely emotionally prepared for parenthood.
1.1.6.1. Con: It is irresponsible to force unwilling or unprepared would-be parents to complete their pregnancy when the world is severely overpopulated already.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Contraception must be promoted instead of abortion. It is more humane,  cheaper and less painful.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Contraception is readily available, but often unused or misused. Accidents happen, and unfortunately there needs to be a back up option.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Contraception is before embryo has been conceived. However, abortion should be a choice available if that embryo has flagged up genetic condition even if the pregnancy was wanted. People want a child, not a burden. Forcing them to continue to birth is against their rights.
1.1.6.2. Con: Abortion is unpleasant, but child abuse and neglect are far worse.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: We have no way of knowing whether a child would experience child abuse or neglect. Abortion kills living beings, and that is the only certainty.
1.2. Con: It should not be left to lawmakers to decide which disabilities classify as legal or illegal to abort.
1.2.1. Pro: Thin end of the wedge. Once aborting disabled children becomes the 'norm', there is no telling what other legalised abortions it could lead to.
1.2.1.1. Con: This is a [slippery slope argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope#:~:text=A%20slippery%20slope%20argument%20\(SSA,significant%20\(usually%20negative\)%20effect.): a well known logical fallacy.
1.2.2. Con: If so, then all abortions of disabilities should be legal regardless of reason.
1.2.3. Pro: If lawmakers are given this right, it can evolve into legal targeted genocide.
1.2.4. Con: Lawmakers are not the only ones who get to decide. There first has to be public interest or concern for it to be brought to lawmakers.
1.3. Con: Abortion must be illegal, regardless of its reasons, as long as it is not necessary for the mother's health.
1.3.1. Con: A person deserves the right to accept and forget traumatic events, such as rape.  Being forced to have a child after such an event, is forcing that person to love something that started with a traumatic event.
1.3.1.1. Con: Delivering a baby doesn’t force loving it. If she finds herself unable to love it, it can be given for adoption.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Millions of children around the world are already growing up in orphanages, [suffering from a large spectre of disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care#Medical_and_psychiatric_disorders) and generally ending up worse off than children growing up in families. Giving birth to a child with a high likelihood to do worse in life than his peers growing up in families seems unnecessary cruel.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Everyone does worse than someone. It is not clear who decides at which level a life worth living“ begins.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Orphans face numerous issues, ranging from mental health issues going into adulthood \([1](http://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1445163706.pdf)\) to an increased risk of physical abuse \([2](http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/1648/1/PREDICTORS%20OF%20THE%20MENTAL%20HEALTH%20OF%20ORPHANS%20AND%20VULNERABLE%20CHIDREN%20IN%20NIGERIA-1.pdf)\). Add to this that these orphans are disabled and one could argue that the majority of people would not call this a life worth living.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A life is not necessarily "not worth living" just because the majority of people say so. No one can know for sure, and it is not worth risking aborting someone who could be beneficial to the world.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: There are far too many children than there are good foster homes. We must increase a large number of new foster homes to care for the many children we already have on waiting lists, before we create a large new influx of babies if abortion is made illegal.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Better still would it be to have our tax dollars redirected from abortions to better foster homes, because that way, less people die.
1.3.1.1.3. Con: Delivering a baby isn't easy, nor is carrying one, it has major health hazards for months afterwards as well. No one should be forced to go through that against their will.
1.3.1.2. Con: Killing an unborn baby does not fix or better the rape that has already occurred.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Exactly why women should be allowed to make their own choices and not force them into positions they don't want to be in, like saddled with a child that was forced upon them.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.1.3. Con: While it could be harm to mother to give birth to such child, it is also possible that she would love such child, which would make her suffering smaller.
1.3.1.4. Con: Abortion could even make problems worse because of the physical and ethical impact of such decision.
1.3.1.5. Pro: Preventing an abortion is akin to preventing her from washing the rapists semen from her body.
1.3.2. Con: Abortion must be a choice. The choice therein encompasses the responsibility of being fully informed of her own reasons for following through with the procedure, no matter her decision. Lest she be viewed as unable to arbitrate in the eyes of the government and legal system, even in her full capacities.
1.3.2.1. Con: If we consider the lives of a Homo Sapiens as valuable there should be at least some restrictions on abortion.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The illegality of abortion strips the woman of the humanity of decision making. The decision to abort is never, ever a simple one.
1.3.3. Pro: The child in question seems to always be ignored.  Even for rape cases, a child's life outweighs almost everything.
1.3.3.1. Con: Children do not contribute in any way and even remove adults from the work force to care for them. Increasing the abortion rate would be a good thing.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Children need constant supervision and generally are incapable of supporting themselves or helping others.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Just as the murder of a child would be a bad thing, so would the murder of a fetus, which is a younger stage of a child's development. Abortion, then, would be ageist.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: Children will contribute later, which becomes increasingly important as societies age. In Germany less than 13% of heavily disabled people are workless: [www.dgb.de](https://www.dgb.de/themen/++co++d8d8e91e-22b2-11e8-8ab0-52540088cada)
1.3.3.2. Con: A "child" who is an unborn fetus should not have rights that outweigh those of an actual person, such as its mother.
1.3.4. Con: If the mother is in a financial crisis, this could risk the mother's, father's and child's future.
1.3.4.1. Con: This could be applied to any child and also justifies killing one among any pair of twins.
1.3.4.2. Con: Adoption is a better solution in cases of a financial crisis.
1.4. Con: No one has a right to determine whether or not another person will die because of a disability.
1.4.1. Pro: By giving this right to another, the disabled is at the mercy of someone who may not know what is best.
1.4.1.1. Con: An aborted fetus is not equivalent to the entire community of people with disabilities nor are they even apart of that community.
1.4.2. Con: Someone has to decide if a given fetus comes to term or not. Any 'right' to determine if an entire category of people is not allowed to die implies the right to decide that each individual one of them will not die.
1.4.2.1. Con: Not everything is rightfully decided by outsiders. For instance, people don’t want to cede the right to choose their partner in marriage.
1.4.3. Con: Each individual has the right to live the life they want. If the parents don't wish to have a disabled child, they have to right to abort it. Nobody should be forced to have one.
1.4.3.1. Con: It follows that the child has the right to live the way it wants.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: A woman has the right to decide whether her body is used to sustain someone else's life. Therefore, the child only has any right after the mother.
1.4.4. Con: A fetus is strictly [not a person](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) so while that argument is true it does not pertain to the thesis at hand.
1.4.4.1. Con: A homo sapien fetus is human, therefore a fetus has human rights at least.  Among the inalienable human rights is the right to life.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: By law, a human is a person. Therefore, a fetus cannot be considered a human being because it has not yet developed into one; it is only potential.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Just because a fetus is not considered a person by law at the moment, it does not mean this should not be revisited and the person be given right to life.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: [A fetus is no more human](http://www.uhs.nhs.uk/Media/Controlleddocuments/Patientinformation/Pregnancyandbirth/Havinganextremelyprematurebaby-patientinformation.pdf) than a sperm or an egg.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: A fetus has a heartbeat, unlike a sperm or egg.
1.4.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Most abortions are done within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \(90%\) \([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#History_and_religion)\), during this period the fetus doesn't even have any brain activity yet. \([2](https://www.answers.com/Q/When_does_a_fetus_have_brain_activity)\)
1.4.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Animals have heartbeats, yet we don't consider them human.
1.4.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Animals cannot be conceived by humans. There are major differences between animals and the unborn.
1.4.4.1.2.1.3. Con: By this reasoning, people decrease in moral value when they experience cardiac arrest. However, that is absurd.
1.4.4.1.2.1.4. Con: Having a literal heart does not define or identify an entity as a human.
1.4.4.1.2.1.5. Con: By this reasoning, someone with an external artificial heart wouldn't be a human.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Actual inalienable rights are natural rights, not the legal rights governments institute to recognise them. Arguing based on definitions of words such as "human" is mere legalese, only relevant to the latter, and so not relevant to whether something actually should have human rights.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Something that lacks a functioning nervous system cannot be said to have a subjective experience, so it cannot be a person.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: This argument could only be considered as potentially relevant if you add the qualification of being able to seek abortions only within the first [six weeks](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-brain-nervous-system/), because the nervous system begins to function after that point.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: It would be concievablely possible for an adult with complete atrophy of the muscles to survive for a substantial period of time if given a care comprable to that given to a fetus in their mother's womb. Therefore by this argument they could not be considered a person, and their murder could be endorsed without reservation.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: The nervous system includes the brain, thus if one had an atrophied brain or anything similar to such they would most likely be in a [persistent vegetative state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_vegetative_state). Depending on where one lives people in this state are considered dead. Thus comparing them to fetuses who haven't even developed to the point where they have [brain waves](https://www.answers.com/Q/When_does_a_fetus_have_brain_activity) is a false comparison.
1.4.4.3. Con: Even as law states that fetus is not a human, it is not obvious whether decision of abortion is ethically proper.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: As abortion is something which has been made legal and not illegal in the past, we can say that abortion is considered ethically proper as abortion laws have only come to pass in the last century.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: But one could also say that some areas of the law are very corrupt.
1.4.4.4. Con: There exists no magic stick by which to define personhood. Therefore declaring a fetus as a non-person is a matter of denial, not of establishing pertinence.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: The same could be applied to calling someone a person. It is all subjective thus we try to find a consensus.
1.4.4.5. Con: The thesis at hand refers to a "disabled child", directly claiming personhood.
1.4.5. Con: Medical triage is an accepted practice where doctors determine whether or not someone receives treatment potentially deciding between life and death. If there are multiple fetuses in a pregnancy and one of them is severely disabled such as to endanger the others, doctors may be justified in aborting the disabled fetus to save the healthy fetuses.
1.4.5.1. Con: Additional issues such as the fetus endangering the life of other fetuses, or endangering the life of the mother, are more extreme cases than just a fetus with a disability. Endangering the other life, not the disability, would justify an abortion.
1.4.5.2. Con: Prioritization of patients to receive treatment is not the same as actively euthanizing patients deemed low-priority.  Performing an abortion is an active step, not a passive withholding of treatment.
1.4.6. Con: Rights are not inherent and are subject to change.
1.4.7. Pro: If humans were allowed to systematically interfere with how and which babies are born, we would have too much power on our hands. This may lead to selective breeding among humans, looking for certain characteristics and abandoning others.
1.4.7.1. Con: Humans already practice selective breeding. It's done with every date you go on, or in whom you even find attractive \(physically and mentally\).
1.4.7.1.1. Con: Yes, but going on a date does not justify killing the other dating options, and finding people attractive does not justify killing the people you do not find attractive.
1.5. Pro: Under current law the answer is trivially "yes," because aborting any fetus is legal.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.
1.5.2. Con: What is legal doesn't determine what should be. People make mistakes and are quite rarely deciding because of ethical value, especially when financial value comes in play.
1.5.2.1. Con: A law is an attempt to determine what is right or wrong, or what should be considered such. Therefore, a law does help determine what should be.
1.5.3. Con: There are places in the US where it is illegal to abort on the basis of sex, race and genetic abnormalities. [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/sex-disability-race-selective-abortion-indiana/482856/)
1.5.4. Pro: A fetus up to a certain point is in many places including the U.S. [not recognized legally as a person](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights), and as such the human rights of the mother supersede it.
1.5.4.1. Con: Many of the laws are based on our ability to keep a premature baby alive. As we get better at this \([able to keep them alive at earlier stages](https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/586996)\) we should review and update the laws.
1.5.4.2. Con: The existence or non-existence of legislation has no bearing on the morality of something. Slavery was legal, but it was not right. The fact that some legislatures do not recognize a fetus as having life does not mean they are correct, or morally right for that matter.
1.5.4.3. Con: Fetus means child in [Latin](http://www.latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/fetus).
1.5.4.3.1. Con: The legal or scientific recognition of a word is not decided by its Latin origins.
1.6. Pro: Abortion can be used as a [preventative measure](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/29/u-n-human-rights-commissioner-urges-abortion-down-syndrome-babies/) to prevent a child from a life of suffering.
1.6.1. Con: An outside agent cannot clearly determine the weight of suffering against the value of their own life, and thus ought not act due to their limited understanding.
1.6.1.1. Con: Inaction is impossible in the case of pregnancy; carrying the fetus to term IS action.
1.6.2. Con: Disabilities that are a heavy burden now may well be treatable in the near future. And the opportunities for disabled people to participate in all venues of life have improved dramatically.
1.6.2.1. Con: Some disabilities do not have a long life expectancy. Many children with type 1 SMA [do not live longer than 2 years](http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/s/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma). In these types of cases, treatment is unlikely to become available within the child's life-span.
1.6.3. Con: Once probable suffering is accepted as a legal reason to terminate life, the right to evaluate its likelihood may shift from the mother to the state on the grounds of objectivity. Poor mothers may then be forced to abort against their will. That is clearly to be not in the interest of mothers.
1.6.3.1. Con: The state should not be involved, but the state likely will not become involved simply due to the controversy generated from such involvement.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: Forcing can easily take forms that appear to be the mother‘s choice. Such as extreme financial motivations.
1.6.4. Con: This also implies that in countries, where females are heavily disadvantaged, aborting females solely for their sex should be legal.
1.6.5. Con: “Suffering” is a relative term based on circumstance, environment, geographical location, and current technology available. A child born in the rural South or rural Midwest of the United States is arguably at a disadvantage in comparison to the same child born in a more well developed metropolitan area on the East or West Coast when it comes to access to medical care.
1.6.6. Con: It is hard to say whether child with disability would live life of suffering. For some it might be true, for some not.
1.6.7. Con: Many disabled people are happy and glad to be alive. One would be hard pressed to find a disabled individual who would rather have been aborted.
1.6.7.1. Con: As there are no aborted people to report their preference for non-existence, this is subject to confirmation bias.
1.6.7.2. Con: Assuming parents who abort a disabled fetus would go on to have a non-disabled child \(as can be supposed\), then not aborting deprives the potential non-disabled child of life.
1.6.8. Con: By this logic, suicide is also an acceptable option. Being a preventative measure with positive effects therefore does not equate to being acceptable.
1.6.9. Pro: It's best to prevent a disable child from being born, giving a chance at life to one that will be able to experience life fully.
1.6.9.1. Con: Disabled people are generally as equally satisfied with life as healthy people, as long as they have support and are not isolated. Parents should be made aware of all the support available not advised to abort.
1.6.9.2. Con: This is hateful towards disabled people in the community, as someone would rather terminate a pregnancy and have no baby rather risk giving birth to a disabled child.
1.6.9.3. Con: There are many people with disabilities that live a fuller life than those without them.
1.6.9.3.1. Pro: Plenty of disabled people live very very happy lives. 99% of Down syndromes say they are happy with their lives. 97% say they are happy with who they are. Killing such people is a purely selfish act. These are some of the happiest people on the planet.   [www.lifesitenews.com](https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/99-of-people-with-down-syndrome-say-they-are-happy-so-why-are-most-downs-ba)
1.6.9.4. Con: This is a false dichotomy. Taking away life from a disabled person does not automatically give a life to a non-disabled person. Likewise, giving life to a disabled person does not prevent said able bodied person from existing.
1.6.9.5. Con: It is not legislator's prerogative to decide how "full" somebody's life is or would be.
1.6.10. Pro: Aborting a child with any [severe mental disability](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Severe+mental+retardation) should be mandatory.
1.6.10.1. Pro: [Severe mental disabilities](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Severe+mental+retardation) significantly diminish the quality of a human's life and their individual freedom to the point that it is unethical to bring them into existence.
1.6.10.2. Pro: Several mental disabilities place an undue burden and risk upon caretakers.
1.6.11. Pro: [Over 40% of America’s homeless population suffer from disabilities whereas only 17.7% of the general population do](https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/07/16/homeless-report/4153/). Choosing to abort a disabled child could contribute to decreasing the homeless population and prevent suffering of the child caused by homelessness and poverty.
1.6.11.1. Con: The ends never justify the means. To end an innocent life to improve the lifestyle of another is not morally acceptable.
1.6.12. Con: The child should have a right to decide for himself if his life is worth living.
1.6.12.1. Con: This argument is invalid in cases where the person would not be able to consent.
1.6.12.1.1. Pro: Some disabled individuals may still not be able to consent verbally or otherwise due to their condition.
1.6.12.1.2. Con: Nobody deserves to die solely on the basis that they cannot consent to it.
1.7. Con: Terminating pregnancy based on a child's disabilities would send a message that disabled people are unwanted by the society.
1.7.1. Pro: The decision to end another persons life should not be based upon an assumption , another persons personal opinion that the disability will cause that person to be unhappy in life or that it might inconvenience them or others in some way.
1.7.1.1. Con: The decision to end a ball of cells existence \(note: not "a life"\) can be rationally made based on whether that ball of cells' development is going well or not.[Human Embryogenesis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/HumanEmbryogenesis.svg/550px-HumanEmbryogenesis.svg.png)
1.7.2. Con: The broadcast of the termination is not necessary.
1.7.3. Con: Disabled people are in fact unwanted by society. They are accommodated, as well as possible, but they are not a desired result of procreation.
1.7.3.1. Con: A person that bears one undesirable characteristic can not immediately be deemed undesirable. For example, Stephen Hawking could have passed extremely desirable genes when already aware of his disability.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: He was 21 before showing any symptoms. Few cases of his condition are genetic \(10%\), but genetic screening of the embryo to lower risk further would have been an advantage. He may be smart, which is heritable, but we are discussing aborting embryos that show up as carrying the condition. [news.bbc.co.uk](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8009804.stm)
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Screening might have allowed earlier treatment, but here we discuss abortion, which would have bereft us of a great scientist and teacher.
1.7.3.1.2. Con: On a professional level the referenced person was successful, however the condition prevented a happy home life for those around him. Life is difficult enough; reducing the medical burden on society also removes it on a micro level.[google.de](https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/jane-hawking-there-were-four-of-us-in-marriage-stephen-hawking-theory-of-everything)
1.7.3.1.2.1. Con: Unhappy thinkers and creators, such as Kekule or Kafka are by no means, no desired result of procreation“. Please mind the parent claim.
1.7.3.1.2.2. Pro: Partners often feel trapped as carers when conditions progress. Most genetic conditions become medically important later in life \(due to evolutionary forces\), so those in good health when young become less able with time.
1.7.3.2. Con: This assumes that the disability is the sum of all of the person's worth.  There are many aspects to a person, and while he may have certain disabilities, he has inherent worth as a human.  There are many ways people contribute to society, not all of them economic.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Holding all else equal, one would not deliberately choose for their child to be born with birth defects. Therefore, it is an unwanted outcome.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: There are few who would make such a choice to show the world that it is not so bad; that the lives of disabled people are also worth living.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Con: Trying to make a point with the birth of your child sets a bad precedent.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: Just because it’s an unwanted outcome doesn’t mean the child has no value and isn’t worth raising.
1.7.3.3.3. Con: Yet, we don’t have the ability to 'hold all things equal“. Every person has many strengths and weaknesses and is not defined by one dimension \(disability\).
1.7.3.4. Con: Even if disabled are really unwanted it is not good to manifest this concept in such brutal way, because it will make their life even harder.
1.7.3.5. Con: If society considers people with disabilities to be unwanted, then the issue here is discrimination.
1.7.4. Pro: Medical model of disability can overestimate medical burden.[books.google.de](https://books.google.de/books?id=RnDA0EKcMaEC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=medical+burden+of+disabled+citizens&source=bl&ots=Y6urmTnKqA&sig=bKnjR6BfyhT7baNfGhEcYa3CW-c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjq8-ydx7bZAhVMthQKHVa8D4YQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=medical%20burden%20of%20disabled%20citizens&f=false)
1.7.5. Con: If there was a way to tell that the child would suffer \(more than life already bestows\), it is a kindness to prevent that suffering.
1.7.5.1. Con: Disability does not equate suffering. It just means living differently.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Suffering may be involved, but many people can still live valuable lives despite suffering. Besides, medicine, societal reform, and familial love can alleviate suffering a child experiences.
1.7.6. Pro: Children with disabilities contribute to society in ways that are overlooked because their condition is often seen as a burden to their families and society.
1.7.6.1. Pro: In what world can people decide who gets to live and who gets to die? Even though the child might have a mental disability that doesn't mean that we should kill the child. Take Hellen Keller for example, she was thought of as "useless" in the world but look at all the things that she accomplished.
1.7.6.2. Pro: We as humans have a lot to learn from disabled people. Preventing their being would devalue society.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Disabled children grow into disabled adults who can add significant value to society in all areas
1.7.7. Pro: It would further send the message that disabled people do not have lives that are in themselves valuable. All life is good and valuable.
1.7.7.1. Con: Not everyone sees every form of life as inherently good or valuable.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: All life is still inherently good and valuable despite how others may see it.
1.8. Con: Once the baby‘s right to life is made conditional, the legal basis for more exceptions is created.
1.8.1. Con: Providing an option to abort based on more information on negative impacts for this child's and the families future is quite different than demanding abortion from anyone for any reason. Providing access to abortion is not eugenics.
1.8.1.1. Con: It creates a legal basis for eugenics by making the right to birth conditional.
1.8.2. Pro: Children from an area with high criminality, born and unborn, may come next.
1.8.3. Pro: If we start to allow abortions based on specific traits, this could give way to the idea of designer babies, perhaps even make them a reality.
1.9. Con: Disabled children and their families contribute to our culture through their accomplishments and perseverance.
1.9.1. Con: Their contributions and accomplishments are irrelevant to the question of the legality of aborting them. A rapist or murderer could be amazing doctors, writers, engineers, or whatever, we would still punish them, no matter their accomplishments and contributions to society.
1.10. Con: Prenatal screenings cannot grant with 100% security that its results are true. This would mean the abortion of healthy children in some of the cases.
1.10.1. Con: No surgery is 100% safe, yet every day people have surgeries of differing levels of risk.
1.10.2. Con: The small percentage for faulty prenatal screening doesn't outweigh the high possibility of birthing and giving resources to an invalidated person for which there is no place in society.
1.10.3. Pro: In one case, an expectant mother was hours away from a recommended and scheduled abortion when she was informed that her baby was [misdiagnosed](https://www.liveaction.org/news/caution-genetic-testing-not-100-accurate/) via  a pre-screening.
1.10.4. Con: Women with initial abnormal results can do more tests to gain certainty, such as [amniocentesis tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis).
1.10.4.1. Con: Even the amniocentesis test is not 100% accurate \(at best it is given a 99.4% accuracy rate [webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-amniocentesis#2-5) although most estimates claim that it is only 98%-99% accurate [americanpregnancy.org](http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/amniocentesis/) \). There still remains the possibility of human error with any diagnostic test that can occur in the lab or as a result other negligent human mistakes that can lead to inaccurate test results .
1.10.4.1.1. Con: These cases of inaccuracy are minor and are highly likely to become even rarer in the future.
1.10.4.2. Con: No pre-natal screen is 100% accurate.
1.11. Pro: Abortion allows for selective human evolution for non-disabled genes, which leads to a stronger species.
1.11.1. Pro: Reducing the prevalence of recessive gene conditions from the population is good for overall society; more attention/facilities/staff will be available to deal with other patients \(afflicted other, non-heritable, conditions\).[A brief discussion on genetic conditions.](http://science.jrank.org/pages/2975/Genetic-Disorders-Recessive-genetic-disorders.html)
1.11.2. Con: A person’s gene pool does not consist of one characteristic \(disabled/non disabled\). The species would not be stronger for aborting Stephen Hawking on the grounds of disability, for example.
1.11.2.1. Con: Stephen Hawking is one in a million. Disabled humans are normally weaker in their [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability) and [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability) attributes depending on their degree of disability. They will most likely direct evolution in a non-desired direction.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: We have no way of knowing what will become of these children. They could very well be the next Stephen Hawking, and we wouldn't be able to know because of an abortion.
1.11.2.2. Con: Stephen Hawking's disease wasn't genetic.
1.11.3. Pro: Modern society has halted natural selection. Scientific advances can keep most people alive and well long enough to breed, whatever their condition. It is now our responsibility to try to improve the future outcome of human evolution. [David Attenborough- Humans stopped natural selection.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/evolution/10297124/Sir-David-Attenborough-Humans-have-stopped-evolving.html)
1.11.3.1. Con: Selection still occurs, especially sexually. As our society changed, disabled people have more and more potential to contribute to society. We can’t propose selections based on the priorities of prehistoric society.
1.11.4. Con: That is prehistoric thinking. In the Stone Age, this may have been true, but we live in a modern society that can nurture and bring out the best in disabled people. A species can be strong in many ways, and now disabled people can contribute to that strength.
1.11.5. Con: This suggests eugenics, which may not be considered moral.
1.11.5.1. Pro: In fact this is called eugenics. The Germans used this method during Hitler's time, killing weaker children right after they were born.
1.11.5.1.1. Con: Just because an evil regime did something, it doesn't mean that the thing itself is bad.
1.11.5.1.1.1. Pro: Hitler was a vegetarian - this doesn't mean vegetarianism is evil. Hitler did eugenics, but this doesn't mean that eugenics is evil.
1.11.5.2. Con: Idealogical eugenics \(whitest, smartest, prettiest\) is unwanted. However, due to medical advances and modern society, evolution is no longer able to improve the human population \(genetic conditions\) with natural selection. It is our responsibility to remove poor genes where possible.
1.11.5.2.1. Con: It has been shown that [many human traits are subject to natural selection](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/evolutionary-adaptation-in-the-human-lineage-12397)
1.11.5.2.2. Con: Killing anyone with these genes who are already born is not right, neither should be killing anyone with these genes before they are born.
1.11.5.3. Con: Eugenics is not universally considered immoral.
1.11.5.4. Pro: The legalization must be complete. If it applies only for some cases, then it isn't any different from other eugenic policies that selectively chooses the most desired gene expressions.
1.11.5.4.1. Con: There are countless laws that only apply in certain circumstances.
1.11.6. Con: Having the right to abort children based on preference is immoral. A disabled person's right to live is the same as a normal person's.
1.11.6.1. Con: The right to live is equal. The right to be born is under discussion.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: The right to be born equates with one aspect of the right to live.
1.12. Pro: The right of abortion must always be given, as long as it does not threaten the mother's health, regardless of the person's reasons.
1.12.1. Con: The entire purpose of the law is to ensure that an individual's right to live their life as they choose does not impact anyone else's freedom and right to live their lives as they choose. Abortion takes away someone else's right to live and to make choices when they are capable of doing that in the future.
1.12.1.1. Con: The [violin player thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion) argues that the right to life does not include the right to use another person's body. Abortion does not violate the fetus's right to life but merely deprives it of use of the mother's body to which it has no right.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: Depriving the baby of the use of his or her mother's body is what violates their right to life. The baby is not choosing to use a mother's body, he or she merely existing. Their right to life should not be taken away because of something they cannot help.
1.12.1.2. Con: This is untrue. Many unjust laws exist and have existed which do not enforce the rights of individuals to live their lives freely. Slavery was legal, for example.
1.12.1.3. Con: A fetus is not a person yet, as it lacks many of the cognitive traits of a human being that confer moral personhood, including among others the ability to choose, which is necessary for any right to live one's life as one chooses.
1.12.2. Con: That legalises abortion of females based on sex, which is guaranteed to happen in societies keen to preserve the paternal line.
1.12.3. Pro: The [right of abortion](https://www.kialo.com/should-women-have-the-right-to-choose-abortion-5637/5637.0=5637.1/=5637.1) is a right over one's body, which is a universal human right.
1.12.3.1. Con: The body of their child is not their own body, its someone else's body.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: A woman has the right to decide whether her body is used to sustain someone else's life.
1.12.3.1.1.1. Con: She does so before getting pregnant.
1.12.3.1.1.2. Con: This argument acknowledges the baby is a "someone" and is alive, so this individual should have the right to life. The baby is not choosing to "use" the mother like a parasite, he or she is simply existing and growing, and has a right to do so.
1.12.3.2. Con: Humans do not universally have rights over their own bodies. There are many things that we are not allowed to do with our bodies.
1.12.3.2.1. Pro: We are not allowed to harass or assault others with our bodies. Even if it's our body and we want to, it still hurts another person and inflicts their rights to safety and life.
1.12.3.3. Con: The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) does not include the right over one's body.
1.12.3.3.1. Con: The "security of person" , as outlined in [Article 3](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), gives one the right over their own body, specifically to prevent their body from being the domain of someone else.
1.12.3.3.1.1. Con: This does not justify killing to preserve that right.
1.12.3.4. Con: The fetus is in the same ontological class as any human being, therefore, he has the same rights as any other human being.
1.12.3.5. Pro: The unborn do not have the rights that the living have. A living person has a right to life, but a fetus does not.
1.12.4. Pro: It is not the place of the government to decide the validity of someone's reasons for having an abortion.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Many people believe that aborting a disabled child is ethical. The ethics of a government should reflect the ethics of it's citizens. [Australian Parents Choose to Abort 93% of Down Syndrome Fetuses](https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2017/08/17/down-syndrome-birth-terminations/)
1.12.5. Con: No one has the right to kill another human without that person's consent. A mother's right to bodily autonomy are waived where they conflict with the baby's right to life.
1.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.12.5.2. Con: Assisted suicide is usually illegal in most modern world countries.
1.12.5.3. Con: By this logic, if a dead person's organs could save someone's life they should not have a right to bodily autonomy.
1.12.5.3.1. Pro: If a dead person continues to have rights when it doesn't affect them, a mother's rights to bodily autonomy should be waived when they are in conflict with a fetus's 'right to life' as it can cause the mother both physical and mental trauma.
1.12.5.4. Pro: The right to life is a key principle of human rights and can only be decided by the person. It is not a parents choice to decide.[echr.coe.int](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf)
1.12.5.5. Con: Being "human" does not confer moral personhood - a [cell line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa) from a woman who died in 1951 is human by some definitions \(living thing with human DNA\), for instance. What makes one a moral person is the cognitive ability that distinguishes human from animal, which a fetus does not have.
1.12.6. Pro: The Roe v. Wade decision set that a woman obtaining an abortion was in fact, a constitutional right. Specific reasons as to why a woman obtained an abortion should be between the woman & her partner.
1.12.7. Pro: We do not have a right to force somebody to make a decision that's not right for them especially if the consequence might hurt a dependent \(ie bad moms who did't want the responsibility in the first place\)
1.13. Pro: Abortion in cases of disabled children would save families the higher financial burden of supporting such offspring.
1.13.1. Pro: Taking care of a disabled child can cost [4 times](https://blog.mint.com/planning/the-cost-of-raising-a-special-needs-child-0713/) as much as a child without disabilities.
1.13.1.1. Con: Money is not as important as the child. There are many people and programs to help.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: If the family cannot support the child, it will end up dead through lack of needs being met or taken by social services. It's more ethical to stop the child existing before it has any ability to suffer than to bring it into a world where it will only suffer.
1.13.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.13.1.1.1.2. Con: It is impossible to go through life without suffering. Suffering is a part of life.
1.13.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The first noble truth of [Buddhism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201609/existence-is-suffering) suggests existence itself is suffering.
1.13.2. Pro: Families with a disabled child, or children are more likely to be [single-income homes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802121/), as one parent takes the caregiver role. This puts substantial financial strain on the family.
1.13.3. Con: So would planned parenting. \(Contraceptives or abstinence\) Abortion does not become moral simply because it has desireable benefits.
1.13.4. Con: Not having any children in the first place is a better option if your only concern in life is money.
1.13.4.1. Con: The decision to abort due to finances does not mean one's only concern is money, but simply at this moment in their life they are not capable of taken on the extra financial needs of having a disabled child.
1.13.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.13.4.2. Con: Considering the financial challenges of having a disable child shows responsibility and also consideration for the hardships the child may have to endure due to lack of proper funds.
1.13.4.2.1. Con: Enduring hardship is often better than not having a life.
1.13.4.2.2. Con: There is a lot of help available for people with disabilities. Government programs, charities, and kind people.
1.13.4.2.2.1. Pro: Shriners Hospitals For Children, for example, does great things for children with disabilities regardless of their ability to pay.
1.13.4.2.3. Pro: If a child will be unable to access the special medical care it may need in order to lead a happy and/or reasonable amount of pain, it shows compassion and consideration on behalf of the mother to decide that it would be better for the child's sake to terminate the pregnancy.
1.13.5. Con: If killing a child at the age of 5, 10, 18, or 21 years because they are a financial burden is not acceptable, so it should not be acceptable in the womb.
1.13.5.1. Con: As soon as a child enters the world, s/he becomes an individual human being with rights, and it is not acceptable to kill an individual. A fetus in the womb is not an individual. The carrier of the fetus should have full rights to her own body, including anything that is feeding off her body. It can be argued, if a fetus is developed enough to live outside of the womb \(prematurely at 22+ months\), then an abortion should not be allowed after that. [www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/babies-born-22-weeks-can-survive-medical-care-new-study-finds-329518)
1.13.5.1.1. Con: A fetus has its own set of DNA, unique to it, making a fetus an individual.
1.13.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.14. Pro: If a family does not wish to have a disabled child, it would be better for the child not to be born than to live feeling unwanted by his/her family.
1.14.1. Pro: Approximately [30 percent](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/09/15/abandoned-state/violence-neglect-and-isolation-children-disabilities-russian) of children in Russia with disabilities end up living in closed institutions away from their families.
1.14.1.1. Con: Having a life in an institution is better than not being born at all.
1.14.1.2. Con: That only means we have to improve the status of disabled people in Russia, as we already did elsewhere.
1.14.2. Con: There are several accounts of children with disabilities being loved, respected, an inspiration, and enhancing the lives of  adoptive parents and other family members.
1.14.2.1. Pro: Just because biological parents are unable and/or unwilling to raise or love a disabled child does not mean that adoptive parents would be unable to do so.
1.14.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.14.4. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.14.5. Pro: Abortion should not have restrictions at all. If a woman or couple want to give birth to a child and to raise him, they obviously want a healthy child. The idea of most parents is to raise a "normal" person and not a disabled one. They would save the disabled child all the suffering the child would live if it was born.
1.14.5.1. Con: The fallacy consists in regarding the child as defined solely by its disability, when in fact it possesses many desirable and undesirable qualities, which may render it more welcome than certain healthy children.
1.14.5.2. Con: Everyone suffers not only the disabled.
1.14.5.3. Con: This state that life of a of Homo Sapiens \(as not everybody agree unborn child is human\) is worth less than another Homo Sapiens comfort / wish and any other value of low importancy.
1.14.6. Con: A family's feelings can change upon the delivery of a baby. This is often the case when [a mother holds her infant](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/forming-a-bond-with-your-baby-why-it-isnt-always-immediate#1) for the first time.
1.14.7. Pro: There are several accounts of children with disabilities being abandoned or abused by their families. Abortion can save them from experiencing this.
1.14.7.1. Con: If the parent is immoral, he will abuse healthy children too.  He is not likely to choose abortion out of concern for the child either. The solutions are adoption and prosecution. Not abortion.
1.14.7.2. Con: Being aborted would also prevent them from ever experiencing anything good
1.15. Con: The presence of disable people in our lives gives us a bigger sense of humanity and transforms the lives of those surrounding them.
