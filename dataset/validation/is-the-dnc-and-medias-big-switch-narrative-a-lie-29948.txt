Discussion Name: Is the DNC and media's "big switch" narrative a lie?

1. Did the Republican party become racist as a result of Dixiecrats switching parties in the 60s and 70s or are Democrats lying? Known as the "Big Switch," this alleged event is hotly debated. The DNC, mainstream media and progressive universities push one narrative while the RNC and conservatives have another. What is true?
1.1. The DNC and mainstream media's "big switch" narrative a lie.
1.1.1. Pro: Republicans were [more likely](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/17/fact-check-more-republicans-voted-for-the-civil-rights-act-as-a-percentage-than-democrats-did/) to vote for the Civil Rights Act than Democrats.
1.1.1.1. Con: [Geography](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/28/republicans-party-of-civil-rights), rather than party affiliation, was the main driver in support of the Civil Rights Act.
1.1.2. Pro: Nixon continued Eisenhower's Civil Rights movements all the way into the 70s, creating the Philadelphia Plan -- the first institutional affirmative action policy. No break in Republican support for Civil Rights.
1.1.2.1. Con: The Reagan administration tried to dismantle this executive order in 1981.
1.1.3. Con: Republicans gained majority control over southern America; thus racists in Jim Crow states voting for Democrats switched to vote Republican.
1.1.4. Pro: Scholars suggest that "[economically](https://journals.openedition.org/miranda/2243) based preferences, rather than race, were the primary force transforming the South into a new Republican stronghold". Thus party realignment was not entirely based on race.
1.1.4.1. Con: "However, as Lassiter and Kruse point out, this new politics was different from and more than simple racism, since middle class status insulated middle class and affluent whites from racial others nearly as effectively as whiteness."
1.1.5. Con: Just prior to the Civil War, there were two Democrat parties, only one of which represented Southern racism and slavery. The New Deal Democrats were descended from the Northern party, and are what today's Democrats descend from.
1.1.6. Con: While Southern states began voting Republican in national races starting with Nixon, most state and local level Southern politicians remained Democrat until the 1990s. This shows that the Southern Democrat party continued on a smaller scale well after the supposed big switch.
1.1.7. Con: Minorities started voting Democrat more than Republican because the racist Dixiecrats joined the RNC.
1.1.8. Con: Strom Thurmond, one of the most prominent Dixiecrats, switched to Republican in order to support Barry Goldwater, who initially opposed the Civil Rights Act.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Some scholars point out that the '[switch](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10750.html)' was gradual and that top party leaders "were actually among the last to move".
1.1.9. Con: Nixon won on racism.
1.1.9.1. Con: Nixon lost the south.
1.1.9.2. Con: Nixon used no racist messaging in his campaigning.
1.1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.9.4. Pro: Nixon tried to use the '[Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy#Roots_\(1963%E2%80%931972\))', an electoral strategy that appeals to racism.
1.1.10. Con: LBJ, prominent democrat president, signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
1.1.11. Pro: A Democrat state congress and Democrat governor passed every single Jim Crow law.
1.1.11.1. Pro: Since 1877 and during the Jim Crow era, there was virtually no Republican in an influential government position in the South \([Bartlet, p. 24](https://books.google.de/books?id=POhHuoGILNYC&pg=PA24&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.1.11.1.1. Con: This is not a con to the thesis as the thesis proposes that the "switch" didn't happen until after WWII at the earliest. Of course Souther Democrats were the ones making the im Crow Laws - they were the same people that succeeded from the Union.
1.1.11.2. Con: While Southern states began voting Republican in national races starting with Nixon, most state and local level Southern politicians remained Democrat until the 1990s. This shows that the Southern Democrat party continued on a smaller scale well after the supposed big switch.
1.1.11.3. Con: No Jim Crow laws were passed in Northern Democrat states, like New York.
1.1.12. Pro: Eisenhower, Republican president in 1961, appointed Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren, who was instrumental in ending school segregation as a Supreme Court Justice on Brown v. Board of Education, and generally as a champion of civil rights.
1.1.12.1. Con: The Court's decisions was [unanimous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) \(9–0\) as school segregation was deemed "inherently unequal" and therefore against the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, judges presumably appointed by both parties, not only Warren, ended school segregation.
1.1.12.2. Con: It is unclear that [Eisenhower](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/commander-v-chief/554045/) wanted Earl Warren to rule the way the Supreme Court did. Some time before, over dinner, the president said "These \[southern whites\] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big black bucks.”
1.1.12.2.1. Pro: In fact, it seems the Brown ruling, that ended school segregation, [ruptured](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/commander-v-chief/554045/) personal relations between Eisenhower and Warren permanently.
1.1.12.2.1.1. Pro: Authors point out that while the president Eisenhower “did not obstruct progress on civil rights,” he “refused to lead" it, and Warren [resented](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/commander-v-chief/554045/) this for the rest of his life.
1.1.12.2.2. Con: This is a racially charged statement but does not convey support for or against segregation or race. Eisenhower merely remarks of the mindset of those affected, and his observation was both accurate and well understood.
1.1.12.2.3. Con: Warren was already a vocal supporter of integration in California prior to being appointed. Eisenhower said Warren's social and political views were the [kind he wanted](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550903).
1.1.12.2.3.1. Pro: During Earl Warren's third term as governor, in 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate conservative, nominated Warren to be chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court stating, ["He represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court."](https://www.biography.com/political-figure/earl-warren)
1.1.12.3. Pro: Warren penned the Supreme Court opinion of the law and convinced the other judges with [quite a great deal of passion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education#Consensus_building).
1.1.13. Pro: Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois, like Lincoln, championed and wrote much of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.
