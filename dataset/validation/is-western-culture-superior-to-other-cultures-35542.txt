Discussion Name: Is Western culture superior to other cultures?

1. [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture) is superior to other cultures.
1.1. Con: Dominance is often confused with superiority, and these two are not interchangeable in terms of culture.
1.1.1. Pro: Western culture is the dominant culture for many factors that are not easily defined as superior.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Implying that Western culture is superior also implies that it is [better](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/superior) than other cultures. This is a detrimental viewpoint.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: To define one culture as 'superior' over another is to position that culture as being [of more importance](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/superior) than others, which can threaten the 'inferior' culture's existence.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Indigenous cultures](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/conservation-and-indigenous-peoples) are in danger of extinction due to Westernization.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Deeming a culture as inferior threatens the lives and livelihood of those people living within that cultural system.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Implying that western cultures are superior because they fare better on [human rights indices](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/freedom-index-by-country) could be beneficial, because they set a desirable standard for how other countries should treat their citizens.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Americans popularly call their country "the greatest nation on earth." This is symptomatic of the myth of "[American exceptionalism](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=American+exceptionalism)(Most statements of "American exceptionalism" presume that America’s values, political system, and history are unique and worthy of universal admiration. They also imply that the United States is both destined and entitled to play a distinct and positive role on the world stage.\n\nThe only thing wrong with this self-congratulatory portrait of America’s global role is that it is mostly a myth. Although the United States possesses certain unique qualities — from high levels of religiosity to a political culture that privileges individual freedom — the conduct of U.S. foreign policy has been determined primarily by its relative power and by the inherently competitive nature of international politics. By focusing on their supposedly exceptional qualities, Americans blind themselves to the ways that they are a lot like everyone else.)," which stifles their capacity for self-criticism and growth.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The [areas](https://www.movehub.com/blog/what-matters-most-map/) that matter most to people around the world vary quite a bit. Therefore what may be considered dominant in one culture may not hold the same importance in another culture.
1.1.2. Pro: A product, for example, can dominate the markets, but it does not make it a superior product in terms of quality.
1.1.2.1. Con: In a free market, a product being dominant is the result of some kind of superior value the majority of consumers enjoy that the competing non dominant products do not offer.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: With the advent of the marketing industry, a product could gain dominance simply because it was advertised aggressively, endorsed by celebrities, or had the luck to attract substantial attention from various forms of media. Due to information asymmetry between consumers and producers, consumers would not even know that the product is not superior and will be enticed by its hype.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Kinder Joy is extremely popular among children, but this is attributable not so much to the quality of the chocolate but their [effective marketing strategy](https://www.chocolateandmoredelights.com/blogs/news/the-magic-of-kinder-surprise-and-why-kids-love-it)(Kids love toys. The surprise that they get inside each egg, no matter how small, means a lot to them. They love knowing that they'll get a toy \(and maybe a unique one\) each time they unwrap the chocolate. The toys are usually miniature versions of objects like cars, bikes, airplanes, cute animals or a special collectible figure.): including a surprise toy in the treat.
1.1.3. Pro: Western countries have caused millions of deaths through slavery, colonialism, and two global conflicts. Thus, Western Culture has been dominant, but not superior.
1.1.3.1. Con: The practice of slavery, war and colonialism behavior is not unique to only western countries or western culture.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery#Origins) was known in civilizations as old as Sumer, as well as in almost every other ancient civilization, including ancient Egypt, ancient China, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Babylonia, ancient Iran, ancient India, the Arab Islamic Caliphate and Sultanate, Nubia and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: However, the extent of the transatlantic slave trade by the Europeans was unique: Between 1525 and 1866, [12.5 million Africans](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/) were shipped to the New World.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: More people are currently [enslaved](https://amp.scmp.com/news/world/article/1333894/29-million-trapped-modern-day-slavery-china-30-million-worldwide) in the East than were traded by the transatlantic slave trade total.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: [This modern-day slavery](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1333894/29-million-trapped-modern-day-slavery-china-30-million-worldwide) includes the forced labour of men, women and children in many parts of the economy, including domestic servitude and forced begging, the sexual exploitation of women and children, and forced marriage.
1.1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: This applies in absolute numbers; however, given that the world population was [approximately 1/10 of today's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Human_toll) population at the beginning of the transatlantic slavetrade, a much larger proportion of the population was affected by it.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Given that the practice was not unique but only the extent, we can attribute this to economic factors and the West's unprecedented power and wealth, not to any particular moral failing.
1.1.3.1.2.3. Con: However, the transatlantic slave trade was only possible due to Africans selling their own people to Europeans, therefore it is not the sole responsibility of Europeans
1.1.3.2. Con: Killing and conflict are not exclusive to Western culture; Eastern cultures have a history of this as well.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Thousands of [Rohingya](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561) people are killed, raped, and forced to flee their homes due to cultural conflict in Myanmar.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: The [Communist Party of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong) persecuted millions of people and the estimated number of deaths caused ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: [Stalin's regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes) killed an estimated 20 million people.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The assumption of western superiority was used as a means of argumentation to justify the colonization of "less developed" cultures.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: The justification and reasoning for one culture or nation to subjugate another is not unique to western culture
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: One argument was called the “[civilizing mission](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/),” which suggested that a temporary period of political dependence or tutelage was necessary in order for “uncivilized” societies to develop in according to Western ideals.
1.1.4. Con: Dominance is defined as 'power and influence over others.' To achieve this, a culture must be superior to another, even if it is only in terms of economic, political, or military power.
1.1.4.1. Con: The culture does not need to be superior to be dominant. If the U.S randomly decided to intervene on behalf of any given culture, they could be dominant regardless of their culture.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: In a situation where two minor powers are squabbling, and the global hegemon decides to intervene on the side of one rather than the other for arbitrary reasons, obviously it's the culture of the hegemon that's producing dominance - in this case, the USA.
1.1.4.2. Con: Military and economic power are tangible advantages that can be considered independent of culture. For instance, North Korea may have superior nuclear capabilities compared to a country like New Zealand, but the values it imparts to its citizens through its centralized education system are in no way superior.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: If North Korea actually could and did conquer New Zealand, this would demonstrate a kind of superiority over New Zealand's culture, if only in terms of the cultural factors that, via politics and economics, lead to strength or weakness.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: If by superiority we mean 'quality' then this would not demonstrate superiority over New Zealand's culture. North Korea's culture is a cult of personality that promotes abuse of all its citizens. If imposed over New Zealand's secularism, the people of the island would suffer greatly. This means that North Korea's culture is inferior.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: New Zealand is in a comfortable enough geopolitical situation that it can afford to have a small military budget, while North Korea is not, and the reasons for this are driven in part by culture.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: New Zealand's GDP is $199 billion, while North Korea's is $40 billion. The economic reasons why a country with one fifth the population has five times the money are, of course, influenced by the different cultures of the two nations.
1.1.4.3. Con: There’s a clear definition to dominance, but not superiority. Dominance reflects power, whereas superiority may reflect effectiveness and competence. Whether a culture is effective and competent depends on the extent to which it contributes to a common goal defined by all countries.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Effectiveness and competence is not defined by contribution to a common goal defined by all countries: an agent that is good at achieving its own goals is effective and competent, regardless of if those goals conflict with the goals of others.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Our anthropocentric measures of superiority are biased. The only unbiased criterion is dominance. E.g. if a country violates human rights, believes in superstitions etc. but is able to dominate the world then its culture should be considered superior.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: One cannot objectively determine superiority, as superior just means [better](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/superior). We can only determine whether something is better through our subjective, personal or cultural values.
1.1.4.5. Con: There’s no objective method to weight all the different dimensions that shape a culture \(architecture, cuisine, philosophy, science, military strength etc\) in order to appropriately rank them in terms of better or worse.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: You could be more military dominant, but inferior when it comes to cultural / historic heritage. There's not an objective KPI that could determine the superiority of a culture over another \(overall\) because there are too many variables.
1.1.5. Con: The [Scandinavian democracies](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gHD7t8NbAKc1EmgAQfxvENyA4SEcio41c14f6imU7iuLKQqu9-c9QLj3rBnD35OTFBmLDuBbD8L83ckct9eBzlzIOuvCKcEi0xa9BuRmhfgz8QQlc3Znaiy2bMA_RXYFUA) are not dominant, yet on almost every metric we could care about they seem to rank highly. Thus we could say that these democracies are superior to the Aztecs, in so far as we deem mass murder, human sacrifice, and torture to be undesirable.
1.1.5.1. Con: The Scandinavian democracies have far superior militaries to the Aztecs - even Iceland, which has a [coast guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Coast_Guard) but no standing army, could not plausibly be conquered by a couple thousand Spaniards with 16th-century technology. As such, the Aztec empire cannot be called dominant relative to Scandinavia.
1.1.5.2. Con: The [Aztec Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire) at its height in 1520 was half the size [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) is today. The government in Stockholm dominates its hinterlands far more than the government in Tenochtitlan did; in the latter case, the lesser cities were tributaries, making their citizens not even direct subjects of the government.
1.1.6. Pro: One culture might be morally, socially, or academically superior to another, but not dominant.
1.1.6.1. Pro: While the Romans were clearly the dominant power and culture in antiquity, they adopted Greek cultural [beliefs and practices](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/history/comparisons-between-ancient-greece-and-ancient-rome-essay.php) and incorporated them into their own culture.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: This situation can be described as Greek culture dominating Roman culture, despite the military advantages of the Roman state over the cities of Greece. The competition in the sphere of actual cultural output is a separate competition from geopolitical conflict with armies, and it is possible to be more successful in one than the other.
1.1.6.2. Pro: A culture that values humility and equality would evidently not seek to dominate other cultures, yet they would be morally superior for espousing this virtue.
1.1.7. Pro: The inferiority of Western culture is proven by the violence required to prove their superiority.
1.1.7.1. Con: This uses an appeal to emotion to force a link between violence and inferiority. However, it depends how superiority and inferiority are defined.
1.1.7.2. Con: Violence is a side effect of rapid change or protection from change, although the violence itself is not a sign of culture. Change should be in the right direction to qualify for cultural development or protection. And ideally, change should be gradual not to hurt anyone.
1.1.7.3. Pro: According to '[Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_\(book\))', the West tries to create an image of itself that is developed, rational and flexible in order to maintain its power over the East.
1.1.7.4. Pro: The violence required to prove the superiority of Western culture can be found in the history of [Western colonialism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-colonialism).
1.1.8. Pro: Cultures cannot be objectively rated as "superior" or "inferior", they are simply different.
1.1.8.1. Con: The difference between cultures can be expressed in numbers. Numbers can be used to create a hierarchy.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Such indicators could include child mortality, the number of inventions / patents, or national GDP.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Culture encompasses a way of life such as food, religion, marriage, behavior, etc. This argument assumes that figures such as child mortality, GDP and patents are attributed to cultural factors instead more structural \(unequal opportunities\) or economic factors \(lack of competitive advantage\), which is inaccurate. [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/global-inequality-of-opportunity)
1.1.8.1.2. Con: While many objective facts may be expressed with numbers, which ones matter and should be used in a hierarchical ranking is a subjective question.
1.1.8.2. Con: Even if no culture is objectively superior to another, one need not adopt the subjective opinion that no culture is superior to another and that "they are simply different".
1.1.8.3. Con: Nazi Germany is not as good as the [Scandinavian democracies](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gHD7t8NbAKc1EmgAQfxvENyA4SEcio41c14f6imU7iuLKQqu9-https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gHD7t8NbAKc1EmgAQfxvENyA4SEcio41c14f6imU7iuLKQqu9-https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gHD7t8NbAKc1EmgAQfxvENyA4SEcio41c14f6imU7iuLKQqu9-c9QLj3rBnD35OTFBmLDuBbD8L83ckct9eBzlzIOuvCKcEi0xa9BuRmhfgz8QQlc3Znaiy2bMA_RXYFUA).
1.1.8.3.1. Con: If this is meant to get to objectivity through universal agreement, it fails because there exist \(neo-\)Nazis who would obviously rate Nazi Germany as better than the Scandinavian democracies.
1.1.8.4. Con: Cultures can be objectively rated as long as we define metrics by which to measure \(e.g absence of- starvation, mass murder, torture, genocide, infanticide, etc.\)
1.1.8.5. Pro: What is considered of value to the West may not be of the same value to the East. Therefore, comparing them is pointless.
1.1.8.5.1. Pro: Eastern cultures tend to display more traditional, [conservative values](https://www.globalfromasia.com/east-west-differences/) in comparison to the West.
1.1.8.6. Pro: Since there are no outside observers, every individual's criteria for superiority are necessarily shaped by their own culture, and thus not objective.
1.1.8.7. Pro: Whether a culture is inferior or superior depends on what we propose our eventual goal as a world to be, and if that particular culture contributes effectively to that goal. We don’t have such goals clearly defined.
1.1.8.7.1. Con: We do have common goals of advancement such as economic growth, technological advancement, and standards of living.
1.1.8.7.2. Con: A culture and the people that live in it are not merely a means to some future end; regardless of any eventual goal for our world that might be decided, a culture's effects on people today and in the past matters.
1.1.8.7.3. Pro: Determining the [superiority](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superior) of one culture would require ranking it according to a particular standard or quality. There is no consensus on which standard makes a culture superior in absolute terms.
1.2. Pro: Most great inventions and discoveries of our world were created by Western scientists.
1.2.1. Con: Many Westerners did not acknowledge the inventions and innovations from other cultures they suppressed.
1.2.1.1. Pro: African American slaves were [denied patents](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-history-month-inventions-black-slaves-denied-patents/) for their inventions, therefore denying them acknowledgment as the creators.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: African American is an identity and product of western culture, therefore, this claim does not provide much support.
1.2.1.2. Pro: There are many inventions, such as the [CatScan](https://www.sagoodnews.co.za/top-10-south-african-inventions/), that originate from cultures often unacknowledged by more dominate cultures.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: White South Africans are Western, just as much as the white populations of other colonial states like Australia or the USA, so the CT scan originated from Western culture.
1.2.2. Pro: [The scientific method](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/#HisRevAriMil) was cultivated in Western culture.
1.2.2.1. Con: [Other](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world) [cultures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method) were crucial in preserving and expanding the scientific method during the Middle Ages.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The scientific method places human beings in a position of [humility](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/nov/13/science-enforced-humility) in relation to knowledge. This contribution to our view of the world is highly valuable.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.psypost.org/2019/03/intellectually-humble-people-tend-to-possess-more-knowledge-study-finds-53409) found that being intellectually humble was associated with increased knowledge acquisition and intrinsic motivation to learn.
1.2.3. Pro: The [Industrial Revolution](https://www.history.com/topics/industrial-revolution), responsible for increasing the standard of living for the common person and many, was the product of western culture.
1.2.3.1. Con: The process of industrialisation cause [significant suffering](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2d68mn/revision/4)(Though great progress was made in industry and technology, living and working conditions remained poor and were a major cause of illness and disease.), especially for the urban poor.
1.2.4. Pro: The West is at the forefront of technological advancements and has been since the [renaissance](https://www.livescience.com/amp/55230-renaissance.html).
1.2.5. Con: Most great inventions and discoveries of our world were created in Asia and the Middle East.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The first [proto-cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-city) appeared in western Asia \(Anatolia, Çatalhöyük\) and Israel \(Tell es-Sultan/Jericho\)
1.2.5.2. Pro: [Crossbows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow#History) were first invented in China in 650 BC.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Many useful inventions used around the world originated in India.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: The first systematic [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar#History) was invented in India in 6th century BC.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Earliest production of [high carbon steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel#Wootz_steel_and_Damascus_steel) is in India.
1.2.5.4. Pro: The Middle East, once considered part of northern Africa, was home to many creations utilized today.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: [Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture#History) was first invented in Asia, in the Levantine region.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: The first [bricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudbrick#Ancient_world) appeared in Pakistan in 7500 BC, during the indus-valley civilization.
1.2.5.4.3. Pro: The first [Caesarean section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section#History) was documented in Iran 1000 BC.
1.2.5.4.4. Pro: [Plastic Surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery#History) is first documented in texts from Egypt circa 3000-2500 BC.
1.2.5.4.5. Pro: The first [writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing#Proto-writing) \(9000 BC, Mesopotamia, 7000 BC, China\) and alphabets \(1800 BC Egypt - Canaan\) appeared in the Middle East. Algebra, and solving mathematical problems with linear equations, quadratic equations, and indeterminate linear equations was first used by the Babylonians \(Iraq\) in 1800 BC.
1.2.5.5. Con: The advancements in the [sciences](https://www.britannica.com/science/physical-science/Islamic-and-medieval-science) in the Middle East were based on the work of the Greeks. Including [Aristotle's](http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H011) development of deductive reasoning and principles of logic.
1.2.5.5.1. Con: Greek contributions in [scientific](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5559-8_3) and [mathematical](https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics/Ancient-mathematical-sources#ref65969) were based on the work of other cultures, particularly the Babylonians, Persians and Egyptians.
1.2.5.5.1.1. Con: Greek philosophy is fundamentally different than the other philosophies of the Mediterranean and near east.
1.2.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Greek philosophy, uniquely](https://iep.utm.edu/greekphi/) among other ancient philosophies, sought completely to displace mythology by reason [\(logos\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos), investigation, and first principles \(the [arche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arche)\).
1.2.6. Con: What is considered a great invention is generally evaluated within the value system of Western culture, which inherently values the things it produces more than things produced in other cultures.
1.2.7. Con: The intelligence and inventiveness of someone is only partly defined by their culture; if they lived in another country, they probably would still have made the invention.
1.2.7.1. Con: The culture is critical to providing the correct opportunities to hone the talents
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Asian Americans as a group outperform other ethnicities due to their [culture](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8416) focusing on hard work and belief in education as a path to upward mobility.
1.2.7.1.2. Pro: Muslims created many works of calligraphy because of a combination of emphasis on [writing out Quranic words and disapproval of images of humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calligraphy).
1.2.7.2. Con: A culture is critical to recognize accomplishments independent of innate ability. The difference can be as wide as being celebrated as a role model and inspiring others to follow your path and having to flee from persecution.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: [Dr. Abdus Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam) \(Nobel Prize physics 1979\) was a Pakistani physicist who left Pakistan in 1974 after the sect he belonged to was declared non-Muslim and was [received threats in Pakisan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38238131). Showing that the cultural religious values suppressed his scientific contributions in Pakistan.
1.2.7.2.2. Pro: The US with its strong focus on high school sports frequently [fails to provide for scholastic achievement](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/10/the-case-against-high-school-sports/309447/) in favor of spending more time and money on sports.
1.2.8. Pro: Sir Isaac Newton, who [discovered](https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/isaac-newton-the-man-who-discovered-gravity/zh8792p) gravity and is widely regarded as a founding father of physics, was English.
1.2.9. Con: In some cases, the actual credits need to be tied to privileges. Not everyone got the same headstart.
1.2.10. Con: Many of the great Western inventions and discoveries would not have been possible had it not been for the contributions from other civilisations, particularly Islamic civilisation.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Modern technological marvels coming from the West heavily rely on Algebra, a branch of Mathematics having its [roots](http://new.math.uiuc.edu/im2008/rogers/algebra.html) in the Islamic civilization with al-Khwarizmi being widely held up as the Father of Algebra.
1.2.11. Pro: Western science was the cradle of technological innovation.
1.2.11.1. Pro: The great invention of our time, [the transistor](http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/), was invented in western civilization.
1.2.11.2. Pro: Westerners were the first people to fly to another celestial body, [the moon](https://www.history.com/topics/space-exploration/moon-landing-1969)(On July 20, 1969, American astronauts Neil Armstrong \(1930-2012\) and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin \(1930-\) became the first humans ever to land on the moon.). Arguably, one of the greatest scientific and technical efforts ever made.
1.2.11.3. Pro: The creator of the Internet, [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), is an English computer scientist.
1.2.11.4. Pro: Western culture developed the [aircraft](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-airplane-flies).
1.2.11.5. Con: The [Four Great Inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Great_Inventions) \(gunpowder, compasses, papermaking, printing\) are from China.
1.2.11.5.1. Con: The West capitalised on these inventions once they reached Europe in a way that China failed to do, for instance the European invention of the [flintlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintlock).
1.3. Pro: It is superior in an evolutionary sense in that it allowed the group to more easily compete with other cultures for resources.
1.3.1. Con: It was environmental factors rather than culture that made Western civilization prevail, according to [Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel).
1.3.2. Con: Western culture hasn't competed with other cultures, it has imposed Western culture through [cultural imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism).
1.4. Pro: Compared to other societies, life in Western societies includes a greater number of freedoms, rights, and opportunities.
1.4.1. Pro: Western societies offer their citizens various freedoms and rights.
1.4.1.1. Pro: More people have enjoyed more individual freedoms in western culture and civilization than any other culture.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Countries and nations heavily influenced with western culture were the firsts to abolish slavery.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Nations heavily influenced by western culture were the firsts to allow women to vote.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Religious tolerance and freedom is a trait of western culture.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The Human Freedom Index [rates](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/freest-countries/) Western countries as the most free. Meanwhile, non-Western nations like China, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia are considered not free.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The West allows this discussion to happen, whereas in eastern countries censorship is a big thing. Guaranteed freedom of speech is something the old world doesn’t have.
1.4.1.4. Con: The [Economist's Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) ranks numerous countries in Asia as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean as "full democracies". This shows that the freedoms and rights of fully-developed democracies are not exclusive to the West.
1.4.2. Pro: The Human Development Index [consistently rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) North America, Western Europe, and Oceania as the best places to live in.
1.4.2.1. Pro: These places have access to better education.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Health care is better in these Western countries/continent.
1.4.3. Con: The higher quality of life in western countries may be attributed to their exploitation of much of the rest of the world over the centuries.
1.4.3.1. Con: While this is coherent for economic components of quality of life, Westerners do not merely receive bread and circuses, but have their fundamental rights protected.
1.4.4. Con: While the Western world was busy fighting illness and finding new lands for survival, [Eastern countries](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/2000-years-economic-history-one-chart/) had more wealth on average than the West.
1.4.4.1. Con: Comparing the total wealth of regions with different populations is totally irrelevant to the "luxury" of the lives of the individual citizens.
1.4.4.2. Con: Until the industrial revolution - which began in the West - most people in all countries were subsistence farmers, with no realistic hope of a "luxurious life".
1.4.5. Pro: The United Nations considers Western countries to have the [happiest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report#2019_World_Happiness_Report) residents, with Northern European countries being at the top of the list.
1.4.5.1. Con: The term "considers" is highly subjective. The result of the research/study could be and would be different if it were conducted using another different standard to assess happiness. I.e.: "the higher the income, the more the happiness" would engender a different outcome than "the lower the divorce rates, the happier a country".
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Quality of life in a country can be objectively measured through happiness of residents, GDP per capita, quality of housing and food, etc.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: If mental health was considered a factor, results would show that in these countries, mental health issues and loneliness are on the [rise](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45308016) amongst young people.
1.4.5.2. Con: The World Happiness Report refers to these countries in the context of "[Nordic Exceptionalism](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/the-nordic-exceptionalism-what-explains-why-the-nordic-countries-are-constantly-among-the-happiest-in-the-world/)", implying that their high ranks in the report should not be interpreted as representative of Western culture.
1.4.5.3. Con: In the 2020 version of the World Happiness Report, several non-Western countries [appear in the top-25](https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20_Ch2_Statistical_Appendix.pdf)(p. 28), for example Costa Rica, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, and Taiwan. This implies that non-Western countries are not universally less happy.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Although outliers are worth noting, what matters are trends and averages. And [with an eye on those](https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20_Ch2_Statistical_Appendix.pdf)(p. 63), Western countries clearly best the rest of the world.
1.4.6. Con: Mental health disorders are [prevalent](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) in Western countries.
1.4.6.1. Con: Mental health problems are more readily expressed in developed western countries because people aren’t continuously fighting to survive. There are more cushy first world countries in the west that allow these subtle problems to become more prevalent.
1.4.6.2. Con: In most non-Western countries the government does not track the mental health of their people, so mental disorders could be far more endemic there without us ever knowing.
1.4.6.3. Con: Non-western countries resort to inhumane means when it comes to dealing with mentally ill people, and they face severe stigmatization.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: [In Indonesia](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-09-14/developing-countries-struggle-with-treating-mental-illness), diagnosed patients are chained and locked up like prisoners.
1.5. Pro: Western thinkers have given humanity great political, economical, and philosophical ideas.
1.5.1. Pro: The West has given us great political ideas like democracy and personal freedom.
1.5.1.1. Pro: New Zealand was the [first country](https://www.insider.com/when-women-around-the-world-got-the-right-to-vote-2019-2) to give women the right to vote, followed by other Western countries like Britain and the United States.
1.5.1.2. Con: US democracy was inspired by the [Iroquois Confederacy](https://www.pbs.org/native-america/blogs/native-voices/how-the-iroquois-great-law-of-peace-shaped-us-democracy/).
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: The [Great Law of Peace](https://www.pbs.org/native-america/blogs/native-voices/how-the-iroquois-great-law-of-peace-shaped-us-democracy/) united 5 native nations in the face of war. Its principles influenced the US Constitution after European settlers were introduced to it.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: US Democracy was rooted in British Parliamentary Democracy, Natural Law ideals of John Locke, and the Social Contract ideals of Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jaques Rousseau, and Roman republicanism.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: The Iroquois Confederacy served as inspiration only for some United States founders, not all Western democratic nations.
1.5.1.3. Con: Confucianism has had a great [influence](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ850819) on the Englightenment of Western Europe.
1.5.1.4. Pro: [Athenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Ancient_origins) established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508–507 BC.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: The term "[democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Ancient_origins)" first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of Athens.
1.5.2. Con: Many Westerners seek happiness in their lives by following Classical Eastern philosophies, such as [Taoism](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-006-9037-y).
1.5.2.1. Con: It can be seen as a strength of liberal Western culture to openly accept and benefit from the ideologies of other cultures.
1.5.3. Con: The major and dominant religions that shape the lives of billions of people around the world were created in the Middle or Far East.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The large [monotheistic religions](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/mideast/themes/religion/index.html) \(Judaism, Christianity, Islam, [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism), [Atenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenism)\) arose in the Middle East.
1.5.3.2. Con: Without the help of the [Roman Empire](https://aeon.co/essays/how-an-obscure-oriental-cult-converted-a-vast-pagan-roman-empire), Christianity, which had been an insignificant obscure oriental cult, would have never become the successful religion it is today.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Christianity did not thrive with the help of the Roman Empire but in spite of it. The Roman [massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire) of Christians did not significantly prevent the total dominance of that insignificant obscure cult across the whole of the Roman Empire and beyond.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: The Romans made [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_church_of_the_Roman_Empire) the empire's state church and significantly fostered it thereby, in particular, in Europe.
1.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [The Europeans](https://www.bl.uk/sacred-texts/articles/spreading-the-word-the-missionary-expansion-of-christianity#) spread Christianity over large parts of the world.
1.5.3.2.1.2. Con: Without the Romans, there would not be a Roman Catholic Church.
1.5.4. Pro: The economic world is shaped by Western ideas.
1.5.4.1. Con: This is an outcome of Western dominance through colonial empires and better economic advantages that facilitated wealth accumulation than superior Western culture per se.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Capitalism and the free market economy are Western ideas.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Capitalism is morally questionable.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: Many atrocious historical events, inducing [genocides](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/26/communists-capitalism-stalinism-economic-model)(The Great Depression – still the most severe crisis of capitalism – helped to create the conditions of popular discontent that led to the rise of the Nazis. In the early period of Hitler’s regime, big business, fearful of the power of the German left, made its grubby compromises with National Socialism, seeing the Nazis as a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon both communism and trade unionism. German businesses made huge donations to the Nazis both before and after their rise to power, the industrial conglomerate IG Farben and Krupp among them. Many businesses profited from Nazi slave labour and the Holocaust, including IBM, BMW, Deutsche Bank and the Schaeffler group.) and [slavery](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/26/communists-capitalism-stalinism-economic-model)(Capitalism was built on the bodies of millions from the very start. From the late 17th century onwards, the transatlantic slave trade became a pillar of emergent capitalism. Much of the wealth of London, Bristol and Liverpool – once the largest slave trading port in Europe – was made from the enslaved labour of Africans. The capital accumulated from slavery – from tobacco, cotton and sugar – drove the industrial revolution in Manchester and Lancashire; and several banks today can trace their origins to profits made from slavery.) have been elected as the most efficient outcome through capitalist decision-making.
1.5.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Unbridled capitalism tends to lead to [social entropy](http://web.missouri.edu/~ikerdj/papers/Eastern%20Oregon-%20Econ%20Hunger.htm) where the rich consolidate their wealth at the expense of the poor, sometimes even creating man-made humanitarian disasters.
1.5.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Capitalism is partly responsible for dispossessing many farmers of their land and livelihood due to droughts caused by the [privatization of water](https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-change-chile-farming/).
1.5.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: A farm is a business like any other; that inefficient businesses are outcompeted is the virtue of capitalism, regardless of if it is unpleasant to be the proprietor of a business being outcompeted.
1.5.4.2.1.1.2.2. Con: [Climate change and weather extremes](https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-change-chile-farming/) are the more important factor in the plight of the farmers than capitalism.
1.5.4.2.1.2. Con: It is not capitalism in itself that is morally questionable, but how people use it. Capitalism cannot give you answers as to whether something is morally right or not.
1.5.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Capitalism has generated extremely good outcomes.
1.5.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Over the last two decades, capitalism and free markets have taken more than [one billion](http://The efficiency and effectivity of capitalism have taken one billion people out of extreme poverty in the last 20 years \(2013\).") people out of extreme poverty.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: Even though capitalism and free-market ideas originate from Western culture, they are not practised in most Western countries.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: Government-funded bail-outs are in direct contrast to free-market ideals. Free-marks would allow for the freedom to fail just as much as the freedom to set your own process based on market demand.
1.5.4.2.2.2. Pro: Public education which is supported by all major parties is a socialist ideal.
1.5.4.2.2.3. Pro: Transportation in USA is funded by state and federal government which does not follow free-market demands.
1.5.4.2.2.4. Pro: The US postal service services [all US addresses](https://about.usps.com/who/profile/) which is in [spite of free-market demands](https://facts.usps.com/size-and-scope/#fact600).
1.5.4.2.2.5. Pro: Tariffs are government intervention in the free-market. This is true even if you argue that tariffs protect the free market from price-fixing of other nations.
1.5.4.2.2.6. Con: It can be argued that the economies of Western societies are based on free markets and capitalism with adjustments to offset the disadvantages of this system \([social capitalism](https://www.socialcapitalresearch.com/what-is-social-capitalism-2/)\).
1.5.4.2.2.7. Con: The libertarian ideals that would entail a "true" free market in this regard are not practised anywhere, and even the ideals themselves are primarily an [American phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_in_the_United_States) and less common elsewhere.
1.5.4.2.2.8. Con: The fact that these ideas are currently not practiced in their pure form does not disprove the fact that these ideas originated in the West.
1.5.4.2.3. Con: The free-market economy dates back at least 4,000 years to the [Middle East](https://capx.co/capitalisms-roots-are-in-iraq-and-syria-not-the-pages-of-adam-smith/).
1.5.4.2.4. Pro: The Scotsman [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) is widely accepted as the "The Father of Economics'' or ''The Father of Capitalism."
1.5.4.2.4.1. Con: Just because someone is accepted a something does not make it true.
1.5.4.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.3.
1.5.4.2.4.3. Con: Adam Smith's the Wealth of Nations was published in the late 18th century. It is absurd to think that world economics \(as a living reality\) began then, rather than the systematic study of it.
1.5.5. Pro: Advancements in [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-greek/) in the Middle East were based on the work of the Greeks, including [Aristotle's](http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H011) development of deductive reasoning and principles of logic.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Greek contributions in [philosophical](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/presocratics/) fields were based on the work of other cultures, particularly the Babylonians, Persians and Egyptians.
1.5.6. Con: This is self-fulfilling. We think that Western ideas are great, because they are the ones that get most promoted within a Western-dominated global society. If China had colonized the world, then we would be talking about how Chinese philosophers were the greatest in history.
1.5.6.1. Con: The original mentioned thinkers, not only philosophers. One can argue that if Chinese thinkers were the greatest in history, China would have colonized the world.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: It is more likely that [geography](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11721671) - not thinkers - dictated which regions came to dominate.
1.6. Con: Western culture is ill-defined such that it cannot be meaningfully asserted to be superior to others.
1.6.1. Con: [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture) is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artefacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with Europe.
1.6.1.1. Con: From [the article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture#Terminology) linked in the parent: "The West as a geographical area is unclear and undefined" \[...\] "There is some disagreement about what nations should or should not be included in the category and at what times" \[...\] "It is difficult to determine which individuals fit into which category and the East–West contrast is sometimes criticized as relativistic and arbitrary."
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Like in all definable things, there are areas that are not exactly clear in the extremities. This is not enough to render the term impractical. There is overwhelming data enough to practically define and use Western culture.
1.6.2. Pro: One [possible distinction](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/) that may be made is between Western culture, and discoveries that could have been reached by any culture that had the technological lead. Western Culture "summoned an alien entity from beyond the void which devoured its summoner and is proceeding to eat the rest of the world".
1.6.3. Con: With recorded history, western culture is defined well enough and can be distinguishable apart from other cultures. Therefore we can in some way measure it against other cultures. [Western culture on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture)
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.7. Con: Western civilization has exploited and devastated nature like no other culture before.
1.7.1. Con: This is not only the case in Western culture. In essence, people have effectively harmed nature since they formed the first groups and societies.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Every time modern humans set foot on a new continent, [waves of extinctions](https://globalnews.ca/news/4610304/human-species-wildlife-extinction-wwf/) followed.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: [Homo sapiens](https://globalnews.ca/news/4610304/human-species-wildlife-extinction-wwf/) were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals, along with numerous megafauna \(large animals\).
1.7.1.2. Pro: [China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/07/01/china-emits-more-carbon-dioxide-than-the-u-s-and-eu-combined/#27daf552628c) is generally seen as the world's biggest single polluter.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: One could argue that China has become the biggest polluter because it has started to follow western economic models.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: [Per capita](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/us-plastic-pollution), China is not even in the top ten of the world's plastic waste producers.
1.7.2. Con: This isn't consistent across the board. [Canada](https://priceonomics.com/which-countries-destroy-the-environment-the-most/), a western country, is considered one of the most environmentally-responsible countries.
1.7.2.1. Con: Canada has the [highest total waste generation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090716/5-countries-produce-most-waste.asp)(Canada's estimated total waste generation is the largest in the entire world. It has an estimated annual waste total is 1,325,480,289 metric tons. Given Canada's population of 36.7 million, that's an estimated annual waste per capita of 36.1 metric tons.) of any other country.
1.7.3. Con: Harming nature does not render western culture any less superior to other cultures.
1.7.4. Con: Of the [top 10 CO2 emitters](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271748/the-largest-emitters-of-co2-in-the-world/), only 2 are considered Western nations \(Russia is debateable\), and there are no Western countries in the [top 10 ocean polluters](https://www.plasticethics.com/home/2019/3/17/the-countries-polluting-the-oceans-the-most-with-plastic-waste).
1.7.5. Pro: Many Western inventions have harmful effects on the environment.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Western culture developed the [car](https://www.tuev-nord.de/explore/en/remembers/a-brief-history-of-the-internal-combustion-engine/), roads and pollution are destroying the planet.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Western culture developed [plastic](https://www.sciencehistory.org/the-history-and-future-of-plastics).
1.7.5.3. Pro: [Tin mining](https://theconversation.com/three-ways-making-a-smartphone-can-harm-the-environment-102148) for cellphones, laptops, and tablets is responsible for deforestation and ecosystem destruction.
1.7.6. Pro: Western countries are responsible for most of the world's [plastic waste](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/11/11/which-two-countries-produce-the-most-plastic-trash-per-person/), much of which ends up polluting land, rivers, and oceans.
1.7.6.1. Pro: The [United States](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/us-plastic-pollution) is by far the biggest contributor to plastic waste in the world.
1.7.7. Con: The environmentalist movement, the ideological prerequisite for complaining about Western culture on this basis, [began in the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement#History).
1.8. Pro: Most great art and literature was created by Western artists and writers.
1.8.1. Con: What’s considered good art entirely depends on what you’ve been exposed to and your cultures taste. Westerners have a taste for westerns art, etc.
1.8.2. Con: The Epic of [Gilgamesh](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Epic-of-Gilgamesh), considered the oldest surviving great literary text, was written in Mesopotamia.
1.8.3. Pro: Most of history's greatest artists, such as [van Gogh](https://www.vangoghgallery.com/misc/biography.html)(Vincent van Gogh, one of the most well-known post-impressionist artists, for whom color was the chief symbol of expression, was born in Groot-Zundert, Holland on March 30, 1853.), [Picasso](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pablo-Picasso)(Pablo Picasso \[...\] \(born October 25, 1881, Málaga, Spain—died April 8, 1973, Mougins, France\), Spanish expatriate painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and stage designer, one of the greatest and most-influential artists of the 20th century and the creator \(with Georges Braque\) of Cubism.), [da Vinci](https://www.biography.com/artist/leonardo-da-vinci)(Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance artist and engineer, known for paintings like "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa,” and for inventions like a flying machine \[...\] Da Vinci was born in a farmhouse outside the village of Anchiano in Tuscany, Italy \(about 18 miles west of Florence\) on April 15, 1452.), [Rembrandt](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rmbt/hd_rmbt.htm)(A prolific painter, draftsman, and etcher, Rembrandt van Rijn is usually regarded as the greatest artist of Holland’s “Golden Age.” He worked first in his native Leiden and, from 1632 onward, in Amsterdam, where he had studied briefly \(ca. 1624\) with the influential history painter Pieter Lastman.), [Monet](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/claude-monet)(Monet was the leading French Impressionist landscape painter. Like Camille Pissarro and Charles-François Daubigny, Monet moved to London during the Franco-Prussian war \(1870-1\). After his return to France he lived at Argenteuil \(1871-8\)), [Michelangelo](https://www.biography.com/artist/michelangelo)(Michelangelo Buonarroti was a painter, sculptor, architect and poet widely considered one of the most brilliant artists of the Italian Renaissance. Michelangelo was an apprentice to a painter before studying in the sculpture gardens of the powerful Medici family. \n\nWhat followed was a remarkable career as an artist, famed in his own time for his artistic virtuosity. Although he always considered himself a Florentine, Michelangelo lived most of his life in Rome, where he died at age 88.) were born in Western countries.
1.8.3.1. Con: These artists in wealthier nations gained prominence because there were educational institutions that gave the platform to develop their craft. Similar artists in other parts of the world may have similar or even better talent but were denied the opportunity to explore and excel in arts.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: The culture, not the people, is arguably superior, because it allows people to develop their craft and their talent.
1.8.4. Pro: [William Shakespeare](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shakespeare)(William Shakespeare, Shakespeare also spelled Shakspere, byname Bard of Avon or Swan of Avon, \(baptized April 26, 1564, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England—died April 23, 1616, Stratford-upon-Avon\), English poet, dramatist, and actor often called the English national poet and considered by many to be the greatest dramatist of all time.), who is widely regarded as the greatest playwright of all time, was from a Western country \(England\).
1.8.5. Con: Many pieces of art and artefacts in Western culture were pillaged from other cultures.
1.8.5.1. Con: If being a superior culture includes being superior at pillaging and assimilating things from inferior cultures, then this is not a point against Western culture.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Superiority can also include moral superiority and values - something that pillaging contradicts.
1.8.5.1.1.1. Con: Being good at something and having a tendency to do the thing are distinct things. A superior culture may be both better at pillaging, and less inclined to do so given the opportunity.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Many [museums](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45406557) in Europe display looted treasures from Africa, that hold significant meaning in their culture.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: These artifacts do not hold significant meaning in Western culture, except as a symbol of its colonial past that Westerners have political arguments about, so they do not make up a large proportion of the objects in Western culture.
1.8.5.3. Con: All cultures have at one point or another "stolen" artwork, ideas, and technology from other cultures. This phenomenon isn't exclusive to the West.
1.8.5.3.1. Con: Just because multiple other cultures have stolen ideas etc., does not mean it should be seen as a standard trait of "superior" culture.
1.8.5.3.1.1. Con: It’s not multiple have, it’s that every single culture has taken something from another. Originality doesn’t really exists in modern cultures.
1.8.5.3.1.2. Con: But if it is common to most if not all cultures, it can't be considered a point against the superiority of the culture
1.8.5.4. Con: Successful cultures can be considered a hub where highly diverse ideas of various other cultures naturally come together and are further developed.
1.8.6. Con: The world's first novel, [The Tale of Genji](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Tale-of-Genji), was written by a Japanese woman, Murasaki Shikibu.
1.8.7. Con: Any evaluation of what constitutes "great art" is subject to [cultural bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_bias).
1.8.7.1. Pro: Though western civilization may have been the breeding grounds for innovations in art producing technologies, "great art" can not be measure objectively or be objectively concluded without subjective bias.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Since what is considered 'great art' was defined and created by Westerners, a fair assessment of other existing art cannot be given.
1.8.8. Con: New technology creates new artistic mediums and propels new artistic movements \(e.g. photography creating photographers and posing challenges to painters\), and many become "greats" by pioneering in such areas. As such, Western artistic achievement may be attributed to the technological advantage of Western countries and not to anything in Western culture that promotes artistic achievement.
