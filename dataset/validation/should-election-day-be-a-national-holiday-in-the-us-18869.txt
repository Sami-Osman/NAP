Discussion Name: Should Election Day be a National Holiday in the U.S?

1. Election Day Should be a National Holiday in the U.S.
1.1. Pro: Making election day a holiday would improve the ability of the government to conduct elections.
1.1.1. Pro: People would be more likely to volunteer to assist in election administration if they had the day off.
1.1.1.1. Pro: People can [volunteer](https://www.pointsoflight.org/blog/3-ways-volunteer-election-day/) to become an election worker and provide valuable assistance to voters, helping with location logistics and supervising voting.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Election volunteers are [vital](https://www.eac.gov/voters/become-a-poll-worker/) for ensuring that elections operate smoothly and fairly.
1.1.1.2. Pro: In a [2016 survey](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/10/22/few-people-want-to-be-poll-workers-and-thats-a-problem), the US Election Assistance Commission found that two-thirds of jurisdictions had a hard time recruiting enough poll workers.
1.1.1.3. Pro: [Currently](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/10/22/few-people-want-to-be-poll-workers-and-thats-a-problem) most poll workers are retirees because they are the only people who have free time on a Tuesday. If others had a mandatory holiday they would be more likely to volunteer.
1.1.1.4. Con: Many states require volunteers to have [training](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/10/22/few-people-want-to-be-poll-workers-and-thats-a-problem) before the election, which would likely still be a significant disincentive to people who have jobs.
1.1.2. Pro: Media coverage is likely to increase as a result of election day being made a national holiday.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Pollsters](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/opinion/the-importance-of-polling.html), who help citizens and countries prepare for the future and help governments decide [public policies](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-4-are-opinion-polls-useful-\(1946\)/is-it-important-to-know-public-opinion), are deeply dependent on media coverage. Media coverage is likely to increase if election day is a national holiday.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Greater media coverage is likely to increase the transparency of the electoral process and better inform the voters of any issues that may occur during the day. A better informed public, in turn, is more likely to pressure the government to correct these problems.
1.1.2.3. Pro: There are a number of issues plaguing the electoral process that do not receive adequate attention. Increased media coverage of an event, especially a social one, can help create the pressure and will to do something to rectify the issue.
1.1.2.4. Con: There is already sufficient media coverage as a result of the significant viewing of news on election day.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: More than [36 million](https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/nielsen-36m-viewers-tuned-into-midterm-elections) viewers tuned in to the Midterm Election Coverage in 2014.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: [71 million](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/71-million-viewers-tuned-in-to-2016-election-coverage-during-primetime/) viewers tuned in to the coverage of the 2016 elections.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: The amount of viewership [impacts](https://watermark.silverchair.com/jhumcom0436.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAj8wggI7BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIsMIICKAIBADCCAiEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM0P3vMWl7M1iWXONkAgEQgIIB8h8gN9TKLjdR8g9WnWQZ7TulwjfOThholAkuLoIJds0EYmAxB7c-4msPPGVC0nsnaMdkzpiYsOQLqWyEidiZnHLrHbglKq4ROOj9d9pqBXczKBsqu28oMtCQqj9GM3ZUQvJKsfW3O05dvjaNlBcD-mGko7Y7M0nCK6SBzAd6V-1QH_nvL38s0ZRvTZ8m6Z7e4ftksXSnwKPKn3n7O7jctYI1yoGJNO_7yUmFiIVvHFLoSNIntmQyjg9_cS0inuClRiL3pjHGAQ4mszbuyZ0S1_zJfcwl1gWbHaXqseC4hjWwJ6-WbFToUhOLUC4v8ccRr7ZJYJoD0YaJqceEy0Ly_LMe-oKn6hsKp4IIwvKl4hdwcfaJKiydUo5J_aIjgKg9wLh9eNIOACxcnX2sHomcyfkcYXbP6drQDYx5Ne66KW4M9kbtWDl2Urr9B-1UfTEX6Qdeu3kfLqNH4NOmtfjPpJaQvVNwBQMbuyjXTWb9kulnP-QG2RfNPohSN04Ku4K0WQvgsakv2RIYNzWMDdCBQsSEOUI96iKmZaD0UlhnKIW5qSc_VjKt6N4GlIcLHHQpAjY5nLmgUH95K14uOd_yFkZI9U1-wrJgrGMabZYAxCZ7hepRhsTTaP5ZTm4XahtzN2HfifolLDYMo9pw7jXeRLP6og) the degree of coverage an event receives \(p. 436\).
1.1.2.5. Con: The media coverage would likely focus on unimportant things such as the celebrations, which distracts from the real democratic importance of the elections.
1.1.2.6. Pro: On a national holiday all other business and government activity stops. Therefore the election will likely be the only source of domestic news.
1.1.2.7. Pro: The number of viewers is likely to increase when there's more varied and interesting news. Media coverage responds to interest levels and will subsequently also increase.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Currently, news coverage on the day of the elections is usually [restricted](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48124106) to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather.
1.1.3. Con: The money spent on making election day a national holiday could be diverted to fixing the technical issues that mar election day.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Organizing the kind of events that would create such a "spirit" will cost significant time and money.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In 2019, Washington's military celebrations for July Fourth cost at least [$1.2 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-military/trumps-july-fourth-celebration-cost-military-at-least-1-2-million-pentagon-idUSKCN1U42MW).
1.1.3.1.2. Con: A study that conducted "festivals" similar to the ones that would be in place under this model found that the program spent approximately US$28 on each additional person who voted. This seems to be a reasonable price to pay for increasing the number of voters.
1.1.3.2. Pro: There are a number of [machine breakdowns](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/national-politics/long-lines-machine-breakdowns-mar-vote-on-election-day/) on election day.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Many of the machines are over [15](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/01/texas-straight-ticket-voting-problems-old-machines/) years old.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Many of the machines have [calibration issues](https://www.wbtw.com/news/grand-strand/horry-county-officials-working-to-prevent-voting-issues/).
1.1.3.3. Pro: There are [too few](https://www.apnews.com/6fb6de6fdb034b889d301efd12602e21) voting machines and ballots available to voters on election day. Increasing the number of voters without fixing this problem will overburden an already burdened system.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Hundreds of millions of dollars [are lost](http://www.pinedaleonline.com/news/2011/09/Federalpaidholidaysc.htm) as a result of federal paid holidays.
1.1.4. Con: Time and attention that is currently focused on setting up voting booths and actually voting will be diverted to planning and organizing the celebrations.
1.1.5. Con: Making election day a holiday is likely to provide businesses and lobbies with the most effective way to obtain votes for the candidates that they are supporting \(by setting up and participating in different kinds of celebrations that can be used as platforms for advertising\), which will disrupt [election silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_silence).
1.1.5.1. Pro: Efforts that are currently being made to [regulate](https://www.osce.org/mission-to-montenegro/346631?download=true) political advertising and media campaigning during the preelection period are likely to be more difficult to determine when celebrations, particularly any by the government, are being conducted \(p. 6\).
1.1.6. Pro: Making election day a holiday would reduce wait times at the polls.
1.1.6.1. Pro: It is estimated that [500,000](https://www.propublica.org/article/these-voters-had-to-wait-for-hours-it-felt-like-a-type-of-disenfranchisement) eligible voters didn't cast a ballot in 2012 because of long wait times.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Voters who have to wait a long time to vote are less likely to vote in [future elections](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7eis5yychwgqstw/pettigrew%20-%20lines%20and%20turnout.pdf?dl=0) \(p. 1\).
1.1.6.3. Pro: People who waited a long time to vote were less confident that their vote [counted](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/110798/Waiting%20to%20vote.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) \(p. 48\).
1.1.6.4. Pro: Rather than rush before or after work, people can vote at all hours of the day, spreading out the electorate.
1.1.6.5. Con: There are still likely to be long lines at peak times which are convenient for the individual.
1.1.6.6. Con: The effect on wait times is unpredictable and if the amount of voters increases to a vast degree, it could still result in long lines.
1.1.6.6.1. Pro: If more people are able to vote on Election Day, more people will probably show up to the polls to vote, increasing the size of lines.
1.1.6.6.2. Con: This could be solved by investing in a greater amount of 'voting space.'
1.2. Pro: More people would vote if Election Day was a national holiday.
1.2.1. Pro: A national holiday can create a spirit of celebration and duty that may increase the likelihood of citizens voting.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Marginal voters [need](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2010%20-%20Burden.pdf) all the encouragement possible to get them to vote \(p. 23\).
1.2.1.2. Pro: Researchers organized Election Day festivals to evaluate how a more festive and social voting atmosphere might impact voter turnout. Voting rates were [significantly higher](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/effect-election-day-festivals-voter-turnout-united-states) in precincts where festivals occurred than in comparison precincts. This could occur on a much larger scale if Election Day was declared a holiday.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The precincts with voter turnout of [50 percent](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/effect-election-day-festivals-voter-turnout-united-states)—turnout typical in major US elections—holding an election festival would increase turnout by 6.5 percentage points. In precincts with a 10 percent voter turnout—typical turnout in precincts for the evaluation—election festivals are expected to increase turnout by 2.6 percentage points.
1.2.1.3. Pro: The reason [underlying](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=301002120071066114073126071101101105032027023067011038006025013072079078068030103101021018111115103010043007029082106122101088098074087007053117100112005102003073091026021066068114022091070094071001010110003028019030064027010104090090006006084117069089&EXT=pdf) the failure of a number of accommodations \(such as early voting, Same Day Registration etc\) is a loss of the "civic day of election". This is a result of a dilution of the importance of election day as a result of the spreading out of media coverage and celebrations \(p. 8\). A national holiday would reinforce the importance of the election day.
1.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.2.1.5. Con: Instituting a national holiday will cost the country significantly in terms of lost productivity.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: In the UK each national holiday costs the country [£2.3 billion](http://www.biz-works.net/index.php5?SID&fl=y&pgid=bp&art=882&st=the-cost-of-public-holidaysn&pgid=bp&art=882&st=the-cost-of-public-holidays) in lost productivity.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: National holidays mean that employees in [productive](http://www.biz-works.net/index.php5?SID&fl=y&pgid=bp&art=882&st=the-cost-of-public-holidaysn&pgid=bp&art=882&st=the-cost-of-public-holidays) sectors such as office jobs, factories and building sites do not go to work.
1.2.1.5.3. Pro: In 2011 it was estimated that each federal holiday costs about [$450 million](https://www.today.com/money/another-day-enough-already-6C9678118) in pay for federal employees and lost productivity.
1.2.1.5.4. Con: Lost productivity is an acceptable price to pay if it ensures that more people are able to exercise their right to vote.
1.2.1.5.5. Pro: Increased productivity comes with a number of benefits that will be lost if election day is made a national holiday.
1.2.1.5.5.1. Pro: Increased productivity results in [increased wages](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-benefits-of-increased-productivity-growth-for-workers/) for workers.
1.2.1.5.5.2. Pro: High productivity also attracts [foreign investment](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-benefits-of-increased-productivity-growth-for-workers/), which creates more jobs for workers.
1.2.1.6. Pro: Many less important events are already national holidays.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: [President's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%27s_Birthday) is a national holiday which celebrates former US Presidents. This holiday seems too broad to have any real significance for the public other than having a day off.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: [Columbus Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day#Non-observance) celebrates Christopher Columbus' discovery of America. This is not as important because Columbus was [not even the first](https://www.voanews.com/usa/real-story-who-discovered-america) to discover America.
1.2.1.6.3. Con: While this may be true, adding yet another public holiday will likely disrupt businesses and [hurt](https://www.philstar.com/business/2015/10/20/1512966/excessive-public-holidays-hurt-economy-and-financial-system) the economy.
1.2.1.6.3.1. Con: When [Ohio](https://qz.com/1546769/an-ohio-city-did-what-the-us-should-do-make-election-day-a-day-off-work/) made election day a national holiday, in order to make up for the lost work day, the city got rid of Columbus Day. Following this example would deal with the issue of too many public holidays.
1.2.1.6.4. Con: The US has [11 federal holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States). In comparison to other countries, this is not very many public holidays. This means that the country only celebrates things that are deemed sufficiently important.
1.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: India has [18](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-have-the-most-bank-holidays/) national holidays.
1.2.1.6.4.2. Pro: Colombia has [18](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-have-the-most-bank-holidays/) national holidays.
1.2.1.6.4.3. Pro: Japan has [16](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-have-the-most-bank-holidays/) national holidays.
1.2.1.6.4.4. Con: The United Kingdom has only [8](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-have-the-most-bank-holidays/) public holidays.
1.2.1.6.4.5. Con: Germany has only [9](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-have-the-most-bank-holidays/) public holidays.
1.2.2. Con: The problem isn't the inability to participate in voting, it's the willingness to vote.
1.2.2.1. Con: Being too busy or having a conflicting schedule is one of the most [common reasons](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/P20-582.pdf) cited for not voting \(p. 14\).
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: In 2014, [35%](https://www.marketplace.org/2016/11/02/why-election-day-isn-t-federal-holiday/) of registered voters decided not to vote because of work or school conflicts.
1.2.2.2. Pro: There are many opportunities for people to vote, even if they can't vote on election day.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: [37 states](https://www.insidesources.com/counterpoint-should-election-day-be-a-holiday-no-way/) have early voting meaning that people can vote before election day.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: A [study](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=301002120071066114073126071101101105032027023067011038006025013072079078068030103101021018111115103010043007029082106122101088098074087007053117100112005102003073091026021066068114022091070094071001010110003028019030064027010104090090006006084117069089&EXT=pdf) found that early voting is associated with lower voter turnout because it reduces the importance of election day itself which results in lower net turnout \(p. 2\)
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: [Hawaii](https://www.simplicityhr.com/employment-law/employees-voting-rights/) requires that everyone get a two-hour break to vote unless their schedule allows them at least "two consecutive hours between the opening and closing of the polls during which they are not scheduled to be at work."
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Making voting easier [does not](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=301002120071066114073126071101101105032027023067011038006025013072079078068030103101021018111115103010043007029082106122101088098074087007053117100112005102003073091026021066068114022091070094071001010110003028019030064027010104090090006006084117069089&EXT=pdf) increase overall voter turnout. When a number of reforms were analysed in conjunction, it was found that the negative impact on voter turnout was only partially offset \(p. 27\).
1.2.2.2.4. Pro: Most states have a method for voters to cast a vote via mail. In [11 states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx), the voter must provide an excuse in order to cast an absentee ballot.
1.2.2.2.4.1. Pro: Any citizen in [28 states](https://ballotpedia.org/Absentee_voting) and the District of Columbia can cast an absentee ballot.
1.2.2.2.4.2. Con: Voters must request a mail ballot ahead of time, requiring more planning. Voting on the day doesn't have that requirement.
1.2.2.2.4.3. Con: Voting by mail isn't well publicized.
1.2.2.2.4.4. Pro: Other measures, such as voting over the internet, could also be options for the electorate in the future.
1.2.2.2.4.5. Con: Not everyone can vote by mail.
1.2.2.2.4.5.1. Pro: Not every state has an established system for [mail-in voting](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx).
1.2.2.3. Pro: A [study](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=plYRx0sFT-cC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=weekend+voting+turnout&source=bl&ots=piiIVZxPji&sig=PI3sZNyCFpjvIwpJplEDluLyiDY&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=weekend%20voting%20turnout&f=false) found that when countries adopt weekend voting, voter turnout does not either increase or decrease. This demonstrates that, on its own, making voting more accessible doesn't solve the issue.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Research on young voters found that nearly [20%](https://ysa.org/4-reasons-young-people-dont-vote-and-what-to-do-about-it/) of young people said they don't think they know enough to be able to vote.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Many young people [don't vote](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote) because they think that their vote doesn't matter or because they think the system is corrupt.
1.2.2.6. Con: By reducing the time investment to vote, the willingness would likely increase.
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: It would open up more transportation options for people to get to the polls because they'd have more free time to get there.
1.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: People who take public transportation require more time to get around. Knowing they can take that time will make public transportation a feasible way to get to the polls.
1.2.2.6.1.2. Con: It could also increase traffic at difficult times as people change how the choose to vote.
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: More than [two-thirds](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/democrats-want-to-make-election-day-a-national-holidayheres-why.html) of Americans polled have said they would support making Election Day a National Holiday.
1.2.3. Con: There are a number of alternative ways to increase voter turnout.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Current accommodations can be strengthened and applied consistently throughout the United States.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Oregon is the first state to legalize automatic voter registration, which has been shown to increase turnout by at least [3%](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oregons-new-automatic-voter-registration-is-unlikely-to-have-a-big-effect/) and as much as 13%. This policy could be extended to the rest of the country.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: This amounts to an estimated increase of [50 million](https://business.rice.edu/wisdom/features/innovators-are-finding-new-ways-encourage-people-vote-will-it-work) voters.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Allowing voters to participate through innovative “[Democracy Voucher](http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/faqs#What%20are%20Democracy%20Vouchers?)” public financing programs, like the one in Seattle, could foster [engagement](https://business.rice.edu/wisdom/features/innovators-are-finding-new-ways-encourage-people-vote-will-it-work).
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Voters are [more likely](https://business.rice.edu/wisdom/features/innovators-are-finding-new-ways-encourage-people-vote-will-it-work) to research candidates when they need to decide who to financially support.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Only [3.3](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/5/17058970/seattle-democracy-vouchers) percent of Seattle residents who received democracy vouchers actually used them.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: Making election day a holiday would be easier than enforcing any of these reforms.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Early Day Registration, on its own, [increases](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=301002120071066114073126071101101105032027023067011038006025013072079078068030103101021018111115103010043007029082106122101088098074087007053117100112005102003073091026021066068114022091070094071001010110003028019030064027010104090090006006084117069089&EXT=pdf) voter turnout \(p. 17\).
1.2.3.3. Pro: Combining Early Day Registration with early voting has a [significant and positive impact](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=301002120071066114073126071101101105032027023067011038006025013072079078068030103101021018111115103010043007029082106122101088098074087007053117100112005102003073091026021066068114022091070094071001010110003028019030064027010104090090006006084117069089&EXT=pdf) on voter turnout \(p. 17\).
1.2.3.4. Con: There is no reason that election day can't be made a holiday alongside these reforms.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Eliminating ex-offender disenfranchisement laws would bring more than [6 million](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/6-million-lost-voters-state-level-estimates-felony-disenfranchisement-2016/) new voters into the electorate.
1.2.3.6. Pro: [Investing](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/) in integrated voter engagement \(IVE\) and outreach could increase voter turnout.
1.2.3.6.1. Pro: From 2012 to 2016, the IVE group Emgage, saw a [17.2](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/) percent increase in participation among Muslim American voters.
1.2.3.7. Pro: Socio-economic factors influencing participation in elections need to be addressed to increase [voter turnout](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/paid-time-off-to-vote_l_5ef0eb5dc5b6feb2478ab5a8). Merely declaring a national holiday will not influence this trend substantially.
1.2.3.8. Pro: There would be absolutely no need for a national holiday if we had absentee ballots and early voting in all 50 states and possessions.
1.2.3.8.1. Pro: In the 2020 elections, a large number of voters have chosen to vote through post. Increased access to [postal voting](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html) is a way to increase voter turnout without requiring election day holiday.
1.2.3.8.1.1. Pro: Measures put in place to expand [postal ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting_in_the_2020_United_States_elections) during the coronavirus pandemic are likely to remain and therefore help in instituting this option for the long term.
1.2.3.8.2. Con: Making Election Day a holiday would create a better opportunity for people to vote in person while minimizing the need for absentee ballots.
1.2.4. Con: People might spend the holiday on trips or events thereby making it more difficult to vote.
1.2.4.1. Con: Election Day falls on a Tuesday, making it less likely that people would actually go on vacation than if it were to connect with a weekend.
1.2.5. Pro: According to a survey, creating a national holiday for Election Day would increase voter turnout by about [16%](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303313297_The_Effect_of_Making_Election_Day_a_Holiday_An_Original_Survey_and_a_Case_Study_of_French_Presidential_Elections_Applied_to_the_US_Voting_System) in the US \(p. 1\).
1.2.6. Con: Many Americans [say](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/upshot/what-if-everyone-voted.html) that it shouldn’t be easy to vote.
1.2.6.1. Pro: [63%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/upshot/what-if-everyone-voted.html) of Republicans said citizens should have to prove they want to vote by registering ahead of time.
1.2.6.2. Con: [84%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/upshot/what-if-everyone-voted.html) of Democrats said voting should be made as easy as possible.
1.2.7. Con: The government must be a neutral body. This policy [disproportionately](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/call-hr-1-what-it-is-the-democrat-politician-protection-act/2019/01/17/dcc957be-19cb-11e9-9ebf-c5fed1b7a081_story.html?noredirect=on) benefits the Democrats.
1.2.7.1. Con: That a policy results in greater benefit to one party than another does make the policy non-neutral-- the government must intend to specifically benefit Democrats. Making Election Day a national holiday is too broad to be considered intentionally partial.
1.3. Con: Making election day a national holiday harms already disadvantaged groups.
1.3.1. Pro: Currently, voting is particularly [difficult](https://www.npr.org/2012/01/18/145397003/why-vote-on-tuesday-why-not-the-weekend) for single parents, students, and people who work multiple jobs.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Currently the law does not [require](https://aflcio.org/2016/11/5/know-your-rights-state-laws-employee-time-vote) employers to give their employees time off to vote.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.
1.3.1.2. Con: Data from the U.S Census Bureau shows that voters from households earning more than [$150,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billwhalen/2019/02/01/should-every-election-day-be-a-holiday/#ceeb520b33bf) are the most likely to say they don't have time to show up on election day. This is unlikely to be single parents, students or people working multiple jobs.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: A reason why working people are discouraged from voting is also that waiting in long queues takes up too much time. Among other reasons, queues occur because working people can only go to vote during mornings. Election day holiday would prevent this [rush hour](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/13/politics/ralph-northam-election-day/index.html).
1.3.1.3. Con: [Data](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/11/an-election-day-holiday-might-not-increase-turnout-studies-demonstrate.html) from the U.S Census Bureau shows that of the respondents belonging to income brackets less than $40,000, less than 25% of respondents reported they were too busy to vote.
1.3.1.4. Con: Lower-income non voters are more likely than wealthier non voters to [cite](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/11/an-election-day-holiday-might-not-increase-turnout-studies-demonstrate.html) illness and disability or trouble getting to the polls as problems, not a lack of time.
1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.3.2. Pro: Working class voters will be less likely to vote if this policy is enforced.
1.3.2.1. Pro: It can be harder for people employed in the service industry to take time off on a national holiday.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: National holidays tend to be some of the [busiest days](https://www.foodnewsfeed.com/fsr/marketing-promotions/dollar-days) for restaurants, which see them as an opportunity to earn greater profits.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Retail stores, restaurants, and hospitals, as well as businesses that rely on their day-to-day revenue, usually [remain open](https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/no-election-day-should-not-be-a-federal-holiday.html) for National holidays.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: Because the right to vote is a fundamental right, the state should provide for businesses to be able to give a day off to their workers without having to face economic loss.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Schools are closed on national holidays. In order to vote, blue collar parents would either need a babysitter, which can be difficult to afford, or would need to take their children with them, which can be a hassle.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: Since voting does not take very long, it should not be as difficult to find short-term childcare.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: All adult family members will likely have the day off meaning they can swap out child-caring responsibilities throughout the day.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: It can be beneficial for children to go with their parents as it normalizes voting and [involves them](https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/taking-kids-to-vote-get-stickers/) in the process.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: [In some states](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/schools-closing-for-election-day), schools are already closed on Election Day because the elections are held in school gyms or cafeterias. So this is not relevant.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Working class voters may be harmed if this policy is enforced. This may further disillusion them from the political process, making it less likely for them to use the extra time to vote.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: If all businesses \(including smaller businesses\) do close, their hourly paid employees will either [have to use](https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/no-election-day-should-not-be-a-federal-holiday.html) a Paid Time Off \(PTO\) day or not get paid.
1.3.2.5. Con: Currently, federal law [does not](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/democrats-want-to-make-election-day-a-national-holidayheres-why.html) require employers to allow their workers time off to vote. If this policy is enforced, many workers will have the time off to vote.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: This is especially important as low-income workers are the ones who can least afford to take time off or alter their shifts in order to go vote.
1.3.2.6. Con: Most working class employees work in jobs which would likely get the day off meaning they would be free to vote. The hospitality sector only employs [16.7](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/29/facts-about-american-workers/) million people.
1.3.2.6.1. Pro: [27.8 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/29/facts-about-american-workers/) working class Americans work in trade, transport and utilities services. These sectors are often closed or restricted on national holidays.
1.3.2.6.2. Pro: [22.5 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/29/facts-about-american-workers/) working class Americans work in government service related jobs. All government employees are usually given national holidays off.
1.3.2.6.3. Pro: [12.9 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/29/facts-about-american-workers/) working class Americans are employed in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing plants are normally closed on national holidays.
1.3.2.7. Pro: Instead of instituting a holiday, it is better to make provisions for people to vote early as per their convinience. This would make it easier for people that find it harder to take time out for voting due to their work-related committments.
1.3.2.7.1. Con: Many states already have provisions for [early and absentee voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_\(United_States\)#Early_and_postal_voting). However, the rules concerning these options are quite strict and still keep out a significant number of potential and legitimate voters.
1.3.3. Con: Election results are currently [biased](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=126024068112005084070124066127098098039053020046074058007068117088084116006090010108037124118022010007121001125113100065102064012058074010000095117091115021109115110056019033081103109067097065122010006023106102097003100093107104012098007110090113125126&EXT=pdf) against the interests of economically disadvantaged voters \(p. 25\). Voting is the [best way](https://www.nbcdi.org/news/voting-makes-impact) to effect change.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Voters can [use their power](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/) to diversify government bodies and make them more reflective of the broader population.
1.4. Pro: Citizens have a [right to vote](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/why-presidential-election-should-be-a-holiday/). It is the duty of the state to make exercising this right as accesible as possible by making the election day a holiday.
1.4.1. Pro: Some people face a loss of pay because they do not have a time off from work if they need to go vote. People should not have to face such material loss in order to exercise a fundamental right.
1.4.1.1. Con: Many [employees](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/holidays) do not get holiday pay by default on a national holiday. As such, many people may prefer to work, rather than have the day off.
1.4.2. Pro: Many employees are paid [time and half](https://www.hourly.io/post/have-questions-about-paid-holidays-by-law-here-are-your-answers)(While it’s not legally required, many employers do offer holiday pay \(such as double time or time and a half\) to their employees to reward and incentivize them for working on those days. Keep in mind that while holiday pay isn’t mandatory, standard rules about overtime pay will still apply on those days—since they’re viewed as a normal workday.) for working on a national holiday. As such, designating Election Day as a public holiday would allow people to maintain earnings while working fewer hours to vote.
1.4.3. Con: [Schools close](https://world-schools.com/school-holidays-in-the-usa-in-2019-20/) on public holidays, meaning that having election day as a holiday may actually make voting less accessible for parents.
1.4.4. Con: It is not necessary to make Election Day a national holiday to make voting more accessible; it is only necessary to give people a few paid hours off to vote.
1.4.5. Pro: Having Election Day as a National Holiday ensures a unilateral policy across the US. As such, it ensures that the vote is representative.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Having a patchwork state-by-state approach to voting holidays may lead to a bias towards a given party on Election Day due to states being either typically [red or blue](https://www.governing.com/assessments/what-painted-us-so-indelibly-red-and-blue), and such states adopting similar policies.
1.4.6. Con: There are many rights which are significantly less accessible in modern America. Efforts should be directed towards improving access to these rights, rather than improving the accessibility of voting.
1.4.6.1. Con: The right to vote is paramount to the well-being of US civilisation as it can be utilised to ensure all other rights are protected by one's elected representatives.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Though health is a universally acknowledged right, the US offers [no such provision](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/the-state-of-healthcare-in-the-united-states/health-care-as-a-human-right/), which has resulted in an ill-fitting and costly healthcare system. This should be a priority.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Violence has become entrenched in many [US institutions](https://english.news.cn/20220228/3120e00203a94a86a85fd8ee748e1053/c.html)(The United States has consistently had one of the highest rates of violent crimes in the world. Gun control measures have been stagnant and gun violence has been rife. The police are discriminatory in law enforcement, killing innocent people and causing public anger. Law enforcement officers commit crimes with impunity, and judicial injustice has been widely criticized. Wrongful and unjust cases continue to exist without being corrected and compensated effectively. Prison inmates are abused, and domestic violence as well as youth violence has increased significantly. The American people live in fear of lack of security.), compromising an individual's [right to security](http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/seguridad.eng/CitizenSecurity.V.htm).
1.5. Con: Instituting a holiday on election day would result in economic loss due to loss of productive hours at the workplace.
1.5.1. Con: Economic loss in the face of expanding one's access to exercise vote is justified because the latter is more important.
1.5.2. Con: Election day holiday can be on the same day as an existing national holiday such as [Veteren's Day](https://policyproposals.com/10-memorial-dayveterans-dayelection-day-holiday/). This would prevent additional economic loss.
1.5.3. Pro: This is especially true when, like in some States, companies allow their workers to take [time off](http://www.elections.ny.gov/nysboe/elections/attentionemployees.pdf) for a few hours to go vote.
1.5.4. Con: By this reasoning, there should not be any national holidays, as they cause economic losses.
1.5.5. Con: It could be on a Saturday, like in Australia.
1.6. Con: Elections currently have a certain selection bias by being attended exclusively by those who commit to making the journey to vote; this eliminates those who are politically apathetic. Thus, this could increase the number of uninformed voters.
1.6.1. Con: Some voters may be well-informed already, but simply do not have the time to vote.
1.6.1.1. Con: With fewer barriers to voting, individuals now free to vote could very well be motivated to inform themselves.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Being able to do something you want to do that but you couldn't before would motivate you to learn what you need to learn to do it properly.
1.6.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1957082.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Aa75758a86f06f44d33a61fa41abdcbe1) found that voters \[in the United States\] are more politically aware and involved than citizens in any other democracy, yet the levels of voter turnout are consistently far below the democratic average \(p. 17\). This demonstrates that a number of people who are not voting are well-informed.
1.6.2. Con: This could be alleviated by simultaneous improvement \(particularly, increased resources\) of education.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The government could make it compulsory for schools to provide civic education. In 2018 only [9 states](https://www.edc.org/3-ways-improve-civics-education) required high school students to take a full year course on civics or the U.S. government.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Inadequate levels of knowledge about the political process can be a [barrier](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/14/632666071/how-to-make-a-civics-education-stick) to voting.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: In Kansas voter participation was [2.1%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/) higher for both 18 year olds and their parents in counties where they had 'Kids Voting' programs in the school curricula.
1.6.2.2. Pro: The government could provide support to resources \(such as [isidewith.com](http://isidewith.com)\) which help to inform the public of candidates' positions.
1.6.2.3. Pro: The government could provide funding to candidates for political advertising.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: [Research](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/417164-record-campaign-spending-for-election-is-good-for-democracy) shows that campaign ads increase voter engagement and make voters more informed.
1.6.2.4. Con: The government can improve voter education regardless of whether election day is a national holiday.
1.6.3. Con: A person's commitment to voting is not necessarily connected to them being politically informed.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Only [34%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2016/06/27/american-voters-are-ignorant-but-not-stupid/#23aca26f7ff1) of Americans can even name the three branches of federal government and yet [53.4%](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html) of people voted in the Mid-terms.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Only [37%](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/young-voters-not-informed-midterm-elections_n_5bc90345e4b0d38b587661b4) of Americans would describe themselves as being politically informed yet [53.4%](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html) of people voted in the Mid-terms.
1.6.4. Pro: An informed electorate is [necessary](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=126024068112005084070124066127098098039053020046074058007068117088084116006090010108037124118022010007121001125113100065102064012058074010000095117091115021109115110056019033081103109067097065122010006023106102097003100093107104012098007110090113125126&EXT=pdf) for a well-functioning democracy \(p. 2\).
1.6.4.1. Con: The [goal](http://archive.ipu.org/cnl-e/161-dem.htm) of democracy is to elect representative governments. Not working to secure the greatest amount of participation thus undermines democracy.
1.6.4.2. Con: Voters [usually don’t](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/1/15515820/donald-trump-democracy-brexit-2016-election-europe) have coherent preferences. Most people pay little attention to politics; when they vote, if they vote at all, they do so irrationally and for contradictory reasons.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Uninformed voters are likely to vote for leaders who do not truly represent them.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Political-Consequences-of-Uninformed-Voters-Fowler-Margolis/66d71871403434ca20b34757dd9315de04895f33) found that when uninformed citizens received political information, they systematically shifted their political preferences away from the Republican Party and toward the Democrats. This demonstrates that voters were previously unaware of what party truly represented their values and beliefs.
1.6.4.4. Pro: If the number of uninformed citizens becomes too high neither the opinon of the majority nor that of the minority takes the lead, making political deadlock or incoherent results [more likely](https://phys.org/news/2011-12-knowledge-power-uninformed-vital-democracy.html).
1.6.5. Pro: There is consensus that uninformed votes are undesirable.
1.6.5.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/young-voters-not-informed-midterm-elections_n_5bc90345e4b0d38b587661b4) show that Americans who think they are uninformed also believe that uninformed people shouldn't vote.
1.6.6. Con: As a national holiday would give voters more free time, it would likely increase voter informedness, as voters would have more time and freedom to become better informed.
1.6.7. Con: Uninformed voters are equally affected by political decisions as informed voters and thus deserve an equal right to vote.
