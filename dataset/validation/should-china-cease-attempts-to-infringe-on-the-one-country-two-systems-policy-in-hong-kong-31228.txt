Discussion Name: Should China cease attempts to infringe on the 'one country, two systems' policy in Hong Kong?

1. China should cease attempts to infringe on the 'one country, two systems' policy in Hong Kong.
1.1. Con: Conceding to the protests in Hong Kong will undermine China and its strength.
1.1.1. Pro: The basis of the Chinese government's control over their country and the people is based on an [intolerance](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-deals-with-dissent-threats-family-arrests-2018-8) of dissidents. Diverting from this approach and conceding to the dissidents who have demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill is likely to challenge this control.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The pro-democracy protesters gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing were [harshly repressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests). Significantly greater media censorship was [introduced](https://oxfordre.com/asianhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-157) in the aftermath of the protest, along with the cultivation of increased anti-Western sentiment within the citizens by the government.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [backlash](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/china-accept-hong-kong-unique-identity-fight-190826131317398.html) from the violent suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen uprising damaged China's international reputation for decades.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Permits are [required](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/29/20835183/hong-kong-protests-china-repression-tiananmen-square-beijing-response) in order to carry out protests. The Chinese government thus exercises firm control over the problems the people are allowed to voice, vetoing any that may engender divisions within China.
1.1.2. Con: The Chinese [economy](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2157638/why-us-trade-war-not-only-cause-concern-over-chinas-economy) is not doing well, which means its leaders are probably [hesitant](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions) to cause serious financial harm. In this situation, conceding to the protests in Hong Kong might help uphold China's economic strength.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In July 2019, China's economic growth shrunk to its [lowest in 27 years](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/15/economy/china-gdp-growth/index.html).
1.1.2.2. Con: Many companies have shown a greater allegiance to China, indicating that China's economy can withstand ongoing protests.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Reports suggest that even some Hong Kong-based companies, whose employees have been protesting, are having to [bend to what Beijing wants](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49520047) in order to keep servicing the vast Chinese market.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: In August, Rupert Hogg, the chief executive of Hong Kong-based [Cathay Pacific Airways](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/18/business/economy/hong-kong-china-business-workers.html), resigned after facing Chinese pressure when some of the airline’s workers participated in the demonstrations.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The financial pressure for Rupert Hogg to resign was immense because [26 out of 111 destinations are on the mainland](https://time.com/5668266/hong-kong-business-china-protests-economy-workforce-politics/), and Cathay Pacific earns half of its income from tickets purchased in Hong Kong and China. The risk of losing access to Chinese airspace would be a profound economic blow.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: In September, fast fashion giant [Zara](https://time.com/5668266/hong-kong-business-china-protests-economy-workforce-politics/) issued a statement declaring support for China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong.
1.1.2.2.4. Pro: This summer, [Givenchy, Coach, and Versace](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/world/asia/china-nba-tweet.html) apologized to China for producing T-shirts that seemed to identify Hong Kong as an independent country.
1.1.2.2.5. Pro: [Apple and Google](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/10/11/20910039/american-brands-hong-kong-china-conflict) pulled apps relating to the Hong Kong protests from virtual stores in October.
1.1.2.3. Pro: In [2018](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2180471/how-badly-chinas-economy-doing-look-behind), Chinese academics calculated that the Chinese economic growth rate fell to 1.5%, rather than the official 6.5% over the past few years.
1.1.2.4. Pro: The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index was the world’s biggest loser in [2018](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2180471/how-badly-chinas-economy-doing-look-behind), posting a fall of 24.6% since 2017.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Hong Kong is vital to China's economy. Therefore, any harm to Hong Kong will impact China as well.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Hong Kong acts as a hub for [internationalisation of China’s currency](https://time.com/5610557/hong-kong-extradition-protests-business-impact/), the renminbi, meaning that the currency is [used beyond Chinese borders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency_internationalization.asp). This presents a number of benefits to China's economy.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: When a currency is internationalised, it offers improved financial certainty to residents who can [denominate foreign transactions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency_internationalization.asp) in their domestic currency.
1.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: China has actively employed financial policies to increase the role of the renminbi in the global economy, indicating that internalising the renminbi offers rich economic benefits \([ECB, p. 13-15](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/ire/ecb.ire201906~f0da2b823e.en.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.1.3. Pro: A 2014 study found that the internationalisation of the renminbi promotes the development of China's financial market, and expands firms in mainland China \([Zhang, p. 1](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/156336/adbi-wp481.pdf)\).
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: At the end of 2018, 1,146 mainland companies were listed in Hong Kong, with market capitalisation of [US$2.6 trillion](https://time.com/5610557/hong-kong-extradition-protests-business-impact/) representing [68%](http://hong-kong-economy-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Market-Environment/Economic-and-Trade-Information-on-Hong-Kong/etihk/en/1/1X000000/1X09OVUL.htm) of the market total.
1.1.2.5.3. Pro: Hong Kong’s stock exchange may be more important than ever for China if the [trade war](https://time.com/5610557/hong-kong-extradition-protests-business-impact/) between the US and China cannot be resolved by further talks.
1.1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Hong Kong's [special status](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-markets-explainer/explainer-how-important-is-hong-kong-to-the-rest-of-china-idUSKCN1VP35H) has allowed it to negotiate trade and investment agreements independently from Beijing. This has been especially important given the instability of the US-China relationship.
1.1.2.5.3.2. Pro: The [China-US trade war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war) is an ongoing economic conflict between the world's two largest economies in which each country is imposing tit-for-tat tariffs to harm the other's economy.
1.1.2.5.3.3. Con: Chinese state media has reported that talks with the US are [progressing](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3032964/chinese-state-media-plays-catch-and-says-beijing-and), with prospects for future high-level negotiations. Therefore, the trade war is showing positive signs of resolution, thereby diminishing the potential importance of Hong Kong's stock exchange to China.
1.1.2.5.3.3.1. Pro: The White House was equally [upbeat about progress](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3032964/chinese-state-media-plays-catch-and-says-beijing-and), with Trump saying China and the US had reached a “substantial phase one deal”.
1.1.2.5.4. Con: Over the years, Hong Kong has clearly become less important to the Chinese economy.
1.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Hong Kong's GDP has [shrunk](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/30/why-hong-kong-remains-vital-to-chinas-economy) from being 16% of China’s overall GDP in 1997, the year it was returned to Chinese control, to just 3% in 2019.
1.1.2.5.5. Pro: Hong Kong has proved to be more [reliable](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/30/why-hong-kong-remains-vital-to-chinas-economy) than mainland China as a source of equity financing for the country.
1.1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Since 2012, Chinese companies have raised US [$43 billion](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/30/why-hong-kong-remains-vital-to-chinas-economy) in initial public offerings in the Hong Kong market, versus just US $25 billion on mainland exchanges.
1.1.2.5.5.2. Pro: Hong Kong has provided Chinese companies with access to [global capital markets](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/30/why-hong-kong-remains-vital-to-chinas-economy) for bond and loan financing.
1.1.2.5.5.2.1. Pro: According to the data from Natixis, Hong Kong [accounts](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4c56bd-1c40-3261-8ba8-f3ce8c83e8d2) for 60% of overseas bond issuance of mainland Chinese companies and 26% of their syndicated loans.
1.1.2.5.5.2.2. Pro: In [2018](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4c56bd-1c40-3261-8ba8-f3ce8c83e8d2), Hong Kong financial centers alone helped mainland Chinese companies raise US $33 billion in loans and investments.
1.1.2.5.5.2.3. Pro: In Hong Kong, offshore investors hold [2.02 trillion yuan \($286.04 billion\)](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-bonds-offshore/foreign-holdings-of-chinese-bonds-top-2-trln-yuan-driven-by-index-inclusions-idUSL4N2580OJ) worth of Chinese inter-bank market bonds as of July 2019.
1.1.2.5.5.2.3.1. Pro: Regarding bond trading, Hong Kong provides much more [control](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4c56bd-1c40-3261-8ba8-f3ce8c83e8d2) to mainland Chinese companies by giving them leverage over submitting officially required information, allowing these companies to surpass many documentation and bureaucratic procedures.
1.1.2.5.5.2.4. Con: The offshore bond market is growing and could [replace](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4c56bd-1c40-3261-8ba8-f3ce8c83e8d2) Hong Kong as a source of capital for mainland Chinese companies.
1.1.2.5.5.3. Pro: Hong Kong is China’s most important springboard for [foreign direct investment](https://bruegel.org/2019/08/hong-kongs-economy-is-still-important-to-the-mainland-at-least-financially/) \(FDI\), either into or outside China.
1.1.2.5.5.3.1. Pro: Many foreign companies feel safer investing in Hong Kong rather than China because of the [safety](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/16/china-hong-kong-xi-jinping) provided by its independent judicial system and banking structure that allows free currency conversions and unlimited international transfers.
1.1.2.5.5.3.1.1. Pro: Hong Kong is ranked as the [number one](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/hongkong) jurisdiction in the world for economic freedom.
1.1.2.5.5.3.2. Pro: Hong Kong accounted for [two-thirds](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/30/why-hong-kong-remains-vital-to-chinas-economy) of foreign direct investment into China last year, up from 30% in 2005.
1.1.2.5.5.3.3. Pro: Between 2010 and 2018, [65%](https://bruegel.org/2019/08/hong-kongs-economy-is-still-important-to-the-mainland-at-least-financially/) of Chinese outward FDI was channelled through Hong Kong.
1.1.2.5.5.3.4. Pro: [64%](https://bruegel.org/2019/08/hong-kongs-economy-is-still-important-to-the-mainland-at-least-financially/) of mainland China’s inward FDI came from Hong Kong between 2010 and 2018.
1.2. Con: China is justifiably asserting itself by trying to reconnect and reclaim territories that it believes belongs to it.
1.2.1. Pro: The special status granted to Hong Kong under the 'one country, two systems' policy goes against long established Chinese policies and principles, which is proving to undermine the hold of the Communist party on the country.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The 'one country, two systems' policy [allows](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/06/30/what-is-chinas-one-country-two-systems-policy) autonomy to Hong Kong, with independent legal systems and police forces, which undermines the authoritativeness and stronghold of China over the affairs of its administered territory.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: In the early 1980s Deng Xiaoping, the Paramount Leader of the People's Republic of China [formulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems) the 'one country, two systems' policy as a way of reintegrating Hong Kong into China, a policy that therefore only exists today owing to China's authority.
1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Traditional Chinese values include the concept of [harmony](https://carnegietsinghua.org/2013/11/21/china-s-traditional-cultural-values-and-national-identity-pub-53613), meaning proper and balanced coordination. The 'one country, two systems' policy doesn't promote harmony between Hong Kong and China.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The concept of harmony does not necessarily require [uniformity](https://carnegietsinghua.org/2013/11/21/china-s-traditional-cultural-values-and-national-identity-pub-53613) between the mainland and Hong Kong. Therefore harmony could be achieved under the 'one country two systems' model.
1.2.2. Pro: The ambiguity surrounding the 'one country, two systems' policy is a source of tension between China and Hong Kong. Removing this system will reduce political tensions.
1.2.2.1. Con: Decreasing political tensions is not in itself a good thing if the tensions exist for legitimate reasons.
1.2.2.2. Pro: [Uncertainty](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/businesses-may-consider-moving-from-hong-kong-to-singapore.html) over the future of the 'one country two systems' model is leading businesses in Hong Kong to consider relocating.
1.2.3. Pro: Hong Kong is historically, politically and legally a part of China. Therefore it should be fully integrated into China.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Hong Kong only developed a separate identity to mainland China because it was subject to [British rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) between 1842 and 1997. Without the British there would have been no need for a system to aid in reunification.
1.2.3.2. Pro: The 1984 agreement that transferred sovereignty from Britain to China only guaranteed that the 'one country, two systems' model would be in place for [50 years](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/hong-kong-beijing-will-choose-chinese-sovereignty-protests-china).
1.2.3.3. Pro: There are significant levels of migration between mainland China and Hong Kong.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: In 2015, approximately [879,000](http:///news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2045245/hong-kong-residents-mainland-people-have) migrants from mainland China were living in Hong Kong.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: The levels of migration between mainland China and Hong Kong have been [declining](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2159723/number-mainland-chinese-migrants-coming-hong-kong-drops) over the years.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: In [2018](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2159723/number-mainland-chinese-migrants-coming-hong-kong-drops), the number of mainland Chinese migrants coming to Hong Kong dropped by almost 15,000 as compared to 2017.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: The fact that there are strong channels of migration between mainland China and Hong Kong does not necessarily mean that it is desirable for the latter to be integrated into the former.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: [Migration rates of EU citizens](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_citizens_living_in_another_Member_State_-_statistical_overview) to other EU member states are substantial. Yet, there are few calls for the EU to become one state.
1.2.3.4. Con: Hong Kong has a very distinct identity to mainland China. This supports the notion that it should be treated separately from mainland China.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Mainlanders tend to place greater [value](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2045245/hong-kong-residents-mainland-people-have) on respect for authority whereas people from Hong Kong are more individualistic and care about their personal rights.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: The ability to [demonstrate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-not-china-yet-but-feared-grim-day-coming-ever-nearer) has become an important expression of local identity that distinguishes Hong Kong from mainland China.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Young people in Hong Kong consider themselves to be [Hongkongers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/02/chinas-hong-kong-dilemma) rather than Chinese.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Con: Over time, younger generations in Hong Kong are likely to feel a greater sense of belonging towards mainland China as a result of their significant exposure to the mainland.
1.2.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: In 2017, new compulsory [Chinese history lessons](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2117400/new-compulsory-chinese-history-lessons-will-not-ignore-hong) in Hong Kong secondary schools were introduced, which cover cultural history, technology, and Hong Kong's role in China’s past.
1.2.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: Almost 9 in 10 secondary school age Hongkongers can read simplified Chinese characters, and about [7 in 10 use the popular Chinese WeChat app](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2141153/if-ignorance-not-reason-why-do-young-hongkongers-still).
1.2.3.4.2.1.3. Pro: Around 8 in 10 Hong Kong secondary school pupils often watch [films or TV shows produced on the mainland](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2141153/if-ignorance-not-reason-why-do-young-hongkongers-still), with 1 in 10 saying they do so almost daily.
1.2.3.4.2.2. Con: Identifying as a Hongkonger does not mean that a person cannot [also](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2045245/hong-kong-residents-mainland-people-have) identify as being Chinese.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Hong Kong has a [capitalist](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hong-kong-china-differences_n_5916444) economy whereas China operates under a socialist system.
1.2.3.4.4. Pro: Hong Kong has a [parliament](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hong-kong-china-differences_n_5916444) with a variety of political parties whereas China has a closed political system with only [one political party](https://www.economist.com/china/2017/03/09/chinas-one-party-system-has-a-surprising-number-of-parties) in power.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Historical events show that Chinese claims over Hong Kong are legitimate.
1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Hong Kong was first incorporated into China in [243 BCE](https://www.thoughtco.com/china-lease-hong-kong-to-britain-195153) and remained under Chinese control for the next 2000 years.
1.2.3.5.2. Pro: The [Sino-British Joint Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration), signed in 1984 by then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, represents a [legally valid treaty](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-anniversary-china/china-says-sino-british-joint-declaration-on-hong-kong-no-longer-has-meaning-idUSKBN19L1J1) between the two countries and provides China the basis of its legitimate claim over Hong Kong.
1.2.3.5.2.1. Con: China does not always legally recognize valid accession treaties, so it is not in a good position with regards to its claims over Hong Kong.
1.2.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: If China claims the validity of its control over Hong Kong based on the agreement between China and Britain, then it should give up its claim over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands because the US transferred these islands over to Japan in [1972](https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/why-the-senkaku-diaoyu-islands-are-like-a-toothpaste-tube/) under to the same principle.
1.2.3.6. Con: Even if Hong Kong is historically a part of China, that does not mean that it should be in future.
1.2.3.6.1. Pro: Cultural and political values evolve and new group identities are formed over time, so it can be disproportionately injurious to peace and harmony to re-integrate two communities who have little or no lived memory of that historical point in time.
1.2.3.6.2. Pro: The future of Hong Kong, regarding whether or not it wants to be a part of China, should be decided by the Hong Kong citizens and not Chinese authorities.
1.2.4. Con: Reunification will [happen in 2047 anyway](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40426827?), trying to speed things up could just cause more damage and problems than necessary.
1.2.4.1. Con: [Article 5](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-27/countdown-to-2047-what-will-happen-to-hong-kong-quicktake) of the Basic Law sets out a 50 year term for the 'one country, two systems' model, but it is silent on what will happen after 2047. Reunification may not automatically occur in 2047.
1.2.4.2. Con: China has an [interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-27/countdown-to-2047-what-will-happen-to-hong-kong-quicktake) in preserving Hong Kong's status after 2047 as a financial hub and as a model for potential unification with Taiwan.
1.2.4.3. Con: China and its officials insist that it does not intend to reunify China and Hong Kong after 2047 when the 'one country, two systems' policy expires.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: In 2017 Chinese President [Xi Jinping](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-27/countdown-to-2047-what-will-happen-to-hong-kong-quicktake) stated that after 2047 he would "ensure the principle of 'one country, two systems' remains unchanged."
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The Chinese Constitutional Affairs Bureau has [stated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-explainer/explainer-hong-kongs-borrowed-time-worry-about-2047-hangs-over-protests-idUSKCN1VD0S6) that after 2047 "the People's Republic of China will not change its basic policies to Hong Kong i.e. one country, two systems."
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Since the pro-democracy protests in 2014, Chinese officials have [suggested](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3015492/hong-kongs-extradition-protests-one-country-two-systems-and) that 'one country' should take precedence over the 'two systems'. This suggests China may seek in the future to further undermine the current model.
1.2.4.4. Con: There is a lot of [financial uncertainty](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Hong-Kong-s-year-2047-problem) beyond 2047, which is causing Hong Kong's financial market to be less attractive. Prompt reunification may help restore financial certainty.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: In Hong Kong's suburban districts, as many as [350,000 lease contracts](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Hong-Kong-s-year-2047-problem) will expire in 2047. Banks have refused to extend lease beyond that period, or issue new leases, given that they don't know what the years beyond 2047 hold.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Uncertainty over the legal structure beyond 2047 is making it difficult for banks in Hong Kong to [extend loans](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Hong-Kong-s-year-2047-problem) to their customers, which is likely to cause turmoil in the property market in the coming years.
1.2.4.5. Pro: It is widely accepted that China intends to displace the US as the world’s only [superpower by 2049](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/03/china-couldnt-dominate-asia-if-it-wanted-to/). Given the global economic significance of Hong Kong, reunification in 2047 is logically likely to be central to that agenda.
1.2.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.4.
1.2.5. Pro: China’s attempts to infringe on the 'one country, two systems' policy in Hong Kong are part of their [wider attempt to consolidate power](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) in Asia .
1.2.5.1. Pro: China is attempting to consolidate its economic power across Asia with its '[One Belt, One Road](https://medium.com/\@lseideas/chinas-one-belt-one-road-a-reality-check-b28030ac6d3b)' initiative.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: China's '[One Belt, One Road](http://www.cadtm.org/A-critical-look-at-China-s-One-Belt-One-Road-initiative)' \(OBOR\) initiative ties in many Asian economies, indicating that China has massive economic influence within the region.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: Over [60 countries](https://medium.com/\@lseideas/chinas-one-belt-one-road-a-reality-check-b28030ac6d3b) have shown an interest in participating in the 'One Belt, One Road' \(OBOR\) initiative, suggesting that OBOR is likely to come to fruition, thereby further solidifying China's economic domination.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Since China's military power has expanded, it has been [asserting claims to territories](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) such as in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait. Infringing on the 'one country, two systems' policy in Hong Kong coheres with this theme of power consolidation across Asia.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: China has made aggressive moves to exert its control over the [Diaoyu/Senkaku](https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/diaoyu-islands-dispute-a-chinese-perspective/) Islands, over which it claims sovereignty.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: China has entered into [aggressive confrontation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/china-v-japan-new-global-flashpoint-senkaku-islands-ishigaki) with Japan over the control of Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, by drifting into and out of Japanese territorial waters.
1.2.6. Pro: China is justifiably trying to reclaim land that was taken from them when they were weaker.
1.2.7. Con: Reneging on deals and infringing on civil liberties in the process of reclaiming these territories will only drive China's allies away.
1.2.7.1. Con: There are other reasons why states might be incentivized to follow China's sphere of influence, given its economic power and rising influence in the region.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: China's '[Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-strategic-implications-and-international-opposition)' offers adequate incentives for regional states to align with its agenda and integrate within mainland China.
1.2.7.2. Pro: China has suggested that a 'one country, two systems' approach could be used to integrate [Taiwan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-anniversary-president/taiwan-leader-rejects-chinas-one-country-two-systems-offer-idUSKBN1WP0A4) with mainland China. This is unlikely to be successful if China is not seen as committed to respecting the independence of the two systems.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: Taiwan's President has been skeptical of the 'one country, two systems' integration plan for Taiwan, stating that it has brought Hong Kong to the "[edge of disorder](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-anniversary-president/taiwan-leader-rejects-chinas-one-country-two-systems-offer-idUSKBN1WP0A4)."
1.2.7.2.2. Con: Taiwan [rejected](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538) the 'one country, two systems' policy in the 1980s. The integration of Taiwan is unlikely to occur regardless of China's actions in Hong Kong.
1.2.7.2.3. Pro: In October 2019, [Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3032303/taiwans-president-tsai-ing-wen-urges-rejection-one-country-two) rejected the proposed 'one country, two systems' policy for Taiwan, citing its failure in Hong Kong amid the protests.
1.2.7.3. Con: China has treated each territory that it wishes to reintegrate into the mainland differently, based on its needs and interests. There is no reason to expect the situation in Hong Kong would necessarily be repeated in other territories.
1.2.7.3.1. Pro: Macau has been [successfully](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3026564/china-should-know-hong-kong-not-macau-and-neither-taiwan) integrated into China under the 'one country, two systems' model, without any types of protests as seen in Hong Kong.
1.2.7.3.1.1. Con: There have been some [signs](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/hong-kong-protests-stir-questions-macau) that the protests in Hong Kong could spark anti-China protests in Macau.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Anti-Chinese protests in Macau are unlikely to succeed.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Anti-China protests in Macau are unlikely to succeed given that the authorities in Macau are [cracking down](https://time.com/5688967/macau-hong-kong-protests/) on any show of solidarity by Macau residents for their Hong Kong neighbors, fearing that Macau might also fall prey to anti-Chinese protests.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Between 500,000 and 2 million protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_protests) are estimated to have protested in the Hong Kong, which has a population of [7.4 million](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-hong-kong-sar-population/). By contrast, Macau has a population of just [643,201](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/macau-population/). Unless the whole population of Macau protested, Macau-based protests would be very unlikely to impact China.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Unlike Hong Kong, Macau is highly [dependent](https://time.com/5688967/macau-hong-kong-protests/) on mainland Chinese assistance for its survival.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: According to the U.S. public policy think-tank the Heritage Foundation, gaming-related taxes account for about [80%](https://time.com/5688967/macau-hong-kong-protests/) of government revenues of Macau, which is insufficient for its survival.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.4. Con: Even if anti-Chinese protests in Macau are unlikely to succeed, it is [increasing](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) political awareness amongst its youth, which is likely to put forward a challenge to Chinese control over the region.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: In [Macau](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their), a small but increasingly vocal group of young people are seeing Hong Kong protests as a stage to express their grievances and fight for a common anti-oppression cause.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.5. Pro: Many Macau residents [continue](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) to criticize the increasing levels of violence at the protests in Hong Kong, and support the Hong Kong police. This indicates that they are unlikely to join in, or support a similar situation in Macau.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2. Pro: The media landscape in Macau is much [different](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) than that in Hong Kong, which is likely to provide information to spark anti-China protests.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The local government of Macau has greater [financial control](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) over news outlets, meaning that China cannot spread disinformation and suppress the actual reasons behind the protests in Hong Kong.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: The local Portuguese and English-language media in Macau usually features more [critical views](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) of the government, offering an outlet for any young people that are unhappy with mainland China.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The information produced by the local Portuguese and English-language media in Macau often [does not reach](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) the majority of the population, who primarily speak Cantonese or Mandarin.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Roughly [85.7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Macau)% of the population in Macau has Cantonese as their native tongue, and about 40% of the population is able to communicate in standard Mandarin.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: In [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Macau), English and Portuguese are spoken as a first language by 1.5% and 0.6% of the population respectively.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: The number of people in Macau who use English as their usual language is rising over the years. This indicates that the information produced by local English-language media in Macau is being widely understood.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Data released by the Statistics and Census Service \(DSEC\) [showed](https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/use-of-english-in-macau-a-de-facto-official-language.html) that in 2006 only 1.5% of the residential population in Macau used English as their usual language, and this number rose to 2.3% in 2011.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: In 2006, 16.6% of the population in Macau claimed to use English, which [rose](https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/use-of-english-in-macau-a-de-facto-official-language.html) to 21.1% in 2011.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Constant displays of Hong Kong protests are [touching](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3022997/how-hong-kong-protests-inspire-macaus-youth-and-teach-their) the hearts of young people in Macau.
1.2.7.3.1.2. Pro: Macau has fully [embraced a pro-Chinese education system](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3024535/affluent-quiet-macau-chinas-new-unification-golden-child), which is credited with Macau's relatively seamless unification with China.
1.2.7.4. Pro: China will be viewed as less trustworthy if it infringes on a policy is has previously committed to, making it less likely for states to enter into similar agreements with the country.
1.2.7.4.1. Pro: China signed the [Joint Declaration](https://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm), an internationally brokered agreement within which the country agreed to adhere to the 'one country, two systems' policy.
1.2.7.4.2. Pro: China itself [proposed](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/06/30/what-is-chinas-one-country-two-systems-policy) the 'one country, two systems' policy. Not adhering to their own terms makes China appear fickle and self-interested.
1.2.7.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.7.4.2.2. Pro: Given that China is trying to increase its influence and reach in the [developing world](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/protect-the-party-chinas-growing-influence-in-the-developing-world/), it is unlikely that it would want to appear self-interested.
1.3. Con: China's actions are also in Hong Kong's best interest because of how heavily linked the social, economic, cultural, and political sectors of the two countries already are. Further integration is to Hong Kong's benefit as well as China's.
1.3.1. Pro: Hong Kong's tourism industry is facilitated by China's tourism industry.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Sales at a shop in the popular Hong Kong shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui have [plummeted by 90%](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-economy.html) in recent months. This is largely thanks to the dwindling numbers of tourists from mainland China who have been staying away since the protests began.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Mainland Chinese visitors were the [driving force](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2184378/tourist-figures-hong-kong-reached-new-high-2018-651) that pushed Hong Kong’s tourist arrivals to a record high of 65.1 million last year.
1.3.1.3. Con: The number of tourists in Hong Kong have exceeded Hong Kong's ability to accommodate them and is now harmful.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Prices of services, accommodation and property are being [driven up](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1218510/regulate-tourist-numbers-hong-kongs-benefit) by what the outsiders pay, rather than the demand of the citizens of Hong Kong.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The tourism industry is one of the major pillars of Hong Kong's economy, contributing around [5%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49276259) of the city's GDP.
1.3.2. Con: The U.S. State Department has [expressed concern](https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-june-10-2019/#post-82620-HONGKONGCHINA) that the continued erosion of the ‘one country, two systems’ framework puts Hong Kong’s long-established special status in international affairs at risk. This status is what has made Hong Kong an appealing investment hub.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.3.1.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Foreign investors have [more faith](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-markets-explainer/explainer-how-important-is-hong-kong-to-the-rest-of-china-idUSKCN1VP35H) in Hong Kong’s legal and governance systems, which are not associated with China's Communist Party. This has helped establish Hong Kong's special status.
1.3.3. Con: Hong Kong is very different to China, especially in regards its political sector, seeing as citizens have full internet access and a clear desire for democracy.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Hong Kong was once colonized by the UK. This historical factor has contributed their pro-democrotic nature.
1.3.4. Pro: China has undertaken and facilitated several major infrastructural projects to improve transport and connectivity within Hong Kong, as well as between Hong Kong and the mainland.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The new [high speed rail](https://multimedia.scmp.com/native/infographics/article/2172120/high-speed-rail/) link offers a super-fast connection between Hong Kong and multiple destinations on mainland China.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The cost of the project was about [HK$85.3 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou%E2%80%93Shenzhen%E2%80%93Hong_Kong_Express_Rail_Link) and was shouldered by the Hong Kong government without any assistance from mainland China.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Part of the new Hong Kong rail terminal is [being leased](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/asia/hong-kong-mainland-china-rail-terminal.html?module=inline) to mainland China to allow Chinese officers to enforce law and order and maximise efficiency.
1.3.4.2. Pro: China provided the impetus for the construction of the world’s longest [sea bridge](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/14/chinas-long-term-plan-hong-kong-assimilation-integration-digestion-oblivion/), costing US$20 billion and cutting road travel time between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai from three hours to about 40 minutes.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: The economic benefits of the Bridge are being questioned as the [traffic flow of the bridge](https://www.td.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_4940/table81e.pdf) is less than half of the [minimum estimate done by the government in 2008](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr07-08/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pwsc0521pwsc-109-e.pdf).
1.3.4.3. Pro: The boundary control point at Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai is the seventh [land crossing](https://www.beltandroad.gov.hk/work.html) between Hong Kong and mainland China, connecting the the Eastern Corridor in Shenzhen, to the Shenzhen-Shantou Expressways to cut travel times.
1.3.4.4. Pro: There are currently a few infrastructural projects [underway](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/the-greater-bay-area-plan-china/) by China to improve Hong Kong's transport and connectivity to the mainland. This means that the benefits to Hong Kong are likely to trickle down in the future too.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Corridor is expected to be completed in [2024](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/the-greater-bay-area-plan-china/). It will be an eight-lane highway and will reduce the travel time between Shenzhen and Zhongshan/Jiangmen by approximately 30 minutes.
1.3.5. Con: The people of Hong Kong enjoy [freedoms and autonomy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48607723) that the citizens of mainland China don't. Socially, the citizens are accustomed to living drastically different lives that further integration will not be able to reconcile.
1.3.5.1. Pro: There is limited support for further integration with mainland China from Hong Kong citizens due to little sense of belonging towards mainland Chinese identity. This is likely to decline further.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: A decades-long tracking poll by Hong Kong University [shows](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/what-china-struggles-more-than-ever-to-get-from-hong-kong-loyalty-and-love/2019/06/17/13b55b9e-8f6d-11e9-b6f4-033356502dce_story.html) that only 38% of Hong Kong citizens feel “proud to be a citizen of China,” compared with 47% in 1997.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: As of [June 2019](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/what-china-struggles-more-than-ever-to-get-from-hong-kong-loyalty-and-love/2019/06/17/13b55b9e-8f6d-11e9-b6f4-033356502dce_story.html), 55% of young Hong Kong citizens between 18 and 29 have a negative view of the central Chinese government, compared with only 13% who see Beijing positively.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: [Only 22%](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2141153/if-ignorance-not-reason-why-do-young-hongkongers-still) of Hong Kong secondary school pupils say they would opt to live on the mainland, and only [around 26%](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2141153/if-ignorance-not-reason-why-do-young-hongkongers-still) say they would work there.
1.3.5.1.3.1. Con: Since secondary school pupils are under the age of 17, it is natural that they would prefer to remain at home in Hong Kong. This is therefore a strong confounding variable.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: When Hong Kong students were asked if Hong Kong and Chinese identities could be “compatible” on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “absolutely incompatible”, about [65% gave a score of 5 and below](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2141153/if-ignorance-not-reason-why-do-young-hongkongers-still) and 8.7% chose 0.
1.3.5.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.4.2.1.
1.3.5.1.6. Pro: [51.8% of HK people think they are of Chinese identity](https://m.mingpao.com/pns/%E8%A6%81%E8%81%9E/article/20190628/s00001/1561659574447/76-%E4%BA%BA%E8%87%AA%E8%AA%8D%E3%80%8C%E6%B8%AF%E4%BA%BA%E3%80%8D%E8%BA%AB%E5%88%86-%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E9%AB%98-%E5%AD%B8%E8%80%85%E4%B8%8D%E8%A9%AB%E7%95%B0-%E6%96%99%E5%8F%8D%E4%BF%AE%E4%BE%8B%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF) during 2008 Beijing Olympics. After several years of Xi's domination, it dropped to 23.2%.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Mainland China is [communist](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-type-of-government-does-china-have.html) while Hong Kong has a [presidential limited democracy](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-type-of-government-does-hong-kong-have.html). The citizens thus have drastically different relationships with their governments.
1.3.5.3. Pro: In mainland China, the internet and social media are [heavily regulated](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/27/the-great-firewall-of-china-by-james-griffiths-review-how-to-control-the-internet). The citizens of Hong Kong enjoy [little to no internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Hong_Kong).
1.3.5.4. Pro: According to [social scientists](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2045245/hong-kong-residents-mainland-people-have), people from mainland China tend to respect authority, while people from Hong Kong are more individualistic and care about personal rights.
1.3.5.5. Con: Most people from Hong Kong and mainland China are ethnically similar.
1.3.5.5.1. Pro: [92%](https://www.had.gov.hk/rru/english/info/info_dem.html) of Hong Kong's population is Han Chinese. A [significant percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Hong_Kong#cite_note-3) of them originate from [Canton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong).
1.3.5.6. Con: School-age Hong Kong citizens are accustomed to significant social exposure to mainland China, so further integration will not be that irreconcilable for them.
1.3.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.2.1.3.
1.3.6. Con: It is not social, economic, cultural improvements instigated by the mainland that most Hong Kong people are looking for, but their rights and freedom.
1.4. Pro: The protests that have resulted from China's infringement are detrimental to both China and Hong Kong itself.
1.4.1. Pro: China is concerned about the potential of the protests in Hong Kong setting a precedent for its citizens and potentially [spreading](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions) to mainland China.
1.4.1.1. Con: Since there is [no freedom of the media](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china) in mainland China, the likelihood of any narrative surrounding the Hong Kong protest reaching mainland China, apart from the one fabricated by the Chinese government, is low.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: China is employing its [social media disinformation capabilities](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/20/20813660/china-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-protests-social-media) by setting up fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter to spreading false news about the Hong Kong protests.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Beijing's [disinformation campaign](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions) about the protests is indicating that the demonstrators are disgruntled rioters and CIA props, thus shifting part of the protest blame on US influence.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [China has blamed the US](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric) for crimes committed by some protesters on the front lines of rallies, saying that the violence was the “creation of the US” and calling the US a “black hand” behind the demonstrations.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that China is blaming the US is not necessarily evidence that the US is actually attempting to undermine China. Blaming the US may just be Beijing's way of discrediting the protesters, [rallying mainland sentiment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric) against them, and potentially justifying more direct intervention.
1.4.1.2. Con: Many citizens of mainland China have [denounced](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3019662/mainland-chinese-sentiment-protests-may-spur-tougher-line-hong) the protests as radical.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Many citizens from mainland China have travelled to Hong Kong [in support of](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-09-07/mainland-chinese-support-hong-kong-protests) the protests.
1.4.1.3. Pro: In August, China’s [Public Security Minister](https://www.insideover.com/politics/will-hong-kongs-protests-spread-to-mainland-china.html) visited Guangdong, which, if the Hongkongers’ movement was to cross borders, would likely be the starting point. The Minister urged officers to “resolutely defend the great southern gate of China’s political security” by tackling “all kinds of infiltration, sabotage and subversion”, thus sounding China's concerns about the protests spreading.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Citizens from mainland China who have come out in support of Hong Kong have been detained and treated poorly. Such harsh repercussions indicate a feeling of general insecurity on part of the Chinese government.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: A member of the [Chinese Human Rights Defenders \(CHRD\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Human_Rights_Defenders) reported that "the Chinese government is [working overtime to threaten and detain mainlanders](https://www.insideover.com/politics/will-hong-kongs-protests-spread-to-mainland-china.html) from sharing and commenting on the protests in Hong Kong for fear of what it may spark back home".
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: CHRD monitors and reports on the Chinese government's violations of human rights through [grassroots human rights](https://www.nchrd.org/) activism. Therefore, CHRD is likely a reliable source of information about the internal situation in mainland China.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: "[Freedom Lu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-09-07/mainland-chinese-support-hong-kong-protests)", who crossed into Hong Kong to join the protesters, was detained for ten days in a room where he was interrogated, stripped, and threatened.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: [Wei Xiaobing](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-09-07/mainland-chinese-support-hong-kong-protests) was detained for fifteen days after sharing pro-Hong Kong content on Facebook and Twitter.
1.4.2. Con: The protests may not be solely motivated by China's infringements on the 'one country, two systems' policy, but rather by pro-independence forces. This means the protests would likely have occurred regardless of China's actions.
1.4.2.1. Pro: A Hong Kong [independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_independence) movement has formed since the Umbrella Protests in 2014 and 2015.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: In [2016](https://time.com/4440708/hong-kong-independence-china-localist/), the first pro-independence rally in Hong Kong took place.
1.4.2.2. Pro: A poll of people in Hong Kong aged 15 to 24 found that nearly [40%](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/25/17-hongkongers-support-independence-2047-especially-youth-cuhk-survery/) supported independence from China.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Although the protests were initially sparked by resistance to the [Extradition Amendment Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_protests), the legislation has since been withdrawn. The protesters demands now include calls for universal suffrage for elections for the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Unless direct elections are instituted in Hong Kong, it is [likely](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/hong-kong-beijing-will-choose-chinese-sovereignty-protests-china) that protests will continue to arise in the future.
1.4.2.4. Con: The protest is not related to pro-independence forces, but [5 demands](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695), where one of the demands is about universal suffrage for elections.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: [11% Hong Kong people support independence of Hong Kong](http://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B/20191030-%E6%B0%91%E8%AA%BF11%E6%B8%AF%E4%BA%BA%E8%B4%8A%E6%88%90%E7%8D%A8%E7%AB%8B-%E5%AD%B8%E8%80%85%E7%A8%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E7%9B%A4-%E7%B1%B2%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%8B%BF%E9%80%BC%E6%88%90%E4%B8%8D%E7%A9%A9%E5%AE%9A%E5%8A%9B%E9%87%8F), according to Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute \(HKPORI\)

1.4.2.5. Con: Pro-independence voices \(as well as the identity of HK people\) affected by multiple reasons, including infringement of "one country, two system", Chinese government/CCP political direction, the image/relationship of China-HK/China-International, etc. Therefore, the infringement itself not a sufficient condition to induce the protests.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.6.
1.4.3. Pro: The protests have caused immediate financial harm to Hong Kong, which will reverberate across China.
1.4.3.1. Con: According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Hong Kong received [US$62.9](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3027712/hong-kong-protests-fail-slow-citys-role-foreign-investment) billion in foreign investment in 2019 despite the ongoing protests.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Large foreign direct investment decisions typically involve [months](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3027712/hong-kong-protests-fail-slow-citys-role-foreign-investment) of planning meaning that the effect of the protests is unlikely to have been realized yet.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Hong Kong's local stock market has been fluctuating as a result of local instability.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The Hang Seng Index is down [3%](https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/3024301/hong-kongs-stock-market-has-always-bounced-back) since the first major march on June 9.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The MSCI Hang Seng Index dropped for a [ninth straight day](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3021482/hong-kong-stocks-see-longest-run-declines-two-decades-city), the longest such streak since 1997.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The [drop in tourism](https://www.piie.com/blogs/china-economic-watch/drop-tourism-threatening-hong-kongs-economy) as a result of the protests has hurt Hong Kong's economy.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: The number of tourists in August 2019 \(compared to August 2018\) has fallen by as much as [40%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-09/hong-kong-mall-owners-fall-as-tourism-arrivals-plunge-40).

1.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.4.3.6. Pro: There has been a [drop](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3017580/political-unrest-hitting-hong-kong-where-it-hurts) in consumer spending on non-essential goods, due to the reduced desire from consumers to shop in the midst of such serious violent. This is bad for local businesses.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: In August, retail sales in Hong Kong dipped by 23%, which was the [steepest decline on record](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-economy.html).
1.4.4. Pro: Future investments, particularly foreign investments, are likely to be curbed as a result of the unrest.
1.4.4.1. Con: Hong Kong has a long [history](https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3016815/hong-kong-protest-city/index.html) of large public protests, but still has received significant foreign investment.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: In 2014, protests across Hong Kong, known as the [Umbrella Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests), lasted for 80 days from 26 September to 15 December.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: In 2003, more than [500,000](https://time.com/5606212/hong-kong-history-mass-demonstrations-protest/) people in Hong Kong turned out for a march to protest against a change to the Constitution which would prohibit treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Chinese government.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: In 2018, Hong Kong was the world's [third](https://en.portal.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/hong-kong/foreign-investment) largest recipient of foreign direct investment.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.4.3. Con: Although the protests harm the businesses of Hong Kong, allowing China's infringement to go on will have even worse outcomes for businesses and the economy.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Hong Kong's stable investment environment, protected by fair, transparent courts that enforce long-established rule of law, has been [crucial](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/09/30/why-hong-kong-remains-vital-to-chinas-economy) in attracting foreign investments.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.5.3.1.1.
1.4.4.5. Pro: The recent unrest has made Hong Kong appear unsafe, which makes it a less appealing investment hub.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: [Geopolitical risks](https://www.thebalance.com/should-you-invest-in-foreign-countries-1978967) are an important criteria that investors evaluate when deciding where to invest. They can [result](https://www.thebalance.com/understanding-and-managing-political-risk-1979066) in a decline in [equity prices](https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Prices+of+Equity), reducing the return from investments.
1.4.4.5.2. Pro: The protests have been going on for nearly [3 months](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/18/752208633/protests-in-hong-kong-continue-remain-peaceful-throughout-the-weekend) now. The inability to resolve them thus far makes the future increasingly uncertain, especially given that the protests show no sign of waning.
1.4.4.5.3. Pro: The Legislative Council in Hong Kong was [vandalised](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3016839/protesters-storm-and-vandalise-legislative-council-anarchy).
1.4.4.5.3.1. Pro: [HK$10 million](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3017181/rampaging-protesters-shocking-trail-destruction-hong-kongs) \(US$1.28 million\) worth of damage was done to the Legislative Council complex.
1.4.4.5.3.2. Pro: Damage done to the Legislative Council [took the form](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3017181/rampaging-protesters-shocking-trail-destruction-hong-kongs) of smashed glass doors, broken monitors, electronic control panels and surveillance cameras wrenched from their positions.
1.4.4.5.4. Pro: There have been a number of [violent confrontations](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/13/asia/china-hong-kong-terrorism-intl-hnk/index.html) between the civilians of Hong Kong and the police.

1.4.5. Pro: Cracking down on protests will harm China's international reputation and image.
1.4.5.1. Pro: China's reputation has still not recovered from past incidents of repression that have painted it in a negative light. Undertaking further actions of repression is likely to damage its reputation further.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: The [2008 Tibetan unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Tibetan_unrest), in which [violence occurred](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/world/asia/30iht-china.4.11537294.html) between Chinese security forces and the protesting Tibetans, damaged China's reputation across the globe.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro: [Hundreds of protestors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reactions_to_2008_Tibetan_unrest#International_protests) gathered outside the Chinese embassy in Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK to highlight the violence occurring.
1.4.5.1.3. Pro: The Sunflower Student Movement caused a number of international bodies and countries, such as the US and Amnesty International, to [voice their concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_Student_Movement#Other_countries) regarding China's treatment of Taiwanese students.
1.4.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.4.5.1.5. Pro: China's reputation has not recovered because it continues to engage in incidents of repression.
1.4.5.2. Pro: World-wide public opinion on China's recent activity with regards to the protests is overwhelmingly negative.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: [Pro-Hong Kong rallies](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/09/hong-kong-public-opinion-beijing/599059/) have been taking place in cities across Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter have [removed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter.html?module=inline) hundreds of accounts on the grounds that they are attempts by the Chinese government to sow discord in Hong Kong. This is the first time such an action has been taken.
1.4.5.2.3. Pro: By [deploying hundreds of security officers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/world/asia/hong-kong-china-troops.html?module=inline) from the People’s Armed Police near Hong Kong, China is increasingly being viewed as a tyrannical state, bent on bullying Hong Kong.
1.4.5.2.4. Con: Even though the worldwide opinion regarding China is negative, a strategic response by China to counter this sentiment by ceasing all hostile actions could help reverse some of the damage that has been wreaked.
1.4.5.2.5. Pro: A [crowdfunding drive](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/25/hongkongers-raise-hk5m-front-page-newspaper-ads-urging-g20-action-extradition-crisis/) raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from more than 20,000 donors, paying for full-page ads in more than 10 major international newspapers, urging the G20 summit in Osaka to raise Hong Kong’s plight.
1.4.5.2.6. Pro: International calls to [boycott](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/soviet-union-china-hong-kong/595444/) the 2020 Winter Olympics in Beijing have increased since the protests in Hong Kong. A boycott on the Olympics would be damaging to China's international reputation.
1.4.5.3. Con: Even if cracking down on protests does some harm to China's international reputation and image, this may be a [manageable international repercussion](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/hong-kong-beijing-will-choose-chinese-sovereignty-protests-china) for China and hence an action Beijing is willing to take anyway.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: Russia intervened in both Georgia and Ukraine, and while it did face sanctions, Moscow retained a strong role in shaping the balance of power in the Middle East, and in standing up to shifts in US strategic posture. Therefore, China may feel that any [repercussions would be as manageable as they have been for Russia](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/hong-kong-beijing-will-choose-chinese-sovereignty-protests-china).
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: The growing collaboration between Russia and China in reshaping the global order to better fit their worldview may embolden China to feel confident that [Moscow will insulate China](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/hong-kong-beijing-will-choose-chinese-sovereignty-protests-china) from any significant United Nations actions.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: The [waning willingness of Western countries](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/hong-kong-beijing-will-choose-chinese-sovereignty-protests-china) to pursue purely ideological policies may provide Beijing with a sense of greater room to maneuver with respect to its handling of the Hong Kong protests.
1.4.5.3.3.1. Pro: [57%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/14/where-americans-and-europeans-agree-disagree-on-foreign-policy/) of Americans believe that the US should deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with their problems, and just 37% think the US should help other countries solve their problems.
1.4.5.3.3.2. Pro: A waning willingness to pursue purely ideological foreign policies may be a product of a [waning belief in their national influence](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/14/where-americans-and-europeans-agree-disagree-on-foreign-policy/).
1.4.5.3.3.3. Pro: Some say that [Brexit](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2018/12/brexit-means-return-isolationist-politics-1930s) marks a shift in UK politics towards isolationism.
1.4.5.3.4. Con: Cracking down on the protests could harm the reputation of China's leader, Xi Jinping.
1.4.5.3.4.1. Pro: Under Xi Jinping's leadership China has been more [directly](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/16/china-hong-kong-xi-jinping) intervening in Hong Kong. Therefore any actions in Hong Kong will be seen to reflect on him.
1.4.5.3.4.2. Pro: Xi Jinping is [hesitant](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/if-china-cracks-down-on-hong-kong-the-world-has-few-options.html) to use force to crack down the protests in Hong Kong because it would potentially mean putting an end to any possibility of Taiwan’s voluntary reunification with China, under a deal similar to the one struck with Hong Kong.
1.4.5.3.5. Con: Sending in the People's Liberation Army \(PLA\) to crack down on protests in Hong Kong would also likely affect the [global financial industry](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/if-china-cracks-down-on-hong-kong-the-world-has-few-options.html), of which Hong Kong remains a major hub.
1.5. Pro: A respectful country should keep her promise to the people.
1.5.1. Pro: Keeping promises enhances the trust between the authority and people, which is beneficial to the country.
1.5.2. Pro: The government has a moral responsibility to keep her promises
1.5.3. Pro: The country, or the government as the actor, has greater power and influences compared with the people. Thus, if the government were to break their promises, it may have a major impact on the consequences
1.6. Pro: Chinese attempts to infringe on the 'one country, two systems' policy allow other actors to gain increasing influence in the region, a move that is likely to threaten China's control over the region.
1.6.1. Pro: The Chinese infringement on the Hong Kong policy allowed the United States to increasingly support democratic rights in Hong Kong as part of its broader efforts to [undermine](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/world/asia/china-hong-kong-protests.html) the Communist Party and increase their stronghold in China.
1.6.1.1. Con: In August, President Trump described the Hong Kong protests as "riots", thereby [adopting China's rhetoric](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric).
1.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.1.3. Con: In August, President Trump said that the "riots" in Hong Kong were an [internal matter for China](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-trump/trump-says-its-up-to-china-to-deal-with-hong-kong-riots-idUSKCN1US0OR) to deal with. This indicates that the US is disinclined to get involved, let alone actively undermine China through the protests.
1.6.1.4. Pro: The [US Congress](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3022963/us-congress-support-hong-kong-protests-adds-pressure-white) supports the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: US politicians are calling for the [Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3022963/us-congress-support-hong-kong-protests-adds-pressure-white) to be passed, which would direct various US departments to assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong's [unique treatment under US law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act).
1.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: If Hong Kong were to lose its special trading status under the [Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act), then the Chinese economy would suffer. Therefore, this Act could undermine China.
1.6.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Susan Thornton, who served as acting Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said passing the Act would be a “[huge mistake](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/09/hong-kong-democracy-bill-trump-official-043688)” because ''Beijing would like nothing more than the US to remove Hong Kong’s special status." Therefore, it would not undermine China.
1.6.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.6.1.4.1.2. Pro: Many Hong Kong protesters [support](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/americas-role-hong-kong/597976/) the [Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act#Reactions) as it would allow the US further means to defend the territory’s freedoms and autonomy against China.
1.6.1.4.1.3. Pro: The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act provides for [sanctions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-15/u-s-house-passes-bill-aimed-at-supporting-hong-kong-protests) against officials “responsible for undermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong.”
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: The US House of Representatives passed [three bills](https://time.com/5701591/house-3-bills-support-protests-hong-kong/) in 2019, aimed at showing U.S. support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
1.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: One of the bills passed by the US House of Representatives [recognizes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/house-approves-hong-kong-bills-boost-protesters-191016005623109.html) Hong Kong's relationship to the US and condemns Beijing's "interference" in its affairs, while supporting the right of the city's residents to protest.
1.6.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.4.1.3.
1.6.1.4.2.3. Pro: The [Protect Hong Kong Act](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-15/u-s-house-passes-bill-aimed-at-supporting-hong-kong-protests) halted the export to Hong Kong of crowd-control devices such as tear gas and rubber bullets, to prevent police in Hong Kong from using those non-lethal weapons on protesters.
1.6.1.5. Con: US interests in China appear to [extend](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/if-china-cracks-down-on-hong-kong-the-world-has-few-options.html) no further than the rapidly escalating trade war that both countries are involved in.
1.6.1.6. Con: President Trump has [reportedly](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-xi-jinping-soften-hong-kong-criticism-trade-talks-report-2019-7?r=US&IR=T) told US officials to hold back on any criticism over Chinese actions in Hong Kong. In return China has agreed to reopen trade negotiations with the US.
1.6.2. Con: Infringing on the 'one country, two systems' policy is unlikely to substantially threaten China's economic control over the region because [China dominates Asian economies](https://www.nationthailand.com/breakingnews/30354022).
1.6.2.1. Pro: As of 2018, China has the [highest GDP](http://statisticstimes.com/economy/asian-countries-by-gdp.php) among all Asian countries.
1.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.
