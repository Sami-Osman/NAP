Discussion Name: Should higher education be publicly funded?

1. Higher education should be publicly funded.
1.1. Pro: Publicly funded higher education would lead to a more well-educated population, which has social and economic benefits.
1.1.1. Pro: Having a more educated population brings societal benefits.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Members of a society should help fund the benefits of living in the society, even if they do not personally use all of those benefits.
1.1.1.2. Con: This assumes there is unlimited amount of money to support all students. Given a [finite amount of available money](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-funding-statistics) to spend, it is more beneficial to distribute it to fund the fields or students that need it the most.
1.1.1.3. Con: In Germany one can stay in school as long as they maintain good grades. So, many of the smartest stay in school getting multiple doctorates. This is personally satisfying to them but denies society their best productive years.
1.1.1.4. Pro: A more educated population is likely to be [happier](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/17/does-getting-a-college-degree-make-you-happier.html)(“Education is probably more strongly correlated with future happiness throughout adulthood than any other variable,” according to Jeffrey Arnett, developmental psychologist and professor of psychology at Clark University. Happiness, in this case, is defined as satisfaction with the way one’s life is going.\n\nResearch suggests that the more education you have, the happier you tend to be.).
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Everybody is happy when the eat ice cream. Everyone should eat ice cream all the time so everybody can be happy all the time. But people have regret for the degree they received. [Major Regret](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/02/college-major-regrets/)
1.1.1.5. Pro: A more educated society is likely to have [lower levels of crime](https://criminal-justice.iresearchnet.com/crime/education-and-crime/4/)(Comparisons of state-level education data and crime and incarceration rates have consistently supported the fact that states that have focused the most on education \(in general, financial support\) tend to have lower rates of violent crime and incarceration. Although education can never be viewed as a “cure all” or magic bullet that will guarantee reductions in criminal activity or crime rates, research suggests that increased investments in quality education can have a positive public safety benefit.).
1.1.2. Con: Having a well-educated population is possible without publicly funding higher education.
1.1.2.1. Pro: People can use the Internet for personal research about the subjects they're interested in learning.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Students can learn for free with [open courseware](https://www.oeconsortium.org/) and get college credits through massively open online courses \([MOOCs](https://www.mooc.org/)\).
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Online courses are yet to build a reputation that is solid enough for them to be relevant or compete with actual university degrees and certificates.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many employers would still hire a graduate from a mid-tier university over a person with an online degree from a prestigious university.
1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: As quality improves, online degrees are increasingly being respected and even [preferred](https://www.inc.com/quora/are-online-mbas-a-good-idea-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html)(In the past, online MBA programs weren't as well-respected, but now this is changing. Employers often prefer that their workers attend an online MBA program because it gives them the flexibility and freedom to work and study at the same time. Many top universities offer great MBA programs online now.) by employers.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Most of these courses are not recognized for certification unless the student pays for it.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The courses offered through MOOCs that are both free and will earn college credits are limited.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: There are at least [800](https://www.classcentral.com/report/free-for-credit-moocs/) free online courses that offer college credit.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: It is often [difficult to judge](https://medium.com/swlh/dont-trust-the-internet-ever-8ef49fb5c19e)(This ignorance is everywhere on the Internet. And most of the time, as curious consumers looking for information, we are not informed enough to notice.) the accuracy of information on the internet. Without a trustworthy teacher, people could become more misinformed by learning online.
1.1.2.2. Pro: There are many [scholarships](https://www.scholarships.com/) that are available for a number of different criteria. This renders public funding unnecessary.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Scholarships are limited in number, which means some students will not be able to receive necessary funding.
1.1.2.3. Con: These alternatives may not be as easily accessible as public universities.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Most people in developed countries have access to the Internet's powerful tools and breadth of resources on all subjects.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Alternatives to publicly funded, formal education might not be conducive for people with physical or intellectual disabilities.
1.1.2.4. Pro: The military will [pay for one's schooling](https://www.todaysmilitary.com/education-training/paying-college) if one signs up with a branch of service.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: It is unethical for a country to force its youth to work for the military in exchange for education.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: In the US, the military only pays up to [$4,500 per year](https://www.studentdebtrelief.us/news/does-the-military-pay-for-college/)(The eligibility requirements vary by branch and the total cannot exceed $4,500 per fiscal year.) for education, which [less than one tenth](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-50-most-expensive-colleges-in-america/)(Harvey Mudd is California's most expensive college. The school in Claremont costs students $77,339 per year.) of some universities' expenses.
1.1.3. Con: Having more youth in enrolled in higher education could produce unintended negative consequences.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The majority of people wait until they have a job to have children. Increasing the number of people in school will decrease the number of babies.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Increasing the student population will not decrease the number of babies; people who want children will still have them. It will only increase the number of highly educated parents.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Most people prefer to wait until they have a steady job to have children, as doing so comes with [significant financial burdens](https://equitablegrowth.org/having-a-child-comes-with-significant-financial-consequences/)(Any parent can tell you that children are expensive. Childcare, the endless diaper supply, and cute onesies add up to a startling $12,500 in the first year alone, according to the most recent figure from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.).
1.1.3.1.2. Con: This is a good thing, as human [overpopulation](https://www.populationmedia.org/blog/overpopulation-cause-and-effect), not under-population, is a threat to humanity and all the other species on the planet.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Many wealthy countries are facing population decline due, in part, to women [waiting longer](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/27/opinion/falling-birthrate-women-babies.html) to have children, as their educational and employment opportunities have improved.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Many of these [countries](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/24/791132555/japans-births-decline-to-lowest-number-on-record) have such [low birth rates](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46118103) that it poses serious demographic and economic challenges.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Free college will discourage many people from working right after high school. Therefore, there will be fewer workers.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Automation and robotics will [reduce the need](https://www.zdnet.com/article/automation-could-make-12-million-jobs-redundant-heres-whos-most-at-risk/) for an uneducated workforce anyway. Workers need the education and skills they get from higher learning to remain productive.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: With free education, those who want to attend but normally cannot afford to will go. This is likely to decrease those who enter the workforce.
1.1.3.3. Pro: In many countries, attending college is associated with [high levels of alcohol consumption](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/college-drinking)(Drinking at college has become a ritual that students often see as an integral part of their higher education experience. Some students come to college with established drinking habits, and the college environment can lead to a problem. According to a national survey, almost 53 percent of full-time college students ages 18 to 22 drank alcohol in the past month and about 33 percent engaged in binge drinking during that same time frame.). Having more students in this kind of environment can lead to higher levels of alcohol abuse.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: This can be solved by better alcohol-related policies and behavior, not by limiting access to higher education.
1.1.3.4. Con: Measures could be taken to mitigate any negative consequences while still allowing people free access to higher education.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Policy makers are elected to fix problems that arise from ever-changing social conditions. It is likely that they will find a way to fix whatever problems arise from publicly funded higher education.
1.1.4. Pro: An educated population is [essential](https://verdict.justia.com/2012/03/29/an-educated-population-is-essential-to-a-nations-prosperity-yet-some-politicians-are-demonizing-our-educational-system-for-political-advantage) to a nation's economic prosperity.
1.1.4.1. Pro: If we want the future to be better than the present, we need to fund the education of future generations, or they will lack the ability to improve society.
1.1.4.2. Con: Many factors contribute to a nation's economic prosperity. Having a well educated population does not guarantee economic success.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The number of PhD recipients in the US has [grown for decades](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/12/03/survey-shows-annual-decline-number-phds-awarded), and yet the US has seen [living standards fall](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-09-11/a-global-anomaly-the-us-declines-in-annual-quality-of-life-report) and GDP [shrink relative to competitors](https://www.voanews.com/a/chinas-economy-could-overtake-us-economy-by-2030/6380892.html) like China.
1.1.4.3. Pro: A well-educated population provides a more competitive capitalistic environment, with more people having the tools and knowledge to innovate.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Higher public education improves the employability of all youth beyond basic knowledge.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: For most jobs, employability can be better improved by [hands-on experience](https://newschoolarch.edu/blog/what-are-the-benefits-of-hands-on-learning/) rather than more classroom education.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Higher education can teach skills like [time management](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_00.htm) and [working in groups](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/benefits-of-group-work/) that can be beneficial to future jobs.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: Capitalistic doesn't always mean good, as an overly competitive society has [drawbacks](https://adelphipsych.sg/how-is-excessive-competitiveness-harming-you/). Updating skills and methods is healthy, but hyper-competition is not.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: A well-educated population is more likely to find and nurture the hidden talents that make the country economically competitive and successful.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Publicly funded education broadens the pool of potential geniuses and innovators. This advances technological development and promotes new perspectives in academia.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Pro: Students would be able to follow their passions, as opposed to studying what will give them the fattest paycheck.
1.1.4.3.3.2.1. Con: Having free higher education does not mean that people would pursue their passions. Many people attend state-funded education systems to study subjects for primarily financial goals, regardless of the fact that their education is free.
1.1.4.3.3.2.1.1. Con: By definition, people would prefer to study their passions, and good societies are defined by their ability to aid the pursuit of happiness.
1.1.4.3.3.2.2. Con: If this is true, then it would cause further damage to public finances, as graduates would earn less, pay less tax, and generally be less of an asset to the economy.
1.1.4.3.3.2.2.1. Con: This rests on the assumption that students cannot be productive members of society whilst pursuing their passions.
1.1.4.3.3.2.2.2. Con: Even if those graduates earn less and are less of an asset to the economy, this can open up the opportunity for someone more passionate about a higher paying field, who will be a bigger asset to the economy.
1.1.5. Pro: One condition for funding any education should be to teach methods. The methods USA should use are ones countries that are ranked first or second in ranking. Those teachers that can adapt to the new method will be rewarded. [Teaching Science](https://www.quantamagazine.org/math-and-science-teachers-pencils-down-20161011/) \(December 6 update: In the [2015 assessment released today](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/PISA-2015-United-States.pdf), the United States ranked 19th in science and 31st in math out of 35 OECD countries.\)
1.2. Pro: Publicly funded schooling would give equal access to education and makes for a more fair and equal society.
1.2.1. Con: Higher education funding benefits the already privileged.
1.2.1.1. Con: This is only true in the areas where there are elite programs. When education is free and open to everybody, this can't happen, as the selection process won't be about grades and profiles.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Students who have had better-quality education throughout their lives prior to higher education are [much more likely](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/3/20/18271462/college-admissions-race-stuyvesant-affirmative-action-inequality) to achieve the academic success needed to access free higher education. This will thus only perpetuate a lack of social mobility within education.
1.2.1.3. Con: The high cost of degree-level education blocks access to the economically disadvantaged, maintaining class barriers, as people cannot gain economic advantages from higher education.
1.2.2. Pro: Publicly funded higher education is essential to ensure a fair and equal society, where children from wealthier backgrounds don't have more opportunities through the education system.
1.2.2.1. Con: Children from wealthier backgrounds will still have more opportunities in the form of [extracurricular activities](https://phys.org/news/2019-07-huge-disparities-extra-curricular-social-background.html)(Children from the wealthiest backgrounds are three times more likely to take music classes out of school hours than those from the poorest families and there is a 20 percent participation gap in sport, new research shows.) than poorer children.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Publicly funding education would allow people to pursue extracurricular activities without financial strain. This would allow college graduates to differentiate themselves from each other more clearly.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Educational inequalities can [hinder](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/the-costs-of-inequality-educations-the-one-key-that-rules-them-all/) a country's development by preventing large portions of the population from acquiring necessary life skills.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: No amount of money spent on a defective system will achieve goals stated. Source cited says "If inequality starts anywhere, many scholars agree, it’s with faulty education". Faulty education is not linked to money.
1.2.2.3. Con: It is not a problem if some students have more opportunities than others at the higher education level, as long as all students have a base level of education.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: This will lead to a cycle in which students with fewer opportunities are relegated to lower paying jobs, regardless of their intellectual potential.
1.2.3. Pro: Public funding may mitigate the increase in the cost of higher education.
1.2.3.1. Con: The cost of attending a university makes students more accountable to their work. They work harder because they paid for it.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Paying an excessive amount for higher education makes students more [depressed](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10597-016-0052-0)(Greater financial difficulties predicted greater depression and stress cross-sectionally, and also predicted poorer anxiety, global mental health and alcohol dependence over time. Depression worsened over time for those who had considered abandoning studies or not coming to university for financial reasons, and there were effects for how students viewed their student loan. Anxiety and alcohol dependence also predicted worsening financial situation suggesting a bi-directional relationship. Financial difficulties appear to lead to poor mental health in students with the possibility of a vicious cycle occurring.) than accountable.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Free college will encourage some people to go just because they don’t want to work. They are unlikely to make much effort there if they lack the motivation to learn.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Just because college would be free doesn't mean that anyone could get in. Potential students would still have to demonstrate that they have the intellectual ability to attend.
1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Free higher education would mean that students would enter university on merit alone. This would mean that students would work harder because they would know they cannot buy their way into university.
1.2.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Students with independent motivation to learn should be prioritized over those with a solely financial motivation.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: In many cases, students take out federally subsidized student loans, and so they don't feel the immediate impact of the cost of attending.
1.2.3.1.4. Con: Existing evidence suggests that students who do not pay for their education do not work less hard.
1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: Many public school students work hard and go on to [achieve great things](https://www.self.com/gallery/public-school), despite not paying for their education.
1.2.3.1.4.2. Pro: Students whose parents pay for their tuition are still capable of working hard. Only poor students that pay for their own loans would have to handle the additional financial burden.
1.2.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Poorer students are already expected to work harder due to often coming from a non-academic environment.
1.2.3.2. Con: [Fiscally conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism) organisations, such as the GOP in America, would make it politically difficult to enact.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Almost all legislation faces opposition by rival political parties. This is a natural outcome of politics and not a reason to abandon policy making in general.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Costs of higher education in places with limited public funding, such as America, have [risen](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2017-09-20/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities) over the past several decades
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Increases in the cost of [tuition](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/how-much-college-tuition-has-increased-from-1988-to-2018.html) have been offset by corresponding increases in median household income. Thus, the increase in the cost of college education has not been dramatic.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Between 1980 and 2020, the average cost of higher education in America [rose 169%](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/college-tuition-inflation/)(Between 1980 and 2020, the average price of tuition, fees, and room and board for an undergraduate degree increased 169%, according to a recent report from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.).
1.2.4. Con: Publicly funding higher education will not make a huge difference. Inequalities would have been entrenched in primary and secondary schooling by then.
1.2.4.1. Con: It might not make a huge difference, but it might make a very significant difference to individuals who can go on to achieve great things.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Even an incremental improvement in the education of less favored groups of people would decrease the number of people with high potential for achievement who are prevented from contributing to society.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Even with the restrictions on primary and secondary education of African-Americans in the US during the [segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_segregation_in_the_United_States) years, there were still brilliant people who were able to achieve higher education.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Studies have [found](https://www.epi.org/publication/education-inequalities-at-the-school-starting-gate/)(Using data from two academic cohorts, the kindergarten classes of 1998 and 2010, this study examines the relationship between children’s socioeconomic status \(SES\) and their cognitive and noncognitive skills when starting school. We find that large performance gaps exist between children in the lowest and highest socioeconomic-status \(SES\) quintiles and that these gaps have persisted from the 1998 cohort to the 2010 cohort.) that inequalities in education achievement become noticeable as early as kindergarten.
1.2.5. Con: It is more like separate but equal. Those that can afford private school that do not follow teaching fads and those that have their [children's futures destroyed by public education teaching fads](https://time.com/6205084/phonics-science-of-reading-teachers/)(Now Weaver is heading up a campaign to get his old school district to reinstate many of the methods that teachers resisted so strongly: specifically, systematic and consistent instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics. “In Oakland, when you have 19% of Black kids reading—that can’t be maintained in the society,” says Weaver, who received an early and vivid lesson in the value of literacy in 1984 after his cousin got out of prison and told him the other inmates stopped harassing him when they realized he could read their mail to them. “It has been an unmitigated disaster.” In January 2021, the local branch of the NAACP filed an administrative petition with the Oakland unified school district \(OUSD\) to ask it to include “explicit instruction for phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension” in its curriculum.).
1.3. Con: Tax payers should not have to pay for someone else to go to school.
1.3.1. Con: If tax payer money can be used to finance wars and build weapons, it should also go towards education and other productive sectors.
1.3.1.1. Con: Defense spending is necessary for a country's survival. Without viable defenses, there is no guarantee that a population will survive long enough to become educated.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Very few countries face existential threats in the modern world. It could be possible to reduce defense spending and still survive long enough to be educated.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Few countries face existential threats because they have the means to defend themselves, not because there are no threats.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Enhanced deterrence capabilities likely [prevented nuclear war](https://www.britannica.com/topic/mutual-assured-destruction) during the Cold War.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The US spends [$669 billion](https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics)(Public education spending in the United States falls short of global benchmarks and lags behind economic growth; K-12 schools spend $666.9 billion or $13,185 per pupil annually.) on public education annually, and [$773 billion](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2980014/the-department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2023-defense-budg/)(I am proud to join President Biden today in submitting the fiscal year 2023 Budget. Our department’s budget will help us continue to defend the nation, take care of our people and succeed through teamwork with our allies and partners. \n\nThis $773 billion budget request reinforces our commitment to the concept of integrated deterrence, allows us to better sequence and conduct operations around the globe that are aligned to our priorities, modernizes the Joint Force, and delivers meaningful support for our dedicated workforce and their families.) on defense \(for 2023\). If the defense budget shrank, more of this could be allocated to education.
1.3.1.3. Con: Agreed. just need to amend the constitution.
1.3.2. Pro: College is not for everyone. This would be apportioning taxpayer money to benefit one specific group unfairly and counterposed to the general public good.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Too many people [drop out](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40) before finishing a four year degree, which is money wasted.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: If a student learns something during their time in college, it is still valuable, even if they don't graduate.
1.3.2.2. Con: Publicly funded higher education would not be forced on anyone who didn't want to attend. If few people want to attend college, then few public resources would be needed.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Some people want to do jobs that don't require a college education, such as owning their own business.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Several college drop outs became [successful entrepreneurs](https://yourstory.com/2019/08/college-dropouts-successful-startup-entrepreneurs/amp).
1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: These examples are extreme outliers. The vast majority of of college drop outs [do not](https://www.thebalance.com/the-cost-of-college-dropout-4174303)(College dropouts earn, on average, $21,000 less per year than college grads. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that, in 2019, college grads with a bachelor's degree earned $34.63 per hour on average, while those holding advanced degrees earned an average of $45.07 per hour. Comparatively, workers with only some college education earned an average of $20.97 per hour. Those are big differences that can add up to a substantial amount of money throughout a working career.) earn as much as those who graduate.
1.3.3. Con: Taxpayers already do pay for others to go to school, and the system generally [works well](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/countries-seen-to-have-well-developed-public-education-systems).
1.3.3.1. Pro: People already have to pay for many things that benefit people other than themselves; the amount they pay is [dependent on their income](https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/) in many countries.
1.3.3.2. Pro: In many American states, [taxpayers already contribute](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/californians-pay-states-public-colleges-increasingly-cant-get) to public universities. Thus, public state universities are publicly funded, though percentages of operating budget vary from state to state.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Full tuition for two year community/technical college already exists in [Tennessee](http://tnpromise.gov/about.shtml).
1.3.3.3. Con: In places like America, the public education system is already [underfunded](https://tcf.org/content/about-tcf/tcf-study-finds-u-s-schools-underfunded-nearly-150-billion-annually/?agreed=1)(The United States is underfunding its K-12 public schools by nearly $150 billion annually, robbing more than 30 million school children of the resources they need to succeed in the classroom, according to a new, first-of-its-kind study released today by The Century Foundation \(TCF\). School districts with high concentrations of Latinx and Black students are much more likely to be underfunded than majority white districts, and face much wider funding gaps, an average deficit of more than $5,000 per student, the analysis finds.). If the system was extended to include higher education, it would be too costly.
1.3.3.4. Con: School system works well for other things than [education](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/).
1.3.4. Pro: Publicly funding higher education costs too much money and will harm the economy.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Global government debt is on an [unsustainable path](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/government-debt-tab-hits-66-trillion-80percent-of-global-gdp-fitch-says.html). If governments can't control their budget deficits, publicly funded higher education will only be temporarily available until lenders lose confidence in governments' ability to pay back the debt.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Adding a school tax will not make a huge difference to the wealthy, but would have a significant impact on lower-income families who would not otherwise have been able to afford to send their child to university.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Governments should adopt need based scholarships rather than blanket public funding, which will make sure targeted help reaches the needy.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: There are [options](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26957757) that both provide access to further education for all who meet the academic criteria, while ensuring that the taxpayer is not unfairly burdened.
1.3.4.3. Con: Government funded higher education is costly for the taxpayer, but [not nearly as costly as ignorance](https://www.voanews.com/a/schoolchildren-uneducated-primary-study-africa-asia-gdp-economic-education/1795437.html).
1.3.4.4. Pro: Developing countries cannot afford to fund higher education.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Developing countries, in addition to being poorer, often have [younger populations](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226158/median-age-of-the-population-of-africa/)(In 2020, the median age in Africa was 19.7 years, meaning that half of the population was older and half was younger than that age. The median age on the continent increased compared to 2000, when it was around 18 years. Africa is the youngest continent in the world and present the highest share of inhabitants aged 14 years and younger, that is, 41 percent of the total population. Niger, Uganda, and Mali were the countries with the youngest population in Africa as of 2021.), meaning that there would be an outsized burden to fund higher education for this age cohort.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: Funding can come in the form of loans from international lenders like the IMF or World Bank.
1.3.4.5. Con: Offering free education has been successful in some countries, so it has the potential to be advantageous in other countries.
1.3.4.5.1. Pro: New Zealand has recently made the [first year](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/fees-and-money-matters/fees-free-first-year-of-study.html) of university free.
1.3.4.5.2. Pro: In [Germany](https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-germany) and [Austria](https://www.educations.com/study-guides/europe/study-in-austria/tuition-fees-3798) there are no or virtually no tuition fees.
1.3.4.6. Con: The economy also suffers as students fail to pay their debts, an [increasing occurrence](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/this-is-how-student-loan-debt-became-a-1point7-trillion-crisis.html) as fees rise.
1.3.4.6.1. Pro: Without the burden of student debt, graduates will spend more money improving the economy.
1.3.4.6.1.1. Con: This assumes that money is better for the economy in the hands of graduates than it is in the hands of the government.
1.3.4.6.1.2. Pro: A large chunk of graduates with student debt [delay starting their own businesses.](http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/186179/student-loan-debt-major-barrier-entrepreneurship.aspx)
1.3.5. Con: This argument depends on the protection of private property having a basis in morality. This is something that’s very difficult to justify philosophically.
1.3.5.1. Con: Private property has been [present](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/property/#HistOver)(There are extensive discussions of property in the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hegel, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Marx, and Mill.) in virtually all advanced human societies, indicating that it is a universal aspect of human nature.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Children as young as two [recognize](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Elsevier/Kanngiesser_Young_CogDev_2014_1896579.pdf)(Two- and 3-year-olds thus showed an appreciation of ownership\nrights for their own newly made objects. While 3-year-olds under-\nstood third party ownership, they may have lacked the motivation\nto intervene in ownership rights violations involving a third party.) ownership rights, highlighting the fundamental nature of this concept \(p. 30\).
1.3.5.2. Con: There is no reason for laws to be justified philosophically, as long as they provide practical benefits.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Private property rights are [human-made concepts](https://evonomics.com/ownership-evolution-property/)(Animals don’t own property. Ever. They can and do possess and control goods and territories \(possession and control are importantly distinct\), but they never “own” things. Ownership is a uniquely human construct.) and are therefore arbitrary and subject to change.
1.4. Con: Publicly funded education is less efficient and less effective that privately funded education.
1.4.1. Pro: The government will always have a motive to indoctrinate people in certain ways, and if they fund higher education there will be no way to challenge them.
1.4.1.1. Con: Educated individuals are more likely to spot misinformation and research to find the truth when presented with it.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: If government funded education indoctrinates an individual from primary school onward, they would not be capable of identifying misinformation or challenging accepted orthodoxy.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Allowing the government too much control over the funding of education would also grant them inordinate power over what constitutes education.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Some countries have attempted to [whitewash atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_history_textbook_controversies) committed throughout the nation's history by removing or minimizing these events in history textbooks.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: This could be prevented by having a decentralized or independent educational institution approve the course materials.
1.4.1.3. Pro: In China, where higher education is [mostly publicly funded](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2016/08/29/why-china-doesnt-have-a-student-debt-problem/), the government [heavily indoctrinates](https://www.asianews.it/news-en/Political-indoctrination-in-Chinese-universities-40561.html) students to follow the Chinese Communist Party.
1.4.1.4. Con: A well educated population will help strengthen and stabilize a country's democracy.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: A more educated population can make more informed decisions about matters related to public policy.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: There are huge differences between what one learns in their higher education courses. A law, sociology, or economics degree is far more helpful in understanding public discourse and public policy than a degree in chemistry or the arts.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: Education helps counteract the [Dunning-Krueger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), making people less ignorant and more likely to know what they don't know. This would result in a populace more committed to reading about issues in the public discourse and more inclined to consider the arguments of experts.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Being highly educated doesn't necessarily correlate with being well versed on public policy.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: A person could be brilliant at engineering, for example, but have no deep understanding of the social science issues that dominate most policies.
1.4.1.4.1.3. Pro: People should support other peoples' education because in a democracy, everyone has an interest in others' decision-making abilities during elections.
1.4.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Society would be better off with a more educated population that could focus on proactive answers to the world's problems rather than going into the best paid jobs just to pay off their education.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: A well educated populace can generally engage with logical arguments better than a less-educated populace.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: In the field of politics, people often make decisions based on their [emotions and values](https://microeconomicinsights.org/moral-values-and-voting/)(What roles do moral values play in elections, and how do politicians appeal to them? To examine these questions, this research introduces a core idea of modern moral psychology into the study of political economy. People may endorse “universalist” values, such as individual rights, justice, and impartial fairness, or more “communal” concepts, such as community, loyalty, betrayal, respect, and tradition.\n\nThis may help in understanding election outcomes.) instead of pure logic and rationality.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Political ideology is often [affected](https://www.ushistory.org/gov/4b.asp) by personality traits, social environment, group membership, and self interest.
1.4.1.4.3. Con: This assumes that democracy is preferable to alternative political systems, which is not proven.
1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Having more democracies would likely [reduce](https://www.thoughtco.com/democratic-peace-theory-4769410)(The Democratic Peace Theory states that countries with liberal democratic forms of government are less likely to go to war with one another than those with other forms of government.) the number of wars and make the world more peaceful.
1.4.1.4.3.2. Con: Democracy is preferable because it gives people a greater amount of freedom than autocracies, but still prevents the excessive and lawless freedom of anarchic systems.
1.4.1.4.3.3. Pro: Some scholars have [argued](https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/articles/the-falling-star-called-democracy/)(Some of us have been brought up with the accepted wisdom that, starting under the ancient Greeks, democracy has been the best system in the world. Indeed, among the top ten most competitiveness economies in the 2016 IMD World Competitiveness rankings, only two economies \(Hong Kong and Singapore\) are not full democracies. Yet the data shows that today the world is less, not more, democratic than it was 10 years ago; the countries whose competitiveness has improved the most in that period are non-democratic. And these—Singapore and the UAE—are role models for many public-sector officials around the world.) that full democracy is not preferable to more authoritarian systems.
1.4.1.4.3.4. Pro: People in many countries are [increasingly dissatisfied](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/31/the-countries-where-people-are-most-dissatisfied-with-how-democracy-is-working/)(Across 27 nations surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2018, people were more dissatisfied than satisfied with the way democracy is working in their country. This held especially true in a dozen countries where negative views of democracy outpaced positive by more than 10 percentage points.) with how their democracies are functioning.
1.4.1.5. Con: A policy of public funding may be developed without censorship or political propaganda by forbidding institutionalized control of the educational content itself.
1.4.2. Pro: Attempting to force universities and colleges into lowering costs could result in poorer quality institutions, fewer places, and less successful research.
1.4.2.1. Pro: This would cause the standard of the institution to lower, since the government will continually attempt to minimize costs.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Depending on the political ideology of the administration in power, government spending on education is just as likely to [increase](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/house-democrats-pitch-massive-funding-increase-in-latest-education-spending-bill/2021/07)(The fiscal 2022 spending legislation for the U.S. Department of Education, released Sunday by a House appropriations subcommittee, is a dramatic departure from past spending bills that typically provided incremental increases for education programs. It shows that House Democrats endorse the President Joe Biden’s call for a huge influx of new federal money for schools to help them address the affects of the coronavirus pandemic.) as it is to decrease.
1.4.2.2. Pro: When the government gets involved in funding issues, it becomes bureaucratic, slow, and has the potential to be come biased.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Many school districts in America are [burdened](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/Commentary/The-bureaucratic-skim-of-federal-school-funding.htm)(It takes more than $50 million a year for hundreds of Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction staff to manage the hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds that flow to local school districts around the state, budget figures indicate.\n\nThe figures — which don’t include spending or staff devoted to grant administration in either Washington, D.C., or in local school districts — bolster arguments by those who say the state educational system is too burdened by paperwork and diverts resources that could be better used to help students and to assist their teachers.) by excessive bureaucracy that undermines educational outcomes.
1.4.2.3. Con: This assumes a correlation between lowering costs and public funding that may not be accurate.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Private universities are reliant on tuition fees and donations that could leave them economically vulnerable.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: Several smaller private colleges have gone [bankrupt](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/more-colleges-face-bankruptcy-but-top-schools-experience-record-wealth.html) in the US in recent years.
1.4.3. Con: The source of funding does not make a difference to the quality of the education provided.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Some of the world's [greatest universities](https://worldscholarshub.com/top-40-public-universities-in-the-world/) are funded, at least in part, by the public.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: One's persons public funding is another's cohersion
1.4.3.2. Con: The source of funding is inherently linked to the values that the source holds. This could compromise education if a society is dominated by views that are inherently anti-education.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Some countries promote [religious dogma](https://www.atheistalliance.org/blog/islamic-indoctrination-in-iranian-schools/) in public education that is anathema to the scientific and fact-based education of secular systems.
1.4.4. Pro: The monopoly of elementary, middle and high school do not use funds to ignite the desire for learning in students as a whole. [https://www.quantamagazine.org/science-evolves-will-science-education-20161012/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/science-evolves-will-science-education-20161012/)
1.4.5. Pro: In the [knowledge economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowledge-economy.asp)(The knowledge economy is a system of consumption and production that is based on intellectual capital. In particular, it refers to the ability to capitalize on scientific discoveries and applied research.\n\nThe knowledge economy represents a large share of the activity in most highly developed economies. In a knowledge economy, a significant component of value may consist of intangible assets such as the value of its workers' knowledge or intellectual property.), rapid change to educational programs is valuable, yet public funding creates transaction costs to change via oversight and administration.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Public higher education would not be subject to pressures to improve itself, as educational outcomes would not influence a given program and its managers as much as private enterprises in a free marketplace.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Publicly funded programs do work in certain areas, including in [cutting edge scientific research](https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-020-00213-8).
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Education is a field that needs [constant innovation](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-next-gen-innovations-education-sphere/) and adjustment to the demand for different kinds of training in the marketplace. Public universities are far less likely to adapt to that change since there is no administration for whom it is in their self-interest to do so.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Individual professors are likely to continually innovate, as this will improve their academic reputation.
1.4.5.2. Con: This argument is based on the premise that value is defined by financial return, as opposed to the value added to a society by a well-educated population.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: A well-educated population is defined by the people being educated in topics and skills that are relevant to their time. Having a population educated on outdated or irrelevant ideas is bad, both socially and economically.
1.4.5.3. Con: Educational programs can still change rapidly, and students can still take advantage of this change, under a publicly funding system.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: As long as individual institutions have control over how they allocate their funds, they will have the ability to rapidly refocus on achieving different educational outcomes.
1.5. Pro: Higher education is increasingly necessary to find a job. As a necessity, it should be publicly funded.
1.5.1. Con: Someone has to do the jobs that don’t require the kind of intelligence acquired by formal education.
1.5.1.1. Con: Having a higher education doesn't mean people won't find joy in more menial work. It just means that they will also have a higher education.
1.5.1.2. Con: Higher education doesn't need to be forced on those that don't want to do it. It should merely be an option available for those that do, but might not be able to afford it.
1.5.1.3. Pro: People with [learning disabilities](https://www.readandspell.com/jobs-for-people-with-down-syndrome) are increasingly being welcomed in the workplace, even if they do not have a college education.
1.5.1.4. Pro: A number of jobs that are [necessary for modern society to function](https://www.zippia.com/advice/high-paying-jobs-nobody-wants/) do not require any advanced degrees, and encouraging more people to get advanced degrees may limit the number of people willing to do these jobs.
1.5.2. Pro: The need for a college degree or trade diploma has increased to where a high school degree was needed in the past.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The wage difference between high school and college graduates has [increased](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/study-income-gap-between-young-college-and-high-school-grads-widens) with each generation.
1.5.2.2. Con: This due to the [self-fulfilling prophecy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/self-fulfilling-prophecy)(A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when an originally false social belief leads people to act in ways that objectively confirm that belief.) in educational circles that one [must have](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/education/why-is-college-important)(With more and more occupations requiring advanced education, a college degree can be critical to your success in today's workforce. Southern New Hampshire University leaders agree that education is important, and research indicates that earning a degree can have a significant and expansive impact on your life.) a four year college degree to be successful. If this changes, then advanced degrees will no longer be seen as necessary.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: It is true that one does not need a college degree to be successful, but the [salary range difference](https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level/) between college educated people and non-college educated people suggests that college may be a path to greater success for many.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Salary range may not be an ideal measure of success, since some people's passions are inherently less profitable. Ideally, citizens would have enough income to support their needs and passions regardless.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: There are many respectable jobs that don't require a college degree.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Many [respectable and necessary jobs](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-jobs-without-a-college-degree) with livable salaries require no degrees.
1.5.2.2.2.2. Con: College instills other benefits on an individual than just helping to find a job.
1.5.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: College can be a place where one can learn how to grow a [personal and professional network](https://www.betterup.com/blog/networking) of friends and colleagues.
1.5.2.2.2.3. Pro: There are [many jobs](https://www.moneytalksnews.com/20-high-paying-jobs-2-year-degree/) that only need a two year degree or a trade certificate.
1.5.2.3. Pro: The principle of '[academic inflation](https://www.smartcapitalmind.com/what-is-academic-inflation.htm)(Academic inflation refers to the increasing requirement of higher degrees for certain jobs, even when a higher degree is not necessary to perform those jobs. For example, many jobs that would have traditionally only required an associate’s degree in the past are now requiring a bachelor’s degree or even a master’s degree.)' argues that the [exchange-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_value) of a qualification is devalued over time as the market is flooded with comparable candidates.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Regardless of how 'useful' \([use-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value)\) university is for doing a job well, a higher degree is used by employers to reduce the pool of candidates.
1.5.2.3.2. Con: Providing free higher education will only worsen academic inflation and render university degrees increasingly meaningless.
1.5.3. Pro: As a necessity, higher education can increasingly be seen as [human right](https://www.unesco.org/en/education/right-education)(The right to quality education is already firmly rooted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international legal instruments, the majority of which are the result of the work of UNESCO and the United Nations.) that should be guaranteed by the government.
1.5.3.1. Con: Education is a privilege, not a right.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: It is not the role of government to provide for the privileges of the people, just to secure their rights.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Democratic governance is based on the views of the civilian population by votes for leadership. What it should or shouldn't do relies on those views, and as such, the role of government could be to provide for privileges.
1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is not an objective way to tell the difference between a privilege and a right, and opinions vary on where any one thing falls into one or the other of those categories.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: In the Unites States, having equal access to education is [a right](https://www.aclu.org/other/your-right-equality-education)(All kids living in the United States have the right to a free public education. And the Constitution requires that all kids be given equal educational opportunity no matter what their race, ethnic background, religion, or sex, or whether they are rich or poor, citizen or non-citizen. Even if you are in this country illegally, you have the right to go to public school.) for all children, not a privilege.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: This right only extends to the elementary and high school level, not higher education.
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Education is clearly not a right, as [no country](https://rightstracker.org/en/metric/education?pb=best) achieves a perfect score on securing this right.
1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: Over [260 million children](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/global-3)(In 2019, more than 260 million children did not go to school, according to the United Nations, with conflict-affected areas particularly hard-hit: around 50 percent of out-of-school children of primary school age live in such areas, and 617 million youth worldwide lack basic mathematics and literacy skills.) did not go to school in 2019, indicating that education is a privilege for those with fortunate circumstances, rather than a right for all children.
1.5.3.1.3.2. Con: If this were a legitimate guideline, then no rights exist anywhere, as no country is completely free of any human rights violation.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Everyone should have the right to study and be educated.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: A universal right to study and become educated does not exist in law, and thus cannot be relied upon to support publicly funded higher education.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: This can be easily remedied by the creation of a new law that protects the universal right to education.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: In any free society, people have a right to study and be educated on their own. This right is guaranteed without the need for schools or public funding.
1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: As long as the right to basic education is secured, such as [learning how to read](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220228-the-best-age-for-learning-to-read), a motivated person can continue to educate themselves without the need for higher education.
1.5.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Many of the worlds [most celebrated people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autodidacts) were total or partial [autodidacts](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autodidact)(a self-taught person), indicating that formal education is not necessary for success.
1.5.3.2.2.1.2. Con: It is unrealistic to assume that the majority of children are smart or motivated enough to educate themselves to the point of a college education.
1.5.3.2.2.2. Con: Schools can provide students with unsafe or unstable home environments a place to focus on learning.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: By viewing education as a right, it is more likely that educational objectives will receive greater support around the world.
1.5.3.3. Con: Voting is a right. I can chose to vote or not. If education is a right that mean I can chose be be educated or not.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: Guaranteeing a right is not the same as forcing it upon someone. Citizens are still free to pursue higher education or not.
1.5.4. Con: No human necessity, including water, food, clothing, and shelter, is completely publicly funded, so education shouldn't be either.
1.5.4.1. Con: If government does not directly provide these things, it is their responsibility to make sure people can provide them for themselves. One of the best ways to do this is to provide access to education, which gives people access to good jobs.
1.5.4.2. Con: Most countries have some form of [publicly funded housing](https://www.nhlp.org/resource-center/public-housing/)(Public housing is limited to low-income families and individuals. Public housing residents must have incomes below 80% of the Area Median Income \(AMI\). Nearly two-thirds of public housing households are considered “extremely low income,” with incomes below 30% of the AMI and an average annual income of $14,605. Additionally, 31% of public housing residents are seniors \(\> 62 years old\), 30% of public housing households include a non-elderly family member who experiences a disability, and 3.3 million children live in public housing.) available for those who need it.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Publicly funded housing is usually provided at a discount, but it is [not free](https://www.cbpp.org/research/public-housing)(Most tenants pay 30 percent of their income \(after certain deductions are taken out\) for rent and utilities. Housing agencies can choose to require families to pay a minimum rent of up to $50 even if this is more than 30 percent of their income, and families can opt to pay a flat rent based on local market rents regardless of their income.) for renters.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Any publicly funded access to necessary items is usually restricted to society's poorest, and education should be the same.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Eligibility for [food stamps](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-quick-guide-to-snap-eligibility-and-benefits)(Under federal rules, to be eligible for benefits a household’s income and resources must meet three tests:\n\nGross monthly income — that is, household income before any of the program’s deductions are applied — generally must be at or below 130 percent of the poverty line. For a family of three, the poverty line used to calculate SNAP benefits in federal fiscal year 2022 is $1,830 a month. Thus, 130 percent of the poverty line for a three-person family is $2,379 a month, or about $28,550 a year. The poverty level is higher for bigger families and lower for smaller families.\n \nNet income, or household income after deductions are applied, must be at or below the poverty line.\n\nAssets must fall below certain limits: households without a member who is elderly \(age 60 or older\) or who has a disability must have assets of $2,500 or less, and households with such a member must have assets of $3,750 or less.) in the US is restricted to those on low incomes.
1.5.5. Con: There is no guarantee that tax payer money will be spent on education, that students will be able to absorb the material in their chosen curriculum, or that they would not chose areas of study that are overly saturated, choosing instead courses that would find them a better-paying job.
1.6. Con: Publicly funded education at any level on creates a monopoly so that cost benefit analysis can't be done. So we wont know we have been shafted until it is too late.
1.7. Con: Individuals are responsible for their education, no one else.
1.8. Con: Just because low education levels have failed their education goals does not mean that kicking the can further down the road will help our children to learn what they need to.
