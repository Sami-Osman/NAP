Discussion Name: Multipolar World Order

1. A multipolar world order is preferable to a unipolar world order.
1.1. Pro: Heterogeneity brings more creativity and development than homogeneity.
1.1.1. Con: Heterogeneity is also of the main sources of conflicts, since our societies tend to view the [otherness as a threat](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305419218_Otherness_as_Threat_Social_and_Educational_Exclusion_of_Roma_People_in_Greece).
1.1.2. Pro: [Diversity brings more creativity](https://hbr.org/2017/06/does-diversity-actually-increase-creativity) because it allows for a more granular understanding of human diversity and reality.
1.2. Con: A strong unipolar world order contains clear rules which everybody can understand and this creates less disorder and unrest.
1.2.1. Con: If power is wielded without a broader consensus, this can have catastrophic effects on non-hegemonic states.
1.2.2. Pro: Since everybody would have the same cultural, societal and political understanding, there would be less conflict.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Cultural differences are more likely to create conflict](https://ijol.cikd.ca/article_60478.html), therefore conflict could be avoided with more homogeneity.
1.2.2.2. Con: In order to create the same cultural understanding, other current cultural settings would have to be destroyed, which would in itself create conflict.
1.3. Con: A unipolar order means that one actor has military surpremacy, and this eliminates the risk of world war since no second power can challenge the unipolar leader.
1.3.1. Con: Such an order would require [the elimination of all democracies around the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/democracy-countries) in order to establish a single dictatorship.
1.3.1.1. Con: You can in principle have a large number of small democracies, and then one single powerful dictator nation.
1.3.1.2. Pro: For a democracy to work as such, [citizens have to be able to elect government officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy). If democracies depend on a single dictatorship, then ultimately the decisions would be chosen by the dictator nation.
1.3.2. Con: A unipolar order would also be [more at risk of facing a revolution which could lead into an armed conflict](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41428108).
1.3.3. Pro: Unipolarity would create a [peaceful configuration of the international system.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/theory-of-unipolar-politics/sources-of-conflict-under-unipolarity/272D55385F42635BFAAA86D936E8BE76)
1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.3.3.2. Pro: A multipolar world opens up opportunities for [better foreign policy and security choices of all the countries](https://thelogicalindian.com/trending/is-russias-operation-in-ukraine-a-threat-to-usas-unipolar-world-34128).
1.3.3.3. Con: According to scholars, [unipolarity is ultimately unstable and conflict prone](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/stability-unipolar-world), and thus unlikely to prevail over the long term.
1.3.4. Pro: With the [current nuclear threat](https://ecfr.eu/article/shadow-of-the), a unipolar order would eliminate the possibility of a nuclear war.
1.4. Pro: A unipolar world would [impose cultural values](https://ojin.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/Columns/Ethics/CulturalValuesandEthicalConflicts.aspx)(Cultural Imposition - A situation where one culture forces their values and beliefs onto another culture or subculture.) to the rest of the world, which could have negative consequences.
1.4.1. Pro: [Cultural homogeneity](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/11/111115-12.html) can lead to anti-intellectualism, bigotry, and brutishness.
1.4.2. Con: Cultural values are already imposed in our current multipolar world through [capitalism](https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/does-capitalism-destroy-culture/).
1.5. Con: There may be many multipolar world orders that are inferior. Since there is no way to count the number of possible worlds \(multipolar and unipolar\) and assess their state of affairs, the thesis \(MPWO is preferable\) is neither true nor false, but unknowable.
1.5.1. Pro: In our current multipolar word [there is a lot of inequality between countries](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/global-income-inequality-gap-report-rich-poor/).
1.5.2. Con: In a unipolar world, except for the "world" that rules, all of the other world orders would automatically be inferior and dependent of the ruler, [since there wouldn't be any polarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_\(international_relations\)).
1.6. Pro: A multipolar world order \(MPWO\) consisting of the USA on one hand, and China on the other, is preferable to a world order where the United states has hegemony \(through NATO and control of a large number of vasal states who can vote for them in UN and their powerful media and film industrial complex\). Since this is the only realistic multipolar and unipolar alternative, the thesis is true in praxis.
1.6.1. Con: A multipolar world order consisting of only two countries does not represent multipolarity, instead it [represents bipolarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_\(international_relations\)#Bipolarity)(Bipolarity is a distribution of power in which two states have a preponderance of power. In bipolarity, spheres of influence and alliance systems have frequently developed around each pole. For example, in the Cold War, most Western and capitalist states would fall under the influence of the US, while most Communist states would fall under the influence of the USSR.).
1.6.1.1. Pro: In order to be able to refer to a [multipolar system, three or more great powers with similar capabilities](https://www.aei.org/articles/america-is-navigating-a-bipolar-era-amid-a-growing-chinese-threat/)(Rather, multipolarity refers to a system with three or more great powers of roughly similar capabilities, even if asymmetrical. The European state system of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was genuinely multipolar, though Napoleon tried to change that.) have to be present, even if their power is asymmetrical.
1.6.1.2. Con: Even if it represents bipolarity, since [the hegemony of the power wouldn't be exclusive to a unique country](https://wiiw.ac.at/entering-a-multipolar-world-or-the-rise-of-a-new-hegemon-n-309.html), it would be a different settings to a unipolar system.
1.6.2. Pro: A MPWO consisting of USA and China is not preferable if the ultimate goal of world development is representative democracy.
1.6.2.1. Pro: China is not a representative democracy and will not advance democracy in the world.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: [China's model represents a challenge in terms of labor, environmental and social standards](https://www.equaltimes.org/china-is-not-the-model?lang=en) so it wouldn't be the preferable model to follow.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: [China has become the winner country](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/blog/china-is-one-of-globalisations-winners-it-wont-throw-that-away-for-russia) in our current globalized model.
1.6.2.2. Pro: USA is a representative democracy. However, they have sometimes conspired against representative democracies since they were hostile towards US foreign politics.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: USA supported the [coup](https://transnational.live/2022/05/28/jack-matlock-ukraine-crisis-should-have-been-avoided/) against elected Yanukovich in Ukraine \(though to what extent remains debated\).
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: USA [conspired](https://www.tni.org/es/node/13624) against Allende in Chile.
1.6.2.2.3. Pro: USA conspired against the Greek state in [1967](https://www.greece.org/hec01/Projects/cyprus/Takism5.htm)
1.6.2.2.4. Con: If a MPWO is preferable, then the USA wouldn't be the only country in power, therefore whether they have conspired against representative democracies or not is irrelevant.
1.6.2.2.5. Con: The fact that the United States sometimes prioritize other foreign politics does not negate the fact that they also sometimes further democracy. Weighed together, they are more of a force for representative democracy than against.
1.6.2.3. Con: In order to have a representative democracy in a multipolar world order, all countries should be taken into account through [cooperative multipolarity](https://risingpowersproject.com/world-ready-cooperative-multipolarity/).
