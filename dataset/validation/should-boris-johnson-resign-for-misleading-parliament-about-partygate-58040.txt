Discussion Name: Should Boris Johnson resign for misleading parliament about Partygate?

1. Boris Johnson should resign for misleading Parliament about Partygate.
1.1. Pro: Misleading Parliament demands [resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_of_parliament) according to convention and Westminster's ministerial code.
1.2. Pro: A [majority](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/31/snap-poll-63-britons-still-want-boris-johnson-resi) of the British electorate wants Boris Johnson to resign following Partygate.
1.3. Pro: Remaining as PM is offensive to people who lost loved ones during Covid-19 lockdowns.
1.4. Con: The PM did [not knowingly](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/britain/boris-johnson-apologises-to-mps-over-lockdown-birthday-party-but-says-he-didnt-know-he-was-breaking-the-law-41567012.html) mislead Parliament as he didn't think he had broken the rules.
1.4.1. Con: It is implausible to conceive that the person who authored the rules did not know how to follow them.
1.4.2. Pro: The various gatherings took place in [Downing Street](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/downing-street-fines-how-many-downing-street-parties-there-were-and-who-attended-amid-new-partygate-fines-3530649) - a professional workplace - so the distinction between a social and professional gathering may have been unclear.
1.4.2.1. Con: [Champagne](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-09/boris-johnson-pictured-at-christmas-event-near-champagne-bottle)(The image, published on Wednesday by the Daily Mirror newspaper, shows Johnson standing next to members of staff with food and what looks like an open champagne bottle on a table.) was present at at least one of the gatherings, which would be highly peculiar for a purely professional gathering.
1.5. Con: Even if the PM did mislead Parliament, resigning now would be poor timing.
1.5.1. Pro: The UK government must focus on the ongoing war in Ukraine instead of electing a new leader.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Some Ukrainians view [Boris Johnson as a hero](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-war-fontanka-road-boris-johnson-b2064818.html)(A small town in southern Ukraine is renaming one of its roads after British prime minister Boris Johnson in recognition of the UKâ€™s efforts to help the country in its war against Russia.) for providing weapons to the country. Forcing him to resign may demoralize and worry the UK's Ukrainian allies.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that whoever replaces Boris Johnson wouldn't also be a prominent Ukrainian ally.
1.5.1.2. Con: A new election may make the political system of the UK open for Russian interference, as occurred in the [2016 US elections](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/russian-interference-in-2016-u-s-elections)(On July 13, 2018, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia returned an indictment against 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their alleged roles in interfering with the 2016 United States \(U.S.\) elections.).
1.5.2. Con: It would be better for the PM to resign now than be faced with a [no confidence vote from his own MPs](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61187790).
1.5.3. Con: Resigning now would be good timing because Partygate has become a [distraction](https://www.itv.com/news/2022-04-22/pms-trip-to-india-overshadowed-by-partygate-as-poll-shows-drop-in-public-trust).
