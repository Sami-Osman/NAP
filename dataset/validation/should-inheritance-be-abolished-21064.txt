Discussion Name: Should Inheritance be Abolished?

1. Inheritance should be abolished.
1.1. Con: The law would be unenforceable because the wealthy would just use corporations and/or offshore accounts to hold their wealth.
1.1.1. Pro: It will be easy to circumvent the abolition by putting assets in trusts and other business entities. Thus ensuring that your descendants still benefit from you estate. This will also exclude those assets from inheritance tax.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Even less affluent people would 'give' away assets as they got older. The ones that would suffer the most would be the children of people who die unexpectedly.
1.1.2. Pro: People could easily just give almost all of their assets to their children before they die so this wouldn't work unless you just want to ban giving gifts.
1.1.3. Pro: Such a policy incentivises anyone who both expects to create more wealth than they receive from the state and cares about their legacy to emigrate. This will impoverish the country.
1.1.4. Pro: Most people in middle or low income households will struggle to cheat the system in the same way. This doesn't just further income inequality but also makes it even harder for poorer people to manage and survive in the system.
1.1.5. Con: We have no way of knowing what future tax laws or tracking mechanisms would exist. Maybe this would not be a loophole. There are many ways to prevent such gaming/loopholes if our legislators had the guts to pass rules and enforce them.
1.2. Con: In a free market it should be the owner's right to choose where their money and properties go when they die.
1.2.1. Pro: It is a good thing when one person gives to another person. Inheritance is a form of giving.
1.2.1.1. Con: This statement is broad, unspecific, and completely arbitrary. Money often makes problems worse - giving a drunk another drink \(or the money for one\) is a demonstrably bad thing, for example. The question is why money is being given and to whom - and the argument is that it should not be blindly passed onto forbears further perpetuating generational inequality and the stranglehold the rich maintain upon the poor.
1.2.2. Con: A business that passes on from father to son has no economic benefit to society. It just eliminates further competition for startups while not improving its industry.
1.2.2.1. Con: Allowing "benefit to society" to supersede people's rights is wrong.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Public infrastructure enables private entities to earn income; however, this debt is never sufficiently paid. Therefore, inheritance should be treated as public property to compensate for this debt.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Actually, a business passed in this way would maintain its economic benefit to society by selling whatever it sells and making those goods/services available to the marketplace. Just because a firm is not innovating, does not mean it has no value to society.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Innovation is crucial in our capitalist system and culture and this proceeding would not make a favorable breeding ground for innovation.
1.2.3. Pro: It is unfair to parents who might have saved money their entire lives to make their children's lives easier.
1.2.3.1. Pro: People work hard to secure the future of their families, it is wrong to stop them from securing their family's future.
1.2.3.2. Con: Nothing prevents these hypothetical parents from stewarding their assets while they are alive by giving their children gifts and paying the appropriate taxes if the gifts are large. This would improve the lives of their children. The problem we are examining is ownership after death.
1.2.4. Pro: It is better to tax inheritance progressively than to abolish it.
1.2.4.1. Con: Many countries have progressive taxation, yet massive [wealth inequality](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/global-income-inequality-gap-report-rich-poor/) persists. The abolishment of inheritance can would help stop this.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Estate taxes only affect the most wealthy \(\>$5M\) and are often sidestepped through Trusts, Foundations, and other tax avoidance schemes. The taxes on inheritance as they are today do not 'work perfectly well' at all.
1.3. Con: Wealth confiscation upon death is very unpopular, and will lead people to oppose any government that imposes such a policy.
1.3.1. Con: Just because something is unpopular, does not mean that it is not prudent.
1.3.1.1. Con: Politics is the art of the possible, and if a policy is so unpopular as to render it impossible to impose on the population, then that impossibility is the most important fact about that policy.
1.3.2. Pro: "But above all he must abstain from taking the property of others, for men forget more easily the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony" - Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Prince.
1.3.3. Con: The founders of modern capitalist systems argued against inheritance and advocated for a [more equal distribution of wealth](https://www.economist.com/lexingtons-notebook/2010/10/14/you-cant-take-it-with-you)(Jefferson cited Adam Smith, the hero of free market capitalists everywhere, as the source of his conviction that \(as Smith wrote, and Jefferson closely echoed in his own words\), "A power to dispose of estates for ever is manifestly absurd. The earth and the fulness of it belongs to every generation, and the preceding one can have no right to bind it up from posterity. Such extension of property is quite unnatural." Smith said: "There is no point more difficult to account for than the right we conceive men to have to dispose of their goods after death.").
1.3.4. Pro: Some property can hold emotional value and it is hard to make the distinction between property that does or does not hold emotional value in good faith as it is subjective so it is highly possible that confiscated property holds emotional value to the heirs of the owner.
1.4. Pro: The more money you have the easier it is to make more money \(by investing, rent, etc.\).
1.4.1. Pro: As people are born equal, the fact that those born to the richest parents get much more than the less well-off without any effort is inherently unfair.
1.4.2. Pro: This means that, over generations, some families will have amassed far more than others because of an unfair advantage.
1.4.2.1. Con: This means that, generations, some families will have amassed far more than others becuase they would have worked hard to earn it, it is not an unfair advantage if it is the result of hard work.
1.5. Pro: The money that is collected from inheritance could be used to fund a welfare system that helps to ensure that everyone is born with equal opportunities.
1.5.1. Con: It could just as easily be used to fund a huge military buildup, or such a welfare system could be funded by some other revenue source; such policies are naturally separate.
1.6. Pro: If, instead of inheritance, the property of the deceased goes back to the state, this would provide an enormous new source of funds to eradicate poverty, invest in health and education, and support other social programs and projects that benefit society as a whole.
1.6.1. Con: Governments do not always use funds for the best of purposes, or in the most efficient way even if they are working for good goals.
1.6.2. Con: Making the state the beneficiary of someone's properties at their death would break the bond between deeds accomplished through hard work and money, effectively devaluing hard work and therefore products that we can buy with money.
1.6.3. Pro: Separating work from money would create an environment where work would be ethical and moral rather than economical and this would solve most of the issues we have with ethics in the industries \(pollution, human rights, etc\).
1.6.3.1. Con: This is an argument for a communist system where property is wholly abolished, not the narrow policy position of abolishing inheritance.
1.6.4. Pro: Working only for moral and ethical reasons rather than for economical reason would give people's work and lives more meaning. This would increase people's wellbeing.
1.6.5. Con: Moving such a mass of money from an individual to the state might be so much trouble administratively that it could cost too much money to be economically viable for the state.
1.6.5.1. Con: There already exists massive administrative services for managing taxation and other government duties, asking them to manage inheritance taxation would likely still pay for itself.
1.6.6. Con: Inheritance cannot be abolished because wealth cannot be destroyed. A state that inherits the wealth of it's citizens would become too powerful.
1.6.6.1. Con: Taxation burden can be reduced such that budget size remained the same after collecting these funds.
1.7. Con: Abolishing inheritance would disincentivize the creation of wealth, as any wealth they create will be confiscated rather than being passed down.
1.7.1. Con: Some of the wealthiest people in the world have no children, or heirs, meaning inheritance was no incentive to their acquisition of wealth.
1.7.2. Con: Couples with no children routinely earn more money than couples with children.
1.7.3. Pro: Inheritance is part of a long-standing link between the different generations of a family and abolishing it would deprive future generations of meaning and a sense of connection to the past.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Family heirlooms, regardless of their value, are irreplaceable; children should not be barred from accessing them.
1.7.3.2. Con: Fights over inheritance drives siblings apart unnecessarily.
1.7.3.3. Con: This implies all inheritance is in the form of heirlooms, which is rarely the case. The majority of inheritance is financial assets, real estate, or cash. Money is not a sense of connection. It's just money.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Abolishing inheritance might lead to children not treating their parents as well as they would have otherwise.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: If inheritance were outlawed by authorities, then it's not the parents fault. Likely it would improve relations because there is nothing \(no money\) standing in the way of honest love between a parent and a child.
1.7.3.4.2. Pro: Passing of property holding emotional value between generations is an important part of our culture and traditions.
