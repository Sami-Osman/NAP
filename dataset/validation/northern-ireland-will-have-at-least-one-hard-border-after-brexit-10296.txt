Discussion Name: Northern Ireland will have at least one hard border after Brexit

1. Northern Ireland will have at least one hard border after Brexit
1.1. Pro: A hard border between ROI and NI would enable a soft border to remain between NI and the rest of the UK.
1.1.1. Pro: As long as there is one existing soft border, the problems that a hard border would pose can be avoided.
1.2. Pro: One argument for Brexit is that the UK wants to take back control over immigration and import/export. If there is no hard border, there is no control over what passes this border.
1.2.1. Con: Immigration to England, Scotland and Wales via Ireland and Northern Ireland is long and cumbersome, so this flaw may be accepted by the UK Government, as not many will take advantage of it.
1.2.1.1. Con: If anyone wants to bypass immigration controls, only the laziest people would be put off by an extra days journey.
1.3. Con: Negotiations may achieve a soft border.
1.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that Ireland and Europe will accept it.
1.3.2. Pro: Theresa May has opened to the possibility of a [soft border](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/07/soft-brexit-proposal-welcomed-both-sides-irish-border).
1.4. Con: There are non-EU counties that have soft borders with the EU.
1.4.1. Pro: In 2004 the [European Union developed the European Neighbourhood Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy) \(ENP\) for the promotion of cooperation between the EU and its neighbors to the East and South of the European territory of the EU it includes the Cross-Border Cooperation programme to promote economic development in border areas.
1.4.1.1. Con: The countries that participate in the agreement \(Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, \(...\) Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, etc.\) do not generally have [soft borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy) with EU states.
1.4.2. Pro: There is a [soft border](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/on-the-frontier-of-brexit-the-eu-s-existing-hard-and-soft-borders-1.2829910) between Norway \(non-EU\) and Sweden.
1.4.2.1. Con: As mentioned in the source, that is a very [unique case](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/on-the-frontier-of-brexit-the-eu-s-existing-hard-and-soft-borders-1.2829910).
1.4.3. Pro: There is a [soft border](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/on-the-frontier-of-brexit-the-eu-s-existing-hard-and-soft-borders-1.2829910) between Switzerland \(non-EU but Schengen\) and Germany.
1.4.3.1. Con: It is likely then that the UK, including Northern Irelandd, would have to sign and be part of the Schengen space.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: That could probably defeat the purpose of those supporting and voting for Brexit to reduce European immigration.
1.4.4. Con: Croatia’s borders with non-EU Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are [hard borders](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/on-the-frontier-of-brexit-the-eu-s-existing-hard-and-soft-borders-1.2829910).
1.4.5. Pro: Bulgaria-Romania border has had across-border cooperation programme since 1999. Its general strategic objective is to bring people, communities and the economies of the border area closer together, and to support the two countries in the joint creation of a cooperation area[espaces-transfrontaliers.org](http://www.espaces-transfrontaliers.org/en/bdd-borders/frontiers/frontier/show/bulgarie-roumanie/)
1.4.6. Con: Whether countries have a soft border with the EU or not is not relevant. Although the UK "could" have a soft border, the so called "red lines" make doing so impossible. Controlling immigration, and having an independent trade/customs policy require a hard border.
1.5. Pro: EU immigration to the UK could continue if the soft border were to remain.
1.6. Con: ‘If neighboring countries are friendly and cooperative, then a border that relies more on technology than physical infrastructure, is possible. A hard border seen as hostile or as a rival.
1.6.1. Con: This technology doesn't exist, is very complex because of the nature of border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, and couldn’t be implemented in the conceivable future. The [EU has already ruled out](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47047993) using existing technology: "We looked at every border on this Earth... there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."
1.7. Pro: The UK Government wants to end Freedom of Movement after Brexit.
1.7.1. Pro: [May has said](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/eu-citizens-lose-priority-under-post-brexit-immigration-plans) that EU citizens will no longer be given priority to live and work in Britain in a radical overhaul of immigration policy after Brexit.
1.7.2. Pro: ROI will remain a member state of the EU, and retain the Freedom of Movement. A soft border with the UK is therefore not possible.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.9. Pro: As ROI and NI have a land border, and travel to England, Scotland and Wales must happen by sea or air, a hard border with immigration checks may be more acceptable for this type of travel.
1.9.1. Con: A hard sea / air border would mean a border within the UK and not outside of it.
1.9.2. Pro: This may stop EU immigration into England, Scotland and Wales, whilst keeping a hard border between ROI and NI, there would need to be a hard border between NI and England, Scotland and Wales.
1.10. Pro: Creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and England, Scotland and Wales would enable Northern Ireland to stay in the single market and customs union.
