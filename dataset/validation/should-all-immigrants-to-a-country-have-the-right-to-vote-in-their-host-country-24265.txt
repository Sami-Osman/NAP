Discussion Name: Should all immigrants to a country have the right to vote in their host country?

1. Should all immigrants to a host country have the right to vote in that country, irrespective of citizenship status, since the very moment they established their habitual residence in that country?
1.1. Pro: If migrants are not allowed to vote, politicians may not take them into account when proposing and enforcing policies, even when they affect them.
1.2. Con: Habitual residence means nothing, merely an address. A poor grasp of the host nation's language \(France and French being a prime example\), no idea of the politics or culture of the host country are arguments against allowing voting rights for habitual residents without citizenship.
1.2.1. Con: Not knowing the language/politics/culture does not mean the habitual resident is not affected by the policies or that s/he cannot express a political opinion, as much as it does not mean one cannot pay taxes to that country. A mute&blind can vote, so language is not a barrier. If one is not interested in politics, would also not be interested in vote. A blank restriction based on an assumption that one does not know politics just because it did not live enough time in a country is unreasonable.
1.3. Con: It would allow for those with far less loyalty or patriotism to have a say in the country, which would be detrimental. This assumes nationalism is a good thing.
1.4. Pro: All residents living under the same governmental unit should enjoy same rights, without preferential treatment.
1.5. Con: It enhances & accelerates the cultural change that results from high levels of immigration, leading to a siege mentality in pre-residents & xenophobic politics. Cultural change always happens but must happen at a managed rate that is acceptable to all. Voting rights should be given to immigrants after some period of acclimatisation - and only if they don't also continue to vote in country of origin.
1.6. Pro: Migrants living in a country are often subject to policies affecting them, without having a meaningful right to express their vote in those matters.
1.7. Pro: No taxation without representation. Those who pay taxes should have the right to vote. Irrespective of citizenship status.
1.7.1. Con: Voting is not a 'reward' for contributing to society, but a voice in what becomes of that society. Those who are not long placed in the host country are unable to make decisions that can benefit a society they know nothing of.
1.8. Con: Voting rights for non-citizents, based just on a temporary habitual residence would give rise to an electoral tourism that would negatively affect the more stable citizens interests.
1.8.1. Con: It is highly implausible that people would move to a country simply to have one vote among millions of other people once every four years.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Moving to a new country requires a lot of resources, time, and effort. Even if people would want to move to another country simply to engage the voting of that country, it's unlikely that many people would be able to repeatedly move between different countries.
1.9. Con: Non-citizens do not have sufficient significant links and interests into the host country.
1.9.1. Con: Non-citizens that live in the host country are affected by the laws of that country in their daily lives.
1.10. Con: Immigrants have a different national background and cannot make decisions affecting another nation to whom they do not pertain.
1.10.1. Con: The national background of immigrants does not prevent them from being affected by social or economic policies enacted by the government of the country they live in.
1.11. Con: Immigrants have the right to vote in their country of origin and a second right to vote in another country, the host country, is discriminatory against those who are entitled to vote only once, since their country of origin and permanent residence is the same.
1.11.1. Con: Since the two realities are certainly very different, it is unclear why it is discriminatory. If non-immigrants had another home country to vote in, they could. Discrimination would entail that certain population, dues to their characteristics, are not allowed to vote.
1.12. Con: Immigrants must show a significant connection to the host country so that a vote could be made fully aware of that country specificities, and this is already checked when applying for citizenship, which include the voting rights for that person, if citizenship is awarded.
