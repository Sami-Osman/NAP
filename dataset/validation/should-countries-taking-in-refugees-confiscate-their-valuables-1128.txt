Discussion Name: Should Countries Taking In Refugees Confiscate their Valuables?

1. Countries that accept refugees must confiscate their valuables worth more than €1500.
1.1. Con: Taking refugee's valuables makes their integration more difficult.
1.1.1. Pro: Integrating within a society is often directly connected to economic success. Confiscating valuables makes this even harder for refugees.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Confiscating refugees' assets and valuables worth more than €1500 makes it very hard for them to be have economic success in the society they have moved to.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are inherent expenses in the path to becoming economically successful.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It can be [very hard to start a business](https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/seed-money.html) without seed money. Confiscating refugees' valuables can take away any possible seed money they might have.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is possible to start a business with less than [$100](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/10-businesses-you-can-start-with-under-100-dollars.html).
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Getting hired can require buying the appropriate clothing for an interview or the job itself, which refugees may be unable to afford.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Formal clothing can be bought from places where it is cheap and affordable for refugees.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Most clothing costs less than €1500 and thus will remain affordable.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Refugees are encouraged to shop [at thrift stores](https://usahello.org/resources/job-interview/) for formal clothing, where it is very affordable.
1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Applicants do not need a suit for all jobs. In some cases regular clothes are appropriate.
1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Typical low-skill roles \(such as waitressing\) are [more relaxed](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-to-wear-to-a-job-interview-at-a-restaurant-2061186) in regards to attire during the interview process.
1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Even in a low-skill role, it is important to stand out during the interview process. Not having access to formal clothing may put refugees at a disadvantage.
1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It is far more likely that a refugee would be put at a disadvantage in a job interview due to other factors, such as lack of language skills, rather than not having formal attire.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Asylum seekers receive [all the necessities](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2015/11/balkan-asylum-seekers-fear-deportation-germany-151105102613974.html) needed for daily life from the state they take refuge in, so there is little need for them to pursue further economic success.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is a huge waste of potential talents, skills and manpower.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Asylum seekers in Germany receive free accommodation, basic healthcare and a monthly allowance of [325 Euros](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2015/11/balkan-asylum-seekers-fear-deportation-germany-151105102613974.html).
1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Refugees are subject to discrimination and violence. Being financially independent and/or economically successful could have positive impacts on their reputation.
1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Camps are often under attack showing how little security refugees enjoy. \([mirror.co.uk](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/calais-migrant-camp-fire-france-6830330); [rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/325053-arson-attack-germany-migrants/)\)
1.1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Historically, discrimination against Jews in Germany led to [boycotting](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-boycott-of-jewish-businesses) of their businesses.
1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: Most young people want to learn, work and build a career no matter what they receive from the government.
1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: 70% of young Britons [want to learn](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/07/-sp-do-young-people-care-about-learning-foreign-languages-data) a foreign language.
1.1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: A British survey shows that [81%](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/aspires/ASPIRES-final-report-December-2013.pdf) of children age 10-14 want to go to university.
1.1.1.1.2.4.3. Con: In Germany, children are not only [less educated](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1) than their parents, but are also [content](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fpolitik%2Fdeutschland%2Farticle132042821%2FDeutsche-Jugend-geringer-gebildet-als-die-Eltern.html) with being less educated.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Without speaking the native language of the country they are in, applying for a job will be difficult regardless of their finances.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: If you do not speak the language there are still many jobs to work in.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: There is always a significant expat community that allows to work in your mother tongue.
1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The basics of any foreign language can be learned in "[several months](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20150302-secrets-to-learning-a-language)".
1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Certain languages \(such as French, Japanese, Chinese, Russian or Polish\) are very hard to learn due to a complex grammar and / or specific type of alphabet.
1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: If the domestic language of a country is too hard to learn, one can get by with only knowing English in [most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world).
1.1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: English is the world's [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_lingua_franca).
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Parties to the Geneva Convention are encouraged in [Art. 30 \(2\)](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) to allow asset transfers for refugee resettlement in another country.
1.1.1.1.5. Pro: If their valuables are taken from them, refugees become dependent on the government for their finances.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Refugees are affected by special legislation which causes a reliance on the government.
1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Refugees are [not allowed to work](https://www.refugee-action.org.uk/about/facts-about-refugees/) as long as their legal status is pending.
1.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Taking valuables from refugees puts them at a disadvantage. Such valuables can be sold or borrowed in order to become independant.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Immigrants are more successful economically if they are well integrated into society [\(Danzer, pp. 18-19\)](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/dicereport411-forum3.pdf).
1.1.2. Con: Refugees' [biggest obstacles](https://eaea.org/2015/10/28/refugees-biggest-obstacles-to-integrate-are-recognition-of-qualifications-and-adequate-language-skills/) to integrate are the lack of recognition of their qualifications and their lack of adequate language skills. Taking their valuables will not make integration notably more difficult.
1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.3. Pro: The physical search creates a feeling of discrimination because non-refugees do not have to undergo the same procedure. This has negative consequences.
1.1.3.1. Pro: This feeling of discrimination might reduce overall security for the entire community.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Procedural justice research suggests](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5893.3703002/abstract;jsessionid=C437FBCBD0ACD7F9BFF34F86922F26DB.f02t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) that when people perceive authorities like police behave unfairly, they are less likely to share information and cooperate with those authorities. As a result, unfair police practices degrade fairness perceptions and thus might degrade the public good of safety for the community as a whole.
1.2. Con: One of the main duties of a modern democratic state is to provide and protect the right of property. Confiscating the private property of refugees violates that important [human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_property).
1.2.1. Con: [Citizens' properties](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34422558) have been confiscated by the state to provide places for refugees to stay for. Thus it should also be okay for the state to confiscate valuables from refugees.
1.2.1.1. Con: Only unused commercial properties \(empty workplaces\) have been confiscated by the state to make use out of them. Thus it is not comparable with the only valuables a refugee owns.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Unused commercial properties are still [often owned](https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2019/06/17/why-have-these-buildings-sat-empty-for-years-and-even-decades/cNAmrF9SbTRBUdeO0qRTPL/story.html) by a private entity.
1.2.2. Pro: Refugees have the [right to transfer their assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees#:~:text=allow%20refugees%20to%20transfer%20their%20assets%20\(Article%2030\)) from the internationally accepted 1951 refugee convention \(Article 30\).
1.2.3. Pro: The value of a property does not lie solely in its monetary value, but also its sentimental value. Ancestral jewelry, heirloom, and gifts from loved ones are invaluable, so confiscating them would be inhumane.
1.2.4. Con: Confiscation does not have to be permanent. Instead, a bond can be created, such that refugees are able to retrieve them after a stipulated time period.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The government can generate revenue from interest accrued by the confiscated valuables, which can be used to provide services to impoverished refugees.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The government can inculcate good behavior among refugees by setting relevant eligibility criteria to retrieve their valuables.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Setting having a clean criminal record for one year as an eligibility criterion would be a good way to incentivize refugees to learn and follow local laws.
1.2.5. Con: The Geneva Convention in [Art 29 \(2\)](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) clearly allows to impose charges to cover administrative procedures.
1.2.6. Pro: As the right to property is one of the [basic rights](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act/article-1-first-protocol-protection-property) in most constitutional states with a free market economy, compulsory confiscations should only be allowed in exceptional cases.
1.2.6.1. Con: Interference with the [right to property](http://www.echr.coe.int/LibraryDocs/DG2/HRHAND/DG2-EN-HRHAND-04%282003%29.pdf) can be justified due to reasons such as public or general interest, taxing measures, compensation, etc.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: The redistribution of wealth is a [generally accepted practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth#Modern_forms_of_Redistribution) that occurs in most modern democratic countries.
1.2.6.2. Con: Refugees are other states' citizens and therefore not in the scope of protection concerning their properties.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: It is likely that the states where refugees are fleeing from are not able to enforce property laws. Therefore, it is the responsibility of other states to enforce them instead.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: The [UN Responsibility to Protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect) outlines a responsibility to protect all populations from human rights violations, such as the right to property.
1.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The [Right to Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect) deals exclusively with [domestic protection](http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf); not with protection once a citizen leaves the country. This mostly excludes refugees.
1.2.6.2.1.1.2. Con: R2P requires a [prior authorisation](http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf) by the UN Security Council. Refugees rarely fall within this scope.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: [Art 13](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) of the Geneva Convention does not give refugees a right to property equal with nationals but only with "aliens generally in the same circumstances".
1.2.6.2.3. Con: In democratic societies individual rights apply to every human in the country, regardless of their nationality.
1.2.6.2.3.1. Pro: Refugees are natural persons and thus entitled to the protection of [property](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/incorporated-rights/articles-index/protocol-1-article-1/).
1.2.6.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.2.
1.2.6.2.3.3. Con: Foreign property in a country is treated differently from domestic property in [international customary law](http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2935&context=bclr).
1.2.6.2.3.3.1. Con: In the absence of a treaty the non-discrimination principle [prevails](http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2935&context=bclr).
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.3.1.
1.2.7. Pro: Confiscation can be a form of dehumanization.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Confiscation of valuables could include objects with high sentimental value such as inherited jewellery. Taking away memories of beloved family members is inhumane.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Jewellery may be the only thing that reminds them of their families and their homes, as it would be too hard to flee with heavier items such as paintings or photo albums.
1.2.7.1.2. Con: It is easy to include safeguards that exempt things which are sentimental to the refugee.
1.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: The Danish officials for example refrain from taking away valuables that have a [sentimental value](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/danish-mps-vote-seizing-valuables-refugees-160126055035636.html).
1.2.7.1.3. Con: Jewellery is a [common means](https://salonsyria.com/the-journey-of-syrian-jewelry-in-times-of-war-and-peace/) by which to trade and secure liquidity during times of conflict. It is reasonable, then, to trade it in exchange for protection.
1.2.7.2. Con: Not all confiscation is dehumanizing. It is common for police to confiscate property [in criminal proceedings](https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3029619/paypal-fraudsters-gbp50-000-in-bitcoins-seized-on-proceeds-of-crime-confiscation).
1.2.7.3. Pro: During WW2, Nazis confiscated property as [a means to dehumanize](https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/voices/testimonies/camps/background/thecamps.html) Jewish individuals.
1.3. Con: Refugees are seeking charitable sanctuary for their lives, so charging them what is effectively a fee for doing so is not an act of benevolence. To charge imposes an extra, burdensome condition upon their being granted refugee status which does not appear in the [1951 Refugee Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees) and is not relevant to their reasons for seeking sanctuary. After all, if I save a child from drowning in a canal, I do not expect to be paid afterwards by its parents.
1.4. Pro: Confiscating refugees’ valuables is a good method to make sure that they contribute fairly to the social services they will access in the country they take refuge in.
1.4.1. Con: It is immoral to tie expenses to the right to asylum.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The right to asylum is a basic right of the individual and thus supposed to be free.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Even basic rights can be limited [under certain circumstances](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/civil-rights/human-rights/when-can-a-public-authority-interfere-with-your-human-rights/).
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There are rights that cannot be limited, e.g. [torture prohibition](https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/03/11/legal-prohibition-against-torture#permitted) or the [right to have rights](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2918840).
1.4.1.1.2. Con: [Article 14](http://www.ichrp.org/en/article_14_udhr) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution." The article and other international law says nothing about the right must be without a reasonable fee.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The confiscation restricts the self-determination possibilities of refugees.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The application of this policy will put refugees from African, Middle-Eastern and Asian countries at a disadvantage, as such policies were not in effect when Europeans were [the majority of refugees](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/postwar-refugees/).
1.4.2. Con: There are alternative ways to have refugees contribute rather than compulsory confiscation.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Rather than confiscating valuables, refugees entering a country should have to declare the worth of their belongings and funds. This declaration should then be used as a basis to calculate how and to which amount the state will financially support the individual refugee.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Instead of confiscating valuables, the state could approach refugee contribution similar to recipients of social performance \(e.g. [Hartz IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartz_concept#Hartz_IV)\). The state only provides financial support when a refugee's reserve assets have been spent.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Keeping track of each refugee's financial situation, as an alternative approach, would overburden the already strained administration.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Refugees are already part of the welfare system, thus their income situation is pretty clear to those who are consulting them on the administrational side. Keeping further track after an initial "tabula rasa" would not put that much extra workload on the administration as they have already performed.
1.4.2.3. Con: Few refugees would be impacted by the confiscation because most refugees [do not own more](http://www.vice.com/read/denmark-refugees-possessions-photos-876) than €1500. Alternative methods of compulsory contribution may impact and inconvenience more refugees.
1.4.3. Pro: Taking away valuables from refugees is necessary for the state to generate revenue.
1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.3.2. Con: As there are very few refugees that have more than €1500, the revenue gained will be negligible.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: A majority of refugees possess [less than €1500](http://www.vice.com/read/denmark-refugees-possessions-photos-876) and thus only special cases will be affected.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: As of January 2019, Denmark has not confiscated [a single item](https://www.thelocal.dk/20190124/three-years-after-denmarks-infamous-jewellery-law-hit-world-headlines-not-a-single-piece-has-been-confiscated) three years after it implemented its confiscation policy.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Additional revenue can help cover the costs of the refugee's application procedure.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.3.4. Con: The EU is wealthy enough to host refugees without taking away their possessions.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: The Eurozone is still struggling with the consequences of the heavy [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis) \(debt crisis\) which started in 2009.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: Greece, for example, is not even capable of supporting their own [poor and elderly](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjulcqA7avjAhX0VBUIHYj8A_8QFjAAegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fgreece-elderly-poor-study_n_560e96c1e4b076812701a102&usg=AOvVaw131vnF7kRuf1o-8QBJW44K).
1.4.3.4.2. Con: The EU is not wealthy enough to give resources to refugees who can support themselves financially.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Con: Even if their valuable possessions weren't confiscated, many refugees wouldn't be able to support themselves financially in their new country.
1.4.3.4.2.2. Pro: Many already in the EU do not get resources even though they would really need them, such as [people in poverty](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/People_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion). Giving these resources to refugees that can sustain themselves is unfair.
1.4.3.4.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.1.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2. Con: People living in the EU have many possibilities to become successful \(compared to the regions refugees are fleeing from\). If these people remain poor it is their fault and no additional money should be spent on them.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Countries like Romania and Bulgaria do not offer a lot of possibilities to people born in poverty.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Countries like Romania or Bulgaria still offer more possibilities for people than war-torn countries like Syria, Libya or Iraq.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: There is significant and inherent discrimination in countries such as Romania and Bulgaria which can negatively influence a person's success.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Romania [discriminates](http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/MediaArchive/national/Romania%20-%20SR%202008.pdf) against the Roma in the educational system.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: The [Bulgarian Roma](http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/BGR-CbC-III-2004-2-ENG.pdf) encounter serious difficulties in many spheres of life.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: The EU already spends significant money helping less developed countries. It is reasonable to minimise any additional financial burden.
1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: The EU is supporting poor countries substantially already.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: The EU as an independent organisation \(not including individual member states\) is the [biggest donor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_by_development_aid) when it comes to official development assistance \(ODA\).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The EU umbrella organisation for aid and relief NGOs finds aid given by the European Commission to be [generally positive](https://concordeurope.org/blog/2012/10/09/eu-aid-the-facts/) across the board, including transparency, impact and effectiveness.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: In Europe, the provision of [ODA/GDP](http://www.compareyourcountry.org/aid-statistics?cr=oecd&lg=en#) is highest among the world.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3. Con: ODA is an inappropriate way of helping poor countries.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: A country used to receiving ODA may be perpetually bound to depend on handouts \([pp. 197](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ec4d/f0191a90bfe0e728d30d1dee49ff09189507.pdf)\).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Government structures adapt to handle and distribute incoming ODA. As the funding from ODA is significant, countries have vested bureaucratic interest to remain bound to aid \([pp. 197](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ec4d/f0191a90bfe0e728d30d1dee49ff09189507.pdf)\).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Many countries have benefited from ODA in their development
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: South Korea [has transformed](https://journals.openedition.org/poldev/1535) from an ODA recipient to an ODA donor
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: The Marshall Plan, which is similar to ODA \([pp. 4](http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896816.pdf)\), was [extremely successful](https://www.nber.org/papers/w3899) in Western Europe.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The Marshall Plan was no ODA as it came accompanied by US military troops that stayed. They have been critical in democratization and safeguarding a beneficial business environment, allowing for economic development.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.3. Con: ODA can relieve suffering in fragile countries, such as those [hit by natural disaster](https://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/policies/v.php?id=38665).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.4. Pro: ODA is ineffective because it leads to [fungibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) of the receiving country's regular budget.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5. Pro: ODA conditionality is reducing the effectiveness of development aid.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.1. Con: Conditionality is a [safeguard](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) against default by the borrower.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.2. Con: Conditionality is preventing [donor fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_fatigue).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.3. Con: ODA conditionality is a safeguard against [moral hazard](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) by the recipient government.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.4. Con: Conditionality reduces corruption within the recipient government [\(IMF, pp. 12-13\)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2000/wp0001.pdf).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5. Pro: The effects of ODA conditionality are mixed at best.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.1. Pro: Poor countries are often unable to implement policies [attached to conditionality](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/may/13/imf-us-congress-aid).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.2. Pro: Macro-economic targets, e.g. inflation or debt level, are typically [not conducive to growth](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.3. Pro: Conditionality targets were generally made based on [overestimated growth rates](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false) while underestimating external shocks.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.4. Pro: The effects of trade liberalization and privatization have often led to [reduced efficiency](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false), especially in public utilities.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.5. Pro: Condititionality neglects the effects of policy reform on the [poor](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.6. Con: Conditions and funds can be used as a [political resource](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) by reformers and thus increase the chances of reform.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.7. Con: Conditionality creates greater [consistency](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) over time.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.5.8. Con: Institutions demanding conditions can be used as [scapegoats](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=scapegoat&f=false) for reform.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.6. Pro: Assessment of what constitutes 'good governance' is highly arbitrary.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.6.1. Pro: The World Bank's [CPIA Index](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/CPIA) is made by individual discretion with little oversight and methodological problems. This leads to [high fluctuations](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=riddell%20assessing%20impact%20aid%20conditionality&f=false).
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.7. Con: [Less state control](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) of the economy leads to a more efficient public sector and mobilizes domestic resources leading to growth.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1.3.5.8. Pro: The [average number of conditions](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6qyEAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) per World Bank adjustment loan increased from 39 to 56 between 1980 and 1990.
1.4.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: The EU is joining in the general criticism of the existing international order and aims at strengthening UN organizations vis-a-vis the Bretton Woods organization in the [context of sustainable development](http://webtv.un.org/watch/panel-discussion-on-human-rights-based-approach-to-good-governance-23rd-meeting-30th-regular-session-of-human-rights-council/4505293520001).
1.4.3.4.3.1.3. Pro: The EU favors least-developed countries through the [Everything but Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_but_Arms) initiative, which removes duties and quotas on goods coming from these countries.
1.4.3.4.3.1.4. Pro: The EU and its Member States are directly providing support to local NGOs in the Global South.
1.4.3.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: [ENDA](http://endatiersmonde.org/instit/) provides environmental development support in the Global South.
1.4.3.4.3.1.5. Con: The EU is doing much harm to poor countries and thus cannot escape responsibility.
1.4.3.4.3.1.5.1. Pro: EU tariff laws mean less developed countries are pressured into [selling raw produce](https://capx.co/the-eu-is-making-poor-countries-poorer/) rather than processed produce, stifling development.
1.4.3.4.3.1.6. Con: The EU carries a historical responsibility for poor countries.
1.4.3.4.3.1.6.1. Pro: Europe exploited poor countries to develop. Europe should now repay these countries for this exploitation.
1.4.3.4.3.1.6.1.1. Pro: Colonies have provided [material benefits](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-colonialism/European-expansion-since-1763) to the citizens of Europe.
1.4.3.4.4. Pro: The EU is the [second largest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=46&pr.y=16&sy=2014&ey=2014&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=998&s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP&grp=1&a=1) economy in the world.
1.4.3.4.5. Pro: According to the World Bank, 24 out of the 28 EU member states rank among the top 50 [wealthiest nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita).
1.4.4. Con: The Geneva Convention states that refugees "should not be penalized for their illegal entry or stay" \([pp. 3](https://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html)\). Confiscation would be penalising them for not having previously lived in the country.
1.4.4.1. Con: It is a major principle of the Geneva Refugee Convention in chapters IV & V that refugees are [treated the same](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) as national citizens. This includes taxation and contributions to the state.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.2.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.5. Pro: Refugees have not paid for the upkeep of the social benefits they receive when they take refuge in a country, as they have not previously paid taxes in that country. Confiscation can act as an upfront method to make sure they contribute for the social benefits they will receive.
1.4.5.1. Con: Valuables of refugees were often taxed in their country of origin and thus it would create a type of double taxation.
1.4.5.2. Pro: A guiding principle of the welfare state is that you support yourself when you are able to do so.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: As the status "refugee" already suggests, self-support is not possible for a refugee, because he/she is not under the protection of his/her home state. That is precisely why the asylum state is obliged to support the refugee.
1.4.5.3. Con: Wealthier refugees, say with confiscated valuables above €1 million, would suffer disproportionate costs.
1.4.5.4. Pro: There are many inherent expenses tied to offering refugees that which they did not have in their home countries.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: Security is not a free good accessible for everybody. It costs a lot of money and everybody has to pay his/her contribution.
1.4.6. Con: [Nearly 90,000](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/nearly-90000-unaccompanied-minors-sought-asylum-in-eu-in-2015-a7010976.html) or [more than one third](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-children-make-up-more-than-a-third-of-arrivals-and-more-than-ever-are-making-deadly-a7052911.html) of arrivals are children. Children have not paid taxes in their countries of origin, so this argument is inapplicable to a large subset of the relevant refugees.
1.4.7. Con: Refugees can be economic net contributors.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Refugees pay more in taxes than governments spend on them.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: In the U.S., while it costs approximately $15,000 to settle a refugee, and the Federal government pays out an approximate further $92,000 in welfare benefits over the first 20 years of a refugees stay, it is estimated that the Federal government gets back [$129,000 in taxes](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-do-refugees-cost-us-taxpayers-2017-6) over those 20 years. So there is a net gain of about $22,000 for the Federal government when it comes to refugees who stay long-term.
1.4.7.1.1.1. Con: This net gain disappears once[inflation](https://smartasset.com/investing/inflation-calculator#xbHmVoBM2z) is taken into account. $15,000 \(to settle the refugee\) would be worth approx. $22,000 20 years later. $92,000 over the first years of a refugees stay would be worth approx 111,000 only ten years later. The government could lose about $26,000 due to inflation variance, for a total net loss of $4,000.
1.4.7.1.1.1.1. Con: It is likely that many long-term refugees will[become citizens](http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/immigration/2015/10/14/fact-check-refugees-can-become-us-citizens/73932826/) or continue to stay, which means the government will continue to receive monetary benefit from taxes without paying further welfare.
1.4.7.1.1.2. Pro: This part of the study only looked at adults \(18-45\).
If children were taken into account, the net gain over 20 years would be much higher, as the study shows child refugees attain better economic outcomes than adults.
1.4.7.1.1.3. Con: This neglects to count future pension costs of the refugee. The government may begin to make a loss as refugees retire.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Studies in the area suggest some positive [economic benefits](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1602.pdf) that can be drawn from properly handled refugee flows into a country.
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: Economically successful refugees bring with them the skills and spirit to contribute to the economy in the host country and are therefore sought after refugees.
1.4.7.2.2. Con: The study shows a modest increase in GDP growth in the short term, but for the medium term it was inconclusive and decided that "it depends".
1.4.7.3. Pro: Migrants and asylum seekers can benefit the economies of their host nations. As [shown](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaaq0883) in the data analysis of 30 years of data from 15 countries in Western Europe, migrants positively affect the economy within a year of arrival, continuing to have significant impact for 2+ years. Asylum seekers have a significant impact after 3-7 years since arrival, but it is not as strong an impact as that of other migrant groups.
1.4.7.4. Pro: A 20 year US study found [no difference in economic outcomes](http://www.nber.org/digest/aug17/w23498.shtml) between refugees who arrived as children and U.S.-born citizens.
1.5. Con: Confiscating refugee valuables can harm a country by giving them a negative international reputation.
1.5.1. Con: Laws should not be made in regards to how they will affect a country's reputation. Laws should be made in regards to necessity.
1.5.1.1. Con: A country's reputation is important.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: A country's reputation is an important source of [soft power](http://www.amazon.com/The-Future-Power-Joseph-Nye/dp/1610390695) and should not be disregarded.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Berlin's reputation as a notorious party capital attracts tourists from [all over Europe](https://www.thelocal.de/20190213/new-research-highlights-the-economic-value-of-berlins-nightlife-and-why-it-might-be-under-threat), with Berlin clubs earning the capital €1.5 billion in 2018.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: A good international reputation leads to more representation in international organizations.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Angela Merkel - who has a very good [international reputation](https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2015-angela-merkel/) - is traded as a likely [successor](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/15/opinion/why-angela-merkel-could-lead-the-un.html?_r=0) to Ban Ki-moon as UN Secretary General.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: A country having a bad reputation will result in negative consequences.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: People [do not want to travel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11936981/Who-in-their-right-mind-would-want-to-visit-Dubai.html) to countries that they think of as cruel and inhumane.
1.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Although being a [military dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt#Tenure_of_President_Mubarak_\(1981%E2%80%932011\)) for decades, Egypt remains a fairly [popular destination for tourists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Egypt) internationally.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: People do not want to interact with countries that they think of as cruel and inhumane.
1.5.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Many individuals do not want their countries [to sell arms](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-saudi-visit-to-britain-dont-trade-away-values) to Saudi Arabia.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2. Con: The US did not seem to suffer in terms of their standing and interactions with the rest of the world, despite widely-known cruelties in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: After Abu Graibh, between 2003 and 2004, the reputation of the US deteriorated significantly in Western Europe. \([time.com](http://time.com/3013299/america-approval/#y2003t2004)\)
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The [budget crisis](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/15/americans-need-discover-how-world-sees-them) undermined international US reputation in the 2003-2004 period, rather than cruelty in prisons.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: [US reputation improved](http://time.com/3013299/america-approval/#y2003t2004) in Russia and Turkey during the 2003-2004 period.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: By all major trading economies the US is seen as [more favorable](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/) than China.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Since 2002 US favorability has [not decreased](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/) around the world, even though many disapprove of US interrogation methods.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: The US is generally regarded as [favorable](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/), not cruel, around the world.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.3.2. Pro: That 50% of global publics regard the US' torture tactics as 'unjustified' did not change the picture that 69% regard the US as 'favorable'. \([pewglobal.org](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/)\)
1.5.1.1.3.2.2.4. Pro: [US favorability](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/) is more a reflection of geopolitical considerations.
1.5.1.1.3.3. Con: A bad reputation reduces constraints on a country because it allows them to cut social obligations to a community of states.
1.5.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Countries with very bad reputation do not have problems violating international law.
1.5.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: North Korea has been known to [violate international human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_North_Korea), defy the Security Council and kidnap foreign citizens.
1.5.1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: All other countries that had been known to violate international human rights tend to eventually \(sometimes from outside influences\) have to make changes, so as to no longer defy the Security Counciel and kidnap foreign citizens.
1.5.1.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Despite the fact that [Iran took US hostages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis#Aftermath) \(1979-1981\), the Iranian government hardly had to make any changes. In addition, the crisis strengthened anti-Americanism and the supporters of the hostage-taking.
1.5.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Having a bad reputation with its counterparts allows a state to impose more stringent and aggressive policies.
1.5.1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The US did not have a good relationship with Iran and this meant it did not need to care about the loss of popularity [when imposing economic sanctions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24316661).
1.5.1.1.3.4. Con: A bad reputation can be used to achieve policy objectives.
1.5.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of the German Empire, played on the bad Prussian reputation among the French to [trick them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War#Causes) into a war that unified Germany in 1870.
1.5.1.1.3.5. Pro: Public diplomacy is an important government function which is tied to international reputation. The negative effects of confiscating refugee valuables is an obstacle to this endeavor.
1.5.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: States make use of [public diplomacy](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01636608509450301) to directly communicate with foreign peoples, with the aim of affecting their thinking and, ultimately, of their governments.
1.5.2. Pro: Denmark's confiscation policy was received negatively by the media. [\[1\]](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/27/denmark-selfish-global-refugee-crisis-immigration) [\[2\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/denmark-refugees-immigration-law/431520/) [\[3\]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/denmark-pulls-back-on-welcome-mat-for-refugees-1453844339)
1.5.2.1. Con: Denmark remained among the Top 10 [most reputable](http://www.reputationinstitute.com/research/Country-RepTrak) countries in 2015. This suggests that the overall negative impacts are small.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Other countries are confiscating valuables and they did not receive negative coverage, suggesting that the confiscation itself was not the cause.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Germany [partly confiscated refugee valuables](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-follows-switzerland-and-denmark-to-seize-cash-and-valuables-from-arriving-refugees-a6828821.html) and was not criticized internationally.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: In the beginning of 2016, there was [mild criticism](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/refugee-crisis-germany-follows-denmark-seizes-jewellery-valuables-refugees-1539381) of the German practice.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.6. Con: To physically search refugees for valuables has negative effects.
1.6.1. Con: Physical checks, including strip searches and cavity searches, are routine procedures in airports, so physically searching refugees would be no different.
1.6.2. Pro: Forcing refugees to undergo a search for valuables invades their privacy and [violates their personal boundaries](https://www.reference.com/government-politics/effects-invasion-privacy-c6d3f8ccffb17f1c) in harmful ways.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.7. Pro: Confiscating refugees' valuables would work as deterrence and help keep refugees out.
1.7.1. Con: It is not clear that deterring refugees is a good thing in the first place.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Trapping displaced people in conflict zones can exacerbate conflict and overstretch foreign countries when they are drawn in.
1.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.
1.7.3. Con: It will deter wealthy refugees more than poor refugees, and is \(for the host country\) a very poorly skewed deterrence.
1.7.4. Pro: Since announcing [confiscation policies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-jewellery-law-migrants-refugees-asylum-seekers-unhcr-united-nations-a7113056.html), refugees arriving in Denmark have dropped to [a historically low number](http://refugees.dk/en/facts/numbers-and-statistics/how-many-are-coming-and-from-where/).
1.7.5. Con: Refugees are not in a state of mind to decide not to go somewhere purely because they know their money will be taken.
1.7.5.1. Con: Most refugees [have smartphones](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/surprised-that-syrian-refugees-have-smartphones-well-sorry-to-break-this-to-you-but-youre-an-idiot-10489719.html), therefore they are able to educate themselves on where their valuables will get confiscated and decide in which direction to go.
1.8. Pro: Confiscating their valuables would show that refugees have something to give in return, which would be good for their reputation.
1.8.1. Con: Refugees have labor force to offer. Instead of taking away their valuables, they just should rather be allowed to work and contribute economically.
1.8.1.1. Con: Influx of a foreign labor force could create a negative reputation from those residing in that country.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Immigration will reduce wages due to more competition for jobs from an increased labour supply.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Reduced wages because of immigration could fuel the resentments on the political right and within parts of the population even more.
1.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: This depends particularly on the extent to which migrants have skills that are substitutes or complements to those of existing workers. If the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages in the short run.
1.8.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in the wages of existing workers.
1.8.1.1.1.3. Con: Reduced wages are good for the competitiveness of companies in developed countries, which are already under pressure [due to high wages](https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-real-reason-the-german-labor-market-is-booming) compared to less developed countries.
1.8.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Economies gain economic advantage through efficiency gains rather than labor input. Asian countries [cannot compete in the long term](http://econ.sciences-po.fr/sites/default/files/file/myth_of_asias-miracle.pdf) because their economies are based mostly upon the input of production factors.
1.8.1.1.1.4. Con: Wages would only decrease if there is a static number of jobs. However, [this is false](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/21819/concepts/lump-of-labour-fallacy-immigration/): immigrants gain income to spend in the economy which in turn creates new jobs.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: Considerable time will be needed until the reputation effects can be seen. Confiscating valuables is faster and directly linked to refugees.
1.8.1.1.2.1. Pro: Benefits refugees contribute to the overall health of the economy are difficult to link to refugees given the complex interdependence of our economy and its development.
1.8.1.1.3. Con: But it shows that refugees actually have something to offer to society.
1.8.1.1.3.1. Pro: The image of a working refugee will destroy the picture of refugees depending on welfare and therewith improve their reputation.
1.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.2.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Most refugees are of working age.
1.8.1.3.1. Pro: Most refugees in Germany are [under the age of 30](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-how-do-refugees-assimilate/av-48896083).
1.8.2. Con: As valuables are only forfeited under necessity, it is unlikely it would affect their reputation \(as compared to if they were to voluntary forfeit their valuables, for example\).
1.8.3. Pro: It makes refugees more accepted among the sceptical public.
1.8.3.1. Con: People who do not accept refugees in general will not start supporting them just because they pay some money when they arrive.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: The right-wing public does not care about refugee finances but rather their religion, ethnicity and culture.
1.8.3.1.1.1. Con: What influences potential right wing voters most is economic and social status of refugees. Confiscating valuables improves refugees' economic and social status and thus will reduce support for right-wing groups. \([pp. 347-348](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11464933.pdf)\)
1.8.3.1.1.2. Pro: Anti-Muslim attitudes are causing most refugees to be turned away. These opinions do not change with confiscating valuables.
1.8.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Regardless of others being driven by racism, being able to contribute financially to their hosting country would likely reduce hate against refugees.
1.8.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Refugees contributing financially would enhance the chance that no taxpayer money would be used.
1.8.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Many Christians in Christian countries [believe that](http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/15575-most-finns-view-that-islam-is-incompatible-with-finnish-culture-and-values-finds-survey.html) Islamic refugees are incompatible with national values. Islamic refugees, therefore, are being discriminated against due to their religion.
1.8.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Not all people in Germany are Christians, so even if the two religions would not fit together, this argument would be irrelevant.
1.8.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: [Felix Baumgartner](http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/leute/felix-baumgartner-hetzt-auf-facebook-gegen-angela-merkel-und-fluechtlinge-aid-1.5720483), extreme athlete, posted a statement on Facebook, where he says he believes that Islam and Christianity do not share the same values, because of the way Islam is treating women.
1.8.3.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The value of statements of people who free fall from 40 km out of a balloon for a lemonade producer, in questions of religious/philosophical/political aspects, is questionable at best.
1.8.3.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Felix Baumgartner is, due to his [treatment](https://www.facebook.com/FelixBaumgartner/photos/a.438276003803.225765.58427163803/10153622023013804/?type=3) of women, not qualified to speak about ways of how to treat women.
1.8.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: A number of Western countries are happy to accept Christian refugees, regardless of their push-back against admitting Muslim refugees.
1.8.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: [Christian refugees](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7284/turkey-christian-refugees) which fled into Turkey \(Anatolia\) have to hide their religious identities because there is potential prosecution and discrimination.
1.8.3.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: More than three times as many Christian refugees than Muslim were admitted [into the US in 2018](https://qz.com/1272676/once-evenly-split-the-share-of-christian-refugees-admitted-to-the-us-now-far-exceeds-muslim/).
1.8.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: Right-wing German group PEGIDA make it clear that they are not concerned with the economic state of refugees, but rather their religion.
1.8.3.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: In their manifesto, right-wing group [PEGIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegida) explicitly approves the acceptance of war refugees and politically persecuted people.
1.8.3.1.1.2.4.2. Con: Right-wing group [PEGIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegida) explicitly states that it does not oppose Muslims who have integrated into society.
1.8.3.1.1.2.4.3. Pro: The name of right-wing group PEGIDA \(Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident\) itself shows the group are not opposed to refugees in general, but to Muslims specifically.
1.8.3.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: A British organizer of PEGIDA states that their [main motivation](http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/feb/28/newcastle-pegida-organiser-explains-reasons-for-march-video) for protesting is their fear of Islam.
1.8.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.2.4.
1.8.3.1.1.4. Pro: Demonstrations against refugees, especially in Germany, are held due to [underlying racism](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/world/europe/pegida-rally-dresden-germany.html?_r=1) rather than the lack of social acceptance.
1.8.3.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.2.1.
1.8.3.1.1.4.2. Con: It is not racism but the intolerance towards Islam that drives the fears in the population.
1.8.3.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.2.3.
1.8.3.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.2.4.4.
1.8.3.1.1.4.3. Pro: [AfD supporters](http://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/afd-supporters-lean-towards-xenophobia-and-fascism-research-says/) lean towards xenophobia and fascism, money cannot change that.
1.8.3.1.1.4.4. Con: The new radical right is [primarily supported](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227620490_'Immigration_Sceptics_Xenophobes_or_Racists_Radical_Right-wing_Voting_in_Western_Europe') by voters who are unhappy about the prevailing immigration policy rather than xenophobes or racists.
1.8.3.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Only the appeal on the immigration issue [unites](http://cps.sagepub.com/content/41/1/3.full.pdf) all successful populist right parties while racism performs little in this task.
1.8.3.1.1.4.4.2. Con: Ethnonationalist xenophobia served as the [major driver](http://jensrydgren.com/Is%20extreme%20right-wing%20populism.pdf) for right wing political parties since the 1970s.
1.8.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.1.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Public dissatisfaction with the political regime significantly facilitates [right-wing extremism](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.203.4186&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Confiscating valuables creates more satisfaction and thus makes refugees more acceptable.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: Many people are afraid that their country cannot pay for all the incoming refugees and see the refugees as competition regarding social welfare, jobs, etc. This may change if refugees have to contribute to their "new country" financially.
1.8.3.2.1.1. Con: €1500 is [not enough](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/refugee-costs-88-billion-80-000-per-immigrant-free-welfare-medicaid) to cover the costs of integrating refugees, thus will not change the mind of people who fear refugees would take away state benefits.
1.8.3.2.2. Pro: It is a symbolic gesture that would appease the right-wing public.
1.8.3.2.2.1. Con: Radical right-wing groups can tout the gesture as their success and therewith gain more supporters.
1.8.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: The Swiss People's Party which supported the Minaret Ban lists it as their success and uses it to advocate their later opinions.
1.8.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Most people that would vote radical right, would do so, no matter whether these parties have proven that they were effective in bringing legislative change or not.
1.8.3.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Populism exactly rides on decrying current situations. Populist parties do not need to prove anything.
1.8.3.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Populist parties can create the image of being successful in delivering their utopian promises.
1.8.3.2.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Nobody votes for a party that seems incapable of delivering on its promises, in case it got elected.
1.8.3.2.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.1.
1.8.3.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.
1.8.4. Con: Immigrants contribute their cultural diversity to their new community.
