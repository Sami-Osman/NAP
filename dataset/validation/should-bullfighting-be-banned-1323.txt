Discussion Name: Should Bullfighting be Banned?

1. Traditional bullfighting - the practice of fighting with bulls that includes physically injuring them - should be banned.
1.1. Pro: Bullfighting is overly dangerous for participants and spectators.
1.1.1. Pro: There is an upper limit on the amount of harm that the government should allow people to expose themselves to in the course of employment or leisure.
1.1.1.1. Con: People are free to harm themselves. [Self-harm practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm) are often not banned.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Self-harm practices are a [sign](https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Related-Conditions/Self-harm) of a lack of coping skills and often associated to mental illnesses. Illnesses cannot be prohibited, while bullfighting can.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Employment can be a coercive factor in decision-making, particularly for the economically vulnerable.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Bullfighting schools are relatively [expensive](http://www.bullfightschool.com/events/spain.shtml). It is unlikely that the economically vulnerable will become bullfighters.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: One could attend bullfighting school at a time when they have money to do so, but this does not mean that they will always have the economic freedom to make rational decisions.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: [Scholarships](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-aug-17-mn-23297-story.html) exist for matador schools.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: If someone takes a job on account of economic pressures, the state should not let them risk their life in the course of their employment.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Individual participants do not necessarily understand the risks. Governments are in a better position to make this assessment and should act accordingly.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Bullfighters go through comprehensive [training](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/mexico-child-matadors-bullring) and are well aware of the sport's dangers.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Being told the dangers does not mean that you understand them, or are in a position to appropriately weigh them.
1.1.1.4. Con: The government does not restrict the right of people to work in far more common, yet dangerous industries.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: For example, [poultry workers](http://file:///C:/Users/Gregor/Downloads/ijerph-13-00197%20\(4\).pdf) are exposed to a diverse set of dangers.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/01/24/abuses-against-workers-taint-us-meat-and-poultry) has called meatpacking "the most dangerous factory job in America".
1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: In other branches of the meat industry, safety standards are very high and the percentage of workers injured each year in the US has decreased from [20% in the late '90s to 6% in 2012](https://www.meatinstitute.org/index.php?ht=a/GetDocumentAction/i/83419/).
1.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: In the United States, 151 people died from [meat and poultry jobs](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/676796.pdf) between 2004-2013, averaging 15 deaths per year.
1.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: This is not an accurate comparison, given the number of people employed as workers in each industry. There are around [500,000](https://www.meatinstitute.org/index.php?ht=d/sp/i/47465/pid/47465) people employed in the meat and poultry industry in the US alone. In contrast, there are only [661](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27520374) bullfights each year in Spain.
1.1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: In 2013, there were at least [47 injuries in 661 bullfights](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27520374). This amounts to an injury in 7% of the fights.
1.1.1.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Many of the injuries are gruesome to watch, as they usually involve someone being stabbed by the bull's horns.
1.1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: In addition, those 500,000 meat and poultry workers are mostly working full time, and therefore have significantly more opportunities to be injured than bullfighters who are working in short irregular events.
1.1.1.5. Con: Taking away the right to choose meaningful employment removes individual agency.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: This does not take away the right to choose meaningful employment - there are many other industries people could be meaningfully employed in.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: Individual agency is not an absolute value. It needs to be weighed against other values such as social utility.
1.1.1.6. Pro: The risk and danger are an integral form of what makes bullfighting appealing as an art form. This cannot be compared to other forms of employment where risk and danger are an unwelcome side effect. Because this inherent danger cannot be ameliorated, the practice should simply be banned.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: Other sports, too, are based on risk and yet face no ban, for example extreme sports such as base jumping.
1.1.1.7. Pro: Bullfighting degrades the people that participate as well as the animals that are exploited. No one should be proud of terrorizing and torturing an animal trapped in a ring.
1.1.2. Pro: In various cases, spectators have been seriously injured during bullfights.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In 2010, a bull escaped the ring during a bullfight in northern Spain and [injured](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7953990/Bull-jumps-from-ring-into-crowded-stands-during-bullfight-in-northern-Spain.html) more than 40 spectators.
1.1.2.2. Pro: In 2015, a bull jumped over a barrier during a bullfight in Peru and [injured](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34586004) at least four people.
1.1.2.3. Pro: In 2014, a bull managed to jump over a fence in a bullring in Mexico City and [injured](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2555614/The-moment-half-tonne-beast-leaps-fence-Mexico-City-bullring.html) at least one person.
1.1.2.4. Pro: In 2006, a bull jumped into the stands of Mexico City’s most famous bullring and [injured](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11107702/ns/world_news-americas/t/bull-jumps-stands-mexico-city/) several spectators.
1.1.2.5. Con: These instances may be a reason for better safety precautions but not for an outright ban.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Fatal accidents in [American ice hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Brittanie_Cecil) have not resulted in calls for banning the events, merely for better measures to protect spectators from stray pucks.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: It is easier to stop a small inanimate object from leaving a playing field than a half-tonne panicked animal.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Following the [Le Mans disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Le_Mans_disaster), car racing underwent substantial reform to stop similar incidents in the future.
1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: After the 1955 Le Mans accident, some sponsors and participants imposed a voluntary ban on themselves, such as [Mercedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Le_Mans_disaster#After_the_race).
1.1.2.5.3. Pro: Following the [Bradford City fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_City_stadium_fire), sports stadiums in the UK were regulated to prevent future fires or deaths in such incidents.
1.1.2.5.3.1. Con: The Bradford City fire was a fire entirely unrelated to the match or the sport, the issue was simply building standards. Regulating the construction of a building is a simple task, ensuring that spectators are sufficiently fenced off from a panicked, 600-odd-kilo animal is not, at least without removing them so significantly from the "action" that bullfights would be functionally unwatchable live.
1.1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: It would be roughly as reasonable to claim that the [Theatre Royal disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Exeter) means that theatre is unsafe, or that the [Bethnal Green disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green_tube_station#Wartime_disaster) means that stairs are death-traps.
1.1.2.5.4. Pro: Better, stronger barriers could be built to help protect spectators.
1.1.3. Pro: Professional and non-professional bullfighters suffer [severe injuries](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/matador-gored-to-death-in-spanish-bullfight-is-first-bullfighter/) and sometimes even death.
1.1.3.1. Con: In July 2016, the bullfighter Victor Barrios was the first to [die](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/matador-gored-to-death-in-spanish-bullfight-is-first-bullfighter/) in the ring since 1985. Therefore, the practice went 31 years without a single dead professional bullfighter in Spain.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The total number of casualties in 2015, one of the [highest in years](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/death-toll-bull-running-festivals-spain-rises-12-fatal-goring-spanish-man-1517764), was [13 deaths](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.20minutos.es%2Fnoticia%2F2549318%2F0%2Fmuertos-toros-2015%2Ffestejos-taurinos-espana%2Fmurchante-navarra%2F). And since 2000, [74 people](http://spanishnewstoday.com/bull-run-death-toll-rises-to-12_22086-a.html) have died in bullfighting incidents.
1.1.3.3. Pro: In any reasonable sport, death should not occur except in the rarest of circumstances. Bullfighting makes the news every year for people having died by goring, trampling or some other gruesome means.
1.1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.3.1.1.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Bullfighting carries a considerable risk of [serious, life-threatening injuries](http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Abstract/2006/10000/Chirurgica_Taurina__A_10_Year_Experience_of.32.aspx).
1.1.4. Con: Injuries and deaths are not an integral part of bullfighting and its competitiveness, but unfortunate accidents, similar to injuries in any other sport.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Around the world, more than 100 soccer players have [died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_association_footballers_who_died_while_playing) while playing or shortly after since 1984. Therefore, applying the same logic, soccer should equally be banned.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: These numbers are misleading: soccer matches are vastly more numerous and frequent than bullfighting.
1.1.4.2. Pro: These cases are very infrequent in bullfights.
1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.3.1.1.
1.1.4.4. Con: No sport ends with the deliberate death of one unwilling participant.
1.1.5. Con: [The aggression catharsis hypothesis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-2337\(1984\)10:2%3C91::AID-AB2480100203%3E3.0.CO;2-7/abstract) suggests that bullfights are useful to collectively free ourselves of negative and aggressive feelings, which are inherent to human nature, thereby ensuring people do not take out their aggression on others.
1.1.5.1. Con: The public celebration of cruelty, violence and death normalises these things in society.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: When people see these activities applauded by audiences, they internalise the idea that these activities are accepted by society in general. This damages the important social norms against violence and cruelty in general.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: While this is a common claim in commentary on violent activities, there is a lack of research to back up the claim that such a link exists.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: There is something sad when you see people enjoying the torture an death of an animal. Even if its prettied up with music, sun, sangria, beautiful colors and a pasodoble played by the band. To kill an animal for pleasure, art or joy makes us less humans.
1.1.5.1.4. Pro: Continued depiction of cruelty to animals makes for a society insensitive to the suffering of any sentient being and contributes to the immorality witnessed every day via social media, television and 24/7 news sources.
1.1.5.1.5. Con: Spain has relatively low murder rates: clearly the presence of bullfighting alone is not a good indicator of violent impulses in a society. [elmundo](https://web.archive.org/web/20180805052115/http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2018/01/12/5a577b2eca4741687c8b465b.html)
1.1.5.1.6. Pro: Watching an animal suffering for enjoyment will lessen peoples capacity to empathy. Being repeatedly exposed to pain and suffering of a living being while people around them cheer may reaffirm that animals are to be treated as objects and do not deserve empathy. They may then be less likely to react when faced with suffering and pain of other living beings outside of the arena.
1.1.5.1.7. Pro: Children are especially vulnerable to normalisation of aggression when exposed to violence at bullfights.
1.1.5.1.7.1. Con: A lot of countries put [age limits](http://www.cas-international.org/en/pages/legislation.html) on bullfighting arenas, so small children are not bullfighting spectators. In Ecuador the minimum age is 16, in Venezuela 18 and in Spain it varies from 12 to 16.
1.1.5.1.7.1.1. Con: In Spain, the relevant laws vary from place to place and in a lot of cases [there are no restrictions](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldiario.es%2Fandalucia%2Fenclave_rural%2FMenores-plazas-toros-Utrera-Espana_0_216279166.html&edit-text=&act=url). Even when they exist, they are rarely enforced and only recently have some organisers [been fined](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fgaceta.es%2Fnoticias%2Fmulta-historica-palma-entrar-menores-los-toros-01022016-2055) for letting children in the arenas.
1.1.5.1.7.2. Pro: Adults who attended bullfighting as minors have memories that persist after many years, and are often associated with [negative feelings and trauma](http://faada.org/userfiles/file/JP%20Richier%20bullfights%20and%20children.pdf).
1.1.5.1.7.3. Con: Of only 300 murders that year in Spain, the only European country with bullfighting, only 60 of those involved minors as perpetrators in 2016. Germany, only one year later, reported a very similar number of 53, despite no possibility of its youth being exposed to bullfighting . [el correo](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.elcorreo.com/bizkaia/homicidios-registrados-espana-20180122160406-nt.html) [statista](https://web.archive.org/save/https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37370/umfrage/jugendkriminalitaet---tatverdaechtige-minderjaehrige-bei-ausgewaehlten-gewaltverbrechen/)
1.1.5.1.7.4. Pro: The violence children see in bullfighting can impact their compassion towards other beings, even humans and make them less compassionate and less kind. We should try to have more compassion in the world, not less.
1.1.5.1.7.5. Pro: Humans learn by [imitation](http://web.colby.edu/socialpsychology/2015/03/21/social-learning-learning-through-imitation/). Exposition to such violence as something "joyful" \(especially at young age\) may likely lead to more violence and the justification of it.
1.1.5.1.7.6. Pro: Children who have been largely exposed to TV violence are [generally more inclined](http://investigacion.ilce.edu.mx/stx.asp?id=2383&db=&ver=) to assume aggressive and dominant behaviours.
1.1.5.1.7.7. Pro: Problems associated with [children's exposure to violence](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.445) include disruption of typical developmental trajectories through psychobiological effects, posttraumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\), cognitive consequences, and peer problems.
1.1.5.1.7.8. Pro: Children who have been exposed to violence show much higher levels of aggression than those who have had no exposure \([Gentile, p.33-34](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2TaaBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=affects+of+media+violence+on+children&ots=-RWLUT_sfF&sig=8TbLsEICl5pKD9AQjxJ7_0B44vw#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.1.5.1.7.9. Pro: As children are exposed to violence they negatively internalize the behavior \([p. 33](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2TaaBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=affects+of+media+violence+on+children&ots=-RWLUT_sfF&sig=8TbLsEICl5pKD9AQjxJ7_0B44vw#v=onepage&q&f=false)(In other words, these findings suggest that acute exposure to a violent video game, even for less than 30 minutes, causes acute desensitization to violence, which then increases the tendency to behave aggressively.)\).
1.1.5.1.7.10. Con: Bullfighting can be [televised](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses) during hours when children are less likely to watch, e.g. after 10pm.
1.1.5.1.7.10.1. Con: Children can simply watch bullfighting online, as in this [channel](http://www.teletoro.com/).
1.1.5.1.7.10.2. Con: This does not keep children from attending the actual bullfights or looking at the television.
1.1.5.1.7.10.3. Pro: The [Spanish](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/221969/Spain-s-BBC-bans-live-TV-bullfighting) state-owned TVE stopped the live coverage of bullfights between 6am and 10pm, because it considered it not suitable for children.
1.1.5.1.7.10.3.1. Con: This regulation was overturned for [Spanish bullfights](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/bullfighting-returns-spanish-state-tv), allowing them to be aired during [prime time television](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/spanish-bullfights-televised-children-watching_n_4072544.html).
1.1.5.1.7.10.3.2. Con: This decision was [revoked](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/bullfighting-returns-spanish-state-tv) by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in 2012.
1.1.5.1.7.11. Pro: In some regions of Spain, children under 14 years of age have to be accompanied by an adult because of the cruelty of the events \([Brandes, p. 788](http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Brandes%20on%20Politics%20of%20Bullfights.pdf)\).
1.1.5.1.7.12. Con: Children are exposed to far more violence in video games and films, and for much longer periods of time.
1.1.5.1.7.12.1. Con: The violence portrayed in the media is fictional and not real.
1.1.5.1.7.13. Pro: The screening of early evening bullfights by Portugal’s state owned TV station was [prohibited](http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/view/963-23) by a court verdict. The court found that televised bullfights can have negative impacts on minors and on the development of their personality.
1.1.5.2. Con: As rational human beings, we can find other ways to free ourselves of negative feelings \(e.g. [art therapy](http://fulltext.study/article/344035/The-treatment-of-aggression-using-arts-therapies-in-forensic-psychiatry-Results-of-a-qualitative-inquiry)\), which avoid the pain of animals.
1.1.5.3. Con: It is irrational to think that enacting violence against someone frees us of that very violence. Just as meditation and acts of peace stimulate a peaceful state of mind. Violence and hurting others begets violence and the capacity and tendency to hurt others. [Catharsis and Aggression in Social Psychology.](https://study.com/academy/lesson/catharsis-and-aggression-in-social-psychology-definition-examples.html)
1.1.5.4. Con: The act of collective [scapegoating](https://www.britannica.com/topic/scapegoat) the bull in this way does not in and of itself justify a practice.
1.1.5.5. Con: The [Cambridge Declaration of Conscience](https://io9.gizmodo.com/prominent-scientists-sign-declaration-that-animals-have-5937356) declares animals as sentient, so such the relief from aggression applies to nonhuman animals as well.
1.1.5.6. Con: Several [other sports](http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781441966292-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1202939-p174003059.) satisfy this need already, such wrestling, rodeo or ice-hockey.
1.1.5.6.1. Con: Rodeos are also [cruel](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120207-ethical-traveller-are-rodeos-a-form-of-culture-or-cruelty) and should also be banned by the logic of the topic.
1.1.5.6.2. Con: No animals may be killed for audience satisfaction at a rodeo, but [animal cruelty](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=11754811) is still a big part of it.
1.1.5.6.3. Con: Bullfighters, and by extension, bullfighting enthusiasts, are [uncommonly sensation-seeking individuals](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199409/when-bullfightings-in-the-blood). The thrill comes from the extreme nature of the sport. It is unlikely that a rodeo will satisfy these desires.
1.1.5.6.3.1. Con: There are plenty of sports that involve a risk to participant's lives, and high-adrenaline - rodeo-riding is actually a very good example.
1.1.5.7. Con: Negative and aggressive feelings are [not inherent](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/01/04/science-suggests-humans-are-not-inately-violent-and-vicious/) to humans but socially and culturally produced.
1.1.5.8. Con: The catharsis hypothesis - that aggressive behavior reduces anger and aggression - has been consistently proven wrong; [aggressive behavior](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/200909/you-cant-punch-your-way-out-anger) rather leads to more aggressive thoughts and behavior \([Bushman et al., p. 368, 374](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/bbs99.pdf)\).
1.1.5.8.1. Pro: If aggression towards animals is precieved as normal, the step to aggression against other humans is smaller as well.
1.1.5.8.2. Pro: Children who were shown [videos](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227636679_Effects_of_viewing_videos_of_bullfights_on_Spanish_children) of bullfighting were seen to have higher levels of aggression.
1.1.5.9. Con: Watching and participating in bullfights harms the emotional and mental well-being of children.
1.1.5.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.7.
1.1.5.9.2. Pro: The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed its concern about the physical and mental well-being of children involved in the training, as well as the mental and emotional well-being of children who watch bullfights. It considered the eventual prohibition of the participation of children in bullfighting. [\(UNCRC, p. 10\)](http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CRC/Shared%20Documents/PRT/CRC_C_PRT_CO_3-4_16303_E.pdf)
1.1.6. Con: Participation in and spectacting of bullfighting is not mandatory. If people want to risk life and limb doing something dangerous, fully informed, then a government has no special business stopping them from doing so.
1.1.7. Pro: Bull fighting is [cruel](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156691263206224&set=gm.2700344629992123&type=3&eid=ARCiSmpqxzEz13-fBhEA2O_FakEiiVyYUVzcB4Yyz5XDLWzDqoLanaNmnbL08ARBWc7i4O6SKngMXLEP), not just to the bull, but also to men expected to risk themselves for other people's entertainment.
1.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.1.9. Pro: There is concern that exposure to bullfighting can [significantly harm](https://one-voice.fr/en/blog/one-voice-infiltrates-a-bullfighting-school-for-children.html)(Psychologists around the world are worried about the impact it can have on brain development and empathy of children, to receive these conflicting signals from adults around them: we must not hurt others and we must applaud those who kill the bulls in the arena ... It is an education of sadism, and this has deleterious repercussions on their psyche.) a child's mental health and brain development.
1.1.9.1. Pro: In Mexico, the practice of [novillada](https://www.worldanimalfoundation.org/advocate/farm-animals/params/post/1280842/the-truth-about-bullfighting)(Mexican bullfighting has an added feature: novillada, or baby bullfights. There is no ritual in this slaughter of calves. Baby bulls, some no more than a few weeks old, are brought into a small arena where they are stabbed to death by spectators, many of whom are children.) uses extremely young calves in the ring.
1.1.9.2. Con: Being a child matador helps develop [high levels of discipline](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/25/spain-young-bullfighters-a-photo-essay)(When I saw the kids training, I was struck by how nice they were and how disciplined. At first I thought I was going to do some kind of critique of it all, but I didn’t want to use the kids in that way because it’s just the world in which they happen to have grown up. I also came to realise that it wasn’t all about machismo. In a certain way, it’s not just about the killing either. It’s a really special atmosphere. I wanted to show that these aren’t cruel, aggressive, evil kids – which is how people in Poland usually see them.).
1.2. Pro: Bullfighting is cruel.
1.2.1. Con: ["Toro Bravo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Fighting_Bull) bulls are bred in much [better conditions](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8916880/To-the-Spanish-bullfighting-is-much-more-than-a-sport.html) than regular livestock cattle. They live a luxurious life before going to the bull ring.
1.2.1.1. Pro: If bullfighting were forbidden, the "[Toro Bravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Fighting_Bull)" cattle population would no longer exist and become [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Bull populations and breeds can be sustained even though no bullfighting is practiced.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is a growing interest in bull meat in [gourmet](http://www.livescience.com/56488-what-happens-to-bulls-after-bullfight.html) cuisine and an increase in [demand](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/fighting-bull-beef-most-ecological-meat-in-world). Some chefs and experts believe it should be [appreciated](https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elmundo.es%2Fcultura%2F2014%2F02%2F23%2F53098750e2704e06218b456a.html&edit-text=&act=url) and preserved regardless of bullfighting. If this trend takes root, some farmers could breed bulls for their meat instead of fighting.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: These breeds can be protected by the state in large reserves.
1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Using controlled breeding or genetic engineering, we can always recreate the "Toro Bravo" characteristics if need be.
1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Niche farmers sustain the populations of rare species, such as [Highland Cattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_cattle).
1.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Highland cattle are particularly well-suited to the Scottish climate, and thrive more successfully there than other breeds. This is a simple matter of self-interest on the part of farmers.
1.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: "Toro Bravo" bulls are not only used in bullfights but also in the famous [Running of the Bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_of_the_Bulls) in Pamplona.
1.2.1.1.1.5.1. Con: In Pamplona's celebrations, bulls [suffer](http://www.animanaturalis.org/p/1433/the_cruelty_of_the_running_of_san_fermin) electric shocks to make them run and are harassed by runners in the streets; a stressing environment for animals bred in quiet fields. At the end of the festivities, bulls are killed in the arena anyway. Therefore, if bullfighting is banned, these practices should be banned as well.
1.2.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Bulls are [naturally fairly sedentary](http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-bull-taming-is-cruelty-at-its-best-tn-parties-using-it-for-political-gains-2564184.html), and are neither inclined towards nor suited to sustained physical exertion of the kind this is used to cause. This alone is cruel, as it causes [metabolic acidosis](http://colvetcadiz.org/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=40&Itemid=209), which causes muscle damage, and various other stress-related suffering.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: "Toro Bravo" is a breed created by humans to be especially aggressive. They are unnatural and have no value outside of bullfighting. We should let the population die out.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: If we bred aggression, stamina, etc. into the breed we can also breed those characteristics out and select for characteristics that are more conducive to beef, leather or milk production.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Or we can simply find bulls like the breed which already have those characteristics and save a lot of time. Breeding them out would still make the current form become extinct anyway.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: The "Toro Bravo" cattle population is not its own species; and calling it a "race" would not be accurate either, since it doesn't have substantial physical differences with other bulls. It's just a more violent breed. If their dissapearance is a real concern, they could be mixed in with other cattle until their violent behaviour gets flushed out, while preserving other characteristics.
1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Humans did not create the breed Toro Bravo, we simple used the process of artificial selection to shape the extant [Bos Taurus](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9913) and created a new taxonomic label.
1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: "Toro Bravo" do not have any more right to life than any other cattle. Animal rights are premised on sentience, not whether they display characteristics that humans appreciate.
1.2.1.1.2.3.1. Con: That right applies to individuals, not species. That does not mean we should prevent a species from disappearing, not by this logic.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Humans created the "Toro Bravo". We are entitled to discontinue the breed \(humanely\) if need be.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.1.1.4. Con: It is not in the interest of any animal population to be bred simply to suffer for the sake of humankind.
1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: If these bulls only exist in captivity to be harmed, it might be better for the species if they were extinct.
1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Aside from the animals, there is the possibility that bull breeders will sell the "[dehesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehesa)" \(open forest used for pasturing the [bulls](http://www.turismoextremadura.com/viajar/turismo/en/ven-a-extremadura/Dehesa-y-Toro-00001/)\) to property developers, with the consequent loss of natural habitat.
1.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Since most "dehesas" are cataloged as [rustic land](https://www.villasfincas.com/2391-can-build-rustic-land-andalusia.html), and thus protected from construction, it is unlikely that they can be repurposed.
1.2.1.1.6. Con: They wouldn't face extinction rather than a decrease in its numbers, given that officially there would be no more "corridas". But, since nowadays [their flesh is sold](http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2014/02/23/53098750e2704e06218b456a.html) to be processed and eaten after killed in "la plaza", it is probable that the "Toro Bravo" business would continue to serve meat industry [alleged "high quality meat"](http://www.contextoganadero.com/ganaderia-sostenible/el-destino-del-toro-de-lidia-cuando-la-faena-concluye) and as breeders.
1.2.1.1.6.1. Con: Being forced into the meat industry would change the eugenic selection they face, their lifespan and their life condition for the worse.
1.2.1.1.7. Con: If the people who raise Toros Bravos actually cared about them, they would continue to raise them regardless of whether or not there are bullfights. Their claims as to their probable extinction should there not be bullfights, only point to their total lack of regard for the well-being of the very animals they claim to defend.
1.2.1.1.7.1. Con: People who invest and raise 'Toros Bravos' do so to get economic returns. Regardless if they care about the animals or not, their livelihood depends on these animals being necessary due to the existence of bullfights.
1.2.1.1.8. Con: Breeding bulls for bullfights causes ecological problems.
1.2.1.1.8.1. Pro: The 'toro de lidia' is [one of the best candidate](https://rewildingeurope.com/news/genetic-study-shows-how-close-primitive-cattle-breeds-are-to-the-lost-aurochs/) for rewilding since they are one of the closest relative to the extinct Aurochs. Selective breeding for anything that isn't to recreate the Aurochs should be ceased to prevent any further genetic harm so as to not hinder the rewilding effort any further.
1.2.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Based on how valuable the [breed](https://rewildingeurope.com/news/genetic-study-shows-how-close-primitive-cattle-breeds-are-to-the-lost-aurochs/) is for rewilding purpose, the 'toro de lidia' should definitely be protected until the world finally understand that we don't have the right to selectively breed species or make them go extinct.
1.2.1.1.9. Pro: Following a court order banning jallikattu, a form of bullfighting in Tamil Nadu, India, some native breeds used for the sport are on the verge of [extinction](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36798500).
1.2.1.1.9.1. Con: This was only proclaimed by one bullfighting supporter and lacks [credibility](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36798500).
1.2.1.1.9.2. Con: It is difficult to imagine a whole breed becoming extinct within the year that's passed since the ban on bullfighting in India.
1.2.1.1.9.3. Con: The breeds in question were under [threat of extinction](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Efforts-on-to-conserve-a-few-TN-cattle-breeds/articleshow/7014903.cms) at least as far back as 2010, long before the ban. Clearly, bullfighting does little to preserve these species.
1.2.1.1.9.4. Con: They are breeds, not species. The extinction of a breed is meaningless, If we take a bull from that stock and breed it with a Norman dairy cow, we create a new breed. When that cow dies, that breed is extinct.. nothing lost, and the breed can be recreated at any time.
1.2.1.1.10. Pro: Beef as side-product from bullfighting bulls was called '[the most ecological meat in the world](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/fighting-bull-beef-most-ecological-meat-in-world)'. This would be lost if bullfighting is prohibited.
1.2.1.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.10.2. Con: There does not appear to be any particular evidence that the cattle in question have a smaller environmental footprint than other cattle. Indeed, given that they are kept alive past the point at which other cattle would be slaughtered for food, they may indeed be less environmentally friendly.
1.2.1.1.10.2.1. Pro: The argument used to support this seems to be that the land used to rear bulls for bullfighting also [acts as nature preserves](http://www.newstatesman.com/global-issues/2008/06/bullfighting-spain-bulls). There is nothing inherent in the rearing of these particular bulls that ensures this - indeed, establishing actual nature preserves would be far more effective.
1.2.1.1.10.2.2. Con: In taking in a holistic view of animal-welfare and ecology, the meat from these bulls could be better on account of the [happiness](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/fighting-bull-beef-most-ecological-meat-in-world) levels of the bulls.
1.2.1.1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.4.
1.2.1.1.10.4. Pro: Beef from bullfighting cattle is quite [rare](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/08/01/746659693/the-eating-of-the-bulls-from-the-spanish-fighting-ring-to-the-plate?t=1612381039536) and so would not have a large ecological impact.
1.2.1.1.11. Con: Toro Bravo cattle are born to be animals, not to be a material for fighting sports.
1.2.1.2. Con: Cruelty and torture become no more ethical because of what happened prior to that.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Bulls bred for fighting in Spain live an average [lifespan](http://www.aficionados-international.com/general-information/the-spanish-fighting-bull) of between 4 to 5 years grazing in open fields, whereas bulls bred for meat in the UK have a lifespan of approximately [2 years](https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/slaughtering-beef-animals-12-months-profitable-say-scientists) [locked](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/cows/dairy-cows/) up most of the time inside before being killed by a metal [bolt](https://www.hsa.org.uk/methods/captive-bolt-stunning) in their brain.
1.2.1.4. Pro: If there was a ranking of cruel practices to be banned created by a valid authority based on the % of time spent suffering, 'toros bravos' \(bulls\) would not be in the fist half of the ranking, because they just suffer 0,00046% of their life \(20 min. out of 5 years\). So, there are many other activities to be banned before that one and we should focus on them.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: The relatively smaller size of one injustice does not justify an injustice on a larger scale. Genocide may be much worse than murder, yet this does not absolve one-off murderers.
1.2.1.5. Con: Just because they have it better than livestock cattle doesn't justify the violence being done to them in the name of entertainment.
1.2.1.6. Pro: "Toro Bravo" bulls are not given hormones or chemicals, and regularly have a large area in which to graze and roam around \([p. 22](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)(It could also be argued that these bulls are actually treated much better than animals that are bred specifically for consumption. They are given a large area toroam around in instead of being kept in small cages like many of the animals here in the US that are bred just for food. In some places, these animals that are bred specifically for consumption are treated horribly, such as baby chicks having their beaks clipped, and are not given quick, painless deaths. These bulls are given healthy meals and the animals we breed for consumption are fed all sorts of awful chemicals and hormones. Is it really fair to point fingers at a culture that condones bullfighting ifwe ourselves legally allow companies to mistreat animals simply because they are bred for the purpose of eating?)\).
1.2.1.7. Pro: Bullfighting bulls experience only 15 minutes of fierce and stressful combat while livestock experience a lifetime of horror.
1.2.1.7.1. Con: This comparison does not change the fact that they are still bred for torture and death. Not to mention immoral entertainment
1.2.1.7.2. Con: These are two separate issues, one does not make the other more acceptable. This does not justify breeding the bulls only for the purpose of torturing and killing them for the sake of entertainment.
1.2.2. Con: The collective enjoyment that a large crowd gains from watching bullfighting exceeds the individual pain of a single bull. On a utilitarian basis, a bullfight is a net positive.
1.2.2.1. Pro: People find pleasure in boxing, mixed martial arts, wrestling, and other competitive full-contact-sports despite them being brutal.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Even if the cruelty in these sports was on the same level, this would simply demonstrate that these activities should also be banned as excessively cruel.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: In these sports participation is voluntary for all participants. That can't be said about bullfighting.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The bull is brought against its will, facing spears, javelins and swords, completely unaware of why it has to fight for its life.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: People do not die in boxing, mixed martial arts, wrestling and other competitive full-contact-sports \(or at least, this is not the main purpose of the match\).
1.2.2.1.4. Con: People are not tortured in boxing, mixed martial arts, wrestling and other competitive full-contact-sports.
1.2.2.2. Con: By this logic, the public torture and execution of innocent humans should be allowed, so long as there is a sufficient audience cheering along.
1.2.2.3. Con: It is immoral to feel pleasure, satisfaction and entertainment associated with another being's pain.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Feelings can't be immoral. Morality is about actions and choice. Emotions in general can't be chosen and this would make some individuals inherently evil.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: True, but in this case the action and choice is still immoral. Perhaps some individuals are inherently evil.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: Going by this logic, it would mean we can allow a person to have the urge/FEEL to rape because they haven't committed the action/choice yet.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Bullfighting is purely for entertainment but for many people it is distressing.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: The vast majority of tourists are appalled by what happens at a bullfight and leave after they see what happens to the first bull \([p. 15](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)\).
1.2.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Word-of-mouth reviews from appalled tourists will, over time, degrade the pool of foreigners interested in seeing a bullfight.
1.2.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Even if they leave after the first match, tourists have already paid for the experience. Thus, it is still an economic boost to regions where bullfighting is practiced.
1.2.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Generally speaking, relying on dissatisfied customers is not a good economic model.
1.2.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: After witnessing the cruelty involved, [90%](https://www.worldanimalfoundation.com/advocate/farm-animals/params/post/1280842/the-truth-about-bullfighting) of tourists who attend a fight will never return to watch another.
1.2.2.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Tourists are almost by definition one-time or at the very least extremely infrequent visitors.
1.2.2.4. Con: As our appreciation for life changes, societies gradually lose enjoyment in ending life. [Gladiator fights](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/colosseum)(The Colosseum saw some four centuries of active use, until the struggles of the Western Roman Empire and the gradual change in public tastes put an end to gladiatorial combats and other large public entertainments by the 6th century A.D.) were appreciated in the past, but we now acknowledge that the torture and violence involved would be unacceptable \(even if potentially entertaining\).
1.2.2.5. Pro: The entertainment a person obtains from watching a bullfight should not be considered more or less moral than their enjoyment of consuming a steak. If anything, bullfighting is a much more moral activity than consuming meat because the former is more rarely done and kills fewer animals.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Infrequency does not make an individual act any more or less moral.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: At best, this demonstrates that eating beef should also be banned.
1.2.2.5.3. Con: The [killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter#Methods) of cattle animals is done as [instantaneously](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14895534) as possible. It's proven that an animal that suffers before getting killed ruins the flavor. While for a "toro bravo" the suffering is long and the meat is wasted.
1.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: Despite the excellent living conditions of bulls, as they are not bred to be eaten and the PH of their [meat](http://200.74.222.178/index.php/cientifica/article/view/15627/15601) increases \(because of the fight\), their meat is sold for very [low prices](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/fighting-bull-beef-most-ecological-meat-in-world) and is used for processed meat or [pet food](http://www.livescience.com/56488-what-happens-to-bulls-after-bullfight.html).
1.2.2.5.3.2. Con: Several animals live in suffering \(i.e. [Broiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler#Skeletal_dysfunction) chicken who grow faster than their skeleton can sustain\), and several methods of slaughter involve suffering \(i.e. CO2-[gassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter#Methods) of pigs\).
1.2.2.5.3.2.1. Con: As humans need to eat, it is impossible to make livestock illegal, while it is possible to prohibit bullfighting.
1.2.2.5.4. Con: Eating a steak does not include the spectacularization of torture. Watching bullfighting is more immoral, because there is active participation and entertainment found in the violence against animals.
1.2.2.6. Con: [Singer](https://nwveg.org/files/Singer_The_Animal_Liberation_Movement.pdf) argues that using utilitarian arguments to justify the torture and killing of animals only works if we discount the suffering of the animal. If we take animal suffering as seriously as we take human suffering, then the massive suffering of the animals outweighs the comparatively marginal enjoyment of even a stadium of people.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: This argument presumes that no one in the audience enjoys watching a bullfight "massively". There is no good reason to assume that the suffering of one bull outweighs the enjoyment of thousands of spectators.
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: In Bentham's [hedonic calculus](https://www.utilitarianism.com/hedcalc.htm), the intensity, duration, certainty, purity and fecundity of a pleasure and pain are considered along with the scope \(number of people affected\). By all measures except for scope, the suffering of the animal greatly exceeds the enjoyment of the audience.
1.2.2.7. Con: If we use utilitarian arguments to take into account the collective enjoyment of the audience, we also need to take into account the collective disgust of wider society.
1.2.2.8. Con: There are typically [six bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-style_bullfighting) killed per event in Spain. While suffering remains constant for every new bull, excitement will decline with repetition.
1.2.3. Con: Governments can use regulation to limit or eliminate cruelty, as it does in other areas.
1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.5.1.1.
1.2.3.2. Con: Bulls are [naturally fairly sedentary](http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-bull-taming-is-cruelty-at-its-best-tn-parties-using-it-for-political-gains-2564184.html), and so must be spooked or hurt to provoke the kind of aggressive action that the spectacle of a bullfight relies on. Any regulation that successfully eliminated cruelty in bullfighting would effectively eliminate bullfighting itself.
1.2.3.3. Con: It would however imply stopping the torturing and killing of the animals, thus eliminating bullfighting or changing its nature.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Bullfighting professionals and [fans have rejected](http://progressivespain.com/2016/03/16/valencia-mayors-nod-to-bloodless-portuguese-style-bullfights-rejected-both-by-supporters-opponents/) the suggestion of adopting the Portuguese-style of bullfighting \(where the bull is not killed\) in Spain, arguing that killing the bull is an integral part of the Spanish tradition.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: In India or in Portugal, the bull is not killed or maimed in any way. Yet the game is still fun.
1.2.3.4. Con: If it involves direct violence and death of the bull at the end, there is literally no way to eliminate cruelty.
1.2.3.5. Con: Without cruelty, the whole show of bullfighting would suddenly be senseless, as the whole game revolves around violence.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: It might be possible to portray violence without causing harm to the bulls, as in 'professional wrestling'.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Con: The actors in professional wrestling are smart enough to know what they are doing. That is not the case when there is an animal involved as its brain is put in a highly stressful situation.
1.2.3.6. Con: Government imposition of safety laws/measures on bullfighting will compromise the tradition of the sport, diluting it and rendering it inauthentic.
1.2.3.6.1. Con: When the alternative is a complete ban, it is not clear why this would be a concern.
1.2.3.7. Pro: Instead of banning, it would be better to modernise it in a way that does not harm the animals, such as the use of protective pads for the "banderillas", and just not killing the animal at the end.
1.2.3.8. Pro: Bullfighting is undergoing reforms to improve the well-being of bulls.
1.2.3.8.1. Pro: The Government successfully regulated the Toro de la Vega, a controversial medieval tradition considered one of the cruelest in Spain. In 2016, for the first time, the festivity did not involve [killing](http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/09/13/inenglish/1473757915_467851.html) the animal in public. Instead, the bull was anaesthetised and sacrificed in a slaughterhouse.
1.2.3.8.2. Pro: The mayor of Valencia [considered](https://news.vice.com/article/spanish-mayor-proposes-bullfighting-match-where-bull-doesnt-die-in-the-end) adopting a Portuguese-style of bullfighting. In this style the bull is tortured less and not killed in the ring in front of thousands of watching people.
1.2.3.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.
1.2.3.8.2.2. Con: This practice is not an improvement for the well-being of the bulls, as the Portuguese-style still [involves](https://news.vice.com/article/spanish-mayor-proposes-bullfighting-match-where-bull-doesnt-die-in-the-end) their death.
1.2.3.8.3. Con: Bullfighting as it is practiced in Spain today has seen little change to techniques or weapons since the 18th century \([Marcos, p. 5](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2568397)\).
1.2.3.8.4. Pro: With Spanish accession to the EU, veterinary standards have been improved \([p. 252](https://www.eara.eu/post/biomedica-sector-in-spain-welcomes-the-publication-of-eu-wide-figures-on-animals-used-in-research)\).
1.2.3.8.5. Pro: The practice of horn-shaving has been regulated since the 1990s \([p. 10](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2568397)(Legislation was modified in the 1990s to fight “horn shaving” and other practices of artificial horn manipulation, introducing detailed procedures for bull examination by veterinarians ex ante and post mortem to assess if the horns had been manipulated and potential sanctions for breeders if it was proved that occurred.)\).
1.2.3.9. Con: In [India](http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-might-be-legalised-bull-taming-is-cruelty-at-its-best-and-govt-is-using-the-issue-for-electoral-win-in-tamil-nadu-2564184.html) the Supreme Court's investigation found that efforts to regulate local bullfighting did not meet animal welfare standards.
1.2.4. Con: Our decision to label this sport as 'cruel' is based on our contemporary understanding of ethics and moral values, which didn't widely exist in the past.
1.2.4.1. Con: By that logic, societies and the conquest of rights \(for humans and animals\) would never advance.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Traditions may contradict who we are today, but they should be preserved as they define our past: who we were, and what we're our values.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Attempting to erase the past or step on traditions is culturally insensitive, and will potentially lead to loss of respect for one's history and heritage.
1.2.4.4. Con: In the past people were presented to gods as [human sacrifices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice) or held as [slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery). However, these cruel practices were eventually abandoned in most cultures.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: [Slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_slavery) and [human sacrifices](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/human-sacrifices-still-taking-place-5999139) exist as of today.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: While slavery and human sacrifice may be practiced covertly, they are now universally condemned.
1.2.5. Con: Bullfighting brings animal harm into the public eye while doing little animal harm compared to other industries, this helps in creating global awareness around animals' rights and activism.
1.2.5.1. Pro: That is especially true in Spain, where they broadcast [bullfightings](http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/tendido-cero/) in the public channel.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: The countries with higher indexes of [vegetarianism](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-highest-rates-of-vegetarianism.html) \(Israel, Taiwan, Italy, Germany or the UK\) are not countries where [bullfighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country#Europe) is practiced \(with the exception of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_and_religion) and due to religious roots\), therefore it seems unlikely that bullfighting’s cruelty has a meaningful impact.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: None of the countries that score higher in [animal welfare](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/best-countries-for-animal-welfare.html), in terms of laws and pro-animal organizations, are bullfighting practicing countries.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: In Europe, the [World Animal Protection](http://api.worldanimalprotection.org/) gives Spain a "C", and it is thus not among the best rated countries for animal welfare.
1.2.5.2. Con: Watching videos or documentaries in which animals are ill-treated may help increase awareness for animal well-being equally or more.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Positive forms of learning empathy towards animals \(volunteering at a shelter, having a pet, etc.\) do not pose a threat to animal well-being to achieve it.
1.2.5.3. Con: Raising awareness for animal welfare should not be achieved at the expense of actual animal wellbeing.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Allowing animals to be mistreated just to achieve human awareness defuses its purpose.
1.2.5.4. Con: That's a paradox. Doing something to ensure people disapprove and fight to make it stop does not justify you doing it in the first place.
1.2.5.5. Pro: In Spain, less than one thousand bulls are killed each year in [bullfighting](https://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldiario.es%2Fcaballodenietzsche%2Fsospechosos-datos-oficiales-tauromaquia-Analisis_6_568403176.html). By contrast, UK dairy farms kill about [95,000](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them) male calves on-farm since “early disposal” is cheaper than keeping them and selling them.
1.2.6. Pro: Other bloodsports like Bear Baiting and Dog Fighting are banned and recognised as cruel.
1.2.7. Pro: It's unethical to harm animals for the sake of human entertainment.
1.2.7.1. Pro: In bullfighting, torture is spectacularized, which adds to the cruelty.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: The most exciting part of bullfighting is not the torturing or killing of the bull, but rather the toying with it and the bullfighters doing daredevil stunts with the bull.
1.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: In [Portuguese-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese-style_bullfighting) bullfighting, the bull is not killed in the arena and oftentimes survives the fight.
1.2.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Despite their name, [Portuguese "bloodless bullfights"](http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/bullfighting/) are anything but bloodless. Even if the bull is not killed in the ring, it is dragged out and left bleeding to await his slaughter, hours or even days later.
1.2.7.1.1.2. Con: A sport is not defined merely by its most exciting part but by the totality of activities. These include the maiming and killing of the bulls.
1.2.7.1.1.3. Con: Therefore, the bull should not be harmed. The sport as a test of bravery and skill should consist of whether an unarmed brave human can perform the same stunts with a physically healthy and unharmed bull.
1.2.7.1.1.4. Pro: Some areas of Spain have forms of bullfighting where the bulls aren't killed in front of an audience, such as [in Amposta](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/30/catalan-fire-bulls-face-ban) \(in Catalonia\) where a local tradition consists of attaching flaming torches to bulls' horns in a makeshift arena.
1.2.7.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.5.1.1.
1.2.7.1.1.4.2. Con: The activity scares the bulls. Even if it doesn't kill them, it is still cruel.
1.2.7.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Things that scare humans are not banned. So it should not be the case for bulls.
1.2.7.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.
1.2.7.1.2. Pro: Bullfighting represents a form of [zoosadism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals), where humans inflict harm on animals for amusement.
1.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: Inflicting pain to undefended beings just for amusement is not morally acceptable.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The bull has the option of defending itself. The proof is the men who died in duel.
1.2.7.1.2.2. Con: Bullfighting it's also an historical and mythical tradition that has to do with the hero concept and it's hability for facing death. It's a ritual that enlarges our idea of life and death. There's a culture behind the whole thing.
1.2.7.1.2.2.1. Con: Just because something is a tradition, doesn't mean that this should be morally accepted. [Bacha bazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_bazi) in Afghanistan is also an old tradition but does it mean forcing children to provide sexual services should be accepted.
1.2.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.2.7.1.4. Con: As a culture, we have no problem with the spectacularization of torture and death. See, for example, violence in Hollywood blockbusters.
1.2.7.1.4.1. Con: Hollywood blockbusters, while often depicting imagined violence, do not inflict real violence, torture, or death on those involved in their production.
1.2.7.1.4.1.1. Con: This thread debates the spectacularization of violence. Considered merely as a spectacle, it is irrelevant whether or not the violence is real or simulated.
1.2.7.1.4.2. Con: This commits the [naturalistic fallac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy)y. Just because we do enjoy the spectacle of violence does not mean we should.
1.2.7.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.7.6.
1.2.7.1.4.3. Con: No matter the form of violence, witnessing too much of it will have a [desensitizing effect](http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/S1056-4993\(14\)00087-X/abstract?cc=y=).
1.2.7.1.5. Con: Legally determining what constitutes spectacularization of violence is a slippery slope that has the potential to impede on the freedom of speech and expression.
1.2.7.1.5.1. Con: Even when there is a "slippery slope," it does not necessarily follow that we cannot see some things as cases of unwarranted spectacularization.  This is why most countries ban dog fighting, for example.
1.2.7.1.5.2. Con: Slippery slopes of this kind only occur when lawmakers and the public fail to draw - and stick to - moral lines and principles. There is no reason to believe that they would be so bad at it in this case as to "slide" all the way from protecting animals to censoring speech.
1.2.7.1.5.2.1. Pro: Spectacularization of violence has nothing to do with freedom of speech and expression. The first is about physical damage to someone and torture, while the other is [a universal recognized human right.](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)
1.2.7.1.6. Pro: Create suffering to an animal just for entertainment goes against the human values that distinguish us as human beings.
1.2.7.1.7. Con: To the organizers and participants \(except the bull, who cannot claim otherwise for itself\), this practice is not a ["spectacularization of torture"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/thousands-protest-in-spain-in-favour-of-bullfighting-traditions). That is a relative term.
1.2.7.1.7.1. Con: People generally do not like to admit that the activity they are participating in is cruel. Fans and participants are hardly impartial assessors of the activity.
1.2.7.1.7.2. Con: Many spectators want to leave the bullring before the end of the fight because they can't stand the show, even if this is often very difficult to do. [\(Hosseinpour, p.37\)](https://books.google.es/books?id=L6NaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=many+spectators+get+out+of+bullfighting+before+the+end&source=bl&ots=huLq-EuaMn&sig=YG2Ry-fG_nb4C2lx266NdNl18fk&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9x72Gl7_QAhVJtRQKHdBNBzUQ6AEIVTAH#v=onepage&q=many%20spectators%20get%20out%20of%20bullfighting%20before%20the%20end&f=false)
1.2.7.1.7.2.1. Con: This is only one account and does not represent a general occurrence.
1.2.7.1.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.1.
1.2.7.1.7.3. Pro: The audience response to bullfighting[depends on](http://www.aficionados-international.com/experience-bullfighting/going-to-your-first-bullfight) the individual’s own taste, social and educational background, and their tolerance of other cultures.
1.2.7.1.8. Pro: Bullfighting is exceptionally barbaric as the bulls are not even killed for their food but solely out of pleasure.
1.2.7.1.8.1. Con: The meat of bulls that were killed in bullfights is used for [human consumption](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/fighting-bull-beef-most-ecological-meat-in-world).
1.2.7.1.8.1.1. Con: Bulls will be killed regardless of whether their meat is [eaten](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/20/fighting-bull-beef-most-ecological-meat-in-world) or not.
1.2.8. Pro: Bullfighting bulls that are deemed not fierce enough are castrated, so that only the best and strongest genes are passed on. This is a cruel practice.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Some young bulls are also castrated to make them less fierce for the sole purpose of being used in bullfighters' training. Other types of bulls are also castrated and used to move herds along in bull-runs.
1.2.8.2. Con: When performed correctly and with anaesthetic, castration is a humane treatment compared to what other economically nonviable male animals have to endure, such as [chick culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling).
1.2.8.3. Con: Castration is one of the standard tools used in the domestication of animals.
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: [Cats](https://icatcare.org/advice/neutering-your-cat) and [dogs](http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2109&aid=911) are often castrated. This is not a cruel practice.
1.2.8.3.1.1. Con: There is a sharp difference between the castration of [pets](https://www.mspca.org/pet_resources/ask-a-vet-all-you-need-to-know-about-spayneuter-surgery/) such as cats and dogs, generally done under anaesthetic and with pain management, and the castration of livestock such as [cattle](https://www.nadis.org.uk/disease-a-z/cattle/castration-of-calves/), [sheep](https://www.fawec.org/en/technical-documents-sheep/247-castration-taildocking-sheep) and [pigs](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/758841), which is usually done without anaesthetic.
1.2.9. Pro: The fact that bulls are - like human beings - sentient creatures creates moral responsibilities towards them. These responsibilities are not compatible with the practice of bullfighting.
1.2.9.1. Con: Humans regularly eat beef and wear leather. These industries kill [far more](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508324/slaughter-statsnotice-18feb16.pdf) cattle than bullfights, frequently using [cruel practices](http://www.salon.com/2013/04/21/is_there_such_thing_as_a_humane_slaughterhouse_partner/). We clearly do not recognise such a responsibility generally.
1.2.9.1.1. Con: Ensuring [animal welfare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093044/) is becoming increasingly important in our society. This indicates that we should recognize a moral responsibility towards animals.
1.2.9.1.2. Con: Just because we do not recognize the responsibility doesn't mean we 'shouldn't' recognize it.
1.2.9.1.3. Con: While no form of animal cruelty should be excused, and the meat and leather industries unquestionably need to be pressured into ensuring more human treatment of cattle, there is a huge difference between slaughtering an animal quickly for sustenance and killing it slowly for entertainment.
1.2.9.1.4. Con: That there is a greater evil does not justify the small evils.
1.2.9.2. Pro: There is evidence that cows specifically have relatively high sentience. There is evidence that they experience [prolonged emotional reactions](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-emotional-lives-of-dairy-cows/) to physical and emotional trauma, and that they can be trained to [navigate mazes](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/dairy/70538715/cows-master-maze-making-mice-look-like-dimwits).
1.2.9.3. Pro: Animals deserve the same treatment as human beings.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: In general, the bullfighting audience enjoys violence against the bull but not against the bullfighter; this is not moral.
1.2.9.3.1.1. Pro: During bullfights, when the bull is injured and bleeding, the audience seems insensitive and entertained. However, in the event that the bull attacks the bullfighter, the public exhibits [horror and fear](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/matador-gored-to-death-in-spanish-bullfight-is-first-bullfighter/).
1.2.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: Dead bullfighters are celebrated and remembered, such as the bullfighter [Manolete](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3178043/Bullfighter-film-Manolete-draws-animal-rights-wrath-on-Penelope-Cruz.html) who was commemorated with a movie.
1.2.9.3.2. Pro: Philosopher Peter Singer explains how the only morally consistent principle of equality lies in the idea of [equal consideration of interests](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm). If this is accepted, there is no morally justifiable reason to treat animal life as less valuable than humans.
1.2.9.3.2.1. Pro: If we measure the meaning of interests such as pain and happiness of sentient beings on the basis of how intelligent the being is, then logically we should consider the interests of stupid people as less valid.
1.2.9.3.2.2. Pro: If we measure the value of interests on the idea that our species is superior to other animals purely because of physical features that set us apart, we opt in to what Singer calls "speciesism," the same system of belief that racists adhere to.
1.2.9.3.2.2.1. Pro: Bullfighting perpetuates the belief that humans have the right to deal with an animal as an object and in a damaging way. Such an attitude is socially harmful because it can spread to weaker people or even children.
1.2.9.3.2.3. Pro: The capacity animals have for suffering and enjoyment is no different from that of humans. Animals' inability to express their interests in order to achieve happiness and avoid suffering does not make those interests any less valid.
1.2.9.3.2.4. Con: We are relieved of the responsibility to give animals the same rights as humans because humans consciously agree to act civilly while animals do not.
1.2.9.3.2.4.1. Pro: We give humans rights because we expect them to respect the rights of other individuals and the laws that lay the foundation for a civilized society. Animals are unable to comprehend the rules of society and the impact of their actions and so we cannot expect that they will respect others. This means that animals cannot be held accountable for their actions, unlike humans.
1.2.9.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: When humans do not abide by their responsibility to act civilly and follow laws, we strip them of their rights through means such as imprisonment, in order for civilized society to function.
1.2.9.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: People restrict themselves because they understand the impact of their own actions. Because animals cannot understand the meaning of the harm caused nor the consequences of committing an act such as murder or assault, their actions are not restricted by that knowledge.
1.2.9.3.2.4.1.3. Con: There are [many instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals) where we give the right to protection from needless suffering to animals. This is because we recognize that it is immoral to cause unnecessary suffering to creatures regardless of whether or not we expect a creature to act civilly.
1.2.9.3.3. Pro: Anything which is not beneficial to either party should be banned. All living beings have the right to live their life with dignity and respect.
1.2.9.3.4. Pro: Animals are in the world as living beings in their own right. Nothing gives us the right to cause unnecessary suffering for entertainment.
1.2.9.3.5. Pro: There is no difference emotionally between a bull a dog or a human were all capable of feeling pain and sadness so why not promote love and happiness And give all equal chance to live the happy life they choose for themselves
1.2.9.3.6. Pro: Given the overwhelming power of human civilization to wipe out other species combined with the fact that decreasing biodiversity is universally harmful, we \(humans\) have a responsibility to care for other species on Earth.
1.2.9.3.7. Pro: Bullfighting reinforces the idea that animals are products, and that it is okay to use and abuse them for our pleasure, in this case entertainment. This baseless discrimination and objectification in and of itself is morally wrong.
1.2.9.3.8. Con: Animals do not act morally towards humans, a parasitic worm would feed from a human being as a human would feed on beef. There is no reason to threat animals nicer then they treat us.
1.2.9.3.9. Con: A human life is worth more than the life of an animal.
1.2.9.3.9.1. Con: When faced with a hypothetical situation in which they could save only their pet or a foreign tourist from being hit by a bus, 40% of study participants [chose their pet](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201308/is-dogs-life-worth-more-persons). This shows that almost every second person considers the life of an animal \(their pet\) more valuable than a human life.
1.2.9.3.9.1.1. Con: The experiment represents individual reactions of biased pet owners and not general societal rules. If the participants had been asked about a categorical imperative for how society should handle situations like this, their answers would have been different.
1.2.9.3.9.1.2. Con: If people saved their pet rather than the human, then they would be prosecuted for failure to render assistance to a person in danger and go to prison.
1.2.9.3.9.1.2.1. Con: Actually, the vast majority of legal systems impose no legal duty to act to save the life of a stranger.
1.2.9.3.9.1.3. Con: Pet lovers care about their pets because they have a special relationship with them, not because of their pets' status of being animals. Thus, the pets are deserving of receiving this much love.
1.2.9.3.9.1.4. Con: It is safe to assume that, given the situation where the love for the human would equal the love for the pet, choosing the pet over the human \(whom that person had a similar bond with\) in a life or death situation, would be considered to be wrong and probably sick.
1.2.9.3.9.1.5. Con: Surveys on complex moral thought experiments are interesting but unreliable, as people themselves have a very hard time predicting how they would react.
1.2.9.3.9.1.6. Con: However the percentage decreases drastically to 2% if the human in the hypothetical situation is a friend or family member.
1.2.9.3.9.2. Pro: Human life has a higher value because humans need and depend on each other, socially and economically.
1.2.9.3.9.2.1. Pro: The dominating form of economic organization is division of labor. Everyone is a specialist and highly depends on other individuals' skills and products.
1.2.9.3.9.2.2. Con: Animals are also responsible for important social tasks, e.g. guide dogs or [therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-assisted_therapy) animals. Humans depend on animals for these functions.
1.2.9.3.9.2.3. Pro: Appreciation and commendation, which is very important to humans' self-perception, can only be given by other humans.
1.2.9.3.9.2.3.1. Con: Animals may not be able to verbalize commendation, but they are clearly capable of giving affection and unconditional regard. Both of these help with self-perception and well-being.
1.2.9.3.9.2.3.1.1. Pro: Indeed, animals are used in [therapy](https://www.nsarco.com/therapy-animal-info.html), to do this in ways that humans are not capable of.
1.2.9.3.9.2.4. Con: This may make us appreciate other humans more than we do animals, but does not mean that animal lives do not have value - to themselves, to other animals, and to the world.
1.2.9.3.9.2.5. Pro: Humans, as members of the same species, can identify with each other, feel what it is like to be in the situation of the other individual and thus develop a stronger feeling of compassion and sympathy than with animals.
1.2.9.3.9.2.5.1. Con: Humans, through history, have consistently subjugated and killed other groups of humans by constructing them as "inferior" and "other" based on random ideas, and often for personal gain. Enslaved people have often been valued less than animals.
1.2.9.3.9.2.6. Pro: In classical [Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature), humans are described as social or political animals, with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities the size of a city or town, with a division of labor and law-making. Humans need these communities to develop their [full potential](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/#SH7c).
1.2.9.3.9.3. Pro: A society where the life of an animal was worth as much as the life of a human would be doomed to fail.
1.2.9.3.9.4. Pro: Religious teachings emphasize the higher value of human life.
1.2.9.3.9.4.1. Con: The religious concept of [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation) suggests that an animal could become a human in another life \(and vice versa\), so their relative worth is subjective.
1.2.9.3.9.4.2. Con: It is not clear why religious teachings should be treated as definitive here. Most modern societies are secular, and seek to have a better justification for their laws than mere religious texts.
1.2.9.3.9.4.3. Pro: Humans are the counterpart of [god](http://bibeltext.com/multi/genesis/1-27.htm), provided with an immortal soul. Animals are, according to the Bible, [subjects](http://bibeltext.com/multi/genesis/1-26.htm) to humankind.
1.2.9.3.9.5. Pro: Because of their biological characteristics, a human is worth more than an animal.
1.2.9.3.9.5.1. Con: Measuring the value of a creature on earth by taking into account its contribution to the condition of the biological system, the animal's life is more valuable, as it does not damage the ecological balance.
1.2.9.3.9.5.2. Con: Humans and animals are both just biomass. The self-perception of humans does not make for a good objective measurement.
1.2.9.3.9.6. Pro: Humans have better skills and capabilities, thus their lives are worth more.
1.2.9.3.9.6.1. Pro: Humans are the kings of the animal kingdom, they have mastered and beaten all other animals, using weapons, traps and intellect and are thus worth more than all the other animals.
1.2.9.3.9.6.2. Pro: Humanity has created culture, art and science.
1.2.9.3.9.6.3. Con: It is not clear why skill in tasks that humans value should determine the worth of a life.
1.2.9.3.9.7. Con: Even if this is true, it does not prove that animal lives should be treated with no regard, merely less.
1.2.9.3.9.8. Con: This is an invalid comparison, as a policy banning bullfighting would not put human lives at stake. Thus, this is not a trade-off between human life and animal life. The correct comparison should be whether or not human entertainment is worth more than the life of an animal.
1.2.9.3.9.9. Pro: Humans, being self-aware, have a greater capacity to suffer than most animals, which gives them greater moral value.
1.2.9.3.9.10. Con: If an alien species found humans and saw us as animals with lives of less value than theirs, it would still be unfair for us to die for their entertainment.
1.2.9.3.9.11. Pro: Generally speaking, in all societies, humans treat a human's life as more important than that of an animal.
1.2.9.3.9.11.1. Pro: Humans enjoy basic rights and liberties as guaranteed by a wide range of domestic and international institutions. Animals do not have these kinds of rights and protections.
1.2.9.3.9.11.2. Con: Radical Hindu groups in India have been criticized for assigning more value to cows than to [women](http://www.southasia.com.au/2015/03/11/india-holy-cow-matters-women/) and [untouchables](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-cow-protection-violence-by-shashi-tharoor-2016-08).
1.2.9.3.9.11.3. Pro: It is only in war situations that a human life is considered expendable for a cause. Otherwise the utmost is done to protect human members of society.
1.2.9.3.9.11.4. Pro: Firemen save humans first. Even after they have saved any humans, they will only save animals if they can do so without risk.
1.2.9.3.9.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.3.9.3.
1.2.9.3.9.11.6. Pro: Taking the life of an animal has fewer consequences than taking the life of a human.
1.2.9.3.9.11.7. Con: At the very least, this is not universally true. International and sustained outrage over the shooting - and death - of a [gorilla](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/harambe-the-perfect-meme/498743/) whose actions were threatening the safety of a toddler who had fallen into his enclosure indicates that in some cases, humans will actually value animal lives over those of other humans.
1.2.9.3.9.11.8. Con: How humans value lives does not necessarily indicate how humans should value lives.
1.2.9.3.9.11.9. Pro: Humans accept most livestock being treated in an abominable fashion, before being slaughtered.
1.2.9.3.9.11.10. Con: Most people who donate to wildlife organisations do not treat human lives as being more important than lives of animals.
1.2.9.3.9.11.11. Con: Pets in the developed world often have more comfortable and secure lives than humans living in other places around the world.
1.2.9.4. Con: In a bullfight, the bull is attempting to kill the matador. There is no moral obligation to be merciful to something that is trying to kill you.
1.2.9.4.1. Con: The bull does not consent to be put in that position and it is only there because some humans put him there. Therefore, humans have full responsibility of the situation.
1.2.9.4.2. Con: The bull is imprisoned and mistreated by humans in order to trigger a violent reaction. The bull would probably not be trying to kill anyone if left alone.
1.2.9.4.2.1. Pro: Bulls are tortured in the fight as well as [during the pre-fight treatment](http://www.stopbullfighting.org.uk/facts.htm)(The bull is not an aggressive animal, and the reason he is angry and attempts to charge at the matador whilst in the bullring is mainly that he has been horrendously abused for the previous two days. In fact, what spectators see is not a normal, healthy bull, but a weakened, half-blinded, and mentally destroyed version, whose chances of harming his tormentors is virtually nil.), where the bull is tortured for days before the fight in order to weaken it.
1.2.9.4.2.1.1. Pro: The bulls are preemptively handicapped, to ensure that the matador is able to win. Their ability to see, hear and smell is impaired through various techniques, including putting vaseline in their eyes, wet newspaper in their ears and cotton buds in their nostrils \([p. 24](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)\).
1.2.9.4.2.1.2. Pro: The act of bullfighting usually involves attempting to kill the bulls multiple times, and the bulls' bodies are [mutilated](https://time.com/4400516/bullfighting-calls-for-ban-spain/)(Animal rights groups say the matador rarely succeeds in killing the bull on the first try. More often than not, he is forced to use more than one sword to finish the job. As the bull’s blood spatters across the arena’s sand it may still be conscious — even while one or both of his ears and tail are cut off and awarded to the matador, depending on his performance.) afterwards.
1.2.9.4.2.1.3. Pro: The practice of the "[Tienta](http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/bullfighting/vocabulary)" is also cruel: bulls are [tested](https://www.madrid-traveller.com/bullfighting-terms/) at age two to see if they are suitable for breeding, bullfighting, or meat. Those who do not pass the proof are slaughtered.
1.2.9.4.2.1.4. Pro: Bulls are made more aggressive by being poked and [bitten](http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-might-be-legalised-bull-taming-is-cruelty-at-its-best-and-govt-is-using-the-issue-for-electoral-win-in-tamil-nadu-2564184.html) by bystanders before a fight.
1.2.9.4.3. Con: There is still a moral obligation to respect the right to life. More importantly, in a bullfight the matador could easily leave instead of persisting in the fight.
1.2.9.5. Pro: If the activity harms innocent creatures, people should no longer be able to do what they want.
1.2.9.5.1. Pro: A game or a sport is no longer a distraction when it involves suffering or death for an animal
1.2.9.6. Con: One should know that a "toro de lidia" is treated with utmost respect, admiration and care throughout its life, including in the bullring where the bull will fight to the death against the matador. These bulls have a much more virtuous life than most bovine creatures.
1.2.9.7. Pro: Acknowledgement of [animals as ‘sentient’](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/1269) was introduced to New Zealand’s Animal Welfare Act 1999 in August 2015.
1.2.9.8. Pro: As the scientific knowledge on sentience continues to grow and we understand more and more about the impact humans have on animals, it becomes increasingly [unethical and illogical](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm) to continue to cause animals harm.
1.2.9.8.1. Pro: Many studies have shown that [animals possess characteristics](http://www.livescience.com/39481-time-to-declare-animal-sentience.html) associated with sentience.
1.2.9.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.2.9.8.1.2. Pro: [Neuroscience proves](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-02/nrn-updating-animal-welfare/7987266?pfmredir=sm) animals experience a wide range of emotions.
1.2.9.8.1.3. Pro: The judgement of pigs - like that of humans - is shaped by both [their basic personality traits and their mood](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/pessimist-pigs-are-positive-if-they-have-nice-digs?utm_campaign=news_daily_2016-11-16&et_rid=17056031&et_cid=1000226). This demonstrates that understanding and applying sentience to animals may have all sorts of complications.
1.2.9.8.2. Con: One of the [key issues](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm) with understanding sentience and demonstrating its existence at a scientific level, is that the concept relates to a being’s own thoughts, feelings and emotions, none of which can be fully understood or described by physiological processes or anatomical structures.
1.2.9.8.2.1. Con: This is a reason to believe that sentience is hard to measure, not that bulls do not have it. If in doubt, we should err on the side of caution.
1.2.9.8.2.2. Con: Just because something is not fully understood does not mean it doesn't exist.
1.2.9.8.2.3. Con: That sentience perhaps is difficult to quantify scientifically is irrelevant. Not all facts are scientific facts, moral ones especially so.
1.2.9.8.2.4. Pro: We cannot know exactly what, or how another is feeling. [This applies to both humans and animals,](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm) and means that it can be difficult to ultimately prove the capacity for sentience. This is particularly difficult for animals, as they lack the power of speech to convey their feelings.
1.2.9.8.2.4.1. Con: Animals have ample ways of making their feelings known. They growl, they purr, they can bite you, or - more relevantly - gore you to death with their horns.
1.2.9.8.2.5. Con: Thoughts, feelings, and emotions may not be fully understood or described when there is a speech barrier.  However, they can be linked with neurological processes and understood in those forms.
1.2.9.8.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.1.2.
1.2.9.8.3. Con: We were aware of animals' suffering in ancient times. This has apparently not lead to a decrease in harm caused to animals.
1.2.9.8.3.1. Con: We may have been aware that they could suffer, but our understanding of the depth of that suffering has increased. Modern science has given us a far better understanding of animals' sentience and ability to experience pain.
1.2.9.8.3.2. Pro: Cruelty should never be used under the guise of tradition, they used to "traditionally" sacrifice people , tradition should not be used as a reason for acceptability, That would be sheer stupidity.
1.2.9.8.3.3. Con: The acceptance of harm to animals by society has decreased over time. This is reflected in the measures that have been taken to protect animal welfare all over the world.
1.2.9.8.3.3.1. Con: Even in antiquity, those who mistreated their horses or donkeys were publicly shamed \([p. 317](http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=acwp_sata)(In that general context, they did not have to refer to religion, philosophy, or laws to criticize and protest against those who mistreated their serving animals: the farmer who harassed his cow just after calving; the bathhouse keeper who forced his donkey to work without rest; Cato the Elder who was heartless to the point of selling his horse after campaigning with him for months.)\).
1.2.9.8.3.3.2. Con: Today's animal welfare does not reflect a better understanding of animals' pain but the deterioration of animals' living conditions.
1.2.9.8.3.3.3. Con: Even if global standards frown upon the practice, cultural traditions are better regulated by decentralized regulations that can weigh competing concerns - as animal rights and cultural tradition - accordingly.
1.2.9.8.3.3.3.1. Pro: Support for bullfighting in Spain is [very regionalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting#/media/File:Tauromaquia_en_Espa%C3%B1a.PNG), and how it is handled in light of animal rights should be dealt with by local governments.
1.2.9.8.3.3.4. Pro: The Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association \(ALRTA\) has outlined the policies its members should adhere to in its [National Animal Welfare Policy](https://www.fullyloaded.com.au/industry-news/1611/alrta-oulines-national-animal-welfare-policy).
1.2.9.8.3.3.5. Pro: Some businesses support animal welfare above financial incentives.
1.2.9.8.3.3.5.1. Pro: Two major airlines have [stopped transporting laboratory animals](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/1267) from mainland Spain to the Canary Islands, an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean.
1.2.9.8.3.3.6. Pro: Nations seek to protect animals from cruelty through legislation.
1.2.9.8.3.3.6.1. Pro: New Zealand, England and Wales, Scotland, and Australia are examples of an growing number of legal jurisdictions around the world who have updated their [animal welfare](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/72) legislation to incorporate positive duties of care based on the principles of the Five Freedoms.
1.2.9.8.3.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.4.
1.2.9.8.3.3.6.2. Pro: There are a handful of [animal protection laws](http://aldf.org/resources/laws-cases/animal-fighting-facts/?gclid=Cj0KEQiA1b7CBRDjmIPL4u-Zy6gBEiQAsJhTMGQZ_9WS5ylCjbxR57uvBs7_D7_UHueiH01td090T2IaAqqw8P8HAQ), such as those that prohibit dog and cockfighting, that also deal with things considered [illegal sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_sports).
1.2.9.8.3.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.7.
1.2.9.8.3.3.6.4. Con: Not all nations have animal welfare legislation.
1.2.9.8.3.3.7. Con: Legislation regulating the use of animals is often motivated by concerns for human health rather than animal welfare.
1.2.9.8.3.3.7.1. Pro: The housing and space [guidelines](https://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/Resource000471_Rep493.pdf) for livestock in New Hampshire, for example, stipulate that these regulations are in order to target "problems of odor and fly control, pesticide drift, contamination of surface and ground waters, and damage to neighboring crops".
1.2.9.8.3.3.8. Pro: Many organizations have spoken out against bullfighting.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.1. Con: Some animal-rights activists are moral hypocrites, because they fight violence against animals but [celebrate the death of a bullfighter.](http://www.thelocal.es/20160712/legal-action-over-matador-death-celebrations-bullfighting-spain)
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.1.1. Con: Some [activists](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/matador-victor-barrio-death-gored-bullfight-animal-rights-activists-could-face-jail-for-celebrating-a7133076.html) claim that they do not celebrate the deaths of bullfighters, yet they do consider them part of the game: it is a fight between a man and a bull, so it is only fair that sometimes the man is the one injured.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.1.2. Con: Individual activists being hypocritical does not justify a conclusion that all the others do not have a valid point.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.2. Pro: Bullfighting does not currently receive substantial subsidies. In 2015, the [European Parliament](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/10/28/bullfighting-european-parliament-votes-end-eu-subsidies-farmers_n_8412542.html) voted to end EU subsidies to bull breeders, claiming that is unacceptable for European funds to finance any part of an industry that involves the torture of sentient animals for public entertainment, even if it is indirectly.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.2.1. Con: This refers only to EU subsidies, not national and private ones.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.2.2. Con: Despite the decision, [€130](http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/10/29/inenglish/1446108998_091871.html) million will [still be devoted](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36270209) to bull breeders, as farming and cattle subsidies are given on the basis of land surface, not the specific activity that takes place in it.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.3. Pro: In April 2004, Barcelona City Council declared its ‘[anti-bullfight](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/69)’ stance.
1.2.9.8.3.3.8.4. Pro: In February 2008, there was an anti-bullfighting conference hosted by the [World Society for the Protection of Animals](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/69) \(WSPA\) and Asociación Defensa Derechos Animal \(ADDA\) in Barcelona, Spain.
1.2.9.8.3.3.9. Con: Globally, there is [no intergovernmental recognition](http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/political-advocacy/udaw-universal-declaration-animal-welfare) of the importance of the protection of animal welfare.
1.2.9.8.3.4. Pro: Ancient thinkers Plutarch, Hippocrates and Pythagoras were all advocates [for the fair treatment of animals](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm).
1.2.9.8.3.5. Pro: During the 18th century and the age of the Enlightenment we saw great changes in how animals were viewed, with a number of philosophers discussing the [ability of animals to suffer \(sentience\).](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm)
1.2.9.8.3.5.1. Pro: Jeremy Bentham, a central figure in the late English Enlightenment, considered the suffering of animals to be [a matter of ethical concern](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/4/628/htm) for utilitarian thinking, famously asking “The question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?”
1.2.9.8.3.6. Pro: James Burgh recognized animal suffering in the 18th century \([p. 61](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=wXoxAQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=J+Burgh+author+of+the+dignity+of+&ots=GO_UT20KE9&sig=tr4iliieYlPoZImAs2xcA8LwE3o#v=onepage&q=children%20ought&f=false)(A turn to cruelty, appearing in a child’s delighting in teazing others his equals, in pulling insects to pieces, and in torturing birds, frogs, cats, or other animals, ought by all means to be rooted out as soon as possible. Children ought to be convinced of what they are not generally aware of, That an animal can feel, though it cannot complain, and that cruelty to a beast or insect, is as much cruelty, and as truly wicked, as when exercised upon our own species.)\).
1.2.9.9. Con: Sentience of other animals, such as pigs, does not create commanding responsibility to take care for them.
1.2.9.9.1. Con: Ethically, while we do not have a "commanding responsibility" to take care of them, we do not have any logical, ethical reasoning for partaking in cruel and painful exploitation of them.
1.2.9.9.2. Pro: Animals, sentient or not, are fundamentally there to serve humans.
1.2.9.9.2.1. Con: This is rather subjective. There really is no evidence to support that as a fact.
1.2.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.8.
1.2.10. Pro: The bulls [suffer](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315721260_%27Suffering%27_in_bullfighting_bulls_An_ethologist%27s_perspective) severe stress, and ultimately end up dying a slow and torturous death.
1.2.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.2.1.1.
1.2.10.2. Pro: Spanish bullfights can last between one hour and a half and three hours, divided in [three different stage](https://www.donquijote.org/spanish-culture/traditions/bullfighting/)[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-style_bullfighting). During this time, the bull loses a significant amount of blood and energy, and gets to the last stage exhausted.
1.2.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.2.1.
1.2.10.4. Con: Bulls can be pardoned from death for exceptional performance with an "[indulto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-style_bullfighting#Stage_3_.E2.80.93_Tercio_de_Muerte)" \(pardon\).
1.2.10.5. Pro: It is extremely [rare](http://www.aficionados-international.com/myths-about-bullfighting/what-happens-bullfighter-injured) that a bull does not die in a bullfight, as the bullfighter cannot really lose due to the availability of backup bullfighters.
1.2.10.6. Pro: In Spain alone, around [35,000 bulls](https://www.worldanimalfoundation.com/advocate/farm-animals/params/post/1280842/the-truth-about-bullfighting) a year are tormented and killed in bullfights.
1.2.10.7. Pro: Even [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting) of traditional bullfighting where killing the bull is not the main goal, such as bull runs, cause severe pain and stress to the animal.
1.2.10.7.1. Pro: In [San Fermin](http://www.runningofthebulls.com/san-fermin/playing-with-fire/) \(in Pamplona\), bulls carry fireworks on their back and horns.
1.2.10.7.2. Pro: In [Coria](https://www.sharkonline.org/index.php/animal-cruelty/bullfighting/81-animal-cruelty/bullfighting/bull-torture-festivals/816-el-toro-de-coria), in the western region of Extremadura, the bull runs at the end of June traditionally feature an "entertainment" in which coloured darts are lobbed at the bull.
1.2.10.7.3. Pro: In the ["Bous a la Mar"](http://www.spanishfiesta.org/bous-a-la-mar.html) of Alicante, the local youngsters try to make the bulls fall into the sea without using their arms or hands, usually causing their drowning.
1.2.10.8. Con: The stress that a bull undergoes as part of the fight is not particularly severe compared to other stressors than any domesticated bull might undergo.
1.2.10.8.1. Con: Appraisals by veterinarians of the [relative level of distress](http://www.hsvma.org/assets/pdfs/hsi_bull_fighting_vet_poster.pdf) demonstrated by bulls during bullfights support the conclusion that the bulls are suffering.
1.2.10.8.2. Pro: Adrenaline can help [reduce pain](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/dailydose/12/03/stress.block.pain/index.html), thus the bull doesn't really suffer in the ring because its adrenaline is pumping so fiercely.
1.2.10.8.2.1. Con: Reduction in experienced pain does not mean elimination of pain.
1.2.10.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.10.8.1.
1.2.10.8.2.3. Con: There are numerous scientific studies that prove that bulls do [suffer](http://www.hsi.org/issues/bullfighting/facts/bullfighting_myths.html) in the ring.
1.2.10.8.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.8.1.
1.2.10.8.2.3.2. Pro: The blood of bulls that die in bullfights contains [dramatically more lactate](http://colvetcadiz.org/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=40&Itemid=209) than is normal or safe – which signals that bulls could not handle the exercise they were meant to do – and hormones that indicate stress, trauma, injury, and pain.
1.2.10.8.2.3.3. Con: The scientific content of these studies can be questioned, as the institutions behind them have a clear agenda of prohibiting bullfighting, such as [Animal Protection Consult](http://www.animal-protection-consult.com/).
1.2.10.8.2.3.4. Con: One of the supporting institutes for these three 'scientific studies' consists of only one [person](http://www.animal-protection-consult.com/). Given it lacks any peer-review, this makes its scientific value highly uncertain.
1.2.10.8.2.3.5. Con: One of these three 'scientific studies' is a mere blog entry, at [Equanimal](http://equanimal.org/).
1.2.10.8.2.3.5.1. Con: The blog post is quoting a university researcher in a relevant field summarising the state of the evidence.
1.2.10.8.2.3.5.1.1. Con: One scientific researcher saying something does not make it a 'scientific study'.
1.2.10.8.3. Pro: Stress levels are [higher during the transport phase](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14181547_Assessment_of_Stress_during_Handling_and_Transport) than when the bull is in the ring.
1.2.10.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.10.8.2.3.2.
1.2.10.8.3.2. Con: This result could be explainable by an injury to stress hormone producing parts of the bull, as some [critics](http://www.ffw.ch/uploads/camps/archivos/ENG_INFORME_VETERINARIO.pdf) suggest.
1.2.11. Con: There are other animal practices that are equally or more cruel than bullfighting. Since these practices are still permitted there is no reason why bullfighting should be banned.
1.2.11.1. Pro: The slaughter and inhumane treatment of livestock is widespread.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: Watching animals die - which we already do, as we kill them en masse for food every day - shouldn't be a problem.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.1.4.
1.2.11.1.1.2. Con: The meat trade isn't spectacularised, and in fact is carefully managed so as to avoid associating the product with the process.
1.2.11.1.1.3. Con: The need to kill for eating is more justified than killing for entertainment.
1.2.11.1.1.4. Con: The number of people who regularly eat meat who also watch that animal die is miniscule.
1.2.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.11.1.3. Con: The social utility of meat eating is much higher than the social utility of bullfighting.
1.2.11.1.3.1. Con: The social utility of bullfighting is higher because in addition to entertainment benefits, the bull's meat is eaten.
1.2.11.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.3.1.
1.2.11.1.4. Con: There are practices that are used in bullfights that are banned in slaughterhouses because they are too cruel.
1.2.11.1.4.1. Con: Likewise there are practices in livestock treatment that are not acceptable in bullfighting, such as meat factories.
1.2.11.1.4.2. Pro: If a bull is not killed during[ordinary three sequences of a bullfight](http://colvetcadiz.org/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=40&Itemid=209), the bullfighter typically cuts the spinal cord of the bull and slices its medulla oblongata. This method, was [banned](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/5/12072534/running-of-the-bulls-2016-bullfighting-pamplona) from slaughterhouses in the EU, due to its cruelty.
1.2.11.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.3.2.1.
1.2.11.2. Con: Claiming that other practices are legal is not a justification for bullfighting also to be legal.
1.2.11.3. Con: Other practices that are cruel to animals have been prohibited, like [animal crush videos](http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html).
1.2.11.4. Pro: Hunting is legal in most countries, and often leads to slow and painful deaths for animals. Bullfights just happen to have a larger audience for this spectacle.
1.2.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.11.4.2. Con: The skill of a hunter is to kill the animal fast and painlessly. Bullfighting relies on the slow and painful death, hunters - who have the skill - kill the animals faster than they would have been killed by natural predators.
1.2.11.4.3. Con: One should not use one "wrong" to justify another.
1.2.11.4.4. Pro: About 50% of hunted animals are [wounded but not killed](http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/), leading the animals to suffer prolonged, painful deaths.
1.2.11.4.4.1. Con: Bullfighting is for entertainment, but hunting is often for keeping up the natural balance of species when there is a lack of predators in a given biosphere.
1.2.11.4.4.2. Con: The purpose of hunting isn't to show off the slow death as entertainment, it is to kill the animal quickly. Banning hunting is like banning gardening because some people use harmful chemicals in their garden. No one hunts to hurt animals, they hunt to get wild meat and try to kill as fast as possible. This is predator-prey dynamic, not entertainment for the masses.
1.2.11.5. Pro: From the animal rights perspective it's not coherent that Spain, as a European country, has harsh laws against treating animals with cruelty yet allows bulls to be used in such a manner \([p. 25](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/583114/IPOL_STU\(2017\)583114_EN.pdf)\).
1.2.11.6. Pro: Zoos imprison animals in deplorable conditions for the entertainment of humans.
1.2.11.6.1. Con: Zoos are less cruel than bullfighting.
1.2.11.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.2.1.1.
1.2.11.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.2.1.
1.2.11.6.2. Con: Zoos perform tasks beyond entertainment, such as safeguarding conservation of species.
1.2.11.6.2.1. Con: The individual suffering of the animal has to be included into any benefits for the species as a whole.
1.2.11.6.2.2. Pro: Zoo and Aquarium visits are an important tool for conservation education and animal care, and have an impact on visitors’ perception of their personal role in environmental problems and conservation. \([Falk et al., p. 3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253004933_Why_Zoos_Aquariums_Matter_Assessing_the_Impact_of_a_Visit_to_a_Zoo_or_Aquarium)\)
1.2.11.6.2.3. Con: Preserving animals for preservation's sake [is not desirable](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/jamieson01.htm). We should not preserve animals that are not able to survive in nature any more, but only in man-made constructions. In this case, we keep the animals for ourselves and for preserving their genetic material, not for the animal.
1.2.11.6.2.3.1. Con: Not all animals that are in conversation programs in zoos cannot live in the wild anymore. Frequently, animals are [reintroduced back into the wild](http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/conservation-breeding-programmes/extinct-in-the-wild) after human care or conversation breeding programs.
1.2.11.6.2.4. Pro: There are several species that [would be extinct](http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/8-zoos-helping-animals-edge-out-of-extinction) without the preservation of zoos, for example the Arabian Oryx, the Golden Lion Tamarin, and the Puerto Rican Parrot.
1.2.11.6.3. Con: Zoos often work to create species-appropriate living conditions, such as for polar bears in [Munich](http://www.hellabrunn.de/en/news/beautiful-home-at-hellabrunn/our-polar-bears-between-tundra-and-rocks/history-of-the-polar-bear-enclosure/)'s zoo.
1.2.11.6.4. Pro: In zoos, animals don't live their lives in their natural habitat, but often in terribly small enclosures.
1.2.11.6.5. Pro: A study conducted in 2008 found welfare concerns for every elephant in all thirteen zoos of the UK. \([Harris et al., 47](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf)\)
1.2.11.6.6. Pro: Zoo animals are likely to die prematurely.
1.2.11.6.6.1. Con: [84%](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36361) of mammal species live longer in zoos than in the wild.
1.2.11.6.6.2. Pro: Killer whales kept in zoos [live far shorter lives](https://www.thedodo.com/captive-orcas-die-younger-1117118989.html) than they do in the wild.
1.2.11.6.6.3. Pro: It is common that healthy animals [get put down](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356099) in zoos. In the 340 zoos that belong to the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, this number reaches an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 animals a year.
1.2.11.6.6.4. Con: The examples here are of very large mammals. It is possible that keeping these mammals in zoos should be prohibited, but that is no justification for allowing other cruel practices.
1.2.11.6.6.5. Pro: African elephants in European Zoos [only reach](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=6449110&page=1) an average of 16.9 years, while elephants who died in the Amboseli National Park in Kenya reach an average of 35.9 years, including those that are killed by humans. Asian elephants average 18.9 years in European zoos, while Myanmar timber elephants average 41.7 years.
1.2.11.7. Pro: In laboratories, animals are tortured and die as a result of chemical testing.
1.2.11.7.1. Con: Laboratory testing kills to better the lives of humanity for the rest of time through their experiments, while bullfighting simply kills to entertain a few humans for a little while.
1.2.11.8. Con: Other practices are legal because they serve a higher purpose that justifies the cruelty, while bullfighting is practiced solely for pleasure.
1.2.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.1.3.
1.2.11.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.7.1.
1.2.11.9. Con: The conditions of animals in other practices, such as in the meat industry and laboratories, are being constantly improved through regulations and new technologies.
1.2.11.9.1. Pro: In recent years, there has been an improvement of animal welfare practices in the beef, pork, and poultry industries in EU countries, through the formulation and enforcement of new legislation. [\(FAO, p. 20\)](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4002e.pdf)
1.2.11.9.2. Pro: There has been an increase in the development of private standards for animal treatment in food production, set by industry groups to improve animal welfare practices in the EU \(e.g. certification and control of a particular practice in production\). \([FAO​, p. xviii](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4002e.pdf)\)
1.2.11.9.3. Pro: In 2009, the EU [adopted](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/practice/slaughter_en) legislation that aims to minimize the pain and suffering of animals at the time of killing.
1.2.11.9.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.8.
1.2.12. Pro: Animals other than adult bulls themselves are harmed before the bullfight.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Bullfighters harm [calves](https://one-voice.fr/en/blog/one-voice-infiltrates-a-bullfighting-school-for-children.html)(A calf that is considered as mere "material" of a second level will be taunted around in the vicinity of Nîmes for more than twenty minutes, by a young person who has not yet mastered the act of Corrida \(bullfighting\).) and young animals while training for bullfights.
1.2.12.2. Pro: The bull is not the only animal suffering, hundreds of [horses](http://www.stopbullfighting.org.uk/facts.htm) die long and agonising deaths as they are gored by the pain-crazed bull.
1.2.12.2.1. Pro: [Horses](http://www.stopbullfighting.org.uk/facts.htm) have their ears stuffed with wet newspaper. They are blindfolded and their vocal chords are cut so they are unable to scream in pain.
1.3. Con: Legally prohibiting an activity is ineffective.
1.3.1. Pro: Banning bullfighting could drive it underground.
1.3.1.1. Pro: If bullfighting is less public, there will be a smaller audience and they will be less willing to report any particularly unsafe or cruel activities.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Those who attend underground bullfights could be prosecuted for attending, and so they are unlikely to report abuse to the authorities, thereby revealing their own attendance.
1.3.1.2. Pro: If bullfighting goes underground, it will be performed by criminals who are less likely to care about an animal's welfare.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Bullfighting is premised on [physically hurting bulls to provoke panic](http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-bull-taming-is-cruelty-at-its-best-tn-parties-using-it-for-political-gains-2564184.html) - in order to get the fairly sedentary creatures to "put on a show" - followed by publicly torturing and then killing them. It is not at all clear that criminals would have any less regard for the bull's welfare than those currently engaged in running bullfights.
1.3.1.3. Con: Being lawful and celebrated, it creates the culture and mindset that it is okay, and more people are open to it. Banning it significantly reduces the amount that it would be occurring, and create a culture of animal welfare that discourages the kind of behavior that would lead to individuals partaking in "underground" bullfighting.
1.3.1.4. Pro: To get governments to ban things is not the right way to stop something you don't like \(e.g. drugs\), even if there are good reasons for not wanting it.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Unlike other underground illegal activity - like drug trafficking, or prostitution - bullfighting requires large open spaces, and a live audience. These features make it easier to find and stop.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: In Goa, an Indian state, their version of bullfighting continues as ["an open secret"](http://www.sify.com/news/bjp-non-committal-on-legalising-traditional-bull-fighting-in-goa-news-others-rbwuEgcgedjbe.html), despite it being illegal.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Even if efforts were made to curb the practice, [corruption is so rife in Goa](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/corruption-is-one-of-the-main-key-issues-of-goa-elvis-gomes/articleshow/56803901.cms), that it is highly unlikely any sustainable action will be taken.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: If local law enforcement cannot be trusted to enforce a simple ban, it is unlikely they can be trusted to enforce basic standards either, so it is unclear why banning it would make it any more cruel.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Bullfights are popular events where villages participate. It is surely easier to cover up individual corruption than to turn an eye away from a mass event.
1.3.1.4.1.1.2. Con: The failure to properly enforce bans is not an argument in and of itself for legality.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: This risk also deters audiences from attending, reducing any profit.
1.3.1.5. Con: Bullfighting is less profitable if underground and, thus, rarer. This reduces the number of animals suffering as a result.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: Those that would take bullfighting underground might start adding factors such as betting in order to make a profit. This already happens with cockfights.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: There are already [live betting markets](http://onlinecasinosuite.com/gambling/spain/) at bullrings. This would not be an addition, and so would not help improve profits.
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: Even when legal, bullfighting is not a particularly high-profit industry [to begin with](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324766604578459073959438626).
1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Unlike other industries that survive underground - like drug trafficking or gambling - there does not seem to be any evidence that bullfighting is addictive for spectators, reducing the chance that they take the risk of breaking the law to continue to pay to attend.
1.3.1.5.3.1. Con: Non-addictive activities like prostitution are also driven underground if illegal.
1.3.1.5.3.2. Con: [Sports](https://www.recoveryunplugged.com/sports-addiction/) can be addictive in nature and so people's commitment to the sport cannot be ruled out.
1.3.1.5.4. Pro: If bullfighting is pushed underground, it won't be able to be held up as a source of national pride. This will reduce its popularity, and so reduce the amount of bullfighting.
1.3.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.1.
1.3.1.7. Con: Law enforcement agencies can crack down on illegal, underground practices and minimize their occurrence.
1.3.1.8. Pro: Despite cockfights being illegal in the US, they remain [relatively common](https://news3lv.com/news/local/the-underground-world-of-cockfighting-in-southern-nevada)(LAS VEGAS \(KSNV\) - Hidden deep in California's farmlands is a tradition as popular as fútbol and quinceañeras. Migrant workers call it a sport. Law enforcement authorities say it is a serious crime.\n\nThe laws are tough, and raising roosters with the intention to fight them is a felony in Nevada.\n\nCockfights are common in certain rural communities. And fights in empty warehouses and abandoned barns have made their way into southern Nevada.) in parts of the country.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: Cockfights would be easier to hide from the authorities as they can occur indoors. Bullfighting requires a large open space.
1.3.2. Con: On all models of political [sovereignty](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sovereignty/) other than anarchism, governments do have the right in at least some scenarios to ban actions, and on most models those rights are quite robust.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Even if one were to adopt a libertarian theory of sovereignty that only allows for banning actions that violate the [harm principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/), this would conceivably justify banning bull-fighting.
1.3.2.2. Con: Even if governements have this right, this does not mean that a ban is 'the right way'.
1.3.3. Con: Government do actually ban [drugs](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-11001803), therefore they have the capacity and legitimacy to ban practices that are deemed harmful.
1.3.4. Pro: [Nudging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) could be used to change the image of bullfighting.
1.3.4.1. Con: Nudging can only be applied to individual decision-making, while sports are organizational by definition. For a state policy targeting bullfighting to be effective, there ought to be at least some material disincentives, such as high excise taxes. Burdensome bureaucracy would not be sufficient unless the requirements are set so high that they and up creating a de facto ban on bullfighting, which would put them outside the nudge theory spectrum.
1.3.5. Con: It would still minimise bullfighting. Making drugs legal has [increased](https://www.sanpatrignano.com/what-we-do/sanpa-international/marijuana-legalization-has-led-more-use-and-addiction-while-illegal-market-continues-thrive/) their use.
1.3.6. Con: Laws aren't meant only to discourage a practice, they force those who break them to face recourse for their actions. Banning drugs may not stop users, but it gives us the ability to punish those who harm themselves or others while selling or using them.
1.3.7. Pro: The ban on alcohol during the [Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) in the United States turned out to be ineffective in preventing alcohol consumption.
1.3.7.1. Con: It is a lot easier to smuggle drugs or alcohol than bulls, not to mention hiding bullfights: the two things cannot be comparable.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: The principle remains the same: a ban will merely add value to the product, since it adds risk to those still dealing in the illegal good or service, and it adds the additional costs involved in subterfuge.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Con: The principle might remain the same, but the reality of the logistics involved in clandestine bullfights would be too complicated to ever become a reality.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Con: The public's view of something considered "illegal" dramatically changes the way people view those who practice it, which would eventually result in the practice becoming socially unacceptable.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: It is much harder to stage secret bull fights than it is to sell drugs secretly because you need an arena.
1.3.8. Con: The law also acts as a comment on morality, by making bullfighting illegal it is effective in sending the message that the act itself is objectively immoral. On the other hand, keeping it legal says that it is objectively an alright thing to do.
1.4. Con: Bullfighting is part of the history and the culture in several countries. Culture should be preserved.
1.4.1. Pro: Bullfighting is a form of art.
1.4.1.1. Pro: [It has been suggested](https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/orson-welles-on-bullfighting-as-an-art/) that the movement of the bull expresses majesty and grace.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The bulls are exhibiting classic signs of panic, suffering and distress. These are not majestic or graceful emotions or experiences.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.8.1.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Assuming this is true, we shouldn't kill them as murder is not graceful.
1.4.1.2. Pro: It has been suggested that bullfighting ranks as its own artistic discipline on par with sculptures and paintings, for example by [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/04/specials/hemingway-afternoon.html) and [Orson Welles](https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/orson-welles-on-bullfighting-as-an-art/).
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Hemingway and Welles lived in a different time.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Art is timeless. We still admire renaissance paintings of Titian, for example.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Artistic standards change all the time. Renaissance artists would hardly have recognised most modern and post-modern art as such.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: Orson Welles [trained](https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/orson-welles-on-bullfighting-as-an-art/) as a bullfighter in his youth, and is therefore hardly an impartial commentator.
1.4.1.3. Pro: In 2010, Spain's capital city [Madrid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/07/madrid-protects-bullfighting-art) protected bullfighting as an art form.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: The Madrid declaration of bullfighting as art form came later, in response to the Catalonian ban on bullfighting. For this reason, it was considered a political act, in order to reaffirm the power of Spanish traditions against Catalan claims.
1.4.1.4. Con: Just because an activity is considered a form of art does not in itself make it ethical to perform.
1.4.1.5. Con: Art, as the superior aesthetic expression of our creative inner selves, cannot include torture and violence.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Art very often depends on displays of [torture](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Torture_in_art).
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Bullfighting is a practice with the aim of showing the society that we, as humans, are superior to animals by making them seem weak and inferior. Some people consider bullfighting an art, yet the massacre of animals should not be considered art from any point of view.
1.4.1.6. Con: [The concept of art is a personal one. Hence, it cannot be generalised](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080247144500326). \(By definiton then, people will always disagree on its meaning\)
1.4.1.7. Pro: Bullfighting is an art as well as a form of inspiration for artists and intellectuals such as [Orson Welles](https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/orson-welles-on-bullfighting-as-an-art/), [Hemingway](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/04/specials/hemingway-afternoon.html), [Picasso](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/26/pablo-picasso-bullfighting-london-gallery-minotaurs-matadors-exhibition), [Dalí](http://www.southflorida.com/theater-and-arts/art/sf-art-salvador-dali-boca-20161228-story.html), [Lorca](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/06/bullfighting-outlawed-catalonia), among [others](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/sunday/spains-bullfighting-fight.html).
1.4.1.7.1. Con: Artists can draw inspiration from other places which don't include torturing living beings.
1.4.1.8. Pro: In 1936, [Federico García Lorca](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/06/bullfighting-outlawed-catalonia) described the bullfight as "probably Spain's greatest poetic and life-sustaining wealth \(...\) the most cultured 'fiesta' anywhere in the world".
1.4.1.9. Pro: In 2011, the Spanish Prime Minister [José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/31/bullfighting-saved-spain-artistic-discipline) officially recognized bullfighting as an "artistic discipline and cultural product".
1.4.1.9.1. Con: This declaration divides the Spanish population \([Douglass, 1997, p. 3](https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=AR7dF3dLzqMC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=bullfighting&ots=LO6WIHAnoo&sig=qOZjru7cKQ8SkbWW6NzlgX7iz_8#v=onepage&q&f=false)\). Many Spaniards identify themselves with a more liberal, modern, service-oriented, artistically avant-garde, culturally innovative, democratically open, internationally respected Spain, which in their opinion does not include bullfighting.
1.4.1.9.1.1. Pro: Bullfighting is often associated with [conservatism](http://www.politico.eu/article/spanish-bullfightings-slow-death-tordesillas-backlash-animal-rights-laws-culture/) and traditionalism, with right-wing parties in favour \(Partido Popular\) and left-wing \(PSOE, Podemos, IU\) and most regional parties \(PNV, CIU\) against it.
1.4.1.9.1.2. Pro: For many Catalans, bullfighting is associated with general [Francisco Franco](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2016/10/catalonia-bullfight-161018093320323.html), who during his regime declared bullfighting to be a Spanish national celebration.
1.4.1.10. Con: Other brutal sports, like boxing, are not considered an 'art' either.
1.4.1.10.1. Con: Compared to other athletes, bullfighters do interact with the audience for the eventual evaluation of their performance \([McCornick, p. 4](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=AMmaDY3HMP0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=regulation+of+bullfighting&ots=RvThm5DwWD&sig=kD1sKXat6FEa9qpN7q-vJHlOkyg#v=onepage&q=regulation%20of%20bullfighting&f=false)\). This is a shared component with art, but not present in boxing.
1.4.1.10.1.1. Con: Boxing has a long and storied history of participants and managers engaging in interaction with the audience to [build hype](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/27147850). Cricket has a strong history of ["sledging"](http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/crickets-sledging-power-rankings-featuring-marlon-samuels-shane-warne-merv-hughes/news-story/8049762cb1a6454dc08a66b74fa85a68) - insults to shake opponents and engage crowds. Plenty of sports involve various forms of players engaging with the audience - arguably, more so than many forms of art, which are presented without interaction.
1.4.1.10.1.1.1. Con: Cricket or boxing results are not decided by the spectators but the results of bullfights are.
1.4.2. Con: Cultural components change, as cultural transformation is a natural dynamic process.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Traditions change as societies' values change.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Oppressive practices such as casteism, gender injustice, racism that are part of some cultures are challenged according to the evolving sense of justice of the contemporary populace.
1.4.2.2. Con: Even if culture changes, cultural fix-points often remain, as illustrated by the continuity of religious [lactans iconography](http://www.academia.edu/1954926/Divine_Mothers_The_Influence_of_Isis_on_the_Virgin_Mary_in_Egyptian_Lactans-Iconography_Journal_of_the_Canadian_Society_for_Coptic_Studies_3_4_2012_71-90) in old Egypt and the modern Christian world.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: This is a fact, but not a justification for preserving culture touchstones that are violent and cruel.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: It is not about whether something is justifiable but whether it occurs.
1.4.2.3. Pro: [Cock fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfight) was a part of the history and culture of many nations but it is banned now in many of these countries \(including all states in the US except for one\).
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Cruel practices that are similar, like [bear-baiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear-baiting), have been banned in the UK and the US, regardless of tradition.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.6.2.
1.4.2.4. Pro: There is an ongoing generational change in opinion. 60% of young Spaniards disapprove of the sport, compared to 34% of those above 55 \([Ipsos, p. 2](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/bullfighting-in-spain-tables.pdf)\).
1.4.2.5. Pro: Western \(European\) culture has undergone rapid changes, such as a [democratic transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_society_after_the_democratic_transition#Role_of_women) and the ensuing sexual revolution.
1.4.2.6. Pro: With urbanization, culture [transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_of_culture#Environmental_stresses_and_impacts_on_cultures), which makes bullfighting less significant.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: With urban growth, bullfighting arenas become more valuable for other purposes than bullfighting, like the bullring in [Barcelona](http://inhabitat.com/architect-richard-rogers-transforms-barcelonas-las-arenas-bullfighting-ring-into-epic-shopping-center/) that was an transformed into a shopping mall.
1.4.2.6.1.1. Pro: In Madrid, for example, the [Vistalegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palacio_Vistalegre) bullring was transformed into a multipurpose arena that holds sports, concerts or political conventions.
1.4.2.6.2. Pro: The urban lifestyle has become increasingly stressful. This leaves less time for entertainment like bullfighting, as people are forced to schedule their time and can focus only on their favorite activities.
1.4.2.6.2.1. Con: In reality, people still make time for entertainment. For example, soccer matches in Spain attract [several hundred thousand people](http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/esp-primera-division-2015-2016/3/) every weekend.
1.4.2.7. Pro: [Communication technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_of_culture#Technological_impacts) that allow people to gather and organize foster a culture that opposes bullfighting, by helping animal-rights activists network or offering new forms of innovation.
1.4.2.8. Pro: Interest in bullfighting is declining and so is its cultural significance.
1.4.2.8.1. Con: The local protests in [Tamil Nadu](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/jallikattu-protests-intensify-in-tamil-nadu_1844964.html) or [Southern France](http://www.ibtimes.com/bloody-battle-over-bullfighting-southern-france-violence-protests-boycotts-cultures-collide-1497642) against bullfighting bans illustrate the sustained interest.
1.4.2.8.1.1. Con: While there is still enough support for such protests to occur, they do not negate an observable decline in interest in the activity.
1.4.2.8.2. Con: Traditional bullfighting may only survive with a big enough number of supporters and spectators so it will probably disappear without the need of prohibition due to the competition of digital entertainment.
1.4.2.8.3. Pro: Bullfighting is a very controversial topic, often with a minority being very passionate about maintaining it and forcing the practice on the wider society. Banning or defunding such practices would accelerate the end of such controversy.
1.4.2.8.4. Pro: One poll from 2015 claims only 19% of Spanish adults [support](http://www.newstalk.com/The-business-of-bullfighting:-A-Spanish-moneymaker-or-drain-on-taxpayers) bullfighting and 58% are against it.
1.4.2.8.5. Pro: Funds allocated for bullfighting in the past are now being spent on other [public services.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/27/villafranca-de-los-caballeros-bullfight-subsidy-books-school-supplies)
1.4.2.8.6. Pro: Attendance at bullfighting matches is in severe decline. The number of bullfights held in Spain has [dropped from 953 to 398 in 2014](http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/26/inenglish/1440584832_101530.html), according to the Culture Ministry.
1.4.3. Pro: Banning bullfighting should be decided by each individual country, a worldwide ban would lack legitimacy and ignore national and regional specificity.
1.4.3.1. Con: Global precepts like the ones written in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \([UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf)\) are valid worldwide.
1.4.3.2. Con: If we truly adopt a moral relativist outlook, then taboos such as murder and pedophilia could be considered valid in cultures that find them acceptable. However, we should be justified in condemning such norms.
1.4.3.3. Pro: It is definitely hard to "standarize" global laws, specially when the countries participating on that are not diverse and the power \(and ideology\) lays always on the same ones.
1.4.3.4. Con: From this view point, issues such as climate change risks, among others, would never be tackled and solved. We are becoming a globalized species, and if we wish to continue in this path, we need to decide some things worldwide.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: [Banning sprays](http://mentalfloss.com/article/523944/ozone-layer-healing-thanks-international-ban-harmful-man-made-chemicals) that harm the ozone layer of our planet was a [global](https://www.popsci.com/cfc-ozone-emission/) decision, it could only work if the ban went global.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: If nothing should be decided worldwide, human trafficking should not get tackled.
1.4.3.5. Pro: There are about ten [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting) in the world where bullfighting is practiced. Whether to ban it is a decision for the people of those countries. It is no business of people living in non-bullfighting countries.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: Bullfighting is part of the cultural identity of some countries, those who are not part of those countries cannot impose their beliefs in other cultures because they are part of the multidiversity.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: The question of whose business it is to make the decision to ban bullfighting is not relevant to the question of whether or not bullfighting ought to be banned. If bullfighting ought to be banned, then those who live in countries where it happens ought to campaign to ban it.
1.4.3.5.3. Con: Since moral obligations do not stop at national boundaries, cruelty is the business of all moral people regardless of what jurisdiction they live in.
1.4.3.5.4. Pro: A form of Bullfighting is an important part of [India's](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jallikattu-tradition-first-safety-next/article2801743.ece) culture.
1.4.3.6. Con: There are many things that should be decided worldwide and have been: banning the use of child soldiers, banning civilian bombing, torture. It isn't always enacted, but it should be agreed worldwide.
1.4.4. Pro: Human rights come before animals. In this case, the right for [cultural](http://www.unesco.org/culture/culture-sector-knowledge-management-tools/11_Info%20Sheet_Cultural%20Rights.pdf) expression.
1.4.4.1. Con: The right not to suffer and be tortured is of much more importance than the right to preserve a culture. Therefore, it is not sufficient that we assume human rights are more important than animal rights, we would have to assume that animal rights are of a much smaller importance to put something like culture before physical suffering. Besides, the cruelty involved in Bullfighting seems to strenghten socially pervasive cultural traits instead of any desirable ones.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Humans enjoy basic rights and liberties on different levels, from [UN Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) to national constitutions. Animals do not have these kinds of rights and protections.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Legal trends indicate that animals have rights.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: In 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution [to extend limited rights](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/weekinreview/13mcneil.html?_r=2&ref=science&oref=slogin) to non-human primates.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: At best this indicates that some basic rights exist for some animals. It does not prove that animal rights exist in general.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: Acknowledgement of [animals as ‘sentient’](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/1269) was introduced to New Zealand’s Animal Welfare Act 1999 in August 2015.
1.4.4.2.1.3. Pro: The [Lisbon Treaty](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare_en) of the EU introduced the recognition that animals are sentient beings and deserve welfare.
1.4.4.3. Pro: The right to participate in cultural life is considered [imperative](http://safeguarding heritage, strengthening creative industries, and encouraging cultural pluralism) to create a dialogue around diversity, safeguarding heritage, strengthening creative industries, and encouraging cultural pluralism
1.4.4.4. Pro: Prohibiting bullfighting can lead some to defend their rights, leading to public unrest.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: Campaigns against bullfighting already target individuals, such as [Frank Evans](http://www.stopbullfighting.org.uk/facts.htm).
1.4.4.4.2. Con: Unfair to the slaughtered animals: *they* do not get a chance to rebel, protest, defend or fight for *their* rights. Their voice, opinion or needs are disregarded.
1.4.4.4.3. Con: [Differences of opinions, contestations and confrontations are normal \(and healthy\) part of social interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) \(very much like we are doing by using this Kialo site\). Reason why, when they get out of hand, an authority is supposed to be there to support, and keep the peace.
1.4.4.4.3.1. Con: When there's social unrest and chaos, this is a sign of something that is potentially a threat to society. In this case, ruling body or authorities need to take charge for the welfare of society.
1.4.4.4.4. Con: Individual transgressions cannot be a good guide for state policy because they are isolated instances.
1.4.5. Con: When bullfighting is perceived as a core part of national identity \(e.g. in Spain\) it brands a country's culture as violent and diminishes its international reputation.
1.4.5.1. Con: Bullfighting sometimes attracts foreigners to Spain.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Non-Spanish bullfighters are attracted to Spain and sometimes even change their nationality, as [Frank Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Evans_\(bullfighter\)) did.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: This appears to be a very small handful of people. It is not clear on the evidence available what benefit these handful of exceptions bring to the nation.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: Child prostitution in some countries attracts tourists. Or hunting endangered species. Something being lucrative and attractive to tourists does not make it right.
1.4.5.1.3. Pro: Tourists are drawn to bullfights.
1.4.5.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.1.
1.4.5.1.3.2. Pro: Bullrings are largely sustained by tourists who visit out of curiosity and a belief that if they fail to visit this unique part of Spanish culture, their visit to Spain will not be complete \([Larene Read, p. 15](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)\).
1.4.5.1.3.2.1. Con: If bullfighting was prohibited – thus, officially not accepted as part of current Spanish culture – there would be no reason for tourists to regard it as a cultural 'must do' in Spain.
1.4.5.1.3.3. Con: Bullfights are not the only reason why tourists visit Spain.
1.4.5.1.3.3.1. Pro: For [Barcelona](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/31/bullfighting-ban-is-sweet-revenge-for-catalonia) it was particularly easy to ban bullfighting because most tourists come for Gaudí's buildings, the Picasso museum and the Miro Foundation.
1.4.5.2. Con: The international reputation of one country should be improved through education, progress and innovation, not through law imposition and prohibition.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: Education can be slow in improving general sensibility. If something is logically demonstrated to be harmful, the government can enhance the progress and the development of a nation through law.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: An analogous example would be the ban of CFC with [Montreal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol), which showed that waiting for the majority to demand less harmful products can be ineffective.
1.4.5.3. Pro: "Bullfighting is part of the culture in Spain" is a very broad \(and misguided\) generalization. [84](https://www.infolibre.es/noticias/politica/2016/01/21/el_los_jovenes_24_anos_esta_quot_poco_quot_quot_nada_quot_orgulloso_vivir_pais_con_toros_43668_1012.html)% of people from 16 to 24 years old are ashamed to live in a country with bullfighting.
1.4.5.4. Con: If a nation's culture is cruel and bloodthirsty \(the exquisite tortures of the inquisition come to mind, as does the treatment of South American natives by the Spanish\), it's good that other nations should know about this. It is a good thing that bullfighting warns other peoples about the Spanish national character.
1.4.5.5. Pro: [International animal-rights activists](http://www.stopbullfighting.org.uk/index.htm) \(working [in several countries](http://www.newstatesman.com/global-issues/2008/06/bullfighting-spain-bulls)\) work for the abolition of bullfighting, which they see as torture of animals. Their campaigning against this practice throughout the world influences foreigners' opinion of Spain.
1.4.5.6. Pro: It also unnecessarily divides the country, the supporters and those against it. Although [statistics show](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/11/493492351/momentum-grows-against-bullfighting-in-spain-as-thousands-rally) that only 19% of adults in Spain supported bullfighting, while 58% opposed it. [Monarchy](http://royalcentral.co.uk/europe/spain/king-felipe-attends-bullfight-104394), Government [\(especially when is Right-wing\)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11694875/Bullfighting-under-threat-from-Spains-new-Left-wing-councils.html) and many councils mayors \(which could be explained by the [chieftain-like state](https://www.eldiario.es/piedrasdepapel/caciquismo_espanol-conflicto_terrritorial_6_705939431.html) in the countryside\), also play a role in the supporters side.
1.4.5.7. Pro: Albeit a very traditional and old form of entertainment, bullfighting is not more than that and, from a moral point of view, individuals do not progress morally after watching an animal fight and die following his instincts.
1.4.5.8. Pro: [Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.peta.org/features/gandhi/) asserted that “the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”
1.4.5.8.1. Con: Laws shouldn't change merely because of one famous person's opinion.
1.4.5.9. Pro: Bullfighting represents a maladjusted display of ethnic identity and cultural identity. Large elements of society or societies that display maladjusted practices should have their leaders stopped, as matadors should be stopped, and should reconsider their moral compasses as a collective whole for supporting maladjusted and morally questionable practices.
1.4.5.9.1. Pro: Some forms of organization just are not the same as others, because of cultural inequality, lower forms of culture must be changed and brought up to the standards of higher forms of culture
1.4.5.9.2. Pro: Higher society listens to wider cultural and global cultural voices that delegate standards for how living ought to be. If a society is lower and does not comply with higher societies' reasonings it risks being unopened to change.
1.4.5.10. Pro: The identification leads to [stereotypes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/16/spanish-stereotypes-_n_5822414.html) and perpetuates myths about Spain with which many people do not identify.
1.4.5.11. Pro: At the 2016 Toro Jubilo near Madrid, [journalists were prevented from attending](https://www.euronews.com/2016/11/17/bull-set-on-fire-during-spanish-toro-jubilo-festival)(According to the animal rights group, the local authority in Medinaceli had prevented journalists from covering the event, allowing in only people who had been invited.). This suggests that organisers were aware that the event would attract negative publicity if given wide coverage.
1.4.5.12. Con: The loss of reputation is a marginal concern, as there are no significant economic consequences.
1.4.5.12.1. Con: Such a reputation could seriously damage the tourism industry, which regularly turns over upwards of [€50 billion](https://www.wttc.org/-/media/files/reports/economic%20impact%20research/countries%202015/spain2015.pdf) annually.
1.4.5.13. Con: Countries with bullfighting traditions are not judged by those alone; their positive reputation also draws from many of their other rich cultural practices.
1.4.5.13.1. Con: Despite these rich cultural practices, stereotypes about Spain being a country defined by flamenco and bullfighting [persist](http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/image+of+spain/ari43-2014-chislett-distance-between-spains-image-and-countrys-reality).
1.4.6. Con: Culture and history can be preserved by many other ways, without the need to continue doing the bad practices of it
1.4.6.1. Pro: Museums and books are the way to preserve traditions that no longer fit the actual morale and ethics.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Tradition based on torture and exploitation of the innocent has no place in the 21st century. The Spanish culture has many wonderful things to maintain and offer; this one can afford to be forgotten.
1.4.7. Pro: Bullfighting is an important part of culture in [Spain](https://www.quora.com/How-and-why-did-the-bull-become-so-important-in-Spanish-culture).
1.4.7.1. Pro: In Spain, it is [supported by the Monarchy](http://royalcentral.co.uk/europe/spain/king-felipe-attends-bullfight-104394)(His Majesty King Felipe VI of Spain was the guest of honour at the San Isidro Fair in Madrid this weekend, joining thousands of attendees at the annual event organised by the Press Association of Madrid.\n\nKing Felipe attended the traditional Corrida de la Prensa on Sunday, the final event of the San Isidro fair and a key highlight of the Spanish bullfighting season. During the event bullfighters Manuel Escribano, Paco Ureña and Emilio de Justo took on bulls from the famous stock of Victorino Martín Andrés as the King watched on from ringside seats at the Las Ventas bullring.) as well as by [right-wing political parties](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/12/europe/bullfighting-spain-politics-scli-intl/index.html)(In December, Vox, a far-right party known for its hard line stance on illegal immigration, won 12 seats in a regional election for the first time since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.\n\nThis week, Vox used its position as kingmaker to join a center-right coalition after making a deal with the Partido Popular\n\n\[...\]\n\nIn return for its support, Vox negotiated a number of conditions with the PP, including commitments to lower taxes, combat illegal immigration, and tackle Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nAnother intriguing addition to the list was "support for our traditions, hunting and bullfighting.").
1.4.7.2. Con: The notion of publicly stabbing cattle with knives and spears for entertainment is totally barbaric and such a stain on Spain's character, morality and compassion. Killing an animal slowly and ritually with knives and spears is a sadistic form of torture and totally unacceptable.
1.4.7.3. Con: Bullfighting is [strongly supported](https://www.thelocal.es/20160328/spain-could-lose-36-billion-a-year-if-it-bans-bullfighting/)(Madrid alone would face a loss of €244 million in revenues if it banned bullfighting: €232 million would be lost indirectly while €12.2 million would be lost directly.\n\n“Many tourists who come to Madrid include in their tour a trip to Las Ventas \[bullring\] to view the bullfights,” said adviser and spokesman for the regional government, Ángel Garrido, to Spanish media.) by tourism, suggesting that it is more important to people outside of Spain than locals.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Bullfighting is important to the [conservative elements](https://sportsgazette.co.uk/bull-fighting-a-symbol-of-modern-spain/)(Bull fighting represents conservatism: deeply entrenched cultural tradition resistant to change. For those who favour it, bull fighting is culturally vibrant, aesthetically artistic and a beautiful expression of what it means to be Spanish. The central government in Madrid recently overturned Catalonia’s ban on bull fighting which reflects the reluctance to let this element of the past die.) of Spanish society, who value the sport's traditional roots.
1.4.7.5. Con: Bullfighting is not popular in all of Spain. Some provinces have discouraged or banned the practice.
1.4.7.5.1. Pro: Catalonia [banned bullfighting in 2010](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37719997)(Bullfighting was banned in Catalonia in 2010 on the grounds that it was incompatible with Catalan tradition.).
1.4.7.5.1.1. Con: The national government [overturned this decision in 2016](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37719997)(Spain's constitutional court has overturned a ban on bullfighting in Catalonia, declaring it unconstitutional.\n\nThe court said bullfighting was part of Spanish heritage and therefore any decision on banning it could only be taken by central government.), declaring it unconstitutional as decisions over Spanish heritage had to be taken by the central government.
1.4.7.5.2. Pro: According to a government poll, [65% of the Spanish population](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anagarciavaldivia/2020/12/30/will-bullfighting-survive-the-next-decade-in-spain/)(According to government figures, only 8% of the population went to a bullfighting spectacle last year. Of this percentage, 5.9% attended a bullfight or 'corrida' while the rest went to other events such as the popular running of the bulls.\n\nThe same national survey shows that 65% of Spaniards have an interest of between 0 and 2 out of 10 in bullfighting. This figure rises to 72.1% for people aged 15 to 19 and to 76,4% for those aged 20 to 24.\n\nOnly 5.9% of the population claims an interest between 9 and 10 in the spectacle.) have an interest of between 0 and 2 out of 10 in bullfighting.
1.4.7.5.3. Con: Spanish law still defines bullfights as [part of Spain's cultural heritage](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2021/10/12/bullfighting-banned-from-spain-s-400-covid-culture-recovery-voucher-for-teens)(Conservative opposition parties chided the government for leaving out bullfights. The Fundación Toro de Lidia, which represents the bullfighting sector, complained that Spanish law classifies bullfighting as part of the country's cultural heritage.\n\nThe Culture Ministry said in a written note to state-owned news agency Efe that "not everything that our legislation regards as culture will come under this cultural support."). Regional bans have [been overridden](https://www.catalannews.com/society-science/item/catalonia-s-ban-on-bullfighting-ten-years-later)(Then, in 2016, Spain's Constitutional Court overturned the Catalan Parliament ban, arguing the chamber had overstepped its authority. According to the court, only Spain has authority over things considered to be part of the country's cultural heritage.) by the Spanish Constitutional Court on this basis.
1.4.7.5.4. Con: Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Madrid's conservative mayor, is [more popular than ever](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56978343)(The conservative leader of Spain's Madrid region has won a resounding victory after a bitter election battle.\n\nDespite more than doubling the Popular Party \(PP\) seats, Isabel Díaz Ayuso still fell short of a majority and may end up in alliance with the far right.). She is [vocally pro-bullfighting](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/bullfighting-back-madrid-heated-election-campaign-ends-77451666)(Díaz Ayuso defended her decision by appealing to the central theme of her campaign: “liberty.”\n\n“When there are bullfights, there is liberty,” Díaz Ayuso said last month.\n\nLast week she added: “It is very important for those who like bullfighting to see them as they wish. The spectators are going to be in the best hands possible. There won’t be a problem.”).
1.4.8. Pro: The historical experience of bullfighting has lent itself to become a source of modern day identity.
1.4.8.1. Con: The validity of bullfighting has been contested several times in Spain's history. Enlightenment intellectuals regarded it as barbaric and considered it a spectacle to disenfranchise the masses from wider political issues. Thus the expression, mimicking [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses), “[bread and bulls](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPan_y_toros&edit-text=&act=url)”.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Bullfighting allows people to [reconnect](http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/Books/bid1030.htm) to a traditional and great Spain and therefore is a source of identity.
1.4.8.3. Pro: Bullfighting was necessary for the creation of Spain once the reconquista was successful, as it provided a set of [common traditions](https://mariahrob.wordpress.com/historical-significance-of-bullfighting/) that could be practiced by the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula.
1.4.8.4. Con: Many in Spain do [contest](http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Brandes%20on%20Politics%20of%20Bullfights.pdf) the practice of bullfighting - especially the Catalans, those who identify with a modern Europe and animal rights activists.
1.4.8.5. Pro: Bullfighting deepens cultural bonds within the Spanish-speaking world, as it is commonly practised in Spain, Mexico and Colombia.
1.4.8.6. Con: The case of [Cuba](http://www.academicroom.com/article/between-baseball-and-bullfighting-quest-nationality-cuba-1868-1898) - where bullfighting has been replaced by baseball as a cultural touchstone - illustrates both the cultural power that this sport has and how it can be changed.
1.4.8.7. Con: It was only in the late 19th and 20th centuries that bullfighting experienced a boost.
1.4.8.7.1. Con: Nation building is always a modern process. Nevertheless, it conveys a feeling that roots reach long into the past. The Korean nation, for example, was invented in the late 19th century, but claims to have a linage as far back as [2333 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangun).
1.4.8.7.2. Con: Spanish bullfighting practices were perceived by [Ancient Rome](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/378227/pdf) as something distinctly Spanish. This points to its importance before Spain formed as a distinct nation.
1.4.8.7.3. Pro: Despite being contested in other periods, bullfighting experienced a boost during Franco’s dictatorial regime: it had the backing of the government and those who opposed it could not express their opinions \([Larene Read, p.14](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)\).
1.4.8.7.3.1. Pro: During [Franco’s](https://www.ft.com/content/9f8853c8-7b7a-11dd-b839-000077b07658) dictatorship, while bullfighting was encouraged and imposed as a national symbol, other practices were diminished or prohibited.
1.4.8.7.3.1.1. Pro: Many Spaniards do not see  bullfighting as a symbol of pride, but rather as an [imposed](https://www.ft.com/content/9f8853c8-7b7a-11dd-b839-000077b07658) and continual denial of Spain’s plurinationality.
1.4.8.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.1.2.
1.4.8.8. Pro: Parts of the Spanish pro-bullfighting lobby are working to have it listed it on Spain's intangible heritage list with [UNESCO](http://www.thelocal.es/20151207/fans-must-lead-fight-to-save-bullfighting-from-extinction-pro-bulls-group).
1.4.8.9. Pro: Early 20th century Spanish literature traces bullfighting as an age-old tradition that is peculiar to 'Spain' \([p. 8](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=AMmaDY3HMP0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=regulation+of+bullfighting&ots=RvThm5DwWD&sig=kD1sKXat6FEa9qpN7q-vJHlOkyg#v=onepage&q=regulation%20of%20bullfighting&f=false)(The readers of El Ruedo \(Madrid\) are assured that elegance as it is found in toreo is allied to the Spanish sensibility and “presupposes a high popular conception of man’s destiny and of his mastery over himself.” More alarming but equally typical is the statement, “Such is Spain, in its rural areas and towns, as in its fundamental principles: with a faith and a mythology. A pure faith and an incomparable Catholicism \[together with\] a mythology of the bull as a totemic animal, racial and mysterious, and the secular pleasure of the Spaniard in the bull’s deception.” The statement is virtually impossible to translate, for it is not conceived in the logic of prose but as poetic incantation.)\).
1.4.9. Con: Bullfighting has become a subject of political claims, in which cultural traditions are merely used as source of power.
1.4.9.1. Con: As an integral part of society, culture is always political and therefore used for political reasons.
1.4.9.2. Con: Since most everything in culture has to do with the distribution of power, this does not show that bullfighting isn't a cultural tradition.
1.4.9.3. Pro: In Central and South America bullfighting represents colonial culture of the oppressor. The practice is not rooted in the native cultures.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Bullfighting is a pawn in the [contest](http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/Books/bid1030.htm) between those supporting a centralized and those supporting a regionalized Spain.
1.4.9.4.1. Pro: The sport has an [overwhelming support](http://www.spainthenandnow.com/spanish-culture/bullfighting-in-spain/default_8.aspx) among sections of Spain, particularly in Andalucía and around Madrid.
1.4.9.4.1.1. Pro: Only 21% of those living in the Centre and the South of Spain support bullfighting, while the number soars to 53% in the North or East \([IPSOS p.2](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/bullfighting-in-spain-tables.pdf)\).
1.4.9.4.1.1.1. Con: [58%](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/bullfighting-in-spain-tables.pdf) of those surveyed opposed or strongly opposed bullfighting. Only 19% of them supported or strongly supported it.
1.4.9.4.1.1.2. Con: To call [53%](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/bullfighting-in-spain-tables.pdf) supporting it in the area with the greatest level of support "overwhelming support" is misleading.
1.4.9.4.1.2. Con: Even in Andalucia, the number of bullfights held per year [halved](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-bullfighting-2360921.html) between 2007 and 2010, indicating a collapse in support.
1.4.9.4.1.3. Con: In 2006, [only 25% of Spaniards](http://www.spainthenandnow.com/spanish-culture/bullfighting-in-spain/default_8.aspx) had an interest in the bullfighting spectacle, and those were mostly older people.
1.4.9.4.1.4. Con: Regional opposition to bullfighting is massive within Spain.
1.4.9.4.1.4.1. Pro: In [Galicia](http://www.addaong.org/site/thebulltribune/2010/07/12/galicia-and-the-majority-of-spanish-communities-against-bullfighting/) there are often protests against the national decision to preserve bullfights, so the support is not nationally shared.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2. Pro: Bullfighting is not central to Catalan culture.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Bullfighting encounters strong opposition from civil society.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Fans and members of the Catalan bullfighting federation \(FETC\) [celebrated](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fccaa.elpais.com%2Fccaa%2F2016%2F11%2F20%2Fcatalunya%2F1479659074_059113.html&edit-text=) the overturning of the Catalan bullfighting ban. They expect the Monumental bullfighting arena to host the sport again soon.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Fans are not a useful sample. No-one is claiming that there are no bullfighting fans in Catalonia, simply that they are a small minority.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Over [600,000 petitions](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/69) were collected in support of a ban on bullfighting in Catalonia.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.8.4.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1.4. Pro: 81% of the population of Catalonia opposes bullfighting \([p. 787](https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/brandes_on_politics_of_bullfights.pdf)(A survey taken in 2007 revealed that some 81 percent of Catalans oppose bullfighting.)\).
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Bullfighting has strong opposition from the administration and political institutions in Catalonia.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.8.3.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: 45 towns in Catalonia have declared themselves to be[anti-bullfighting.](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/69)
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: Bullfighting encounters strong opposition from the Catalan cultural environment.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: In Catalan nationalism, there is a feeling that to be a good Catalan, one has to reject bullfighting because it is not a Catalan tradition \([Tkac, p. 152](http://revistas.uned.es/index.php/rdh/article/view/14955/13280)\).
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: The Catalan cultural movement of the early 20th century, [Noucentisme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noucentisme), started to claim that bullfighting, as savage and Spanish, had nothing to do with Catalan identity \([Rabaseda & Matas, p.105](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/5146429.pdf)\).
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.4. Con: There are indications that many in Catalonia do appreciate bullfighting.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.4.1.4.2.1.1.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.4.2. Pro: In Barcelona, the audience cheered and applauded when the most famous bullfighter José Tomás re-debuted. This indicates the pan-Iberian importance of bullfighting \([Brandes, p. 788](http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Brandes%20on%20Politics%20of%20Bullfights.pdf)\).
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.4.2.1. Con: There is a bias involved, as those who visit bullfights are already inclined to appreciate the activity.
1.4.9.4.1.4.2.4.2.2. Con: The re-debut was accompanied by major protests outside the stadium indicating the ambivalence with which bullfighting is received \([Brandes, p. 788](http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Brandes%20on%20Politics%20of%20Bullfights.pdf)\).
1.4.9.4.1.4.3. Con: Bullfighting is a pan-Iberian tradition and thus part of political traditions in all regions.
1.4.9.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Bullfighting being part of a region's history does not mean that it enjoys support from the populace, or governing administrations.
1.4.9.4.1.4.3.2. Pro: Catalonia does have bullfighting traditions. Some [non-professional](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/jason-webster-bullfighting-ban-is-more-about-catalonia-than-cruelty-2360934.html) practices of bullfighting, like correbous, are still enormously popular in the province of Tarragona.
1.4.9.4.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Even though Catalonia's bullfighting events violate animals’ rights, they are considered to be an integral part of Catalan culture \([p. 152](http://revistas.uned.es/index.php/rdh/article/view/14955/13280)\).

1.4.9.4.4. Pro: Bullfighting has to be seen in the context of a symbolism. Jaume Sala and Àlex Ferreiro came up with the idea for the [Catalan donkey](http://www.enforex.com/culture/osborne-bull-catalan-donkey.html) car sticker in 2003, as an alternative and satirical reaction to the Spanish bull.
1.4.9.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.4.1.4.
1.4.9.4.6. Pro: The legality of bullfighting is contested between the central institutions in Madrid and those in the region of Catalonia, which even introduced a ban on bullfighting.
1.4.9.4.6.1. Con: The [legality](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/69) is more a contest between animal right activists and traditionalists rather than between center and periphery.
1.4.9.4.6.1.1. Pro: Support for this claim can be found in the fact that poor people are more opposed to bullfighting \([IPSOS, p. 3](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/bullfighting-in-spain-tables.pdf)\). Poor people also tend to be more in favor of [animal rights](https://thebluereview.org/why-poor-people-care-more-about-animal-welfare-than-wealthy-shoppers/).
1.4.9.4.6.2. Pro: Political actors, such as [Iniciativa per Catalunya](http://www.iniciativa.cat/), are using the bullfighting controversy to [press through](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/06/bullfighting-outlawed-catalonia) their demands for more autonomy, making use of the legal system.
1.4.9.4.6.2.1. Pro: The vote on the ban by the Catalan Parliament came in October 2010, after the Spanish Constitutional Court struck down parts of [Catalonia's autonomy charter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/19/spain.gilestremlett) - including the right to call itself a nation - with a referendum in June 2010.
1.4.9.4.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.9.4.1.4.3.2.
1.4.9.4.6.3. Pro: In 2016, Spain's Constitutional Court [overturned the Catalonia ban](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37719997), saying that bullfighting is part of Spanish heritage and therefore any decision on banning it could only be taken by the central government.
1.4.9.4.6.3.1. Pro: In 1991, bullfighting was also banned in the [Canary Islands](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/07/bullfighting-future-spain-160712113548128.html) and the Constitutional court did not express any objection. This shows that bullfighting is being used as a weapon in a political battle.
1.4.9.4.6.4. Pro: Catalonia's ban on bullfighting is less about repudiation of bullfighting than it is about asserting regional control.
1.4.9.4.6.4.1. Pro: [Some believe](http://www2.gwu.edu/~igis/assets/docs/Bob_Paper.pdf) that the real motive of the ban was ridding Catalonia of the Castilian culture epitomized by bullfighting, using animal rights as a new weapon in a nationalist battle.
1.4.9.4.6.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.4.1.4.3.2.
1.4.9.4.6.4.2. Pro: [Critics of the ban](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/31/bullfighting-saved-spain-artistic-discipline) said it was motivated more by Catalan nationalism and a desire to assure political independence from Madrid than by a genuine desire to outlaw the tradition.
1.4.9.4.7. Con: Even though the [Basque Nationalist Party](http://www.thelocal.es/20150623/ole-san-sebastian-council-reinstates-bullfights) strives for more regional autonomy, they reintroduced bullfighting once they grabbed power.
1.4.9.4.7.1. Con: [Bildu](http://www.thelocal.es/20150623/ole-san-sebastian-council-reinstates-bullfights), a left-wing and pro-Independence Basque party, was the one that banned bullfighting, as they considered it no longer central to the festivities. The Basque Nationalist Party \(PNV\), a conservative party, was just appealing to its more traditional base.
1.4.9.5. Pro: The economically and socially dominant Thevar caste group in the state of Tamil Nadu considers bullfighting, known as [jallikattu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallikattu), to be a symbol of their [caste supremacy](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Jallikattu-Power-play-by-caste-bigwigs-in-villages/articleshow/34999811.cms).
1.4.9.5.1. Pro: [Dalits](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inside-the-macho-divisive-world-of-tamil-nadu-s-bull-taming-sport-jallikattu/story-HyPVBni8jupH0Faagn6oTI.html), the former untouchables, are generally discriminated against at bullfights. Often they are forced to do unpaid menial labour and have special segregated seats assigned to them.
1.4.9.6. Pro: Bullfighting is central to maintaining a Spanish political identity.
1.4.9.6.1. Con: The majority of Spaniards from all regions and age groups oppose using public funds to support bullfighting \([IPSOS, p. 22](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/bullfighting-in-spain-tables.pdf)\), which indicates they do not view it as critical to national identity.
1.4.9.6.2. Con: Rafael Nadal, Pau Gasol, Fernando Alonso and especially the Spanish national soccer team are sources of national [pride](https://www.ft.com/content/9f8853c8-7b7a-11dd-b839-000077b07658) that generate national identity and unity in a lot less controversial manner and for a bigger majority than bullfighting.
1.4.9.6.3. Con: Spain has other unifying features, such as the national soccer team or the monarch.
1.4.9.6.3.1. Con: Spain has relatively weak symbols of unity compared to other states. The Spanish language, for example, is contested by regional language like [Catalan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/catalan-language-survived).
1.4.9.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.4.
1.4.9.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.9.4.1.4.
1.4.10. Pro: Cultural practices, discourses and material expressions surrounding bullfighting give social meaning to societies.
1.4.10.1. Con: Social meaning is created through more cultural practices than bullfighting.
1.4.10.1.1. Pro: Internationally-known figures like Cervantes, Goya, Gaudí or Picasso - and the cultural practices associated or influenced by them - offer a less controversial contribution to Spanish culture than bullfighting.
1.4.10.2. Pro: The importance of bullfighting in Spain can be seen in linguistics: 42 idioms come from bullfighting [\(Boers and Lindstromberg, p. 365\)](https://books.google.es/books?id=nEGN5KYHCGIC&pg=PA365&lpg=PA365&dq=spanish+idioms+that+come+from+bullfighting&source=bl&ots=HNNm3yHBxa&sig=035vLHeTUW4E2BYBJIMJoVHCsXI&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij7vC88NHRAhVFwBQKHfW1BmkQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&q=spanish%20idioms%20that%20come%20from%20bullfighting&f=false) and they are often [used](https://casualnotebook.wordpress.com/2015/09/11/language-files-part-1-spanish-and-bullfighting/) by [speakers](https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=es&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.turitoros.com%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D91%26Itemid%3D248&edit-text=&act=url), even without knowing their origin.
1.4.10.3. Con: Abstract values like social meaning are not more valuable than concrete ones like material suffering.
1.4.10.4. Con: Fatal practices should be banned regardless of their cultural meaning. They can be preserved in history books, but they are not necessary to embrace a particular culture. For example: [Dueling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel), [Self Mummification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokushinbutsu), [Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_\(practice\)), etc. these practices are now banned but their cultures still persist.
1.4.10.5. Pro: In Spain, the bull is viewed with respect and considered a symbol of beauty in the bullfighting community.
1.4.10.5.1. Con: Beauty should not be represented by a violent act that imposes death to a living being. There is a huge difference between a representation and real life, bioethics do not allow violence by a huge amount of reasons, and this is one of those.
1.4.10.5.2. Pro: The [Osborne bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_bull) illustrates the importance of the bull in Spanish culture.
1.4.10.5.2.1. Con: While the Osborne bull is preponderant in Andalusia and the two Castillas, it is non-existent in Catalonia and has only small presence in the Balearic Islands, The Basque Country or Navarra. The sculptures have been [vandalised](http://spanishnewstoday.com/osborne-bull-beheaded-in-malaga_44246-a.html) many times by nationalists or animal activists.
1.4.10.5.2.2. Con: In 2017 the Spanish Supreme Court, following a litigation between Osborne and Badtoro, ruled that bullfighting is part of the Spanish heritage, but the [bull](http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170123/413628409268/el-supremo-rechaza-anular-la-marca-toro-de-osborne-porque-el-animal-no-es-simbolo-oficial-de-espana.html) is not. The Court also stated that the bull is not an official symbol of Spain, even if sometimes it is used as such.
1.4.10.5.2.3. Pro: When a Spanish court ordered the Osborne bullboards removed, there was major public outcry by those who feared a loss of identity \([Brandes, p. 782](http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Brandes%20on%20Politics%20of%20Bullfights.pdf)\).
1.4.10.5.2.4. Pro: In 1997, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that the "[bullboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_bull)" has become an intrinsic part of [Spanish identity landscape](https://www.grapefrute.com/de/from-the-people-to-the-people-toro-de-osborne/)(Spanish citizens, backed by designers, artists, and historians, lobbied for an exception for the Osborne bull as a cultural artefact. In 1997, the Spanish Supreme Court gave the bulls an exemption, and they were permitted to remain as part of the landscape.).
1.4.10.6. Pro: [Colombia](http://fusion.net/story/45635/ole-colombia-reverses-ban-on-bullfighting/)'s Supreme Court overruled a ban on bullfighting because it represents a “cultural form of expression.”
1.4.10.7. Pro: In Spain, bullfighting is so integral that the government plans to include it as an optional [school subject](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11938960/Spain-to-teach-bullfighting-in-schools.html).
1.4.10.7.1. Con: The plan to introduce bullfighting as a subject in school met fierce [opposition](http://europe.newsweek.com/plans-bullfighting-courses-spanish-schools-meet-opposition-336065) both within and outside Spain.
1.4.10.8. Pro: Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, India is a 5,000-year-old tradition that is conducted during a harvest festival and is read by some as a "[cultural resistance to an urban modernity that tends to marginalise rural and agrarian values](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-why-the-cultural-argument-for-jallikattu-needs-a-hearing/)".
1.4.10.8.1. Con: Traditions ought not to be beyond critique.
1.4.10.8.2. Con: Bullfighting is so cruel that the Indian Supreme Court [banned](http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/sc-bans-jallikattu-says-cruelty-against-animals-is-prohibited-by-law-go-play-computer-games-265263.html) it.
1.4.10.8.2.1. Con: The Indian federal government issued a six month [executive order](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-38711340) that bypasses the Supreme Court and temporarily clears the way for bullfighting events to resume in Tamil Nadu.
1.4.10.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.1.1.
1.4.11. Con: Where a tradition or cultural practice constitutes a threat to humans or animals, the government should intervene and prohibit it.
1.4.11.1. Con: "[Castells](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/catalonia-s-human-towers-the-art-of-castells/)", a Catalan tradition that involves creating human towers, is also dangerous for participants \(especially children, who go on top\) and spectators, yet the UNESCO classified it as an Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: The organisations that make "castells" have improved their [safety](http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/catalan-castells-are-safer-than-ever-with-only-2-5-of-the-towers-collapsing-in-2013) measures in recent years - for instance, by making children wear safety helmets.
1.4.11.1.2. Pro: A [12-year-old girl was killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/07/spain.gilestremlett)(Young girl dies after fall from nine-storey human tower\n\nThe huge, fragile-looking human towers built by groups from eastern Spain known as castellers were at the centre of controversy at the weekend after a 12 year-old-girl died falling off one.\n\nMariona Galindo died of head injuries after falling from a nine-storey human tower at her home town of Mataró, north-east Spain. She had been climbing to the higher levels of the human towers for the past two years.) after falling from a castell in 2006.
1.4.11.2. Con: Cultural transformation is an organic process that occurs from individual choices and beliefs. It should not be the role of government to dictate culture.
1.4.11.2.1. Con: Cultural transformation does not occur from individual choices, but from collective action. Social movements are the main agents of social change \([Della Porta & Diani, p. 21](https://www.hse.ru/data/2012/11/03/1249193172/Donatella_Della_Porta_Mario_Diani_Social_Mov.pdf)\) and their actions are meant to influence their rulers' decisions.
1.4.11.3. Pro: There is growing evidence that harmful traditional practices - such as the preference for a son in many societies, or early and forced marriage of girls - can be one of the root causes for discrimination and violence against girls. \([UNDAW, 1](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/elim-disc-viol-girlchild/ExpertPapers/EP.4%20%20%20Raswork.pdf)\) If states want to enforce their national and international obligations, namely to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on sex, they need to intervene, regulate or prohibit these practices.
1.4.11.4. Pro: It is possible to keep part of the tradition, modifying it in order to avoid injury or death to the animal
1.4.11.4.1. Pro: Barbaric traditions don't have to be completly abolished, but can easily be transitioned into symbolic variants \(sublimation\), such as a sport with movements that resemble bullfighting or some folklore event with a virtual bull fight.
1.4.11.5. Pro: Other violent traditions have been outlawed. This indicates how violence can be a motivation for abolition.
1.4.11.5.1. Pro: In 2014, Denmark [banned halal and kosher slaughter](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-bans-halal-and-kosher-slaughter-as-minister-says-animal-rights-come-before-religion-9135580.html) – an essential part of Muslim and Jewish faith – if animals were not stunned before the procedure. The reasoning of the government was that religion is not allowed to harm animal rights.
1.4.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.
1.4.11.5.3. Pro: The Roman gladiatorial games [declined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator) in the early 5th century because their cruelty was inimical to Christian life and salvation.
1.4.11.5.4. Pro: France struck bullfighting from its list of [intangible heritage](http://www.thelocal.fr/20150605/france-cuts-bullfighting-from-cultural-heritage-list) in face of animal rights campaigners pointing to its cruelty.
1.4.11.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.8.8.
1.4.11.6. Pro: In a modern, advanced world there are alternative ways in which we can celebrate and honor a culture, which emphasize our social growth and progression and do not require suffering.
1.4.11.6.1. Pro: For example, an alternative could be the formation of a theatrical performance that takes place in the arena, with traditional music and performers portraying the dramatic history, the conflict and the resolution. This would honor and preserve the cultural history without causing harm.
1.4.11.6.2. Pro: Traditions require help in order to evolve positively - the force of habit does not question whether the habit is still beneficial or applicable: it requires an outside force to do the thinking. Modern Spain is that outside force.
1.4.11.7. Pro: Female genital mutilation \([FGM](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw52/statements_missions/Interagency_Statement_on_Eliminating_FGM.pdf)\) is also a cultural practice. Governments and institutions all over the world have [recognized](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg5) that it needs to be fully abandoned.
1.5. Con: Bullfighting can benefit national economies.
1.5.1. Pro: Bullfighting is a billion dollar industry.
1.5.1.1. Con: Those who argue that bullfights can not be forbidden because of [business](http://people.howstuffworks.com/bullfighting5.htm) are putting the importance of a life and money on the same level, and this is immoral.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Banning bullfighting and removing this source of revenue is more immoral than allowing it, as the estimated [€3.6 billion a year that Spain's economy would lose](https://www.thelocal.es/20160328/spain-could-lose-36-billion-a-year-if-it-bans-bullfighting) could have been used to help many of its citizens.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.1.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: The revenue from bullfights does [not benefit](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/europe/26bullfighting.html) society; only a small group of breeders and star fighters.
1.5.1.1.1.3. Con: Based on the case of [Madrid](http://www.thelocal.es/20160328/spain-could-lose-36-billion-a-year-if-it-bans-bullfighting), where only 5% of the loss occurred directly to the government, this €3.6 billion would make up an insignificant 0.07% of Spain's [total welfare spending](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SOCX_AGG) as of 2013.
1.5.1.1.1.4. Con: This is far less money than it sounds. The Spanish tourism sector alone regularly turns over upwards of €50billion annually - investments in various other attractions or industries could easily replace this amount.
1.5.1.1.1.5. Con: The figure of €3.6 billion is likely to be exaggerated given that it was the National Association of Bullfighting Organizers that came up with the figure. After all, it has a direct stake in keeping bullfighting alive.
1.5.1.1.1.6. Pro: In Spain, there are around [562](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers2.cfm?abstract_id=2568397) bullfighting arenas that are either run by the government or in private hands. If there are no more bullfights, it would lead to a significant financial loss.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1. Con: These could be repurposed for other sports, or forms of entertainment.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.6.1.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Many may be suitable as stadiums for other sports, with minimal refurbishments.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Many may be suitable for outdoor theatre and concerts, with minimal refurbishments. The Santamaria bullring in Colombia has previously been used for [concerts and other cultural events](http://www.virtualamericas.net/colombia/photos/cities/bogota/co0022.shtml).
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Many, like [La Malagueta Plaza de Toros in Malaga](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/spains-most-impressive-bullrings/) are already used for such events, so it would simply be a matter of increasing their frequency.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.4. Pro: Many publicly-owned ones − in some cases, listed buildings or protected spaces − can be transformed into public facilities that the city or town [needs](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elconfidencial.com%2Fsociedad%2F2011-07-10%2Fque-hago-con-mi-plaza-de-toros_396185%2F).
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.5. Con: If it was so easy to repurpose large buildings, Olympic stadiums all over the world would not leave behind [white elephants](http://www.businessinsider.de/abandoned-olympic-venues-around-the-world-photos-2015-8?r=US&IR=T): large buildings that require constant care and maintenance and cannot sustain themselves.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.5.1. Con: Olympic stadiums are white elephants because they must hold massive once-in-four-years international audiences, which are larger than audiences for any other sporting event in the world. Bullfights do not draw such audiences in the status quo, and so bullrings are more reasonably sized.
1.5.1.1.1.6.1.5.2. Con: Olympic stadiums are "white elephants," a white elephant is expensive because it cannot be used due to its beauty, not because it economically/physically cannot be used. One wouldn't hold a tennis game in the Taj Mahal, in the same way Olympic stadiums are preserved.
1.5.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: When mobile arenas are included it has been suggested that there are up to [1727](http://www.mundotoro.com/plazas-de-toros?pagina=35&txtpais=1&submit=Buscar) arenas.
1.5.1.1.1.6.3. Con: The end of slavery also led to a financial loss. Proponents of child labour in some countries use the same argument that "it would lead to financial loss." Just because it costs money, doesn't mean it isn't abusive.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Many humans feel more compassion and sympathy for the bull than concern about the business side of things, which reflects the essential concern of the debate.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Organisations like the [Nonhuman Rights Project](http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org) are becoming increasingly popular, just as the acknowledgement of the cruelty of bullfighting is being debated.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: To many in rural [Haiti](http://mashable.com/2014/11/22/bull-fighting-haiti/#HXgMxgBOukqR), bullfighting is a necessary means to make a livelihood.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: The claim that it is a necessary livelihood is tenuous, given that the money earned seems to come exclusively from betting, which is inherently unreliable and could be replaced with other, less cruel, forms of gambling.
1.5.1.1.4. Pro: If animal cruelty is permissible due to its financial benefits in the case of bullfighting, cruelty to any other nonhuman animal is tacitly allowed if it results in profit of a certain level
1.5.1.2. Pro: In Europe, bullfighting is a €2.5 billion \($3.3 billion USD\) industry \([p. 12](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)(“Bullfighting is a 2.5 billion euros \($3.3 billionUS dollar\) industry, employing more than 10,000 people across Spain, including matadors and assistants, managers, breeders, bullring workers and promoters.)\).
1.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.4.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Bullfighting generates millions in [sales tax](https://www.newstalk.com/business/the-business-of-bullfighting-a-spanish-moneymaker-or-drain-on-taxpayers-604053) in Spain.
1.5.2. Pro: Bullfighting provides jobs.
1.5.2.1. Con: A significant portion of those jobs are in raising cattle, managing events or selling food and/or merchandise. All of those employed in these roles could very easily remain in the agriculture, entertainment or goods and services industry in similar or functionally identical roles.
1.5.2.2. Con: [Losing jobs would help Spain create more businesses](https://www.inc.com/sujan-patel/why-a-bad-economy-may-be-the-best-thing-for-your-business.html) and be more creative with their tourist attractions.
1.5.2.3. Con: The loss of jobs should not be a sufficient reason to discontinue an unethical practice.
1.5.2.4. Con: To offset job losses, the government – or the European Union – could offer the newly-unemployed subsidies.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: To help breeders move towards other industries, national governments or the EU could offer subsidies, in the same way as Germany and other countries have subsidised renewable [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Germany).
1.5.2.4.2. Con: Although Spain's economic woes have [improved](http://www.thelocal.es/20161117/no-government-was-no-problem-spains-economy-still-on-the-up) in the last few years, compensating all those involved in bullfighting post-ban would come at a massive cost.
1.5.2.4.3. Con: It would be unlikely that the EU would grant any appreciable subsidy to breeders and fighters transitioning out of an industry that had just been so strongly condemned.
1.5.2.4.3.1. Con: A big portion of EU funds are devoted to [agriculture](http://As a big portion of EU funds are devoted to agriculture, if bullfighting is banned, the EU could help bull breeders to change their sector and not lose their economic means of survival.). If bullfighting is banned, the EU could help bull breeders to change their sector and not lose their economic means of survival.
1.5.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: EU [rural development](http://www.fega.es/en/PwfGcp/en/accesos_directos/desarrollo_rural/index.jsp) projects would also help farmers to re-orient their businesses.
1.5.2.4.3.2. Con: The European Commission has directed substantial effort towards [reskilling programs and policies](https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/publications/strategic-notes/future-work_en#h-5-6).
1.5.2.4.3.3. Con: Given the EU's [support for animal welfare](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/eu-platform-animal-welfare_en), it has an incentive to ensure that the ban on bullfighting goes smoothly, without obvious negative consequences, to ensure that countries remain willing to make such reforms.
1.5.2.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.8.2.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Bullfighting employs more than 10,000 people across Spain. If it were banned, they all would be without work \([p. 12](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)\).
1.5.2.5.1. Con: Bullfighting does not actually employ as many people as one might expect. While there might be 10,000 people employed, the number of full-time jobs it provides in Spain is not even 400 \([p. 12](http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honors_theses)\).
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.5.4. Con: Tourist may choose to stay away from bullfighting countries because they are against it. So maybe it would be more beneficial financially to ban it.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Some [organizations](https://www.change.org/p/spanish-tourism-stop-promoting-cruel-bullfighting) and travel insurers compel [tourist](https://www.columbusdirect.com/content/how-can-tourists-visiting-spain-help-end-bullfighting/) to not [attend](http://www.banbloodsports.com/ln150901.htm) bullfighting or avoid spending money in accommodations, restaurants or shops that promote bullfighting.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Recent [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269285581_Bullfighting_and_Tourism) seem to point out that while tourism initially boosted bullfighting in Spain, it is nowadays an "ambivalent tourist attraction, of declining attractiveness".
1.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.1.
1.5.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.3.2.
1.5.5. Con: Moral considerations are generally taken into account when making economic decisions.
1.5.5.1. Pro: So can slave labour. Benefitting a national economy does not absolve a practice from being inherently cruel, not to mention morally questionable or wrong.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Qatar is building its installations for the World Cup with questionable quasi-slavery [practices](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/modern-day-slavery-in-focus+world/qatar), which will no doubt benefit its economy in 2022.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Various industries are billion dollar industries. But at the same time, they can be unethical, or dangerous for human health or environment \(arms, tobacco, nuclear...\). Ethic should be more important than money.
1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.3.
1.5.7. Pro: [Bullfighting](https://www.toroshopping.com/en/) [merchandise](https://www.cafepress.com/+bullfighting+gifts) is sold.
1.5.7.1. Con: Anti-bullfighting [merchandise](https://www.redbubble.com/people/huzan/works/22525505-ban-bullfighting?cat_context=all-departments&grid_pos=3&p=classic-tee&rbs=95d35624-435f-4ee6-8a0a-bcc62bb4dd76&ref=shop_grid&searchTerm=bullfighting) is also sold.
1.5.7.2. Con: Merchandise could still be sold to commemorate past culture after an eventual ban.
1.5.7.3. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.5.7.4. Pro: Bullfighting merchandise would not exist without bullfighting.
1.5.8. Con: Instead of benefiting national economies, bullfighting receives [substantial](http://www.greens-efa.eu/legacy/fileadmin/dam/Documents/Studies/Environment_health/2013-5%20Bullfighting%20subsidies%20report.pdf) subsidies.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Public money given to bullfighting can be employed for other social needs. For example, a small Spanish town that dedicated [€18,000](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/27/villafranca-de-los-caballeros-bullfight-subsidy-books-school-supplies) to bullfighting festivities could instead use them to fund school supplies.
1.5.8.1.1. Pro: Regional governments in Spain have already begun [to shift funds from bullfighting to education](http://www.newstalk.com/The-business-of-bullfighting:-A-Spanish-moneymaker-or-drain-on-taxpayers) - in the case of A Coruña, based in part on the "cruel spectacle" of the sport.
1.5.8.2. Pro: This [document](http://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063446f764c324679626d56304c334e706447567a4c31684a53556c4d5a5763765130394e4c7a6444515530765247396a6457316c626e52766330466a64476c32615752685a4756446232317063334e68627938344f5445304d7a59775a4330775a4445774c54526b5a6a67744f575a6a4f5330775a6d4a6c5a6d4d305a5464684d7a4d756347526d&fich=8914360d-0d10-4df8-9fc9-0fbefc4e7a33.pdf&Inline=true) displays some examples of subsidies granted to tauromachic events between 2009 and 2015 held in Portugal.
1.5.8.3. Pro: In Portugal, public money is granted to support bullfight via both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Culture. It could be argued that this money should be spent in other areas rather than to support a practice that does not gather a national consensus nor adds a real economical benefit.
1.5.8.4. Pro: Subsided animal cruelty sends the message to future generations that it is alright to torture a living being for entertainment.
1.5.8.5. Pro: Very often, bullfighting lives only through public investment. While it moves a lot of people and generates a lot of money, it's frequently not economically sustainable. The allocation of public funds to such a controversial sport over other, more constructive cultural practices, would be preferable in the long term.
1.5.8.6. Con: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.8.2.
1.5.8.7. Pro: From 2009 to 2011, the public broadcaster televised bullfighting, paying [€9 million](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldiario.es%2Fzonacritica%2Foscuro-mantenimiento-tauromaquia_6_138296187.html) of taxpayers' money for the rights. Tendido Cero, a program \(which started in 1986\) specialising in bullfighting, costs around a €1 million per year and has a quite small audience.
1.5.8.7.1. Con: Public institutions invest in sectors that they deem worthy of preservation, regardless of their audiences. [Cinema](http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2004/8/article12.en.html), for instances, have always been subsidized.
1.5.8.8. Pro: Spanish MPs presented a report in the European Parliament estimating the amount of public money devoted to bullfighting is [€571 million](http://www.greens-efa.eu/legacy/fileadmin/dam/Documents/Studies/Environment_health/2013-5%20Bullfighting%20subsidies%20report.pdf). Their conclusion was that bullfighting would be “on the brink of the financial collapse and unable to subsist” without the public subsidies.
1.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.6.
1.5.10. Con: In India and France, bullfighting is of marginal economic relevance.
1.5.10.1. Con: India and France cannot be equated to Spain.
1.5.10.1.1. Pro: The assumption that a solution designed for one culture will apply to all others is false
1.5.10.2. Pro: The main economic victims of the bullfighting ban in India were [regional bull breeders](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/slipping-hold-jallikattu-ban-threatens-indigenous-cattle-breeds-rural-livelihoods-tamil-nadu/3) in just one province.
1.5.10.2.1. Pro: The recent protests to re-legitimize jallikattu in Tamil Nadu were carried out on [purely cultural grounds.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-38687248)
1.5.10.2.2. Pro: Even [conspiracy theories](http://lessonsoflifelol.blogspot.kr/2016/01/jallikattu-ban-ruthless-conspiracy-by.html) that see the bullfighting ban as western attempt to conquer the Indian dairy industry cannot point to widespread economic consequences.
1.6. Con: Bullfighting is a sport and therefore should be legal.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.1.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Sport is good for health, so every sporting activity, like bullfighting, should be encouraged.
1.6.2.1. Con: Bullfighting is actively performed only by a negligibly small share of the population in countries where it is popular. It has therefore no public health benefits.
1.6.2.2. Con: Running is healthy. People can run as a sport. Running with the aim of torturing an animal isn't a sport. If we called murder a sport because it may include running, that would not make it right.
1.6.2.3. Con: An activity being good for the physical health of one who practices it, does not justify that activity being legal or encouraged. If someone runs after someone and kills them, they will not be excused because the act of killing involved running and running is good for their health.
1.6.2.4. Con: Participating in sport is good for health, but bullfighting is largely a spectator sport, meaning that very few people gain any health benefit from it.
1.6.2.5. Con: Bullfighters are considered «artists» or «Masters» by themselves. Bullfighting is in fact originally a [ritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting#History) in where a man, sacrifice animals in behalf of his god.
1.6.3. Con: Other sports have limits on their violence \([p. 12](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-6630-8_2#page-1)(Although this statement was extreme and clearly incorrect given that MMA partici-pants were rarely if ever killed by a competitor, it is true that MMA in its original incarnation was fairly brutal. At the time, the rules of the match allowed for any-thing except for eye gouging and biting, and the fight ended when an opponent was knocked out or by a judge’s decision. In response, the competition was banned from all but three states. After regulating its matches by introducing more than 31 fouls and 8 ways to end a bout, the UFC found its way back into the public spotlight.)\). Bullfighting ends with death.
1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.
1.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.4.
1.6.4. Con: Even if an activity is classified as a sport it does not follow that it should therefore be legal. Other activities classified as sports are also illegal.
1.6.4.1. Con: Other [illegal sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_sports), such as street racing, come with significant liabilities to uninvolved third parties. This is not the case with bullfighting.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: The bull is not a willing participant, therefore it  be considered a third party.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: Bullfighting comes with significant liabilities to both involved parties. While human participation is voluntary and the liability can therefore be ignored, no such claim can be made about bulls.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: Bulls are injured and killed doing an activity which they are forced to do. Had the human been in bull's position, it would be classified as torture and murder. This is a clear case of [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism).
1.6.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.6.2.
1.6.5. Con: The bioethical and animal right's ideals must prevale before the sports and pleasure of a collective or individual.
1.6.6. Pro: Bullfight is both sport and art.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.6.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.7.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Bullfighting occurs naturally. If a man were to encounter a bull alone in a field, the [bull](https://www.roysfarm.com/spanish-fighting-bull/) would charge and try to kill the man. Man has taken this and created an artistic event that emphasizes valor while giving the spectator a perspective on the tragedy of life. It is theater where the protagonists risk their lives. It should be appreciated more.
1.6.6.3.1. Con: Bullfighting is not a natural occurrence but an organized practice. Selective breeding has maintained or augmented the [aggression](https://www.roysfarm.com/spanish-fighting-bull/) of the bull. Additionally, bulls are aggressive "especially when solitary or unable to escape” and thus a bull typically raised within a herd in an open and natural environment would likely not be that aggressive and would likely escape and not kill anyone.
1.6.6.3.1.1. Pro: [Research](http://www.animal-protection-consult.com/The_suffering_of_bulls_CAS_Jordi_Casamitjana.pdf) points out that the charging of the bull is not an [attack](http://www.hsi.org/issues/bullfighting/facts/aggression_in_bulls.html) "but as a way to push away the attackers, to avoid the adverse situation".
1.6.6.3.2. Con: Natural doesn't automatically mean good. It's a [Logical Fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature)
1.6.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.
1.6.7. Con: Some TV episodes have antagonists kidnap humans and hunt them for sport. Sports definition is along the lines of 'competition involving physical exertion and skill.', arguably every theft and murder can be considered a sport and definitely every war.
1.6.8. Con: Bullfighting is not a common sport, but rather a cruel [blood sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sport) involving the killing of animals for human pleasure.
1.6.8.1. Pro: Bullfighting is not an ordinary sport, but rather an archaic spectacle that is reminiscent of the gladiator fights in ancient times.
1.6.8.1.1. Con: The archaic nature of a custom arguably gives it greater value as a symbol of a people's heritage.
1.6.8.1.1.1. Con: Same could be said of burning witches on a stake, enslaving people, having gladiators fight each other to the death. Just because something was part of a culture in the past, that doesn't make it good.
1.6.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.6.8.2. Con: Killing animals for food is killing for pleasure, too.
1.6.8.2.1. Pro: If one finds enslaving, killing, dismembering, and eating animals acceptable, it is bizarre to claim to care for their well-being.
1.6.8.2.1.1. Pro: We should stop killing high-sentience animals such as mammals. That however does not mean we don't care about them suffering without reason when the suffering involved in their death is negligible in comparison.
1.6.8.2.2. Con: In bullfighting, the pleasure is derived from the act of killing. This is not the same in killing animals for food.
1.6.8.3. Pro: Bullfighting is like any other kind of animal fighting where the animal is forced to fight to the death for entertainment at the painful expense of the animal's life: therefore it is not sport, it is animal cruelty.
1.6.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.8.3.3.6.2.
1.6.9. Con: It cannot be regarded a real sport as the fight lacks [fairness](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness), as there is very little chance the bullfighter would be injured before the bull.
1.6.9.1. Con: The competition is between bullfighters and not between bulls and bullfighter. Between different bullfighters there is fairness.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: The bulls are unwilling participants, to whom fairness is not shown. Regardless of whether there is fairness between other participants, this makes it an unfair activity, and thus unsporting.
1.6.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.6.9.3. Pro: In the rare cases that a bull survives a bullfight, it is immediately [retired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-style_bullfighting#Stage_3_.E2.80.93_Tercio_de_Muerte) as too dangerous an opponent for future fights, as it will have learned from the experience. The entire activity relies on one participant - the bull - having no experience of the event or understanding of what is taking place, and the other participant having substantial support and training.
1.6.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.2.1.1.
1.6.9.5. Pro: When and rarely the bull kills the fighter, the bull is still killed. Bullfighting is never an equal fight. Therefore, it cannot be considered a sport.
1.6.9.6. Pro: Bullfighting is not sport. Sports involve competition between two or more consenting parties and the mediation of a referee.
1.6.9.6.1. Con: -> See 1.6.9.1.
1.6.9.6.2. Con: There are many types of sports which do not require a competition between two consenting parties, e.g. the first ascents of rock walls by extreme climbers.
1.6.9.6.2.1. Con: Rockclimbing and the like still don't involve any non-consenting parties, unlike bullfighting.
1.6.9.6.2.2. Con: Extreme rockclimbers are competing with each other - to scale more challenging rock walls than others do, or to scale them faster.
1.6.9.7. Pro: The animal does not choose to partake in the activity. So one could argue that if you are thrown into a boxing ring without consenting \(and get beaten up badly\) it's a crime.
1.6.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.6.9.9. Pro: If bullfighting was fair, the number of bullfighters and bulls that die in the ring would be equal.
1.6.9.9.1. Con: -> See 1.6.9.1.
1.6.9.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.2.1.1.
1.6.9.9.3. Pro: The \(Spanish-style\) bull fighting system is skewed in favour of the matadors. The World Society for the Protection of Animals estimates that around [250,000](http://iberianature.com/spain_culture/tag/how-many-bullfighters-have-been-killed/) bulls are killed each year in bullfights \(Spain, Portugal, France, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela\). And only 52 matadors have been killed in the arena since 1700.
1.6.10. Con: The bullfighting education organisation [Aficionados International](http://www.aficionados-international.com/myths-about-bullfighting/what-happens-bullfighter-injured) itself acknowledges that bullfighting "is not a sport in the first place".
1.6.11. Pro: The bullfighter shares the need for intelligence, physical fitness and coordination with most other athletes.
1.6.11.1. Con: So would a practitioner of human hunting or a thief planing a high-stake heist. The skills alone do not make a sport.
1.7. Pro: Bullfighting, as a [male-dominated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gored-female-matador-says-its-the-sexism-in-bullfighting-that-makes-her-see-red-9955952.html) sport, reinforces harmful gender stereotypes.
1.7.1. Con: Other male-dominated sports, such as American football, are not prohibited.
1.7.1.1. Con: Male-dominated sports are flexible in allowing women. Even in countries like Iraq, women and girls are training to be [wrestlers](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/world/middleeast/05wrestle.html). Women's boxing was included as an event in the [2012 Olympics](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/08/13/olympics.2012.london.women.boxing/).
1.7.1.2. Pro: In the same vein, some disciplines are widely accepted to include only women, for example Synchronised Swimming and Rhythmic Gymnastics at the Olympics.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: There is an increasing movement to establish male leagues in [each](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmic_gymnastics#Men.27s_rhythmic_gymnastics) [of](http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/19/russia-pushes-to-add-mens-rhythmic-gymnastics-to-olympics/) [these](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33566335) [sports](http://www.slate.com/blogs/five_ring_circus/2016/08/15/male_synchronized_swimmers_belong_in_the_olympics_they_could_be_there_in.html).
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: Indeed, in the case of [sychronised swimming](http://www.slate.com/blogs/five_ring_circus/2016/08/15/male_synchronized_swimmers_belong_in_the_olympics_they_could_be_there_in.html), men were equally involved at its onset, before the genders were separated for modesty reasons, and lack of participant interest in the male league led to its collapse.
1.7.1.3. Con: Perhaps they should also be banned, if they are similarly reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.
1.7.1.4. Con: American football has recently seen the [first female player](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/13/us/vanderbilt-sarah-fuller-first-woman-score-power-five-spt-trnd/index.html) on an otherwise male team an college level.
1.7.2. Con: Male-dominated sports have been captured by women and been transformed into a tool to fight gender stereotypes.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Those who are the first women in a male-dominated sport, such as [Jackie Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Mitchell) in baseball, act to inspire future generations of women.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Sports such as baseball do not rely on inherently violent or otherwise morally problematic activities. This is why trailblazers can inspire future generations. But there is nothing inspiring about being the first to engage in violent or otherwise immoral acts.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Mexican bullfighter [Karla de los Angeles](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gored-female-matador-says-its-the-sexism-in-bullfighting-that-makes-her-see-red-9955952.html) aims to perform well in order to eradicate sexism in bullfighting.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Gender marking, e.g. a different visual representation of women and men, is not present in the fight of female bullfighter [Cristina Sanchez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qFwSM8QLIE).
1.7.2.4. Con: [Female bullfighters](http://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/world/spain-s-female-bullfighters-fight-men-too.html) often complain about fighting sexism within bullfighting circles, in addition to fighting bulls.
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: Female bullfighters - such as Beatriz [Romero](http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/During-1950s-woman-excelled-in-a-toro-s-world-5024489.php), Joaquina [Ariza](http://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/world/spain-s-female-bullfighters-fight-men-too.html) or Cristina [Sánchez](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-30/news/mn-19914_1_female-matador) - have proved their mastery in the arena, yet they have endured [sexism](http://www.pbs.org/pov/matador/background/) in the form of fewer bookings, less payment, and less recognition, among other issues.
1.7.3. Con: There are no separate categories for men and women in bullfighting.
1.7.3.1. Con: This might well be a result of the absence of women in the sport. Where there are no women, there is no need for a separate category of women's bullfighting.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: If there are no women in the sport, the cause of that should be questioned. It may be driven by hostility of the sport towards women, or a lack of opportunities being provided to women to participate.
1.7.4. Pro: The town of [Astorga](https://translate.google.co.kr/translate?hl=de&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fastorgaredaccion.com%2Fnot%2F9312%2Fque-se-retire-el-cartel-de-la-novillada-en-homenaje-a-la-mujer-espanola%2F&sandbox=1) promoted a bullfighting festivity in honour of “the Spanish Women”, in which women \(and children under 8\) could enter for free, as long as they went with someone holding a ticket \(a man\). This is an initiative that equates women to children and uses them as a tactic to increase attendance.
1.7.5. Pro: Historically, women have been left out of bullfighting as active subjects. Participation in the practice has been [forbidden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchita_Cintr%C3%B3n) for women in different [times](http://www.pbs.org/pov/matador/background/) throughout Spanish history.
1.7.5.1. Pro: In the first volumes of the Cossío \(the most important bullfighting encyclopaedia, which continues to be updated and revised\) out of 4,125 pages, only 11 are dedicated to women and only under comical shows, ignoring [pioneers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_bullfighters) like Conchita Cintrón or Juanita Cruz \([p. 3-4](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibliotoro.com%2Fhiper%2FPDF%2520LA%2520PRESENCIA%2520DE%2520LA%2520MUJER%2520EN%2520EL%2520MUNDO%2520DE%2520LOS%2520TOROS.pdf&edit-text=&act=url)\).
1.7.5.2. Pro: For centuries, women could only be eye-candy for male spectators or the bullfighter's suffering mother or wife \([p. 36](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibliotoro.com%2Fhiper%2FPDF%2520LA%2520PRESENCIA%2520DE%2520LA%2520MUJER%2520EN%2520EL%2520MUNDO%2520DE%2520LOS%2520TOROS.pdf&edit-text=&act=url)\).
1.7.5.3. Con: There are currently no discussions to forbid women's participation in bullfighting.
1.7.6. Pro: When the Indian Supreme Court banned jallikattu \(bullfighting\) in Tamil Nadu, animal rights activists like Tamil actress Trisha faced [misogynist attacks](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/jallikattu-issue-turns-ugly-misogynistic-attack-actor-trisha-tells-you-just-how-much-55668) by fans. The male actors who took a similar stand were not targeted by the protesters.
1.7.6.1. Con: This may have nothing to do with bullfighting specifically, as high-profile women who take public stances on political issues generally receive [sub​stantial amounts of abuse and threats](https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/aug/28/online-abuse-of-female-journalists-is-also-a-threat-to-press-freedom).
1.7.6.1.1. Con: The issues where women face mysoginist attacks are generally those where there is a masculinity ethos, i.e., those where qualities such as strenght are valued over ethical qualities like kindness and compassion. Therefore, even though it is very common to see this kind of attack happening in many issues, bullfighting seems to be prone to this kind of attack.
1.7.7. Con: Bullfighting could easily become more inclusive for women in the future. The current situation is no reason to outright ban the sport.
1.7.7.1. Pro: If female bullfighters are successful, as some were in the [1990s](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hvMl-lPozdAJ:https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19981801917+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=de), there will be pressure to change the traditional male-dominated narratives of bullfighting.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.5.1.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.4.1.
1.7.7.2. Pro: For example, in Portugal, there are two parts of the bullfight, one where the bullfighter on a horse puts some kind of sticks in the bull, the other where the 'forcados' stop the bull by immobilizing him. In the first category there are many famous female bullfighters and almost always is there a woman fighting, in the second, there is less representation, but there are female groups of 'forcados'.
1.7.8. Con: An activity being primarily done by men does not necessarily mean that it reinforces gender stereotypes.
