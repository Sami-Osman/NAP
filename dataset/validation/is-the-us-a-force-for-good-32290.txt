Discussion Name: Is the US a force for good?

1. The US is not a force for good.
1.1. Pro: The US [allows its citizens to bear arms,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms_in_the_United_States) which poses a risk to innocent people - such as schoolchildren.
1.1.1. Pro: These is a [rapid rise](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180419131025.htm) in mass shooting incidents within the United States.

1.1.1.2. Pro: From [2009-2019](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/07/us/ten-years-of-school-shootings-trnd/), there has been 180 school shootings in the US, involving 356 innocent victims.
1.1.1.3. Pro: From 1999 to 2014, the [average number of days between shootings](https://www.kunc.org/post/are-school-shootings-becoming-more-frequent-we-ran-numbers#stream/0) was 124 days. From 2015 to 2018, the average was 77 days.
1.1.2. Con: There are [reasonable limitations](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/criminal/the-second-amendment-and-the-right-to-bear-arms.html) that follow the right to bear arms in the US, which eliminates the risk of innocent people being harmed.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Federal law in the US outlaws the possession of firearms or ammunition by [convicted felons](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/criminal/the-second-amendment-and-the-right-to-bear-arms.html).
1.1.2.2. Pro: Under [18 U.S.C. § 922\(g\)](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/criminal/the-second-amendment-and-the-right-to-bear-arms.html), people who’ve been committed to a psychiatric institution or labeled mentally ill under a court ruling do not have the right to bear arms.
1.1.3. Con: [Venezuela](https://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/) is a prime example of how ‘gun bans’ can be used against the population not only by the government, but criminal agents as well.

1.2. Con: The US has helped various countries economically.
1.2.1. Con: US [intentionally imposes poverty](https://borgenproject.org/economic-sanctions-and-poverty/) on [foreign civilians](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/iran-sanctions-humanitarian-crisis/) using [sanctions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387816300177).

1.3.1.1. Con: The human rights violations of other groups or nations are irrelevant to the repeated violations made by USA.
1.3.1.2. Con: Considering the USA net good does not change the suffering inflicted on others for corporate profit.

1.3.2.1. Con: This is not true. Americans [rarely get convicted](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/10/the-crimes-of-seal-team-6/) on war crimes they absolutely did commit.

1.3.2.3.1. Pro: The USA supports and sells weapons to [The Saudi Arabian Royal Family](https://nypost.com/2017/07/05/inside-the-lavish-brutal-world-of-saudi-arabias-royal-family/) who are [notorious human rights violators.](https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-human-rights-violations-atrocities-before-jamal-khashoggi-2018-10#funding-global-terrorism-1)

Pro: From 2002-2007, as part of the War on Terror, CIA personnel employed so-called "[Enhanced interrogation techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_violations_by_the_CIA#Torture_and_rendition)", a variety of coercive and abusive interrogation techniques that are widely judged to constitute torture.

1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: In [2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/washington/11detain.html), Red Cross investigators concluded in a report that the CIA's interrogation methods for high-level al Qaeda prisoners constituted torture which could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes.

1.3.5. Pro: The US government has massacred its own citizens on multiple occasions [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE#1985_bombing) [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre) [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre) [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain).

1.3.8.1. Con: [Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States) show that a low percentage of police brutality claims have merit.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: Other [studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States) have shown that most police brutality goes unreported and the process of filing a complaint is difficult and often intimidating.
1.3.8.2. Con: Most people [feel safe when living or visiting](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/united-states-travel-safety/) the US. It's criminals who live in fear of the police.

1.3.11. Pro: The US government supports terrorism/acts of terrorism.
1.3.11.1. Pro: The United States has at various times in recent history provided support to terrorist and paramilitary organizations around the world.

Con: It was [necessary for the US](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=YJ7ZBGy0wsIC&pg=PA397&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) to engage in such support in order to destabilize political movements that were aligned with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, where the US faced a threat towards its democratic and liberal ideals.

1.3.11.2.1. Pro: The United States has a [long history](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy) of selling weapons to nations where the immediate risks of those weapons being used for aiding terrorism were obvious.

1.3.11.6.1. Con: The fact that US Government is different from terrorist organizations in one way doesn't mean it can not fit under the definition.
