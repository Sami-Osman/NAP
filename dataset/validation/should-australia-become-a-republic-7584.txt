Discussion Name: Should Australia become a republic?

1. Australia should become a republic.
1.1. Con: [Constitutional monarchies](https://www.britannica.com/topic/constitutional-monarchy) tend to lead to much [more politically stable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/) nations on average.
1.1.1. Pro: According to the global [political stability index](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/) of the World Bank, 3 European monarchies are in the top 10, 6 in the top 40, and all 11 in the top 80.
1.1.1.1. Con: Liechtenstein, Andorra and Luxembourg are also [primarily micro-states](http://www.morality2.com/morality2/europes-microstates-showing-us-the-future-of-europe.html), so could be seen as 'oddities'.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: These countries' limited human and natural resources have lead to the development of specific economic policies to make up for it, including extremely [low taxation](https://all-andorra.com/taxes-europe/) and openness to foreign investment.  These are likely to have contributed to the countries' stability to a greater degree, and cannot necessarily be translated to other monarchies in larger countries.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Andorra's [Corporation Income Tax](https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/tax-rates-online/corporate-tax-rates-table.html) is 10%, while Liechtenstein's is 12.5% and [Switzerland](http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/Switzerland-Corporate-Taxes-on-corporate-income)'s is 8.5%. All are much lower than Spain's 25% or Belgium's 33.9%.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: [Corporation Income Tax](https://all-andorra.com/taxes-europe/) in Luxembourg \(22.05%\) is higher than in The Netherlands' \(20%\).
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: [Standard VAT](http://www.uscib.org/valueadded-taxes-vat-ud-1676/) in Andorra \(4.5%\), Liechtenstein \(8%\), Switzerland \(8%\) and Luxembourg \(15%\) are all lower than in the UK \(20%\), Spain \(21%\) and Norway \(25%\).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Microstates form institutional relationships with larger protectorates to guarantee their political and economic viability; relationships that are dependent on the countries' [small size.](http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf)
1.1.1.2. Pro: According to the political stability index, Australia lowest ranking since 2000 has been [0.86](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Australia/wb_political_stability/), which puts it safely in the ranking of a politically stable country.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The monarch changes less frequently than a president would, leading to more stability throughout time.
1.1.2. Con: Monarchies are not inherently stable. For example, [monarchies elsewhere in the world are notoriously unstable](http://www.middleeasteye.net/essays/arab-monarchies-and-illusion-stability-7545029).
1.1.3. Con: The stability of European parliamentary monarchies does not come from the monarchy, but rather the other governmental institutions.
1.1.3.1. Con: By a similar logic, one can argue that the stability of republics lays in a place other than the republican system itself - as, for instance, the degrees of social peace, social equality, democratic and civic culture of citizens, etc.
1.1.3.2. Pro: European [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession) shows that monarchies have been [often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_succession) [overthrown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession), and have faced turbulence, which has resulted in quick changes in policy and foreign affairs. Current European monarchies are supported by democracy and those democracies are typically stable, giving the illusion that monarchies are stable.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Most of these nations are in Europe, which is the second stablest and [richest continent](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/books/chapters/0325-1st-eich.html) in the world \(after North America\).
1.1.4. Pro: Although their power is largely symbolic, in a constitutional monarchy, should the democratically elected government falter badly, the monarchy or its designate acts as an enduring and ostensibly incorruptible backstop until a new government can be formed.
1.1.4.1. Con: Although monarchs have the power, in practice they are not the people who intervene in the case of a failing government. [In constitutional monarchies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/), more often that not, new elections are called in the event of a failing government whereas in republics, it is often the president that takes on the ability to dissolve a government by choosing a non-electoral replacement.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: In the event of a failing government, early elections are twice as common in constitutional monarchies than in republics with elected presidents, where 49% of the time they are dealt with via [cabinet reshuffling instead.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/)
1.1.4.2. Pro: Unlike a presidency, the [monarch](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/09/europe/royal-brexit-neutrality/index.html) is apolitical so they cannot be dragged into taking sides in politics.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The Queen has been dragged into [UK politics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/21/queen-above-politics-not-when-cameron-and-johnson-come-calling), and so could equally be into Australian politics.
1.1.5. Pro: Constitutional monarchies tend to be [more egalitarian](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2018/release/the-case-for-constitutional-monarchies) than other forms of government.
1.2. Pro: Australia needs a unique national identity that is not defined by Britain.
1.2.1. Pro: Australia is multicultural. Britain is only one of many nations from which immigration has occurred.
1.2.1.1. Con: Despite intensive immigration, currently, between [85% to 92%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians) of the Australian population is of European decent.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: European descent does not equal British descent.
1.2.1.2. Con: There is no reason why monarchies cannot be multicultural; the two are not mutually exclusive.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Australia's successful multiculturalism is [an essential part](https://mckellinstitute.org.au/research/articles/why-australia-is-the-worlds-most-successful-multicultural-society/) of its identity today. Holding onto the monarchy detracts from the present.
1.2.1.4. Pro: [One in four](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/education/face-facts-cultural-diversity#:~:text=Australia%20is%20a%20vibrant%2C%20multicultural,one%20of%20our%20greatest%20strengths.) Australians are born overseas.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Britain has an overwhelming claim on Australia that is not representative of the fact that Australians originate from many countries, not just Britain.
1.2.2. Con: Australia already has a unique national identity that is not defined by any single agent such as Britain. Shared perception of history, e.g. former ties with Britain, is an important ingredient but it doesn't prevent from having a unique identity.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Australia has assimilated many different cultures and traditions in order to create its identity as a multicultural country.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Multiculturalism became an important aspect of Australian identity as early as the [1960s.](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1011/11rp06#_Toc275248118)
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Discrimination has been [on the rise](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/29/australia-still-embraces-multiculturalism-but-fracture-lines-are-deepening) in Australia.
1.2.3. Pro: The Union Jack being in the top left corner of the Australian Flag is an indication of a foreign influence on our current national identity. Becoming a Republic would allow Australians a great opportunity to replace that with Australian-specific symbolism.
1.2.3.1. Con: There is no guarantee that the [flag](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-28/35542) would change if Australia became a monarchy.
1.2.3.2. Con: Australian soldiers fought and died for that flag. Changing it would be disrespectful.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Australian soldiers fought and died for their country. For their families and friends. For duty and honour. For freedom. Not for a piece of fabric.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Australia has already changed it. The blue ensign only became the Australian national flag in 1954. The ANZACS fought under the red ensign.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Having the British flag in the top left corner of Australia's flag symbolises that Australia is under British rule. If Australia is truly self-governing it should have a flag that symbolises that.
1.2.3.4. Con: The flag can be changed without becoming a republic
1.2.4. Con: Australian national identity has inevitably been defined by its historic relationship with Britain. To remove it would be to try to remove Australia's history.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The monarchy allows some Australians to feel like their cultural connection to the British isles is maintained.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Australian soldiers have [fought](https://www.awm.gov.au/visit/exhibitions/1918/soldier/tommy) for Australia and for the Crown, and to dissolve the connection of Australia to the Monarchy is to disrespect the memory of those who have died in battle.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Many of these soldiers fought under the flag of [Australia](https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/atwar/first-world-war), and so they would not be disrespected by annulling the relationship between the monarchy and Australia.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The flag they fought under contained the Union Jack in the top left, so it was also an indication of the connection to the monarchy.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: There are widespread cultural differences between Australia and Britain.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Many Australians experience [culture shock](https://www.escape.com.au/destinations/europe/uk/an-australians-guide-to-british-culture-shock/news-story/da2b36520f376731cea7c71460c33249) when they visit Britain.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Today, Australian culture is [more similar](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/the-americanisation-of-australian-political-culture,13343) to that of America than it is to that of Britain.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: Australian culture has been adopting American elements since [the end of World War 2](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/the-americanisation-of-australian-political-culture,13343), indicating that the cultural connection to the British Isles stopped being maintained a long time ago.
1.2.4.1.4. Con: For Australians without a British cultural or ethnic background, including Indigenous Australians, Asian Immigrants, etc. this could be seen as a British cultural connection being "imposed", rather than "maintained". This could have positive or negative connotations depending on the specific Australian.
1.2.4.2. Con: The US is similarly tied to Britain historically, and yet despite being an independent republic its historical ties to Britain have not been forgotten or devalued.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: US and UK [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom–United_States_relations#Culture_and_media) both have heavy influences over each other.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: American diplomatic publications still [argue that](https://uk.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/) "the United States has no closer ally than the United Kingdom".
1.2.4.3. Pro: Australia's inception [lies in the decision](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/australia-day#:~:text=On%20January%2026%2C%201788%2C%20Captain,South%20Wales%2C%20effectively%20founding%20Australia.&text=Cursed%20with%20poor%20soil%2C%20an,difficulty%20keeping%20the%20men%20alive.) by the British to found a penal colony.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Australia's inception lies in [the arrival of humans from Southeast Asia 50,000 years ago](https://www.science.org/content/article/who-were-first-australians-and-how-many-were-there). The founding of a colony by Britain was a very recent event.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: To claim that this event was the inception of Australia, is an example of the British-dominated narrative described in the parent claim.
1.2.4.4. Con: Australia has been [loosening its ties](https://theconversation.com/no-longer-tied-to-britain-australia-is-still-searching-for-its-place-in-the-world-70407) with Britain since the end of World War 2.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Australia signed the [ANZUS treaty](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/anzus) in 1951 when it realized it could not rely solely on Britain and needed to take its security into its own hands.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: In the 1960s and 1970s, Prime Minister Gorton declared Britain [a 'foreign country'](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/seeing-britain-foreign-country-story-australia-house-london) following the differences in strategies adopted by the two countries with regard to the European Economic Commission.
1.2.4.4.3. Pro: The Imperial Strategy of defense that connected Britain to Australia [was substituted](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-uk-and-australia-adapting-a-long-standing-relationship/) by a military alliance with the US in 1951.
1.2.4.4.4. Con: There have been efforts to restrengthen this relationship in recent times.
1.2.4.4.4.1. Pro: Australia and the UK signed a new [defense treaty in 2013](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/new-defence-treaty-between-australia-and-uk#:~:text=Australia%20has%20renewed%20its%20defence,in%20Perth%2C%20Lindsey%20Arkley%20reports.&text=The%20historic%20document%20was%20signed,Ministers%20of%20the%20two%20countries.), in which the countries emphasize the strength of their connection and shared goals.
1.2.4.4.4.2. Pro: The creation of a [Space Bridge](https://www.industry.gov.au/news-media/space-bridge-to-link-australia-and-uk-space-industries) is a joint effort to link the space industries of Australia and Britain.
1.2.4.4.4.3. Con: Brexit is likely going [to weaken](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-10/brexit-and-australias-relationship-with-britain/10879914) this relationship, as many of the benefits of the interaction are contingent on Britain's position in the EU.
1.2.4.4.5. Con: Australia and Britain were both part of the [Five Power Defense Arrangement](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/five-power-defence-arrangements-remain-relevant-to-deal-with-todays-security-threats) in 1971, a defense agreement that remains strong and relevant even today.
1.2.4.4.5.1. Pro: Britain signed onto this agreement [primarily to](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27751605.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ac0c5164b52e2f8358861df7c81461230) retain its connection to Australia and as a counter to the earlier rebuke \(in signing the EEC\) to the relationship with Australia \(p. 103\).
1.2.4.4.6. Con: The two countries still have strong economic ties.
1.2.4.4.6.1. Pro: [Most foreign investment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969593103000179) by Australians is directed to Britain.
1.2.4.4.6.2. Pro: In 2019, the UK was [one of the top two](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/investment-statistics/Pages/statistics-on-who-invests-in-australia) investors in Australia.
1.2.4.5. Pro: Australia would no longer be able to compete in, or host, the Commonwealth Games.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: Australia has the [best record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Commonwealth_Games_medal_table) of any country at the Commonwealth Games. Australia would potentially lose this if they could no longer compete.
1.2.4.5.1.1. Con: [In spite](https://theconversation.com/australia-dominated-the-commonwealth-games-so-why-doesnt-it-feel-like-that-94909) of the success of Australian athletes, the public are largely apathetic towards the games.
1.2.4.5.1.2. Pro: Australia has an unrivaled [commitment](https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/australia/articles/australia-dominates-commonwealth-games/) to the Games, being one of only six countries to attend all of them.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: The Commonwealth games [help foster](https://theconversation.com/why-the-commonwealth-games-still-matter-93880) a sense of community and better diplomatic relations with other countries.
1.2.4.5.3. Con: The majority of countries participating in the Commonwealth Games, including hosts, [are republics](https://independentaustralia.net/australia/australia-display/an-australian-republic-and-the-commonwealth-the-truth,3505). Australia would not be rejected based on its choice of political system.
1.2.4.5.4. Con: That is a small price to pay for all of the independence that becoming a republic would give to Australia.
1.2.5. Pro: Australia can struggle internationally as a result of the perception that it is [subservient](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/monarchy-and-australias-image-abroad) to other powers.
1.2.5.1. Con: Most countries view Australia's monarchy as a [historical anomaly](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/monarchy-and-australias-image-abroad).
1.2.5.2. Pro: Australia has to work to make other nations in the region, like Indonesia, convinced of the fact that Australia is more than just an extension of the [West](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/monarchy-and-australias-image-abroad).
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Australia is increasingly looking to deepen ties with Asian countries as their economies grow. As long as the Queen remains the head of state, those countries will question Australia's [commitment](https://republic.org.au/business-network-articles/2018/12/19/the-economic-case-for-a-republic) to the region.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: The issue is ultimately not at the front of the minds of Australia's Asian [trading partners.](https://republic.org.au/business-network-articles/2018/12/19/the-economic-case-for-a-republic)
1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: Australia has negotiated trade deals with many of the region's biggest countries, such as [Malaysia, China, Korea and Japan](https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/Pages/trade-agreements), in spite of not being a republic.
1.2.6. Pro: The colonial era was Australia's infancy, federation was the beginning of its adolescence. Symbolically, the country will not reach maturity until it has its own Sovereign.
1.2.7. Pro: The image of the monarch being on the back of Australian Currency is an indication of a foreign influence on our current national identity. Becoming a Republic would allow Australians a great opportunity to replace that with Australian-specific symbolism.
1.2.8. Con: Becoming a Republic would further the Americanisation of Australia instead of letting it carve out its own unique identity.
1.2.8.1. Con: There is no reason why the USA model is the only alternative available to Australia.
1.2.8.2. Pro: Since the signing of the [US Free Trade Agreement](https://hbr.org/2012/03/fixing-whats-wrong-with-us-politics) in 2004, the Americanisation of Australian culture has accelerated.
1.2.8.3. Con: Australia becoming more similar to America is by choice, not by colonization.
1.2.8.4. Pro: The [state of US politics](https://hbr.org/2012/03/fixing-whats-wrong-with-us-politics) alone indicates the US system, however well designed in theory, should not be copied in practice.
1.2.8.4.1. Pro: The US is ranked among [the worst](https://apnews.com/article/a820cf4ff8351bb9802e7e7a042c85cb) of the Western democracies.
1.3. Con: It is not feasible to redesign Australia's political system.
1.3.1. Con: Incremental updates can be made over a number of years. It doesn't need to be a complete replacement all at once.
1.3.2. Pro: Changing Australia's political system would be very expensive.
1.3.2.1. Con: No longer having to pay [expenses](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/charles-and-camillas-australia-visit-cost-taxpayers-1-million/news-story/9e537abe72068a7d3ca936f497aea78d) of royal visits would eventually pay off the cost of implementing a republic.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The cost of royal visits would be easily eclipsed by the cost of maintaining a president.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The cost of maintaining a president would be equal to the cost of maintaining a Prime Minister.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This still results in twice the expenses when both are present and funded by the taxpayers.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: The cost of the office of the President would be incredibly expensive too. Ireland, a country which replaced the Monarch with a President, will incur [€30 million](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/revealed-how-much-the-office-of-the-president-costs-over-seven-years-36785078.html) of costs for a seven year presidency.
1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Taxpayers have paid almost [$68 million](https://www.ntu.org/foundation/detail/post-presidential-perks-subsidizing-millionaires) since 2000 to support retired presidents.
1.3.2.1.1.4. Pro: It cost [$1.4 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/news/guess-how-much-it-cost-taxpayers-protect-first-family/) to provide security for President Obama in the US during his tenure.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Royal visits promote Australia as a tourist destination, making the expenditure a valid tourism investment.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Tourism in Australia is already an [essential component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Australia) of the Australian economy. Royal visits are not needed to promote tourism to the country.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Royal visits allow Austalia to [showcase](https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/17/what-is-a-royal-tour-why-are-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-in-australia-and-how-long-are-they-down-under-for-8046767/) parts of its country to the world.
1.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: Places visited by the Duke and Duchess in 2014 saw a [41% increase](https://www.news.com.au/national/kate-and-williams-australian-tour-to-boost-tourism-by-tens-of-millions/news-story/784a42cc23be2da66c60638e7c445d19) in interest.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: [In Oct 2011, the cost of a 10-day royal visit was put at $5.85 million.](https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/03/06/royal-rates-what-youll-pay-for-will-and-kates-aussie-adventure/)
1.3.2.2. Pro: [Cost estimates](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-28/35542) range from $250 million to $2.5 billion.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Changing banknotes and coins, changing the names of institutions with 'royal' in their name, and the cost of elections are just some of the [costs](https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/monarchy) that would be incurred.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Many institutions in former British colonies have retained the use of 'royal' in many instances, such as the [Royal College of Surgeons](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/why-do-irish-institutions-still-call-themselves-royal-1.2803336) in Ireland.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: According to one detailed breakdown, the referendum for constitutional change alone would cost nearly [$130 million.](https://norepublic.com.au/republic-audit-costs-of-republicanism-paid-or-payable-by-the-taxpayer/)
1.3.2.2.3. Con: The expenditure of the Australian government was in the region of [$500 billion](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Budget_Office/Publications/Chart_packs/2019-20_Budget_Snapshot) in 2019. $250 million is a small amount of money in that context.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: $250 million, or $2.5 billion, on top of the amount of money the government is already spending, adds to [mounting debt](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-09/federal-budget-2020-debt-deficit-blowout-explained/12741472).
1.3.2.2.4. Con: The estimate of $2.5 billion is less [realistic](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-28/35542) than that of $250 million, with the former having been compiled by a monarchist.
1.3.3. Pro: The replacement system may be worse than the system we have today.
1.3.3.1. Con: There is no reason why this would be the case today, any more than it was when the British imperialists devised the political system years ago.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The present political system, though devised by British imperialists, has been tested and is working well and the envy of many a country.  Making changes, designed by present day political power brokers, puts Australian citizens at risk of an untested political system which may not serve them as well.
1.3.3.3. Con: The general standard of people on this committee will likely be the highest standard of politicians in the government at the time.
1.3.4. Con: A full redesign of the political system is fundamentally unnecessary as the position of the monarch is one which does not have a massive impact on Australian politics.
1.3.4.1. Con: Changing the holder of the office of the head of state is objectively a big political change.
1.3.4.2. Pro: There is [no meaningful role](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=9495A9BDD2964D7DB682C13BFA5D4D1A&_z=z) for the Queen enshrined in the Australian constitution. During the Queen's 1954 visit to Australia, a special Act had to be drafted so she could exercise some power to partake in government processes.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: This would [not resolve questions](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/~/link.aspx?_id=321A4F47DDEE42D7AEBF4C01C689632D&_z=z) such as who possesses the power to dissolve lower houses or the need for a constitutional umpire.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The Prime Minister could become the de facto head of state.
1.3.5. Pro: There is [no need](https://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article/australian-republicans-demand-satisfaction) to change the Australian political system.
1.3.5.1. Con: Waiting until a time of [political crisis](https://republic.org.au/business-network-articles/2018/12/19/the-economic-case-for-a-republic) to go about changing the way the Australian political system is far more unwise.
1.3.5.2. Con: While there may not be a political crisis at the moment, the current system is serving but a [minority](https://independentaustralia.net/australia/australia-display/indigenous-australia-and-an-australian-republic-moving-in-the-same-direction,8681) of privileged Australians.
1.3.5.3. Pro: In 2020 the Australian economy was [outperforming](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/the-australian-economy-outperforms-the-world-but-real-test-to-come-20200624-p555mg.html) that of all other countries in the world.
1.3.5.4. Pro: According to the World Bank, Australia's government is the [ninth most effective](https://theconversation.com/how-efficient-is-australias-public-sector-short-answer-very-19908) one in the world in terms of government effectiveness.
1.3.6. Con: There are good alternative systems that Australia could model itself after as a republic.
1.3.6.1. Pro: There are multiple examples of countries who have transitioned from having the British monarchy as head of state, to a different system.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Countries like [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_Ireland) can serve as an example for how to transition from having the crown as head of state, to a system with a directly elected president.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: The last country that changed from having the Queen as head of state to being a republic was [Mauritius](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/09/16/as-barbados-drops-queen-elizabeth-ii-heres-where-else-the-monarch-is-head-of-state/) in 1992. These examples are no longer analogous to that of Australia due to widespread political, economic, and social changes.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Con: [Barbados](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/09/16/as-barbados-drops-queen-elizabeth-ii-heres-where-else-the-monarch-is-head-of-state/) will be removing the Queen as head of state in 2021. This demonstrates that it is feasible to make such a decision even in today's political climate.
1.3.6.1.2.2. Pro: The GDP of [Mauritius](https://www.worldeconomics.com/GrossDomesticProduct/Mauritius.gdp) in 1992 was roughly $3 billion, while [Australia](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/gdp)'s current GDP is over $1.3 trillion. The situations of the two countries and therefore incomparable.
1.3.6.2. Con: Many democratic republics have experienced [democratic backsliding](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401), and so they should not be emulated.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: Countries like [Hungary](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-no-longer-a-democracy-report/), [Czechia](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/09/calling-on-the-people-to-rekindle-democracys-promise/), and [Brazil](https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2020/08/25/pandemic-brazil-aggravates-democratic-backslide/) are all republics and have experienced democratic backsliding.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: [Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/australias-civil-rights-rating-downgraded-as-report-finds-world-becoming-less-free) is already experiencing democratic backsliding.
1.3.7. Pro: All actors in the current political system of Australia play a critical and irreplaceable role in maintaining the state of affairs of the country.
1.3.7.1. Pro: The Governor-General's position as an unelected representative with limited powers can be instrumental in resolving political crises, such as when elections produce inconclusive results and no government can be formed.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: There is no reason this role couldn't be retained in a republic, while eliminating the foreign Monarchy.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: There are many parliamentary systems around the world that do not have a monarch, let alone a foreign monarch, and yet feature a Presidential figure who plays the same role as a constitutional monarch.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Italy, Ireland, Germany and India are all examples of [parliamentary republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic) that have a ceremonial presidents.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: The Governor-General removed the [Prime Minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1975/nov/12/australia.fromthearchive) from office during the Constitutional Crisis of 1975.
1.3.7.1.3. Con: It it not appropriate for an unelected official to be given so much power.
1.3.7.1.3.1. Pro: If a president is chosen as the head of state, the powers of the Governor-General are [transferred](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/ceremonial-role-by-far-most-important-for-the-president-1.117797) to an elected official.
1.3.7.1.3.2. Con: An unelected official can be free from political interference and be above the brinkmanship which is often seen in parliamentary politics.
1.3.7.1.3.2.1. Con: An unelected official can still have opinions, allegiances and biases which mean that they are susceptible to being influenced one way or another.
1.3.7.1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is an impossible standard to set for any official, elected or otherwise.
1.3.7.1.3.3. Pro: The Governor-General's [role](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-53386554) in sacking Whitlam without as much as informing the Queen in advance highlights the serious potential for misuse of power.
1.3.7.2. Con: Under the status quo, the principle of the separation of powers is undermined as the offices of governor-general, prime minister and parliament are not properly [demarcated](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/07/16/palace-letters-australia-constitution/). This would be fixed in a new system where the roles are clearly defined in the constitution, as opposed to built on custom.
1.3.7.3. Pro: The Queen is a neutral presence that can connect the country despite political differences.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.3.7.3.2. Pro: A President would have to belong to one or the other political party, which may worsen political partisanship.
1.3.7.3.2.1. Pro: Australia currently suffers from one of the [most partisan](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-23/hyper-partisanship-is-killing-two-great-democracies/10152542) governing systems in the world. It is best to stray from actions that could worsen this.
1.4. Pro: The presence of the Monarchy as Head of State undermines the principle of equality as per Australian law.
1.4.1. Pro: Monarchies perpetuate the idea that some individuals are better than others due to heritage.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Western societies have been founded on egalitarian basis.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The motto ["Liberté, égalité, fraternité](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism)" was used during the French Revolution, and lead to the building of Western constitutions, including the Australian one.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: There are always people who are above the rest in society, depending on what society values. These can be politicians, celebrities or business people for example.
1.4.1.2. Con: The idea of privilege and hierarchies borne from birth is not unique to monarchies. It is perpetuated by the very system of capitalism that is currently adopted by Australia.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Hierarchical power is [what generates](https://capitalaspower.com/2018/08/2018-06-fix-capitalist-income-and-hierarchical-power/) capitalist income.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: The [lottery of birth](https://hbr.org/2013/12/the-popes-war-on-capitalism-and-why-rich-kids-stay-rich) can drastically shape the rest of a person's life.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: Capitalism at least allows for some people to adjust their position in society through social mobility.
1.4.1.3. Con: Being a monarch does not make someone better than others. It is simply a symbol of a position that was once [extremely important](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11930839) to the stability of a country.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: A monarch personifies the nation and their very existence holds politicians to a [higher standard.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11930839)
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: The Queen does not personify Australia, but the UK first and foremost, and so the effect on Australian politicians is more than likely negligible.
1.4.1.3.1.2. Con: For it to be true that a monarch personifies the nation, they must have a quality which inherently puts them above everyone else in that nation.
1.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: The power to [dissolve](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter1/Powers_and_Functions_of_the_Governor-General) the parliament hangs over politicians, which forces them to act in the best interests of the country.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: The fact that the monarchy can be a symbol of stability does not negate the inherent pedestal that the monarchy sits upon.
1.4.1.4. Pro: The current monarch can trace her lineage to monarchs who claimed a [divine right](https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/monarchy), which inherently puts the monarch above normal people.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: The [Bill of Rights](https://www.lawteacher.net/acts/bill-of-rights-1689.php) undermined the claim that monarchs governed by divine rule in 1689, and no monarch has claimed this since.
1.4.1.5. Pro: The monarchy creates a system whereby someone is born into a position of inherent wealth and power.
1.4.2. Pro: Catholic individuals are not allowed to become monarchs. This violates the freedom of religion in Australia.
1.4.2.1. Con: Freedom of religion in Australia still allows discrimination in [employment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/14/religious-discrimination-bill-what-will-australians-be-allowed-to-say-and-do-if-it-passes) in certain circumstances.
1.4.2.2. Con: The rules governing the monarchy can be changed to reflect the changing times.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: A [change in the rules of succession](https://theconversation.com/australian-politics-explainer-gough-whitlams-dismissal-as-prime-minister-74148) in 2013 updated a number of outdated laws governing the monarchy.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The rule by which only male heirs could become monarchs [was scrapped](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/world/europe/rule-of-male-succession-to-british-monarchy-is-abolished.html) in 2011.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: The monarchy is unlikely to undergo reform for the benefit of Australia, as its primary role is to rule over the United Kingdom.
1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: The earlier changes [had the approval](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/australia-greets-queen-reforms) of the premiers of each Australian state before they were made. This shows that the monarchy gives due consideration to Australia.
1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: The Queen hosts [biweekly meetings](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/world/prince-charles-tests-positive-to-coronavirus-but-remains-in-good-health/news-story/61ed54b3302f2338f15a43f5fa56a8fe) with the British Prime Minister. Her interaction with the Australian Prime Minister is limited.
1.4.2.2.3.2.1. Con: The Queen has personally visited Australia [sixteen times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_visits_to_Australia).
1.4.2.2.4. Con: The British monarch is also the [Supreme Governor of the Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England), making it impossible for them to identify with any other religion.
1.4.2.3. Pro: [The Act of Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701) decrees that no Roman Catholic can be heir to the throne.
1.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.4.
1.4.2.5. Pro: [22.6% of Australians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Australia) identify as Catholic, making it the largest religion in the country. It is therefore ludicrous that the Head of State is forbidden from identifying with the Catholic religion.
1.4.3. Con: There is a sense of legal equality between the Crown and citizens.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Impediments to suits against the government were removed, and the presumption that government agencies were not bound by legislation has been eroded, such that the Crown is not above the law \([p. 886](http://There is a sense of legal equality between the Crown and citizens, hence impediments to suits against the government were removed, and the presumption that government agencies were not bound by legislation has been eroded \(p. 886\).)\).
1.4.3.2. Con: There is a [general presumption of statutory interpretation](http://g) which says that legislation was not intended to bind the Crown.
1.4.4. Con: The monarch [has been labelled](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop27/c05) a "symbolic head of state". This minor role for Australian political and public life indicates that the monarchy can hardly be said to seriously undermine principles and values such as equality.
1.5. Con: The [referendum in 1999](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_republic_referendum,_1999) showed that the majority of Australians would prefer to maintain the Monarchy.
1.5.1. Con: The last referendum was held more than 20 years ago. It is time to do a new one to determine the will of today's generation.
1.5.1.1. Pro: It is incumbent on democratic institutions to uphold the will of the people. This can only be done if the will of the people is made known through a referendum.
1.5.1.2. Pro: A poll in 2020 showed that [62%](https://www.miragenews.com/new-poll-finds-62-per-cent-of-aussies-want-an-australian-head-of-state/) of Australians supported Australia becoming a republic.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Polls are, arguably, less indicative than a referendum since the opinions voiced there have no consequences.
1.5.1.3. Con: [Support](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/27/australian-support-for-monarchy-has-grown-as-debate-for-republic-revived) for the monarchy was higher in 2016 than it was at the time of the referendum.
1.5.1.4. Pro: In a [representative democracy,](https://www.moadoph.gov.au/democracy/australian-democracy/#:~:text=Australia%20is%20a%20representative%20democracy,way%20that%20is%20uniquely%20Australian.) it is important to uphold the will of the people.
1.5.2. Con: Australians voted against the referendum in 1999 because there were too many other considerations, questions, and problems that had become associated to the dissolution of the Monarchy.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Many Australians [were confused](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/from-the-archives-1999-australia-says-no-to-a-republic-20191104-p537bp.html) about what becoming a Republic would entail and thus unwilling to commit to something so tenuous.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The 'No' campaign [confused voters](https://australianelectionstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/Higley-McAllister-Elite-Division-2002.pdf) by claiming that voters would not be voting for a real democracy, but a republic for the elite \(p. 852\).
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Some of the more extreme elements of the ['No' campaign](https://australianelectionstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/Higley-McAllister-Elite-Division-2002.pdf) asserted that Australia becoming a republic would result in it becoming a Weimar-like republic similar to Hitler's Germany \(p. 852\).
1.5.2.2. Con: If people actually had wanted the monarchy gone, they would have put aside semantic differences and voted to abolish the monarchy.
1.5.2.3. Con: A referendum now would likely have other considerations built into it as well.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: The question at the heart of the Republican division was how the new head of state would be chosen. This would still be something that would need to be agreed upon by the people of Australia.
1.5.2.4. Pro: [Widespread distrust](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/6/newsid_2514000/2514833.stm) of politicians was seen as fueling the rejection of the referendum.
1.5.2.5. Pro: The republic referendum [was defeated](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/world/reluctantly-australians-keep-a-bond-to-the-queen.html) due to division among republicans on the method proposed for selection of the president.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: Voting for the referendum [was also](https://www.abc.net.au/archives/80days/stories/2012/01/19/3423918.htm) a vote for Parliament to elect the Head of State. Many people voted against this as opposed to voting for the monarchy in the 1999 referendum.
1.5.2.5.2. Pro: That referendum failed because John Howard \(a monarchist\) [phrased the referendum question](https://www.aec.gov.au/elections/referendums/1999_referendum_reports_statistics/1999.htm) in order to limit the office of head of state to a parliamentary appointment. The Australian public [wanted to elect its own head of state.](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop28/c01)
1.5.3. Pro: [54.87%](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/6/newsid_2514000/2514833.stm) of the votes were against dissolving the monarchy. This is a clear majority.
1.5.3.1. Con: Of all the referendums since the establishment of the federation, this is [thirteenth lowest](https://australianelectionstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/McAllister-Elections-Without-Cues-AusJPS-2001.pdf) 'Yes' vote of a total of 44 \(p. 253\).
1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.
1.5.3.3. Con: Other cases show that public opinion can change quite quickly after a supposedly decisive referendum.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: In 2014, [about 55%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum) of Scots voted in favor of remaining within the UK \(the same share as in Australia's referendum in 1999\). A couple of years later, in 2020, this share dropped [as low as 40%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_Scots_Indep_V6_new_format.pdf) in surveys \(depending on the specific poll\).
1.5.4. Pro: The referendum failed, despite the fact that the royals had been mired in scandals throughout the [1990s](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/24/royal-family-bounced-back-annus-horribilis).
1.6. Pro: In creating a Republic, greater rights and protection can be guaranteed to the Indigenous population.
1.6.1. Con: If one wishes to be mindful of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cause, the monarchy should not be replaced without first dealing with the constitutional issues of [Indigenous peoples.](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/april/1522501200/megan-davis/republic-aboriginal-issue#mtr)
1.6.1.1. Pro: If Australia became a republic, tribal peoples would be forced to cede their [sovereignty](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/april/1522501200/megan-davis/republic-aboriginal-issue#mtr).
1.6.1.1.1. Con: It is unclear why sovereignty would have to be concede sovereignty, and why the necessary agreements couldn't be continued with the new head of state.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Native Title Act of 1993](https://www.auroraproject.com.au/what-native-title) enshrined the rights of Indigenous Australians in law that would outlast the Crown.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: One of the mechanisms by which Indigenous Australians won their sovereignty was through a [legal victory](https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/mabo-case) against the Crown, which said that Indigenous peoples owned the land long before the British invaded. This doctrine could be put at risk if the monarchy was no longer involved in Australian affairs.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Con: The [outcome](https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/australian-history/mabo-native-title/) of this case was the establishment of Native Title which asserted Indigenous peoples' ownership over the land they had lived on for generations, and the abolition of Terra Nullis, the idea that the land had belonged to no one before the British arrived. This is enshrined legal doctrine that would remain past the abolition of the Monarchy.
1.6.1.1.3. Con: If tribal sovereignty was enshrined in a n[ew system of governance](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/1/25/an-australian-republic-could-benefit-aborigines), such that Indigenous peoples did not have to fight for their rights, then becoming a republic would be better for the Indigenous Australians.
1.6.1.2. Con: The Crown ultimately has provided [no recourse](https://rsj.winchester.ac.uk/article/10.21039/rsj.147/) to Indigenous peoples and so should not be retained on account of the potential for it to help those peoples.
1.6.2. Pro: Retaining the monarchy legitimises the British invasion of Australia and the genocide of Indigenous peoples that took place.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The British monarch's continued role in Australian politics is reminiscent of an imperial age of colonialism that should hold no place in the 21st century.
1.6.2.2. Con: [Genocides](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront) were carried out after Australia had become [independent](http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/commonwealth/history/).
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Having an Australian as a president legitimizes the genocides committed by the state.
1.6.2.3. Pro: [Many genocides](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/britain-and-genocide/) have been committed during the monarchy. Divorcing the monarchy would be a definite step away from this legacy.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: Parting ways with the Monarchy can bring Australia together by serving as a genuine apology to Indigenous people for the atrocities that occurred in the past.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: English colonial terrorism is [largely responsible for](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244013499143) the destruction of the homes and livelihood of the Indigenous Australian community.
1.6.2.3.1.2. Con: Blaming the monarchy for the atrocities against the Indigenous people is a poor attempt to shirk Australia's own share of responsibility in these actions. This is an insult to the Indigenous people and makes it more difficult for the country to move forward.
1.6.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Australia's government has [repeatedly failed](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/12/australian-governments-have-failed-indigenous-peoples-says-oxfam) to enact the policies recommended by the UN on Indigenous issues.
1.6.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: The unjust policies of the Australian government were responsible for the [Stolen Generation.](https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/australian-history/stolen-generations)
1.6.2.3.2. Con: The current monarch took the throne after the last [genocide](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront) by the state.
1.6.3. Pro: The transition to a republic posits a unique opportunity to introducing greater representation and rights for the Indigenous population by opening up space to more easily introduce changes to the Constitution.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.6.3.2. Pro: A republic could include [more representation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/1/25/an-australian-republic-could-benefit-aborigines) of the Indigenous population in parliament. Greater political representation could help create more rights and protections for the community.
1.6.3.3. Pro: The Indigenous population is currently underrepresented in the Australian government. A republic could help rectify this.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: Since 2005, [no Indigenous representatives](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/FedLawRw/2006/9.html) have been present in the federal parliament.
1.6.3.3.2. Pro: Currently, there is [an absence](https://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp23) of a treaty or formal body to define the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
1.6.3.3.3. Pro: The Indigenous population comprises [2.5%](https://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp23#_ftn2) of Australia's total population. This translates to three Indigenous members in the House of Representatives and one senator.
1.6.3.4. Con: It would be more appropriate to move forward with and create measures specifically to cater to the Indigenous population instead of lumping this together with the charge to become a Republic.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Australia will be holding a [referendum](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/world/australia/indigenous-recognition-referendum.html) that specifically deals with the issue of the recognition of the Indigenous community in the constitution.
1.6.3.4.2. Pro: If the referendum to become a republic fails, officials may use this as an excuse to avoid continuing work on Indigenous rights and affairs.
1.6.3.4.3. Con: On its own, it is too difficult to enact constitutional change in Australia.
1.6.3.4.3.1. Pro: An [absolute majority](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/11/australia/australia-indigenous-constitution-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=\(CNN\)%20Two%20years%20after%20the,national%20referendum%20on%20the%20issue.) in both houses of parliament is required in order to approve changes in the constitution.
1.6.4. Con: It is unlikely that any Republic that would come to be would guarantee new protections for Indigenous peoples.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The 1999 referendum on the preamble to the constitution did not include a proposed mention of [indigenous recognition](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/april/1522501200/megan-davis/republic-aboriginal-issue#mtr), which demonstrates that those in charge will not engage in issues of constitutional reform for indigenous peoples.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: This referendum was held twenty years ago, and so perspectives of what should be contained in the preamble of a new constitution could have changed for the better.
1.6.4.2. Pro: A study has shown that [three quarters](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/three-quarters-of-australians-biased-against-indigenous-australians-study-finds) of Australians hold implicit bias against Indigenous people and so constitutional reform would not likely stem from such an environment.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: Implicit Bias does not prevent people from consciously supporting a people group, when clear opportunities are presented.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The Republic plebiscite that Labour is advocating for [does not include](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/14/an-australian-republic-without-a-first-nations-voice-is-just-tokenism) provisions for First Nations voice.
1.6.4.4. Con: The [Indigenous cause](https://time.com/5905168/australia-aboriginal-people-justice/) in Australia is being championed domestically and internationally, such that those creating the Republic will be forced to listen.
1.6.5. Con: Many Indigenous people do not want to be recognized by, or in the founding document of, what they see as a [settler state.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/jul/21/politicians-must-face-the-truth-indigenous-australia-doesnt-accept-symbolic-recognition)
1.7. Pro: Being a republic would award Australia with full political and legal freedom.
1.7.1. Pro: The Australian Constitution contains no power for the federal parliament to legislate with respect to the monarchy \([p. 17](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1943287)\)
1.7.1.1. Con: It was in 1936 that it was decided that Australia could not legislate with respect to the Monarchy. If the matter was at issue now, the state would likely argue that it has an inherent 'nationhood' power to do so \([p. 17](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=351084105114079085067000116117113074037024090008032052023105009111105096092000066011059012033058039112110020092119096093091105103046069078020028003109081103111027007006042075026092013085112073091109093085028121001071122123105077008101094028006001017&EXT=pdf)\).
1.7.2. Pro: The power to [dissolve](https://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_infosheets/infosheet_18_-_double_dissolution) the parliament rests with the Governor-General, the Queen's representative.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Parliament dissolution is an important mechanism \([p. 9](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/dissolution-of-parliament-primer.pdf)\). This power should fall to someone who is elected.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The 1999 referendum would not have instituted a president that was directly elected, but one elected by [parliament](https://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/fast_facts_the_1999_referendum,9546.html).
1.7.2.2. Con: The Crown generally does not dissolve parliament without consulting with the [Prime Minister](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter1/Powers_and_Functions_of_the_Governor-General) first.
1.7.3. Pro: Under the status quo, the [Commander in Chief](http://www.cefa.org.au/ccf/who-australia%E2%80%99s-commander-chief) of the Australian military and navy is the Governor-General.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Tensions can arise between politicians, the Crown, and the armed forces if Australian [politicians](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/29/there-are-obvious-democratic-reasons-for-australia-to-become-a-republic) claim the army as theirs outright.
1.7.3.2. Con: [In practice](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government), the Governor-General is bound by constitutional convention, in almost all instances, to take the advice of the Federal Council.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: The Commander in Chief is the Governor-General, as opposed to the Governor-General in Council, and so there is an element of [personal discretion](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422113620/http://www.gg.gov.au/about-governor-general/governor-general-commander-chief#_ftn17) involved.
1.7.3.2.1.1. Pro: In 1970, the Governor-General refused to authorise the Prime Minister's request for Pacific Islands Regiment peacekeeping mission \([p. 206](https://books.google.ie/books?redir_esc=y&id=zNfV6gBWGswC&q=206#v=snippet&q=206&f=false)\).
1.7.3.2.2. Pro: It would be unwise for a Governor-General to defy the express will of the Government, especially with regards to matters of war, and so it it unlikely the Governor-General would be inclined to ignore the Government.
1.7.3.2.2.1. Con: This makes the country contingent on the good-will of the Governor-General, which is a tenuous position to adopt.
1.7.4. Con: There is no effective difference as the Queen is only a figurehead, with no real power.
1.7.4.1. Pro: The Queen's [only effective powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia) are the appointment of the Governor General, which is done on the advice of the Prime Minister.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: In practice, the Head of State is the [Governor-General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_Australia), who is and often has been an Australian citizen.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: This did not stop foreign intervention in Australia's parliament when Whitlam [was ousted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis).
1.7.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Whitlam [was dismissed by](https://theconversation.com/australian-politics-explainer-gough-whitlams-dismissal-as-prime-minister-74148) John Kerr, an Australian barrister, who was the Governor-General at the time.
1.7.4.1.1.1.2. Con: When [it was requested](https://theconversation.com/australian-politics-explainer-gough-whitlams-dismissal-as-prime-minister-74148) of the Queen to intervene and restore the Whitlam government in 1975, she did not act. Instead, she pointed out that power in truth lay with the governor-general.
1.7.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Governor-General [is tasked with](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/corporate/protocol-guidelines/Pages/1-1-head-of-state-and-governor-general#:~:text=Australia's%20Head%20of%20State%20is,the%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia.) acting as the Queen's representative by the Constitution of Australia, and, as a result, holds all Executive Power.
1.7.4.1.1.3. Con: The Governor-General is not our head of state only a representative of our head of state.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The Australian Constitution limits the [royal prerogatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_prerogative#Australia) that the Monarch would typically hold, such as command of the armed forces, the appointment of ministers and the power to wage war. Instead, it is the Governor-General who retains these powers.
1.7.4.3. Con: There is a difference in how this figurehead, representative of the Australian nation, acquires their power. Rather than an undemocratic birth-right, it would be vested in someone chosen by the state.
