Discussion Name: Is the Antifa direct-action movement beneficial?

1. The Antifa [direct action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action) movement is beneficial to society.
1.1. Pro: Black Bloc is a common tactic used in Antifa Direct Action that seeks to protect non-violent anti-fascist protesters from fascist attackers.
1.1.1. Con: The police are the main protectors of non-violent anti-fascists, as they have the job of separating and standing in-between the warring factions at protests.
1.1.1.1. Con: Whether for political or logistical reasons, the police cannot be relied upon to uphold the rights and safety of anti-fascist protesters.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US police are more likely to use force against [left wing protesters.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/13/us-police-use-of-force-protests-black-lives-matter-far-right)
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The [US Capitol riots](https://prospect.org/justice/cops-and-fascists-rift-between-far-right-and-police-departments/) showed that many of the on-duty cops were sympathetic to fascists, suggesting they are unlikely to protect those protesting against fascist beliefs.
1.1.2. Con: The correct way to protect non-violent anti-fascist protesters from fascists is deescalation, something Antifa does not seem to be very good at.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Non-violent protesters should not be caught up in an escalating fight between warring factions.
1.1.2.2. Con: The Black Bloc is not the only tactic employed by antifa. Many such tactics can and do serve the purpose of deescalation. That the Black Bloc may fail to achieve an end for which it is not really intended is not a good objection to its use.
1.1.2.3. Con: The implied threat of force, especially in the face of greater numbers, can be effective in deescalating a tense situation by causing one side to back down.
1.1.3. Pro: Making it harder for fascists to influence the public is a preferred outcome for all anti-fascists.
1.1.4. Con: Black Bloc anonymizes the individual members, making it difficult to hold those members who engage in violence to account.
1.2. Con: Antifa is hurting the whole anti-fascist movement.
1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.2. Pro: Antifa is tarnishing the whole anti-fascist movement's reputation as being violent and extremist.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The anti-fascist movement opposes fascism, a violent and extreme ideology with a peaceful embracing brand image, Antifa battling with fascists, the police, destroying property and looting, is severely tarnishing that image.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Direct-action is more than violence and property destruction.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Direct action is a [tactic](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Direct_action#Advantages_and_disadvantages) used by people excluded from the regular political process.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the struggle for equal rights for Black Americans in the 1960s, the American Civil Rights movement had leaders who argued for non-violent direct action, as well as [violent direct-action](https://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/counterculture/liberation/blackpanther/blackpanther.html).
1.2.2.2. Pro: The broader anti-fascist movement is very specifically targeting fascism and its adherents. Broadening the definition of fascists to include [42%](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) of the US populations, namely Trump [supporters](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/who-are-the-antifa), is seriously hurting anti-fascism's broad support and the mission of fighting fascism.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Trump has [shown](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/10/fascism/502841/) many of the [traits](https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf) of Ur-Fascism.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Fascism doesn't start as a specific political ideology, rather it hijacks the discontentment of a population. [Ur-Fascism or Eternal Fascism](https://kottke.org/16/11/the-14-features-of-eternal-fascism) posits that a relatively innocuous series of mindsets can lay the groundwork for larger slides in the future.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The ruling [Fidesz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz#Political_affiliations) party in Hungary and its leader Victor Orban cultivate very close ties to right-wing organizations and parties, and take a strongly nationalist, anti-communist stance. This can be interpreted as fascist tendencies.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Fidesz has been [accused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz#Criticism_and_controversies) of removing independent judges, infringing on a free civil society, silencing the media, and have a long history of conflicts with the EU, resulting in strong anti-Western tendencies.
1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Resistance to fascism does not become necessary solely when fascism becomes the official or dominant political ideology of a state. Anti-fascism is also useful in opposing nascent fascist movements, preventing them from attaining greater influence.
1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Even if Trump were a fascist, that would not automatically make all the people that vote or approve of him fascists.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Knowingly supporting a fascist makes you at the very least a sympathizer, or rather literally a fascist supporter.
1.2.2.3. Pro: The majority of protesters are non-violent and do not want to get caught up in violent events. They will stay away when violence is to be expected, which has become the reality for anti-fascists protests. This hurts non-violent anti-fascist organizers who will have a harder time to mobilize people to show up and hurts the overall protest, as the number of bodies showing up is what sways politicians, not whether a couple of hundred protesters became violent.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.2.5. Pro: The general population abhors violence.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: [Wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling) is a popular spectacle, which portrays violence in a hyper-stylized and theatrical way. It is enjoyed by children as well as adults.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: NASCAR is a popular sport where people regularly [die in violent crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_in_NASCAR). This danger seems to be part of the appeal.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Con: Putting yourself in risky situations like extreme sports, is not traditionally understood as falling under the category of violence, as your intention is not to self-harm, but to get away unscathed, while doing something risky.
1.2.2.5.3. Con: Sports teams and their fans have [frequently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_in_sports) been involved in violent riots. This dates back to Roman times.
1.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: In 2018, fans of Superbowl winners the Philadelphia Eagles rioted when thousands of people ran into the streets to celebrate. The [same thing](https://www.sportscasting.com/sports/phillys-not-alone-sports-fans-cities-also-went-riot-mode/) happened in Boston and other places.
1.2.2.5.4. Con: Movies are becoming more and more [violent](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/violence-in-the-media/have-movies-become-more-violent-over-the-years), and are accessible to younger audiences.
1.2.2.5.4.1. Pro: For example, the [John Wick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick) movies have grown into an entire franchise on the back of a story of a former assassin taking revenge.
1.2.2.5.5. Con: The majority of the population either actively supports, or at least doesn't oppose the police force, despite a large number of violent incidents being reported on regularly.
1.2.2.5.5.1. Pro: For example, police in Mesa, Ca, have been [recorded](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/6/6/17434320/robert-johnson-mesa-arizona-police-beating) perpetrating multiple acts of violent assault.
1.2.2.5.5.2. Pro: There are so many incidents of police shootings that Wikipedia has a [master list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States) of Lists of police killings.
1.2.2.5.5.3. Con: The general population abhors excessive police violence. There are protests and riots when it happens.
1.2.2.5.5.3.1. Pro: Protests erupted in LA following the [beating of Rodney King](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/a-history-of-protests-against-police-brutality) by police in 1991.
1.2.2.5.5.3.2. Pro: Protests erupted in New York in 1999, following the killing of [Amadou Diallo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/a-history-of-protests-against-police-brutality) by four plain clothes police officers.
1.2.2.5.5.4. Con: The general public accepts the police because they themselves do not want to provide for their safety and even though excessive police violence should not happen, the cases are so rare, in proportion to the exertion of non-excessive police force, that the general public does not want to dissolve the police.
1.2.2.5.6. Pro: The general population prefers to not be in areas where they are likely to have to engage in physical combat.
1.2.2.5.6.1. Pro: Most people are not trained in physical combat and would lose against trained fighters.
1.2.2.5.6.2. Pro: Many people are not physically fit enough to engage in physical combat, e.g. children, elderly, sick and handicapped people.
1.2.2.5.7. Pro: Most members of society are afraid of violence and not want to get hurt.
1.2.3. Pro: Antifa does not help win over the minds and hearts of the general population.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Antifa's action allow fascists to paint themselves as the victims, which in turn creates a negative impression of Antifa themselves.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: People on either side of the isle will generally side with underdogs and victims, rather than violent protesters.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: [Fascists will always paint themselves as victims](https://eand.co/the-psychology-of-american-fascism-eff731c53f61) as a reaction to public policies they disagree with and as a tactic to inspire their supporters. There is usually some grand conspiracy that they believe they are already victims of.
1.2.3.2. Pro: The actions of Antifa groups often harm their communities.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Policing violent demonstrations requires extra funds that might be better spent on community-building programs.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Antifa promotes community response to many important causes, such as relief to those affected by national disasters.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Promoting response does not mean Antifa is good as a whole. Harmful groups can do seemingly good in one area while still promoting bad actions in another.
1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: Although Antifa has recently been demonised in the media, they have also been responsible for [providing relief on the ground to many communities across Houston and the Gulf Coast.](https://www.democracynow.org/2017/8/30/the_red_cross_wont_save_houston_texas)
1.2.3.3. Pro: Antifa not only fight fascists, but also go up against established public institutions and principles. This makes it less likely for the general public to support the broader anti-fascist movement.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Antifa fights capitalism, which the general public does not want to overthrow.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Antifa denies speech of fascists, which some of the general public want to at least listen and respond to.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Antifa wants to abolish the police, which is a fixture of public life.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Antifa frequently writes Internet posts that are anti-police / [ACAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C.A.B.). [1](https://twitter.com/berkeleyantifa/status/1096254013014753281) [2](https://twitter.com/mark__bray/status/883650680011063296?lang=en) [3](https://twitter.com/itsmikebivins/status/1025815553514991616?lang=en) [4](https://twitter.com/patchie_the_cat/status/1153981230464921600) [5](https://twitter.com/antifa_riot/status/763722823508557824) [6](https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/871469220629929984)
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: Some Antifa members advocate for violence against police officers, others even for the the killing of cops. [1](https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/09/15/antifa-prof-nyc-placed-administrative-leave-anti-cop-tweets/) [2](https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/09/20/antifa-prof-says-wants-tear-system-anti-cop-tweets-surface/) [3](https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/19/project-veritas-disruptj20-agitator-was-definitely-not-joking-about-throat-punching-trump-supporters/) [4](https://twitter.com/tayimanallen/status/1033376424948846592) [5](https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1162830064330956800)
1.2.3.3.3.3. Pro: Antifa is often seen protesting with [ACAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C.A.B.) placards, while wearing clothes with [ACAB](https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/acab) prints. [1](https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/871469220629929984) [2](https://twitter.com/itsmikebivins/status/1025815553514991616?lang=en)
1.2.3.3.3.4. Pro: Antifa sees the police as the force protecting the established governments, which it wants to get rid off, in order to establish anarchy instead. Thus, Antifa considers getting rid of the police an important stepping stone to achieve its goals.
1.2.3.3.3.5. Pro: In human history there has never been a large stable society that did not have a caste of law enforcers.
1.2.3.3.3.5.1. Con: It can be argued that there has yet to be a large stable society.
1.2.3.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: Governments collapse, whether by conquest, decay or insurrection.
1.2.3.3.3.5.2. Con: If a society needs a specific caste of people, who employ violent and coercive means, to enforce the law, then its stability is already threatened for lack of mutual agreement.
1.2.3.3.3.6. Con: Abolishing the Police would be beneficial for society.
1.2.3.3.3.6.1. Pro: Given that police frequently commit unjustified acts of violence and other abuses of power, antifa is correct in calling for the abolition of law enforcement institutions as they presently exist, even if they would have to be replaced with something else for society to continue to function.
1.2.3.3.3.7. Con: As many as [22% of Americans support](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vgqowgynze/econTabReport.pdf) abolition of the police, and [58% agree that major changes](https://counciloncj.org/public-perceptions-of-the-police/) are needed.
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Many non-violent anti-fascist movements explicitly ask their members to abstain from violence as they know that violence is counterproductive to their cause.
1.2.3.3.4.1. Pro: Most major political changes in Western democracies have come about via non-violent protests, not via violent clashes between opposing factions or with the police.
1.2.3.3.4.1.1. Con: Many major changes start off with nonviolent protest, then are escalated to violent clashes with policing forces until they are finally enacted upon.
1.2.3.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the US, the [struggle for civil rights](https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/01/dont-criticize-black-lives-matter-for-provoking-violence-the-civil-rights-movement-did-too/%3foutputType=amp) was on the receiving end of much state violence.
1.2.3.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: In Canada, the clash between protesters and the Canadian mounted police in the [Black Tuesday Riot](https://harvest.usask.ca/handle/10388/etd-09022009-131902) was the culmination of a coal miners' strike for better working conditions.
1.2.3.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: In Ireland, [Civil Rights](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/22/lost-moment-exhibition-northern-ireland-civil-rights-1968-troubles-what-if) marches began peacefully then turned into years and years of bloody conflict with state and loyalists.
1.2.3.3.4.1.2. Pro: In its decades of existence not a single major policy or societal change can be credited to Antifa, while many such changes can be attributed to non-violent activists.
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: The non-violent LGBTQ community has achieved great legislative and societal breakthroughs.
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Some countries now allow gay marriage.
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: Being gay has been decriminalized in Western democracies.
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: Being openly gay is now much less detrimental to you career than it was just a couple of decades ago.
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: The non-violent anti-whaling activists achieved the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling [Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Regulation_of_Whaling).
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.3. Pro: Peace activists brought about the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban [Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty).
1.2.3.3.4.1.2.4. Pro: The non-violent Monday [demonstrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_demonstrations_in_East_Germany) in East Germany brought about the [reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification) of Germany, [Perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika) and the [dissolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union) of the Soviet Union.
1.2.3.3.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.4.1.2.1.
1.2.3.3.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.4.1.2.2.
1.2.3.3.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.4.1.2.3.
1.2.3.3.4.1.6. Con: It is not a specific political change that Antifa seeks, but the prevention of further political shifts towards fascism, and fascistic ideologies.
1.2.3.3.4.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.1.
1.2.3.3.4.2. Pro: Violence will result in victims on both sides and will allow fascist to paint themselves as victims of violence, which is not desirable for anti-fascist movements.
1.2.3.3.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.5.
1.2.3.3.4.2.2. Pro: The last thing anti-fascist movements want is right wingers, skin heads and racist groups as being able to portray themselves as the reasonable faction.
1.2.3.3.4.3. Pro: Violence during a march will drown out the message that the organizers actually want to communicate and will instead have the media focus on the violence.
1.2.3.3.4.4. Pro: A common tactic to delegitimize a protest is an [Agent Provocateur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur) who incites violent behavior.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Antifa dominates the anti-fascist movement's news media coverage as their looks and violent black bloc tactics make for great headline news, while crowding out the majority of the peacefully protesting organizations.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Without Antifa's actions, many protests would not make the news at all.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Black-clad mask-wearing activists make for better headlines than moms that are protesting peacefully.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Con: [Pussyhats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussyhat) had a major media impact, and have remained in popular culture long after the 2018 Women's March.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: News organizations and journalists within these media organizations, generally speaking, are always looking for the most sensational headline to attract as many views as possible.
1.2.3.4.4. Pro: Violence sells more newspapers than reports about the latest Senate hearings.
1.2.3.5. Pro: The general population will not consider masked and armed protesters, such as those in antifa, as trustworthy or reliable.
1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Citizens of Western democracies do not encounter balaclava- and helmet wearing individuals walking the streets in their normal lives and are thus scared when encountering them.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Con: Balaclavas are [regularly](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-warmest-balaclavas-bikers.html) worn by cyclists.
1.2.3.5.2. Pro: Antifa protestors are often armed. [1](https://twitter.com/PortlandPolice/status/871535129096724480)
1.2.3.5.3. Pro: A group of Antifa protesters [resembles](https://youtu.be/_iraAfWBXzk?t=22) an army or police SWAT unit, black-clothed and masked, sometimes wearing body armor and helmets. This does not make ordinary citizens feel safe or sympathetic. Many might even find this scary.
1.2.3.5.3.1. Con: Antifa members need to conceal their identities in order to not get [doxxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) or attacked by fascists.
1.2.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: Trump supporters have previously created large lists of politically left protesters and activists, and shared them [online](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/pastebin-database-grows).

1.2.3.5.4.2.1. Con: Often, the tactics utilized by antifa are illegal \(or criminalized after the fact by the government\). That does not mean their actions are unjustified or harmful.

1.2.4. Pro: Antifa is unorganized, and so has issues structural issues which compromise its aims.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Anitfa’s members frequently wearing masks at protests makes it very easy for anyone to pretend being Antifa and causing havoc in their and the broader anti-fascist movement's name.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.4.4.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Antifa makes anti-fascist protests harder and more costly to organize.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Protest organizers will have a much harder time getting their protests approved if violent activities are likely to occur.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Anti-fascist protests are generally organized in opposition to fascist rallies. If the fascists' rallies have a harder time getting approved, then it is of benefit to all anti-fascists.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: A much larger police force than required for non-violent protests will have to be deployed if violence is likely to happen.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: The incurred cost of policing is to the state and not to the organizers.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: Anti-fascist protests are mostly reactionary. They are often counter-protests of fascist rallies, therefore do not incur the traditional costs of grassroots organizing, such as permitting.
1.3. Pro: Antifa groups seek to protect society from fascism.
1.3.1. Pro: A characteristic of fascism is to blame societal ills upon a [scapegoat](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Extreme-nationalism). A fascist is ever at war with this 'out' group and " [believes neither in the possibility nor in the utility of perpetual peace](http://www.historyguide.org/europe/duce.html)."
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.2. Pro: Many minority groups are targeted by fascist/ white supremacist groups and need protection.
1.3.3. Pro: Fascism is the rejection of some groups' members right to exist and/or have equal rights, and has often lead to terrible injustices and losses of lives.
1.4. Pro: Antifa wants everyone to have equal rights and choices.
1.4.1. Pro: Antifa opposes extreme nationalism.
1.4.2. Pro: Antifa supports the diversity of people.
1.4.3. Pro: Antifa protests the [amassing of wealth](https://edition-m.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/unmasking-antifa-anti-fascists-hard-left/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) by corporations and elites.
1.4.4. Pro: Antifa opposes white supremacy.
1.4.5. Con: Treating everybody equal often does not result in equality, because it ignores the fact that not everyone starts off from the same point in society.
1.5. Pro: Antifa rejects state control and power, instead [advocating for popular direct action](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/31/step-aside-antifa-you-undermine-the-resistance) for all.
1.5.1. Con: Popular Direct Action is contrary to the governmental system of the United States that runs a Constitutional Republic. Grievances of a community are to be addressed by elected representatives who advocate for that community.
1.5.1.1. Con: Elected representatives sometimes do not preside over an accurate representation of a [community](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/26/gerrymandering-supreme-court-maps-1235466).
1.5.1.2. Con: If the representatives are ineffective in addressing the needs of a community -- or simply unwilling to do so -- then members of that community may be justified in using popular direct action to provoke a more favorable response by the government or to alleviate the situation themselves.
1.5.2. Pro: Direct action is sometimes the only available means of creating change.
1.5.2.1. Con: In first world countries there is no need for change, because there is not one first world country with fascism as its political ideology, thus the whole purpose of Antifa becomes unnecessary.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.1.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Direct action does not have to be violent in order for it to effective, as demonstrated by the many groups that do direct action protests, like sit ins, property occupations and blockades.
1.6. Con: Antifa groups' actions often have an opposite effect to the one intended, and make people less likely to actively join the larger anti-fascist movement.
1.6.1. Con: Opponents of Antifa can and will spread [propaganda](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/antifa-right-wing-violence-ted-cruz-bill-cassidy-resolution_n_5d33c982e4b0419fd32de46b?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKXe3FLdoQcwe2FjQxm25pV8v6Uvt39d1w1IoBs5RJQIsT-NIMNi0CExNe_ND7jjBwFaYelRiz1Jv_LnnsKpEMKo-GkdpiiX5QHY6JahQsKaCbXv2tsi5Ye5945euzKT7gky-SMKm4Zbg_bfEJ_FRjjsd_x7TGFQjvjZzwfrDuIu) to paint antifa as evil and dangerous, and will make up [lies](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/06/11/accusations-mirror-how-radical-right-blames-rising-political-violence-left) if necessary, so actual actions become almost irrelevant in changing antifa's reputation.
