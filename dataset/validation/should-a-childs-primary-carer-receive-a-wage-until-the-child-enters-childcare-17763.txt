Discussion Name: Should a child's primary carer receive a wage until the child enters childcare?

1. A child's primary carer should receive a wage from the government until the child enters primary school or some other form of care.
1.1. Con: The government may interfere more in parenting practices if the parent essentially becomes an employee and this would not be a positive outcome.
1.1.1. Con: This can be prevented by making the wage unconditional but for the requirement to be a primary carer to a child.
1.1.1.1. Con: Giving the same wage to every parent would remove incentive for parents to excel, and would encourage them to do only the bare minimum.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Parents should not parent because of economic incentive. \(Duplicate claim, will link to level 1 claim when above claim accepted\)
1.1.1.1.2. Con: At present parents are still motivated to parent well without the incentive of performance based pay.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Parents are motivated by more than money when parenting, such as the love for their child.
1.1.2. Con: There are loads of inattentive, lazy or bad parents out there who allow or encourage their children to do things that are immoral or damaging to society and/or the environment.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Some parents may encourage bigotry in the form of racism, sexism and other social 'phobias'.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Some parent may turn a blind eye to shoplifting and other petty crime done by their children.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Some parents encourage animal abuse \(like throwing rocks at strays\).
1.1.2.4. Pro: Some parents think it is fine to not vaccinate their children.
1.1.2.5. Con: This has no bearing on whether or not individuals should receive a wage for parenting.
1.1.3. Pro: There is pressure on the government to ensure that tax money isn't spent on wages for bad parents, as that would reflect poorly on them. This gives the government an incentive to establish more clear legal guidelines for appropriate parenting.
1.1.3.1. Con: As there's no clear and objective definition of good parenting, there's a risk that any specific government guidelines on parenting would be filled with harmful biases.
1.1.4. Con: This wage would be a benefit similar to an expanded form of the child benefit \(in the UK\). The child benefit has not been used as an excuse to interfere with parenting practices so it is not clear why this might happen if a caregiver wage were introduced.
1.2. Pro: Such a measure may solve the challenge of low population growth confronting many nations.
1.2.1. Con: Low population growth is good for our overpopulated planet.
1.2.1.1. Con: In developed countries, low birthrates are a major [social issue](http://uk.businessinsider.com/japans-population-is-shrinking-demographic-time-bomb-2018-6?r=US&IR=T) as ageing populations require substantial state support while a shrinking workforce is less able to fund that support.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Developed countries could solve this problem without increasing their birthrate.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Developed countries could simply allow in more young immigrants.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Opening the borders and allowing in a large number of young immigrants may be politically unpopular.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The current rate of population growth is part of the cause of the climate crisis. Lowering this rate would help mitigate this crisis.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The climate crisis could also be mitigated via other means.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Countries could move rapidly to zero net emissions.
1.2.2. Pro: This kind of measure would provide an economic incentive for people to have children.
1.2.2.1. Con: This could cause lazy people to just keep having kids for money.
1.2.3. Con: Child-rearers may not be motivated by economic incentives such as a wage or tax break.
1.3. Pro: Raising a child is just as much, if not more, work than jobs which traditionally receive economic reward.
1.3.1. Con: In cases where the parent is the primary care giver, having a child was a personal choice. One should not receive financial rewards from the government for choosing to have children.
1.3.2. Pro: Child rearing has not been acknowledged as work deserving of financial reward in the past because it was almost exclusively completed by women in a a patriarchal society.
1.3.3. Pro: Receiving some financial relief as a result of carer wage could make parenting seem less like a burden and more stress-free. This would improve parent-child interaction.
1.4. Con: The primary carer should only receive a wage if they have adopted a child. Otherwise, in this time of over-population, being natural parents should be a privilege which you should have to prove yourself at least financially responsible to access.
1.4.1. Con: We are no more in a [time of over overpopulation](https://www.pop.org/debunking-the-myth-of-overpopulation/) now than we were in the [2nd century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation#History_of_concern), when overpopulation was first written of.
1.4.2. Con: Financial responsibility is not necessarily the right measure for determining parenting suitability.
1.4.2.1. Con: Financial responsibility is not a sufficient condition for determining parenting suitability but is a necessary condition for determining parenting suitability.
1.4.2.2. Pro: One can be completely financially responsible and neglect a child.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: In fact, according to a [study](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/social-work-report-child-neglect-rich-families-abuse-city-of-london-a8351336.html) about child neglect in affluent families, richer parents are more likely to use their “powerful social connections” to avoid interventions by social services.
1.4.3. Con: Presently, people are free to have children whether they are financially able to or not and many governments provide support payments in recognition of the social good.
1.5. Pro: Child raising benefits society just as much as any other job and therefore should receive economic recognition.
1.5.1. Pro: The birth of new children is crucial for the maintenance of a substantial [workforce](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/new-europe-germany-retirement-pensions-exports), without which an industrial economy can no longer function.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Many countries are approaching [below replacement](http://www.niussp.org/article/half-the-worlds-population-reaching-below-replacement-fertility/) fertility rates which may make them economically unsustainable.
1.5.2. Con: Despite societal benefits, monetary exchanges are given by private bodies in exchange for work that produces economic benefits, which is not the case of child raising.
1.5.2.1. Con: Monetary exchanges also occur between governments and individuals.
1.5.3. Pro: Caring for children and raising them to be emotionally mature, upstanding citizens requires a lot of work and is very important to create a functional society.
1.5.3.1. Pro: If children are not well cared for they may suffer from health issues or emotional issues and have a higher likelihood to commit crimes. Caring for children is the only way to to stop these problems - which would have a high cost for society - from arising.
1.6. Pro: A primary caregiver wage would help [tackle gender injustice](https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1188&context=philosophy_theses).
1.6.1. Pro: A caregiver wage could help to address the gender wealth gap.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Gender pay inequality occurs in part because women are in less high paying jobs because having to take breaks for child rearing slows down their career progression. A carer wage could help make up for this by providing carer's financial compensation.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: A lack of career progression is likely to stop woman from having equal wealth to men as a carer wage is not likely to be enough to make up for the monetary gain that a promotion would lead to.
1.6.2. Pro: Such a measure may help address economic inequality between men and women as women are usually the primary carers and often consequently more financially disadvantaged than men.
1.6.2.1. Con: Such a measure might be a way of discouraging women from seeking jobs in conservative countries.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: As the norm that women should be the one to stay at home doesn't change with this, the wage could be used as an excuse to tell women that they don't need a career to get an income.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: At the very least, woman might gain financial independence even if they would still not be working.
1.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: In many countries, women are still the majority of the caregivers and are financially dependent on men. Providing them a wage would give them more financial independence which is key to tackling gender injustice.
1.6.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Financial dependence on a man leaves a woman in a situation where it would be hard to leave their relationship due to the high exit cost. Addressing this is important.
1.6.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Women in abusive relationships will be more able to leave the relationship if they have financial independence.
1.6.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: There are other non-financial reasons why women find it hard to leave relationships.
1.6.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Men may be able to pressure their wives into giving them access to the money as well.
1.6.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: At least in this situation, women may have some money of their own so all in all, it may be better than women entirely depending on men's money.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.2.1.
1.7. Con: Child raising is the responsibility of the family.
1.7.1. Pro: The primary caregiver, usually the parent, chose to have a kid. Society should not be obligated to pay them to deal with their choices.
1.7.1.1. Con: The purpose of the state is precisely to help its citizens by providing them with equal opportunities.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: There is no other reason for the state to exist than making sure all citizens can live a [dignified life. ​](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hasint31&div=5&id=&page=)
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Libertarians believe the only duty of the state is to protect and enforce private property rights.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: This measure might help low-income families.
1.7.1.1.3. Pro: Having children is natural and part of life. The state should serve these kind of basic needs.
1.7.1.2. Con: While having children is a personal choice, having a new generation that pays taxes \(which contributes to pensions for elder citizens\) is a social necessity.
1.7.1.3. Con: Many parents do not intend to have children but become pregnant.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: Contraceptives sometimes fail even if people are using them properly.
1.7.1.4. Con: Society pays for personal decisions in many other aspects: paying for roads that not everybody uses, paying for treatments caused by smoking, which is a personal decision, etc. This should be no different.
1.7.2. Con: If kids are born to parents who cannot afford to take care of them, it is not fair that they should suffer due to no fault of their own.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Luck egalitarianism posits that it is [unjust](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/does-inequality-really-matter-1.3407528) if some people are worse off than others through no fault or choice of their own.
1.7.3. Con: Raising a child is often thought to be partially the responsible of society.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Most societies provide free education to children on the basis that it is society's responsibility to raise a child to be sufficiently educated.
1.8. Con: People should have children for love, not money.
1.8.1. Pro: People could start having children for money, which would cheapen the parental experience.
1.8.1.1. Con: For that to happen these wages should completely offset the costs and be profitable, that is highly unlikely.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Raising children is [extremely expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/16/cost-of-raising-children-in-uk-higher-than-ever). This wage would likely offset some of the cost of having a child, but it would not make childrearing profitable.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Receiving aid from the state to make sure that your children have all their basic needs covered has nothing to do with profit.
1.8.2. Con: The decision to have a child has so many profound implications. It is very unlikely that a parent would be solely motivated by money to have a child.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.
1.8.4. Pro: Simply wanting a child is very different from desiring a child. A child should be the result of the crazy love between parents.
1.8.4.1. Con: A child can be the result of love and yet that does not mean that childcare is not expensive and thus may need economic compensation. Both things are not mutually exclusive.
1.8.4.2. Con: Some children are the result of a night stand and not "crazy love between parents", some are the result of one person wanting a child and using a sperm donor: there is not a unique way of having children.
1.8.5. Con: People should be allowed to have children for whatever reason they want.
1.8.5.1. Pro: It would be paternalistic to tell parents that they can only have children if they are motivated by love.
1.8.6. Con: People can, and probably will, still have children out of love, even if they have some help with the expenses.
1.9. Con: Such a measure may not be economically viable.
1.9.1. Con: Taxes could be increased in order to fund a primary carer wage.
1.9.2. Con: In [Germany](https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/kindergeld.html), parents receive an allowance for each child already. This is feasible.
1.9.2.1. Con: Many countries are not as economically strong as Germany.
1.9.2.2. Pro: In the UK, parents receive a child benefit.
1.9.3. Con: Money spent on this policy will generate economic activity as recipients spend it on goods and services, helping it to [pay for itself](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/keynesian-multiplier.asp).
1.9.3.1. Con: This money will likely be spent primarily on private goods and services, meaning that the money doesn't necessarily flow back into the government.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Those goods and services generate taxes that do flow back to the government.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: Taxes are not always an effective way of ensuring that money spent on goods and services are sufficiently flowing back into the government.
1.9.4. Con: Government money can be found for such an important measure by cutting other expenses. It is purely a question of spending priorities.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Many goverments spend significant amounts of money subsidising companies and industries. This money could be redirected.
1.9.4.2. Pro: In the US, nearly half of the federal budget is spent on the military. Even cutting this by a small amount could allow for a primary carer wage to be introduced.
