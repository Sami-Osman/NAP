Discussion Name: Should hate speech be illegal?

1. Hate speech should be banned.
1.1. Con: Giving the government the ability to regulate any speech gives them the ability to inhibit free exchange of ideas.
1.1.1. Pro: It is better to challenge bad ideas than to simply ban the enunciation of them.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is impossible to challenge bad ideas if the opposing party has no voice. Those who advocate hate speech will never allow their ideas to be challenged.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is the responsibility of private institutions and citizens to censor and deplatform hateful speech. Hate speech shouldn't be given a private platform unless it is being rigorously challenged, but the government should not be involved in the censorship of speech.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The foundation of hate speech laws came after Hitler rose to power through hate speech. Then once he was in power he removed all that opposed him by wiping them out, effectively removing free speech.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It is ridiculous to suggest that Nazi oppression was enabled by speech restrictions. Hitler [violently purged](https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/the-nazi-rise-to-power/how-did-the-nazi-gain-power/) his political opponents.
1.1.1.2. Con: People who use hate speech are not generally open to reason; this approach will not work.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Those people can be educated, or better convinced. Many kinds of hate speech are based on misunderstood ideas or stereotypes.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: You can not educate somebody who does not want to be educated.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Being ignorant is easy. The cost of seeking true answers is usually larger than cost of finding easiest answers.
1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: If people were ready to learn, misunderstandings and stereotypes wouldn't be such a problem.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: In the US, much support for racism is based on an [idealized and false](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/) understanding of what the Confederacy was.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: While direct reason has less of a chance of initial success, relationship, compassion and reconciliation can ultimately bring someone around to seeing reason. [Daryl Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw) is an example of a black man who actively attends rallies and dialogues with KKK members as a method of changing minds through respect and dialogue. It's not easy, but it's the best way to reduce and eliminate hate.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Modern social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, 4chan, empower a few bad actors \("trolls"\) to have a disproportionately large effect on the overall discourse. People who are not interested in the free exchange of ideas are able to silence dissenting voices through online trolling techniques and poison the conversation.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: This makes the assumption that human discussion will inherently tilt that way rather than being the result of how a discussion platform is designed or who its target audience is.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: It is the right of any media platform to foster any kind of community they deem appropriate. The free market will by nature punish media outlets if their platforms are not attractive because serious users will go elsewhere \(to sites like Kialo\). There is no need for legislative banning of people who speak with hate.
1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: The biggest platforms need to acknowledge that, by prioritizing engagement over accuracy, they reward people who generate lots of controversy, whether or not their speech is accurate, helpful, or respectful of our human dignity. Figuring out algorithms that promote constructive speech over "buzzy" speech would improve online discourse and actually benefit humankind.
1.1.1.3. Pro: If banned, hate speech would move into the shadows and there would most likely be an increase in extremism on all sides of the spectrum.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Banning any kind of speech will not eliminate the reasons why hate speech exists and will simply end up being censored.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Banning hate speech may not eliminate the cause, but it will eliminate it's harmful effects.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Not all censorship is totalitarian. This censorship has, as its basis, the protection of human dignity, which is not totalitarian at all.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Banning hate speech does not fix the underlying problem, it escalates it. As Martin Luther King Jr said: "In fact, violence merely increases hate. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."
1.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Hate speech should be allowed so that it can flow freely along with all other information, and allow the world to be aware of hate speech in its true form.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: After getting hate speech or conspiracy theories removed or fact-checked on Twitter, many U.S. conservatives have switched to less [regulated and diverse apps.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/technology/parler-rumble-newsmax.html)
1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Moving hate speech into darker corners of the internet and losing a shared knowledge or social space leads to [fractured knowledge](https://researchoutreach.org/articles/fractured-knowledge-fake-news/) and increased polarization and extremism.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: It is possible to debate the bad ideas behind hate speech on a societal level even if hate speech is limited.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: There is an ongoing problem with [misinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html) that does not allow hate speech to be properly debunked online. Therefore its removal is necessary.
1.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Misinformation has gotten to the point where [fact-checking websites](https://leadstories.com/how-we-work.html) are not able to handle the quantity of disinformation.
1.1.1.3.4.2. Pro: The rise of [phony or purposely misleading news articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/technology/personaltech/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-of-misinformation.html) makes it much harder to confront hate speech or offensive speech.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: These fake articles are produced with [such great intensity](https://money.cnn.com/interactive/media/the-macedonia-story/) that only centralized intervention could mitigate them.
1.1.1.3.4.3. Con: There are ways of [debunking and stopping](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/05/stop-spreading-misinformation/) the spread of misinformation that does not require the removal of harmful content.
1.1.1.3.4.3.1. Con: People often become ["unwitting agents"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mental-mishaps/201907/can-we-stop-the-spread-misinformation) in the spread of misinformation. That presents a major issue for stopping misinformation.
1.1.1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: There may be an immense backlash if average people have their speech restricted and are accused of spreading fake news.
1.1.1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Social media platforms have started [fact-checking](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-factcheck-idUSKBN2360U0) posts about certain issues.
1.1.1.3.4.3.2.1. Con: One can simply ignore fact-check warnings.
1.1.1.4. Pro: The term “hate speech” too easily becomes “speech which makes me uncomfortable”. Banning speech that makes you uncomfortable shuts down intellectual development, and robs a society of the chance to immunize itself through reason and rational debate from hateful ideas. This is especially harmful in educational institutions.
1.1.1.5. Con: Rational argument rarely succeeds in changing people's minds.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Shocking or hateful opinions are [more likely to be publicized](https://www.thewilkesbeacon.com/opinion/2019/04/16/why-sensationalized-news-stories-are-damaging-to-society/) than reasonable ones. This means absolute free speech is unlikely to displace hateful ones.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: People are often reticent to be shown they are wrong. Therefore, in discussions, they are [likely to double down on their bad opinions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/think-well/201812/why-many-people-stubbornly-refuse-change-their-minds).
1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: This is called the [backfire effect,](https://effectiviology.com/backfire-effect-facts-dont-change-minds/) where forceful exposure to correct or contrary evidence causes people to support their original stance more forcefully than prior.
1.1.1.5.3. Con: Perhaps in one-on-one discussions, people will not change their minds. However, over time, [people will slowly alter their beliefs](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/14/political-views-change-over-time) and it will become clear which views are better.
1.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Opinions do not always necessarily change towards the truth. Animosity against the poor and not well educated has [increased in the last few decades](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/opinion/education-prejudice.html).
1.1.1.6. Pro: Hate speech is better limited by social pressure than legal sanction.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Hate speech is better reprehended socially rather than legally. The problem with legally banning free speech is that laws can be changed according to the government's will. The assumption that democracy will always be the ruling system is a devious one.
1.1.1.6.2. Pro: If we ban hate speech, we lose the opportunities to challenge these ideas. Instead they become taboos, and will be conserved in our culture. If we do not ban hate speech, we can easily refute these theories on a daily basis, and even laugh at them.
1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: The Free Marketplace of Ideas, expressed in modern society through revolutionary platforms like [Kialo](http://www.kialo.com), will ultimately eviscerate any negative effects of hate speech through the exchange of thought.
1.1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: There is no evidence of that.
1.1.1.6.3. Con: There should not be an expectation that members of the public or victims of hate speech be the ones to try and reduce or shut down that speech. The state should take responsibility for this by having laws against hate speech.
1.1.1.6.3.1. Con: The state is funded by taxes collected from the public, so the burden of expectation on members of the public is still there when taxpayer-funded state coercion is used to solve a problem instead of social pressure.
1.1.1.6.4. Con: Those who engage in hate speech often do not feel social pressure.
1.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: People spreading hate speech tend to be [engrained in physical or online communities](https://thecrimereport.org/2019/04/09/how-echo-chambers-of-hate-on-social-media-fuel-right-wing-violence/) which purposefully filter out criticism. These are called echo chambers.
1.1.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Those within echo chambers often find ways to discredit any condemnation they do face. This often happens through [personal attacks on opposition leaders](https://medium.com/\@andybodle/the-art-of-the-smear-how-the-far-right-destroyed-public-discourse-a25ecd11dc16).
1.1.1.6.4.1.2. Con: When these communities face sufficient criticism, they become delegitimized. Perhaps they will still have members, but their malignant speech will have no public effect.
1.1.2. Pro: Making hate speech illegal limits human rights and a government that prevents free speech is to be considered dictatorial
1.1.3. Pro: What is "hateful" can be politicized, with political parties claiming that speech against their positions must be censored for the greater good.
1.1.3.1. Con: This is not a bad thing. Democracy should be about constantly evaluating what our values are and what kinds of behavior correspond to those values.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Especially where political representation for minorities is increasing, new perspectives on how social norms can be oppressive are becoming widespread. We must reevaluate our societies on this basis.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: This essentially boils down to a [tyranny of the majority,](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/preventing-the-tyranny-the-majority) where minority rights will be squashed.
1.1.3.2. Pro: This may delegitimize the reasonable allegations of hateful speech, as people are less likely to believe them if they believe they are a political ploy.
1.1.3.3. Con: It will be easy to tell which allegations are political in nature as the speech they oppose will not likely threaten or malign truly vulnerable groups.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Which people are "truly vulnerable groups" is non-obvious and a political question - e.g. "the unborn", according to pro-lifers, are a truly vulnerable group.
1.1.4. Con: There exist reliable mechanisms to stop government overreach on speech issues.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Most countries have constitutional courts that have, in the past, [prevented unreasonable free speech prohibitions](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases) while still allowing some speech to be restricted.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The precise [role of courts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-judicial-branch/) is to prevent governments from breaching the rights of citizens.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Governments have [several ways](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/trump-tried-to-intimidate-the-judges-over-his-ban-and-he-failed/516294/) to force courts to do what they want.
1.1.4.2. Con: Even democratic states often use the law to justify secret attempts to shut down the speech of opposition.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Inspired by [McCarthy in the 1950s](https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/age-of-eisenhower/mcarthyism-red-scare), the US government imprisoned and censored many for alleged 'Communist behavior'.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Citizens have many resources to uncover secret rights violations.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: [Whistleblower laws](https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing) protect civil servants who publicize state crimes. A political attempt to silence an entire group of citizens will likely be publicized.
1.1.5. Con: If a government is willing to abuse hate speech restrictions, the problem is not the restriction but the government itself.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Governments frequently abuse their power through [police violence](http://www.abuseofpower.info/Article_MisusePower.htm). It does not follow from this fact that the existence of police is always wrong.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Governments intent on restricting the speech of citizens tend to focus [restrictions on insulting state institutions](https://notesfrompoland.com/2018/08/21/polands-insult-laws-and-the-threat-to-free-speech/). This is not justified with reference to vulnerable groups.
1.1.5.3. Con: If we have a government which is the problem, we certainly do not want to hand that government any more power for it to abuse.
1.1.5.4. Con: Humans are always fallible, if a government does not abuse free speech restrictions today it may very well do so when fallible people enter government next.
1.1.6. Pro: All speech should be free.
1.1.6.1. Con: Our society would be much worse off if libel and clear cases of intentionally inciting panic \(e.g. shouting 'fire' in a crowded theatre\) were unfettered.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: "Fire" in a crowded theater is a call to action and to be more specific, a harmful action. This is indeed banned. But the line should be drawn between a call to action and speech where someone just might not like something about it.
1.1.6.2. Con: Karl Popper's [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) states that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: A necessary precondition for a fair and free society is the rejection of views that oppose fairness and freedom in the political community.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: 'Fairness' and 'freedom' are concepts whose [meanings are meant to be contested](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/10/29/the-liberal-conception-of-freedom-is-incapable-of-addressing-the-problems-of-contemporary-capitalism/). Predetermining their meaning, and restricting speech on that basis would therefore be arbitrary.
1.1.6.3. Con: Speeches instigating a crime against a person or a group of people should not be free. For example saying 'Lithuanian people are evil' should be legal, but saying 'let's kill Lithuanian people' should not be legal. The most important reason for that is mass psychosis; a well manipulated crowd of ordinary people can commit unbelievable crimes.
1.1.6.4. Pro: If all speech in public is not free, then we can always find a justification to ban any sort of speech we wish.
1.1.6.4.1. Pro: If an authority with power labels a discussion about hate speech \(such as this one\) as "hate speech," then we couldn't even have this discussion because it would be banned. The problem with banning any speech is that it gives too much power to the authorities to control public narratives and manipulate the populace. Therefore, all speech, including hate speech, should be protected as a fundamental right.
1.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Saying there should be a ban on hate speech, is itself, [hate speech](https://definitions.uslegal.com/h/hate-speech/). With a ban would come sanctions, such sanctions would harm the affected individuals prosperity and be oppressive in nature. To suggest the willing enforcement of oppression against individuals by the government is hate speech.
1.1.6.5. Pro: In the US, the [first amendment](http://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/) protects the freedom of speech, meaning all speech unconditionally. Speaking alone cannot be made illegal. Legal action could be taken if the speech is directly related to a crime and only if, for example, an intentional false tip is given to 911.
1.1.6.5.1. Pro: Outlawing hate speech effectively limits freedom of speech – a fundamental human right. You cannot outlaw kitchen knives because some use it for a crime.
1.1.6.5.2. Pro: Every human has the right to give opinions. Banning hate speech is the same as banning people from talking about their own opinions or thoughts.
1.1.6.6. Pro: If you believe in absolute freedom of speech, then no speech, no matter how hateful, should be banned. In doing so, you lose a valuable teaching tool.
1.1.6.6.1. Pro: Imagine walking down a street and seeing a group of people carrying a confederate battle flag. You could point to that flag and explain to your child why the Civil war had to be fought, what came out of it, and what happened afterwards. The same could be said of the Nazi Flag, Russian Flag, etc. Without honest debate, people never learn.
1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.
1.2. Pro: Hate speech is harmful; harm is a basis used to restrict rights justifiably.
1.2.1. Pro: If hate speech is more likely than not to cause harms, such as attacks or the eroding of minority rights, then it is justifiable to ban it.
1.2.1.1. Con: Restricting "hate speech" is a violation of "minority rights" itself - by definition it is a majority defining what opinions are acceptable and what opinions are not acceptable. This gives them the ability to punish the minority whose opinions are considered "hateful."
1.2.1.2. Con: This presumes that "hate speech is harmful" and that the harm is not outweighed by the benefits. Benefits include discovering that you are willing \(or not\) to stand up to hateful rhetoric, learning how to manage your emotional reactions to that same rhetoric, making a decision to engage in conversation and attempt to sway the speaker. Growth comes from adversity.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The suggested 'benefits' include struggling for the respect you deserve \(like any other human\) and fighting with groups of people that want to deny the respect for you. Basically what you are saying is that the "benefits" include unnecessary stress.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Hateful rhetoric is the problem, so the benefit of defending against it is no benefit at all, if you can avoid hateful speech.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Hate speech often suggests actions that are specifically meant to cause harm to other human beings based on ethnicity, religious affiliation, or sexual preferences.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The generation of action from speech ignores the concept of responsibility and consequences. The old adage "sticks and stones" express an adult response to hate speech. The answer is to teach people grown-up behavior in society. Your actions are your responsibility.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Repeated hate speech often succeeds in dehumanizing the victims of that speech, making [hate crimes more likely](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/oupu-smp100120.php).
1.2.1.3.3. Con: Banning hateful speech often succeeds in giving it a larger audience, which may cause greater harm to the communities targeted.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: Facebook's recent mass bans of far-right commentators made sure these people were the [focus of news coverage](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48142098) for several days.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: With this platform, individuals may be able to advertise where they will be moving their speech, allowing people to follow them.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Parler, for example, [was set up to counteract the bans](https://theconversation.com/parler-is-bringing-together-mainstream-conservatives-anti-semites-and-white-supremacists-as-the-social-media-platform-attracts-millions-of-trump-supporters-150439) that were happening on Facebook and Twitter. It is now an echo chamber for far-right people repeating harmful ideas.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Parler is still a [largely fringe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/23/parler-conservatives-still-on-twitter/) social media website.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Parler has [far fewer users](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/parler-right-wing-social-media-app-trial/) than other mainstream social media platforms.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Few people join Parler who are not already conditioned to believe and seek out fringe viewpoints and theories.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: After Trump's defeat, Parler became the [most downloaded app](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54873800).
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Parler is home to many fringe-right groups espousing [neo-Nazi and white supremacist](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/I-tried-Parler-the-social-media-app-where-hate-15758094.php) ideals without hinderence.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: Often, people fall prey to harmful ideas because they are [easily accessible](https://www.efolio.soton.ac.uk/blog/yl3a15/design1-assignment1/how-does-social-media-convergence-bring-more-convenience-to-peoples-lives/). If users have to go out of their way to find some content, fewer new individuals will start following.
1.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The rise of social media and the ability of anyone to "trend" has contributed greatly to the rise of [violent extremist hate speech.](https://phys.org/news/2019-10-online-speech-crimes-minorities.html)
1.2.1.3.3.1.2. Con: The temporary focus is better than the continued influence these commentators may have through their continued existence on Facebook.
1.2.1.3.3.2. Con: Over time, these voices will have less visibility, because it will [difficult for people to find them](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/5/30/18645004/twitter-white-supremacy-research-nazi-ban-gadde-dorsey) on major platforms.
1.2.1.3.3.2.1. Con: Despite the ban of Alex Jones on Facebook and Twitter, [many of his videos were easily accessible](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/05/alex-jones-banned-facebook-his-videos-are-still-there-so-are-his-followers/) on those platforms.
1.2.1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Banned videos remain up often only on [pages with small viewership](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-bans-boogaloo-groups-but-some-smaller-groups-remain/), which is why they are not caught by moderators.
1.2.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: People who are targeted with hate speech will not have to constantly see it promoted or accessible.
1.2.1.3.3.3. Pro: Commentators who are banned are [often martyred](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/her-emails-two-point-oh/), which may convince more moderate followers that the content of their speech truly is 'dangerous' and being suppressed.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: If you ban hate speech, people will still break the law around it. If they are arrested, that person may well be elevated to some kind of folk-hero status for swarms of bigots to rally behind. Overall this would lead to worse outcomes and more division.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Many laws are broken but this does not mean we should not have them at all. They send important messages about what governments deem to be acceptable.
1.2.1.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: Provocative and dangerous individuals like [Tommy Robinson](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-44577573) have leveraged their legal punishments into evidence that their 'truths' are being repressed by the state.
1.2.1.3.3.3.2. Con: People who have been censured like [Milo Yiannopoulos](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/24/14715774/milo-yiannopoulos-cpac-pedophile-video-canada) also often recede from the spotlight and eventually, their hateful rhetoric is removed from public discourse.
1.2.1.3.3.4. Con: The effort needed to find more underground sources is still often large enough to restrict access.
1.2.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: It was only after a ban on Hitler's writing was lifted that a [shockingly large number](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38495456) of Germans began being his books.
1.2.1.3.3.4.2. Con: Where restrictions on hate speech are more widespread, more people may deem that effort to be worth undertaking so as to find voices they agree with.
1.2.1.3.4. Pro: Often hate speech is specifically made to [incite violence](https://impakter.com/hurt-feelings-real-danger-hate-speech/) against the targetted group.
1.2.1.4. Con: It is troublesome to define what is "at least more likely... to cause something". Comments on obesity might cause bullying of the obese but that should not restrict my right to criticize unhealthy eating habits.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: The "more likely than not to create harm" measure would eliminate freedom.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Not only is it difficult to find a direct causation link between hate speech and violence, but a policy banning speech based upon its hypothetical, potential effects has no basis in reality. A policy must address the causes or outcomes of a quantifiable issue or flaw, not a hypothetical one.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: 'Justifiably' is a given opinion, not a statement of fact. What is a justifiable restriction to one person is not to another.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Even when hate speech does not seek to justify violence, it often normalizes hatred and stokes fear, which can cause violence.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Remaining in communities where this speech is rampant makes individuals less likely to reflect on their views and more likely to feel afraid. This condition often [breeds violence](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-14/white-nationalism-a-year-after-christchurch-mosque-massacre/12046412).
1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: Many violent attacks were precipitated by [hateful manifestos or rants](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/3/15/18267163/new-zealand-shooting-christchurch-white-nationalism-racism-language) published online.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: Hate speech rarely does this normalizing. [Mainstream figures](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/12/tucker-carlson-trump-fox-news-republicans) who engage in perfectly legal speech spreading harmful ideas are more harmful.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Con: These voices appear moderate compares to extreme, hateful groups. When their speech is limited, these mainstream figures may seem more extreme.
1.2.1.6. Pro: The [recent uptick](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25036&LangID) in hate speech has corresponded with a clear increase in harms towards minority groups.
1.2.1.6.1. Con: Causing harm is not a criterion to judge the level of truth of an assumption, and therefore should not be taken into consideration when it comes to deciding if an opinion is worthy of being shared or not.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: You cannot go through change and progress without harming or upsetting the present ideologies of a system. What is at one stage viewed as hate speech may be necessary to help society move forward.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Hate crimes against Muslims in the US, including tactics such as intimidation and calls for violence, [increased drastically](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/15/assaults-against-muslims-in-u-s-surpass-2001-level/) between 2015 and 2016. These attacks make it necessary for hate speech to be illegal.
1.2.1.6.2.1. Con: Speech that 'calls for violence' can be banned without widening the definition to include hate speech, [as in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions)
1.2.1.6.2.2. Pro: In many cases, this hate speech [directly translated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/) into violence or abuse against Muslim communities.
1.2.1.6.3. Pro: Targets of hate speech indicate that it causes them a [number of harms](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f347/056525fd9a0a66b250f6cc5e7239868a723d.pdf) including them living in fear, feeling silenced and unable to respond to the speech, feel dehumanised and less ability to identify with their religion or ethnicity.
1.2.2. Con: Hate speech has to be proven to be harmful. This will be difficult with so many people saying it is not harmful to them. If it is not harmful in all cases it is not the root of the problem and not definitively harmful. Something else is the problem.
1.2.2.1. Con: Being difficult to prove does not make the claim false.
1.2.2.2. Con: "Many people saying" is an invalid argument.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: At the beginning of the feminist movement many women did not feel discriminated against, and yet today it is clear that at that time women were being denied basic citizen's rights \(like the right to vote\).
1.2.2.3. Con: There are [many](https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2004/05000/Immigrant_Suicide_Rates_as_a_Function_of.9.aspx) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24328619) and [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicides_that_have_been_attributed_to_bullying) that show a link between suicide and hate speech.
1.2.2.4. Pro: The harm of hate speech may differ from case to case.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Hate speech laws will thus have to use the same punishment for statements with different real-life effects.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: It will be hard for many to understand and trust these laws when they feel they are used inconsistently.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Con: Governments can and should be encouraged to, craft their hate speech laws with representatives of the groups they seek to protect present, allowing them to make their policies more precise.
1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.2.4. Pro: Hate speech is [directly related](https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence) to violence.
1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.2.4.2. Con: Verbal statements [can never be](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/opinion/sunday/when-is-speech-violence.html) physically damaging. The violent acts are separate from hateful speech.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: There is science to show that words can have a [powerful effect](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10010030) on your nervous system that could be considered physical harm.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Words can make one sick, alter your brain chemistry, and even [shorten one's life.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/opinion/sunday/when-is-speech-violence.html)
1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: These effects are not caused by the words themselves, but by [chronic stress](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/2017/07/18/is-hate-speech-violent-by-nature/), which itself can be managed and controlled by the affected party.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Hate speech may make members of affected groups feel unsafe.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: Particularly when hate speech is uttered by [prominent individuals](https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-border-patrol-facebook-group-agents-joke-about-migrant-deaths-post-sexist-memes), like police officers, many may feel like those individuals may seek to ostracize them.
1.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: Widespread hate speech may make members of these groups worried that many of the people they interact with on a daily basis hold these views.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: It is likely more efficient to locate and stop potentially violent individuals rather than restricting any speech found that may loosely inspire violence.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: Those committing egregious violence often cite [irrelevant sources](https://www.history.com/news/charles-manson-helter-skelter) as their inspiration. Banning hate speech would likely only be an indirect means of solving this.
1.2.5. Con: Non-physical harm is difficult to understand and quantify. The subjective feelings of individuals is a poor foundation for legislative action.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The ways in which people are affected by hate speech vary widely, meaning drawing firm lines in legislation is a practical impossibility.
1.2.5.2. Pro: People are only harmed by hate speech if they take it seriously, and anyone can choose not to be affected by it.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: People do not choose what hurts or affects their feelings. It is more likely that people will temporarily conceal the impact of hate speech, which may have negative long term effects.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: You may not always find yourself in a privileged position to gracefully ignore hate speech. If, for example, your colleagues or relatives react to it, you have little choice than to react also.
1.2.5.3. Con: Threats also do not include physical harm and yet are perceived as morally wrong, and are banned by law in most countries.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Conflating hate speech with threats is nonsensical; as hate speech is loosely and subjectively defined, and those that consider hate speech to be threats to their person have yet to concretely prove how they are indeed threats, whereas actual threats clearly indicate potential harm to the person or people they're directed towards.
1.3. Pro: Hate speech is a de facto limitation on the free speech of those targeted.
1.3.1. Con: The action of making hate speech illegal could allow the government to stop people from saying things that they do not like or agree with.
1.3.1.1. Con: There exist accountability mechanisms that prevent governments from abusing their ability to limit speech.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: It may be politically costly to limit free speech without the backing of groups who are actively harmed by hate speech.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The [judicial courts](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases) have curbed the government when it comes to attempts to limit free speech before.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: A healthy, robust, and [independent news media](http://www.newsmediauk.org/current-topics/press-freedom) can help curb government infringement on free speech.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: Even so, [censorship still happens](https://archives.cjr.org/cover_story/21st_century_censorship.php) and is present in the modern-day.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Many governments have expanded protections against hateful speech to censor ideas that contradicted the government.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Germany has [banned Nazi symbols and Holocaust denial](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/16/16152088/nazi-swastikas-germany-charlottesville) since the Second World War. Outside of far-right circles, this law is uncontroversial and a core part of historical education.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: In Soviet Russia, the government banned harmful ["bourgeois speech"](https://www.rbth.com/arts/history/2017/06/27/soviet-censorship-how-did-the-ussr-control-the-public_790892) that turned into a blanket ban on any speech that criticized the Bolshevik's authority.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: The Chinese Communist Party bans any speech that ["endangers social harmony"](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china) as a method of cracking down on dissenting speech.
1.3.1.2.4. Con: When governments are intent on oppressing their people, they are often willing to resort to extralegal means, like [arresting opposition](https://mashable.com/2016/10/10/what-nations-throw-opponents-in-jail/?europe=true) and thus do not need speech restrictions.
1.3.2. Pro: Speech that infringes on any other citizen's rights should be banned. Demonizing others to mute their voice [infringes on their free speech](https://mg.co.za/article/2019-12-05-00-hate-speech-infringes-on-free-speech/).
1.3.2.1. Con: All that speech can do is hurt someone's feelings at best. As it does not infringe on any citizen's right, there is no reason to ban it.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Speech can do more than hurt feelings. Many [suicides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15184693) are related to hate speech.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [According to a 2021 study in the US](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784337?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=092021)(In this case-control study of 227 youths, having a severe suicide/self-harm alert in a school-based online safety monitoring program was associated with multiple online risk factors \(including cyberbullying, violence, drug-related content, hate speech, profanity, sexual content, depression, and low-severity self-harm content\). However, the greatest risk was found among youth having multiple types of online risk factors.), online risk factors, such as hate speech can be strongly related with youth suicide-related behaviors.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The relation in the linked study only amounts to a correlation; that it "predicts" suicide does not mean hate speech causes suicide to a meaningful extent.
1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The study also focuses on the case of Immigrant suicide rates, which can also be linked to [difficult social situations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226946263_Constructing_the_Reality_of_the_Immigrant_Life).
1.3.2.1.1.2.2. Con: If the two variables are correlated, it means that increased hateful speech leads to more suicides. Speech is not the only causal factor, but it still appears determinative.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Hate speech should be rooted out through voluntary measures, [like education](https://en.unesco.org/news/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference), rather than punitive ones.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Forcing one to self-censor is just as severe an infringement on free speech as preventing one from speaking.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Rights are important only insofar as we are able to use them. Feeling that it is necessary to censor oneself ultimately restricts one's capacity, then, to the same extent as a ban would.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Some argue that rights are important insofar as we are allowed [to NOT utilize them.](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-scotus-playground-20170420-story.html)
1.3.2.2.2. Con: One's choice to self-censor is not an infringement on free speech, as the person has a choice in whether to speak or not.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: According to a study, [nearly half of Americans self-censor](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/08/free-speech-nearly-half-of-americans-self-censor-study-finds/) because of increasing political polarization.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Con: Those who are self-censored do not meaningfully have the choice to speak. They feel as though their speech will meet [aggressive reactions](https://www.coe.int/en/web/human-rights-channel/media-self-censorship).
1.3.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Whether or not this counts as an infringement on free speech through forced self-censorship should not be based on how one feels.
1.3.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: [Self-censorship](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34744432) can originate in the fear of consequences, and it can be even more harmful than censorship by the state because it shuts down the conversation completely.
1.3.3. Con: By no means does a hateful comment silence its target. Targeted individuals still have the right to respond on many platforms -- in person, in public, online.
1.3.3.1. Con: Constant hateful attacks discourage people from speaking publicly. Public attacks of a minority group create insecurity for that particular group and they may not feel able to respond.
1.3.3.2. Pro: When those affected by harmful speech speak out, their tenacity and passion can often make aggressors look belligerent and cruel, thereby delegitimizing them.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: After the 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville led to violence against counter-protestors, the far-right suffered [major losses in support](https://www.adl.org/blog/two-years-ago-they-marched-in-charlottesville-where-are-they-now) as people saw them as cruel.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Particularly when voters are angry, they may positively respond to the cruelty of politicians: hate speech may just breed more hate speech.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: When hate speech is deemed to be 'anti-PC', [it can often attract people disillusioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/opinion/modi-india-election.html) by mainstream political culture.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: The Black Lives Matter movement has often been portrayed as belligerent, angry, and even violent while protesting against hate speech and physical harms suffered by the Black community.
1.3.3.3. Con: Hate speech, frequently perpetuated by trolls, often push others to leave the conversation as they do not wish to interact with hate speech.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Trolling accounts for a [shockingly large](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/) amount of online activities.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: The worry of having to deal with bad faith opposition may drive people to speak freely only within circles of like-minded people, creating echo chambers and preventing discussions.
1.3.3.3.3. Con: Trolls can be dealt with without banning hate speech.
1.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: Forums can sanction users who repeatedly disrupt conversations.
1.3.3.3.3.1.1. Con: A sanction on a user is a greater restriction of their freedom of speech than simply removing hate speech comments they post.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Con: Any restriction on trolls saying hate speech would be, at least indirectly, a restriction on hate speech.
1.3.4. Pro: Repeated hate speech can often make victims and their communities [feel unsafe](https://impakter.com/hurt-feelings-real-danger-hate-speech/). They are far less likely to speak freely and challenge their society if they worry about their safety.
1.3.4.1. Pro: According to the [American Psychological Association](http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/site/attachments/30/01/2012/Naida_noziegums_ENG_cietusajiem_Internetam.pdf), repeated hate speech is a type of attack that "takes place on two levels; not only is it an attack on one’s physical self, but it is also an attack on one’s very identity”. \(p.11\)
1.3.4.2. Con: Limiting speech is, at best, an indirect way to preserve the safety of vulnerable groups.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: More resources should be expended to [inform the public of the ways speech can harm others](https://www.ft.com/content/5cf4cf8e-698c-4f48-a0a0-cf3cad4738cc). That would make citizens wearier of engaging in that speech, to begin with.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Hateful groups can often gain support from these kinds of measures, as people typically [resent being told to change their ways](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/10/16/is-the-resurgence-of-europes-far-right-a-cultural-or-an-economic-phenomenon/).
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Insofar as hateful speech is causing harm now, it should be restricted, even if more effective strategies should also be pursued.
1.3.4.3. Con: "Feeling unsafe" is qualitatively different from an actual, legal restriction on speech such as a hate speech law represents.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: When people say they ["feel unsafe"](https://medium.com/progressively-speaking/trigger-warning-feeling-unsafe-is-not-the-same-as-being-unsafe-197d7bf96b12) they are often referring to the political conditions that actually do oppress them in day to day life.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: Open democracy requires that such oppressive political conditions do not exist.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Repeated hate speech may make members of minority communities feel [scared to enter politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/many-minorities-frightened-trump-presidency-means).
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: [Many Americans](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/08/free-speech-nearly-half-of-americans-self-censor-study-finds/) are reticent to express their political views publically because they worry of being facing aggressive responses.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: Many minority politicians have described aggressive hate as making them question whether to [continue staying in politics](https://www.thedailybeast.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-i-dont-even-know-if-i-want-to-be-in-politics).
1.3.4.4.3. Con: Hate speech is rarely the cause of this feeling of alienation. It is often [everyday discrimination](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/discrimination) that causes this. Hate speech restrictions will do little to change this.
1.4. Pro: Hate speech legislation is necessary to promote social equality.
1.4.1. Pro: Freedom of speech does not justify hate speech. [Hate speech incites violence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/29/why-america-needs-hate-speech-law/) from either parties and can be the reason for larger, deadlier social problems, involving terrorism, denial of human rights and the like and should not be promoted at all costs.
1.4.1.1. Con: The source provided is an opinion piece with no sources of its own specifically backing up that claim.
1.4.2. Con: Banning hate speech won't stop the speech from spreading, it would only [push it underground](https://www.politico.eu/article/hate-speech-and-terrorist-content-proliferate-on-web-beyond-eu-reach-experts/), which could hate speech to spread unfettered by opposing point of views.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Attempts to suppress misinformation around [COVID vaccinations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/24/ivermectin-covid-peru-misinformation)(Ivermectin had prolific and controversial boosters in the country, including Craig Kelly, a member of parliament, who became a champion of ivermectin and other unproven treatments for Covid. Kelly has routinely shared anti-lockdown, pro-ivermectin messages to his more than 40,000 followers on Telegram. In September, a man claiming to be affiliated with an anti-lockdown medical activist group targeted one small town, with a largely Indigenous population, to push ivermectin, telling the Guardian he viewed the town as a “petri dish” to test the drug.) purely pushed discourse on the topic into other realms of the internet, where it was less challenged.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Banning hate speech fails to adequately address the underlying causes of harmful speech, and as such it will likely reoccur in other, perhaps worse, ways.
1.4.3. Pro: Human dignity is a more important value than free speech. Hate speech puts human dignity in danger. Therefore it should be banned.
1.4.3.1. Con: Speech is more important than someone's subjective interpretation of it, that might be seen as attack on their dignity. Human dignity is too wide of a term in its interpretation to base law on it.
1.4.3.2. Con: Free speech is the foundation of freedom and Democracy.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Hate speech has often been used to [justify racism and anti-democratic regimes](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2019/11/15/the-normalisation-of-far-right-politics-in-poland). The restriction of hate speech, therefore, can be seen as a necessity for democracy.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Democracy implies that all participants have equal respect for each other and their opinions. Therefore, it is a [prerequisite of democracy \(3.3\)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#ReaPluPubPolCul) that oppressive views are excluded.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: A government can only be just if its dictates are [given by the people \(3.3\)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/#PubReaDemApp), who hold their own views. Therefore, it would be unjust for a government to dictate what views one can hold.
1.4.3.2.3.1. Con: Hate speech is not simple speech in that it seeks to express an opinion. It typically has a broader goal of altering social norms and producing [justifications for oppression \(p. 17\)](http://danielwharris.com/papers/DanielWHarrisAndRachelMcKinney-Speech-ActTheory-SocialAndPoliticalApplications.pdf).
1.4.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: The evidence of this is that those who actively advocate hateful positions, like white supremacy, rarely enter civil political discourse, attempting to change people's minds.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Instead, those who believe these things, either hide their beliefs behind [dogwhistles and innuendo](https://www.sapiens.org/language/white-power-dog-whistles/) or simply try to shock people on public forums. Neither of these forms of speech is democratic.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2. Con: All speech within politics has the goal of changing the minds of viewers and justifying one's political project. Banning hate speech still amounts to a state breaching its neutrality towards conceptions of the good.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2.1. Con: There is a distinction between speech which tries to express an opinion for which others can make their own minds and speech which aims to [produce an effect](https://www.wtamu.edu/~mjacobsen/SpActCats.htm) from the listener.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Human dignity is protected by the very [first law of the German Constitution](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artikel_1_des_Grundgesetzes_für_die_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland): "Die Würde des Menschen ist unantastbar. Sie zu achten und zu schützen ist Verpflichtung aller staatlichen Gewalt." \("Human dignity is sacrosanct. It is the duty of all state authorities to respect and protect it."\)
1.4.3.4. Pro: Hate speech threatens human dignity because it allows people to belitte, dehumanise and abuse others without facing any punishment.
1.4.4. Pro: Racism, sexism and many other awful forms of discrimination would finally be punished, thus making us a more accepting and respectful world.
1.4.4.1. Con: Punishing people does not change their opinions or make them more accepting or respectful towards others in the long run.
1.4.5. Con: Social equality is best created by social freedom. Ensuring each citizen has equal rights -- including an equal right to speech -- promotes social equality far better than denying the rights of ideological minorities.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The right to speech is ensured in the [Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Righ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech)ts, adopted in 1948, which states that: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression."
1.4.5.2. Con: An equality solely based on the bare provision of rights is no meaningful equality at all.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: A necessary prerequisite to the possession of rights is the [respect of all other persons](http://carneades.pomona.edu/2017-PPE/15.Anderson.html) within society. A right is merely formal if one's voice is always shouted down or never listened to.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: States cannot be neutral to the values of their society. Instead, [they must actively cultivate them](https://www.socialpolicyconnections.com.au/?p=8854). Therefore, they must stand against social ills like racism and sexism.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: Hate speech legislation makes it clear that the government does not support attacks on minority or disenfranchised groups.
1.4.6. Pro: Hate speech necessarily seeks to denigrate the position and equality of marginalized groups, thereby challenging their claim to equality and right to freedom.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Hate speech often seeks to [belittle the historical problems](https://newrepublic.com/article/159589/conservatives-systemic-racism-denial) of oppression faced by vulnerable groups so as to diminish their political capital.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: [Racial pseudoscience](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/disturbing-resilience-scientific-racism-180972243/) often aims to implicitly claim that certain minorities deserve their lesser conditions and are thus less worthy of assistance. This, therefore, challenges their equality.
1.4.6.2. Con: Some mainstream political parties also [seek these goals](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/windrush-scandal-anniversary-hostile-environment-immigration-a8968861.html). It is more important to challenge these movements than censoring their more extreme wings.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: Major parties pursuing racist policies are more dangerous than individuals spouting hate speech because they can [institutionalize that discrimination](https://www.arabnews.com/institutionalized-islamophobia-us).
1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Individuals spouting hate speech have led to some of the [worst violent attacks](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting) in the Western world in the past 10 years.
1.4.6.2.2. Pro: Banning hate speech may diminish the political capital for addressing discrimination in politics.
1.4.6.2.2.1. Pro: Restrictions on free speech are already highly controversial, [even when they are not institutionalized](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/22/21325942/free-speech-harpers-letter-bari-weiss-andrew-sullivan).
1.4.6.2.2.2. Pro: When free speech is banned, more people may be reluctant to care about more accusations of discrimination against political parties.
1.4.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: Opposition arguments that certain parties ["make everything about identity"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/14/identity-politics-right-left-trump-racism) may become more potent as people feel tired of these issues being politicized.
1.4.6.2.2.3. Con: At best, this is a short-term problem: over time these restrictions will be less controversial and people will continue criticizing institutions that discriminate.
1.4.6.2.2.3.1. Con: Germany's ban on extremist pates remained controversial since World War II and [was repealed in 2017](https://www.democraticaudit.com/2017/09/25/germany-no-longer-bans-extremist-parties-but-which-european-democracies-do-and-why/).
1.4.6.2.2.3.2. Con: The ban will remain controversial as the government will have to continue deciding what counts as hate speech. Each decision will create backlash.
1.4.6.2.2.3.3. Pro: The backlash will diminish as it will become apparent that hate speech is not necessary for a robust public discourse.
1.4.6.2.3. Con: These parties are often [spurred on by their extreme wings](https://www.socialeurope.eu/far-right-populists), who are often better at harnessing the anger of citizens.
1.4.6.2.3.1. Con: There is an [incentive for parties to cater to the middle ground](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-median-voter-theorem-c81630b57fa4) to steal voters from other parties. This means extreme wings often have little influence in determining strategy.
1.4.6.2.3.1.1. Con: The more extremist wings of political parties usually are greatly influential in defining the narrative not only a party makes for itself, but also how the party is defined by their opponents.
1.4.6.2.3.2. Pro: Banning hate speech make these wings less influential insofar as their more outrageous views are not spread.
1.5. Con: It is difficult to define hate speech in a way that works.
1.5.1. Con: Finding the best way for hate speech to work is paramount to a society's success, even if it is difficult. Hate speech encourages bad behavior such as killing or fighting people to resolve problems.
1.5.1.1. Pro: WWII is an example of "fighting" instead of using diplomacy. If we had stopped Hitler's hate speech usage after he used it through hate speech laws, we could have politically ended World War II before the killing began.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Arguing "hate speech" laws could have prevented WWII is a severely misguided position and ignores a century of societal and economic developments in Europe with pre-Bismarck Prussia and in Japan with the Meiji Restoration.
1.5.2. Pro: Hate is a human emotion and speech is a way to express yourself. Hate speech is therefore a human emotional expression. Emotional expressions shouldn't be banned.
1.5.2.1. Con: People also express human emotions such as hate through physical actions, such as punching or assaulting other people. We ban emotional expressions such as that.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Physical assault/a punch has a guaranteed chance to do harm, that someone can get hurt by words is subjective.
1.5.3. Con: All of law involves defining things which are difficult to define.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Courts are frequently asked to make decisions based on ambiguous concepts.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Courts often have to [judge the intent of criminals](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1096588?seq=1). Uncovering one's intent may be even harder to do.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: They typically tend to reach working definitions of these concepts, allowing them to consistently make judgements while [continuing debate to improve](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1096588?seq=1) their use of the concept.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: The ambiguous concepts judges are asked to make judgements on are rarely as politically contentious as free speech issues.
1.5.3.2. Con: Language, emotion, and offense are intangible in a unique way separate from other legal dilemmas.
1.5.4. Pro: Hate speech is at risk of being defined too broadly and impinging on free speech generally.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The banning of hate speech is impractical. The "hate speech determination committee" could not possibly enact a structure to define hate speech. The line would always be moving.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Hate speech is too subjective, and government legislation involving it is likely to dissatisfy many of the people affected by such legislation.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: People are incredibly [divided](https://www.cato.org/blog/82-say-its-hard-ban-hate-speech-because-people-cant-agree-what-speech-hateful) on how to define hate speech.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: Even the US Supreme Court has [difficulty](http://Even the Supreme Court has a diffculty imposing judicial action grounded in 'hate speech', despite having a definite, albeit extremely broad and subjectively perceived definition of hate speech.) imposing judicial action grounded in 'hate speech', despite having a definite, albeit extremely broad and subjectively perceived definition of hate speech.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: Often hate speech laws are very clear, flexible and not oppressive.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: Some hate speech laws in Germany have been applied liberally to include insults against women or to broadly "uphold human dignity" [without a strict definition](https://www.dw.com/en/german-hate-speech-laws-also-cover-misogynist-abuse-court-rules/a-53819941) of what that entails.
1.5.4.1.2.2. Pro: Most states with free speech laws tend to be very specific to what kinds of symbols and ideas they reject, leaving little room for ambiguity.
1.5.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: Anti-Nazi laws in Germany tend to refer to [very specific symbols and books](https://www.dw.com/en/how-germany-deals-with-hitlers-mein-kampf/a-18670734) which are banned.
1.5.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This ban was [highly controversial](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/germanys-outdated-wrongheaded-ban-on-nazi-books-like-mein-kampf/251605/) as many argued that it actually made it more likely that neo-Nazi groups would have access to harmful literature.
1.5.4.1.2.2.2. Con: If a law is too specific about what kinds of speech it restricts, it will be unable to respond to new ways that hateful groups devise to usurp the laws, thereby undermining its efficacy.
1.5.4.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Groups tend to hide their hate speech through [innocuous seeming symbols](https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols). Truly banning hate speech would therefore necessitate banning fairly mundane speech.
1.5.4.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Ambiguous symbols make up a minority of hate speech. Banning clearly white supremacist groups and rhetoric would go a long way in achieving the goals of the ban.
1.5.4.1.3. Con: [Legal precedents](https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/map/TheImportanceofPrecedent.html) would be created that set clear limits on when restricting speech is justified and unjustified. That is how most laws work.
1.5.4.2. Pro: What constitutes hate in speech is subjective and depends largely on the audience. Therefore, it is impossible to define what would be banned and what is allowed.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Hate is too subjective a term to apply legislatively. Without a true, immutable definition of hate, it's dangerous to impose without foreseeing an arena in which speech is restricted under any cosmetic circumstance. Law should not be immutable. It should be "a living document." So, with the exception of liable, all forms of speech should be constitutionally protected.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: In today's society, where people become triggered at the slightest suggestion of hurt feelings, the danger is that the brush of what is considered hate speech would be painted far too wide and restrict open discussion on sensitive subjects that need to be talked about.
1.5.4.3. Con: Hate speech can be succinctly and fairly defined as speech that calls for the destruction, de-humanization, or harming of specific groups that are defined by characteristics that group members cannot voluntarily change eg, race, gender, sexuality nation of birth, etc.
1.5.5. Pro: If hate speech is to be banned, this must include all hate speech \(however defined\). This means that one could not express hate speech for Nazis, the KKK, or any other hate group.
1.5.5.1. Pro: When hate speech is banned, it is typically used by those in power to further oppress dissent, such as [Doe vs Michigan](https://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/doe.html) where words such as ["white trash" caused black individuals to get in trouble](https://www.aclu.org/other/speech-campus), even though it was intended to protect those individuals.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The result of this is that no one could speak out in opposition against the choices of these groups, for this could be constituted as hate speech against their chosen identity/lifestyle. These groups should receive social pressure to change. Thus, hate speech should not be banned.
1.5.5.3. Con: Hate speech refers to speech that [seeks to oppress and demonize people](https://www.rightsforpeace.org/hate-speech) based on their ascriptive features. Insofar as choosing to support the KKK is a choice, hating the KKK is justified.
1.6. Con: Hate speech is just offensive speech; offense is not a justifiable reason for legal sanctions.
1.6.1. Con: Speech can incite acts of terror, which goes beyond offense. This ideology that the people's right of free speech to incite violence is more important than people's lives is dangerous and should not go unpunished by the removal of hate speech laws.
1.6.1.1. Con: Banning speech that is not a call to action for violence allows all speech to be banned.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Hate speech calls for violence against certain people or groups. That puts it in a class beyond simply being offensive.
1.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.2.1.
1.6.1.4. Pro: Examples of true hate speech include Hitler's speeches after 1820 regarding the total annihilation of the Jews and speeches given by the southern states of America suggesting that the blacks are inferior to the whites, and therefore they must be slaves.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: Freedom to incite acts of terror comes with risks, but the example of Hitler's speeches is not comparable. A political movement that gains popularity through its initial rhetoric includes freedom of speech but he was granted the legal right to dictate without any legal objection thanks to the enabling act. Freedom of speech alone did not kill millions of people but paired with dangerous dictatorial powers and it became forced. Freedom of 'inoffensive speech' is not objective and is regressive.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Many recent far-right attacks have been directly [motivated by media](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-14/white-nationalism-a-year-after-christchurch-mosque-massacre/12046412) spreading hateful messages and misinformation.
1.6.2. Con: Offense can cause emotional damage. This emotional damage can result in suicide, self harm, etc. This can be grounds for legal sanctions.
1.6.2.1. Con: Using words to verbally abuse / attack / bully etc, which can have lasting damaging effects on individuals, is not the same as 'hate speech'. One being malicious speech with an intent to insult and degrade someone and the other being legitimate perspectives that inadvertently offends. Free speech is not just for the inoffensive. It is better that such perspectives are heard as it allows us to challenge it with the same tools.
1.6.2.2. Con: Self harm or suicide is an effect of dozens of circumstances in one's life such as family, environment, school, financial status, relationship status, achievements, some speech and many others. Linking it just to some speech while ignoring every other factor to ban certain speech is ignorant and therefore wrong. The side effect of such ban would be "shut up or I'll harm myself".
1.6.2.3. Con: Anybody could be offended by anything. If it becomes illegal to offend people, then nobody could speak.
1.6.3. Pro: Censorship of speech is not the best approach. Free speech must be for all in society and not just for the inoffensive. Allowing speech with prejudices towards others can be difficult to hear but it is safer out in the open where society can see the argument and progress in the social conversation.
1.6.3.1. Con: A specific type of control can be beneficial to ensure that online communities are safe and free from hate speech.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: [The Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1135) from the European Union has been created to respond to the proliferation of racist and xenophobic hate speech online in order to create a safer online community.
1.6.4. Pro: Deeming something as "hate speech" is more often than not simply a way to silence someone with a different opinion.
1.6.4.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that those who use hate speech accusations for personal benefit will be in charge of crafting hate speech legislation.
1.6.5. Pro: As Jordan Peterson once [said](https://jordanpetersonquotes.com/order-able-think-risk-offensive/), "In order to think, you have to risk being offensive." In short, there will always be someone who will choose to be offended at your thoughts, so one cannot simply 'not offend' people, without surrendering their capability to express thought in the first place.
1.6.5.1. Con: One can easily challenge the opinions of others without making them feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: People can find [reason in anything](https://madamenoire.com/1080935/the-psychology-behind-people-who-are-always-offended/) to be offended by.
1.6.6. Pro: Hate speech is legal on the grounds that any offence taken is fabricated by the recipient of the speech based on their own interpretation, and that any actions caused by the speech are made by the recipient entirely.
1.6.6.1. Con: [No definition](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf) of hate speech allows punishment for mere 'offense'. Instead, they tend to refer to clear forms of abuse with demonstrable impacts on marginalized groups.
