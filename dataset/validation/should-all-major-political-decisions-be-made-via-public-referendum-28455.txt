Discussion Name: Should all major political decisions be made via public referendum?

1. All major political decisions should be made via public referendum.
1.1. Con: Some major political decisions require specialised knowledge that the average citizen does not have.
1.1.1. Pro: Reducing political decisions to a binary yes or no leads to worse decisions
1.1.1.1. Con: It is better to make a bad decision than to continue debating the issue without making an active attempt at resolving the issue at hand.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is no potential for improvement when no decision is made. Even if the decision made is bad, work can be done to either mitigate its effects or to attempt to repeal it.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If all decisions are made by referendum, then a bad decision will need to be changed by referendum, and that takes time. Furthermore, any attempt to put the question back to the people is likely to face accusations of subverting the will of the people.
1.1.1.2. Pro: This makes people more likely to rely on political messaging such as soundbites and simple phrases to make their decision on these complex issues.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Claims that voting to leave the EU would result in [£350 million a week being spent on the NHS](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/nigel-farage-350-million-pledge-to-fund-the-nhs-was-a-mistake/amp/) were important influences on people voting for Brexit.
1.1.1.3. Con: People who do not have enough information about the issue in question can choose not to vote.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Many people are [not self-aware](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/wisdom-in-ignorance-knowing-what-you-dont-know/) to the point that they realize they lack information.
1.1.1.4. Pro: "Surveys taken in the aftermath of a referendum campaign regularly show that “[insufficient information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379415000384#bib22)” is one of the most common complaints of citizens about the referendum process." \(pg 144\)
1.1.1.5. Con: Independent bodies can be set up which provide information to the public on the referendum issue.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Independent experts can provide information to the public ahead of a referendum.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Experts might provide information, but there is no guarantee that the public will understand it.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: Simply because such bodies exist does not mean that they will be listened to.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Within the Brexit referendum, there was an anti-expert mentality among some [campaigners](https://www.ft.com/content/3be49734-29cb-11e6-83e4-abc22d5d108c).
1.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The current measles [outbreak](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/measles-outbreaks-new-normal) shows that expertise from government bodies is often ignored.
1.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: During the 'Brexit' referendum the Electoral Reform Commission's free online resource \(A Better Referendum\) had limited take-up with only 12,000 unique visitors to the site. [\(Page 35\).](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/its-good-to-talk/)
1.1.1.5.3. Con: Most voters are ignorant or misinformed not because of a lack of available information, but [because the cost to them of acquiring political information exceeds the benefits](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/10/the-dance-of-the-dunces-trump-clinton-election-republican-democrat/).
1.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Only about [34%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2016/06/27/american-voters-are-ignorant-but-not-stupid/#d0694d07ff17) of Americans can name the three branches of the federal government: executive, legislative and judicial.
1.1.1.5.3.2. Con: Much of the information available to voters consists of fake news and conspiracy theories that end up confusing them.
1.1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Almost half of registered Republicans thought Clinton staffers’ leaked e-mails “[contained code words for pedophilia, human trafficking and satanic ritual abuse](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/28/pizzagate-theory-believed-by-nearly-half-of-republ/)".
1.1.1.5.3.2.2. Pro: [Professional PR companies](https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2019/05/07/its-not-just-a-conspiracy-heres-how-much-global-news-is-prepared-by-pr-propaganda-firms/), with extensive knowledge and research in social engineering, promote false propaganda.
1.1.1.5.3.2.3. Pro: A [survey](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/research-analysis/the-publics-brexit-misperceptions) revealed that the British public has significant misconceptions of the facts relevant to Brexit.
1.1.1.5.4. Pro: In Ireland, the [Referendum Commission](https://www.refcom.ie/) is responsible for disseminating factual information to the public on any issue subject to a referendum.
1.1.1.5.5. Pro: In California, the Secretary of State is responsible for publishing a "[Voter Information Guide](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voter-information-guides/)" which provides details about the referendum proposal as well as statements from groups supporting and opposing the proposal.
1.1.1.6. Pro: This makes it harder for people to vote appropriately as they lack the full extent of the information necessary to make their decision. This is because people [rarely possess](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2016/06/27/american-voters-are-ignorant-but-not-stupid/#7916ae5f7ff1) in-depth knowledge of a specific political or social issue.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: This can result in people [opting to play safe by voting no](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/in-referendums-people-are-often-inclined-to-answer-a-different-question-1.1476406), skewing the referendum results.
1.1.1.7. Pro: A [2015 Greek referendum on the EU bailout package](http://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-direct-democracy-trouble-with-referendums-eu-leave/) required citizens to vote yes/no to an extremely complex and technical question on public finance.
1.1.1.7.1. Pro: Greek citizens were ask to answer yes/no to documents on '[Reforms for the Completion of the Current Program](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33311422)' and '[Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33311422).'
1.1.1.8. Pro: This means voters can end up turning to the guidance of trusted authority figures or choices that fit within a familiar narrative for the answers instead of assessing the information available for themselves and make their decisions in a non-partisan way.
1.1.1.8.1. Pro: Most of the regions that voted for President Santos in 2014 [also voted for the Colombian peace deal](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html) in 2016 which he had endorsed.
1.1.1.8.2. Pro: Politicians often reframe the referendum into [simplistic, straightforward narratives](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html). The result is that votes become less about the actual policy question than about contests between which narrative voters find more appealing.
1.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: During the Brexit referendum, neither side emphasized the specifics of membership in the bloc, instead framing the vote as a choice about which grand goals to emphasize. The [“Remain”](https://journals.openedition.org/rfcb/1370) campaign presented membership as a matter of economic stability. The [“Leave”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5712068/) campaign emphasized immigration.
1.1.1.9. Pro: The Brexit referendum was marred by fake news.
1.1.1.9.1. Pro: Social media companies allowed [fake news](https://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/how-social-media-stood-by-and-did-nothing-about-fake-news-during-brexit-and-us-president-votes-434754.html) to proliferate around the time of the referendum.
1.1.1.9.2. Pro: Due to their [ideological leaning](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/brexit-eu-referendum-media-coverage-partisan-a8731051.html), media corporations were responsible for lying around the time of the referendum.
1.1.2. Pro: A survey in 2016 found that "[complicated language](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/democratic-duty_should-we-worry-about-low-voter-turnouts-in-switzerland-/44248880)" was the top reason young people in Switzerland gave for not voting in referendums.
1.1.3. Con: Websites such as [fullfact.org](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2092182-there-are-better-ways-to-decide-the-big-issues-than-referendums/) allow people to educate themselves and fact-check arguments from referendum campaigns.
1.1.3.1. Con: Full fact and similar sites are useful but voters don't have the time to do this for every issue.
1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.1.3.3. Con: Just because people can inform themselves doesn't mean that they will.
1.1.4. Pro: Foreign policy and security decisions are often made based on confidential information which, if made public, could pose security concerns. As such, it is better to not have these decisions made by referendum.
1.1.4.1. Con: There are very few actual instances where information is too confidential to be shared with the public.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: There is a [serious problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/opinion/the-broken-system-of-classifying-government-documents.html) with overclassifying documents in the USA.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The U.S. Defence Department and National Security Council experts have estimated that [50 to 90%](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/opinion/national-security-and-americas-unnecessary-secrets.html) of classified documents have been classified unnecessarily.
1.1.5. Pro: Economic policy is often made based on information provided by expert advisors. It is better to rely on this expertise, rather than a public vote, for important economic policies.
1.1.5.1. Con: Economists [disagree](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/why-economists-do-not-agree.asp) about economic philosophy and policy direction. Thus, it is difficult to decide which expert to listen to.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: The ministers who have to make the decisions will have good advice and references to help them choose the experts. They are also paid well to take responsibility for those choices.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Human advancement is best achieved by those with the greatest knowledge and skill in their respective areas. Asking everyone to decide on everything reduces debate to the lowest common denominators and holds back progress.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Citizens may vote, for example, for a tax rate that is preferable to them personally but is not ideal for the overall economy.
1.1.5.4. Pro: The US President is advised by the [Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers) of Economic Advisors.
1.1.6. Pro: Brexit is a [complex issue](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45788142) which makes it difficult for voters to make an informed opinion on it.
1.1.6.1. Pro: David Cameron held the Brexit vote on whether to depart the European Union expecting that it would [bolster his decision to stay in the bloc](https://www.ft.com/content/4f8634c6-3873-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7) and would thus silence British politicians who wanted to leave.
1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.1.8. Con: Politicians also do not have the expertise to make these decisions.
1.1.8.1. Con: Unlike the public, politicians are held accountable for their actions through elections and therefore have an incentive to inform themselves if they want to be re-elected.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: Politicians do not necessarily need to be policy experts to campaign effectively. Campaigns often are more to do with [beating](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/11/political-campaigning-advertising-golden-rules) the opposition \(e.g. personal attacks or use of humour\) rather than debate on specific policy details.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Political debates have the ability to impact [electoral races](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/12/12847632/debates-trump-clinton-polls-political-science).
1.1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Political debates can be used as a tool to win over [undecided voters](https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/22/inenglish/1555917295_840791.html).
1.1.8.1.2. Con: Only if they want to be re-elected they are accountable.
1.1.8.2. Pro: There is a growing number of '[career politicians](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11251185/Can-we-stop-the-rise-of-the-career-politician.html)' meaning they do not have any professional experience outside politics.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: In the UK's 2015 election, [26%](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11498660/Revealed-how-many-General-Election-candidates-have-had-real-jobs-and-how-many-are-professional-politicians.html) of new candidates were political professionals.
1.1.8.2.2. Con: In the United States 2018 Mid-term elections [6 politicians with science backgrounds were elected](https://gizmodo.com/here-are-all-the-candidates-with-science-backgrounds-wh-1830281137) including a nuclear engineers and a biochemist.
1.1.8.2.3. Con: The experiences described in the article of assisting politicians, or working in similar areas such as lobbying, can give politicians experience which would be more relevant than other professions.
1.1.8.3. Pro: Even where politicians are experts in a particular area, they will not have experience in every area required.
1.1.8.4. Con: Politicians do not always need expertise to make decisions, as they have teams of advisors and civil servants with specific policy knowledge who can assist them.
1.1.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.1.8.4.2. Pro: Ministers in the UK are assisted by [special advisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_adviser_\(UK\)).
1.1.8.4.3. Con: Without expertise politicians cannot understand which advice is best to follow. Advisors often give conflicting advice or opinions, so politicians need to decide which advice to follow.
1.1.8.4.4. Con: Politicians often do not listen to their advisors.
1.1.8.4.4.1. Pro: [Research](https://qz.com/1059352/researchers-have-shown-that-politicians-dont-let-facts-get-in-the-way-of-their-beliefs/) has shown that politician's prior beliefs affected how they interpret factual belief and when presented with evidence that went against their prior beliefs politicians doubled down on their original beliefs.
1.1.8.5. Con: Politicians have access to experts in topics, and it's their job to weigh different positions into their actions
1.1.8.6. Con: Often elected politicians have varied experiences.
1.1.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.
1.1.9. Con: Important policy decisions are often not technical questions but [involve questions of preferences or balancing priorities / interests](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d02/70d0603be86615285e91518957a6466bf427.pdf). \(Pg 4\)
1.1.10. Con: In an ideal world there would be a period of public debate about the referendum's question, leading to better understanding by the public.
1.1.10.1. Con: Real debate is most likely only possible with [repeated interactions amongst individuals](http://www.unige.ch/ses/spo/static/simonhug/hmfur/ecpr09bochsler_hug.pdf), which only occurs in places like parliament \(p.3\).
1.1.10.1.1. Con: Parliament is not the only open forum where people can debate these issues.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Experts commonly are asked to give opinions on issues in public forums such as writing [opinion pieces](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/29/brexit-is-still-chilling-the-economy-two-experts-debate-the-uk-outlook) or engaging in [live debates or forums](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/centre-for-brexit-studies/news-and-events/centre-for-brexit-studies-celebrates-conference-success).
1.1.10.1.2. Con: Parliament can still debate the details of policy and then put the final decision to the public in a referendum.
1.1.10.2. Con: We do not \(and never will\) live in an ideal world.
1.2. Con: Referendums can shine a spotlight on [fringe movements](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-direct-democracy-trouble-with-referendums-eu-leave/).
1.2.1. Con: If an issue constitutes a major political decision, there is likely to be significant interest in the matter and thus extending beyond the realm of fringe movements.
1.2.2. Con: If a movement is powerful enough to instigate a referendum, then it is unlikely to qualify as a fringe.
1.2.3. Pro: By having binary choice questions, referendums empower extremist sides on an issue by giving them equal platforms.
1.2.3.1. Con: A [multiple choice referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum) can be used to prevent a binary choice being required.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The [1998 Puerto Rican referendum](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/us/looking-beyond-vote-in-puerto-rico-after-none-of-the-above-is-top-choice.html) offered voters a choice between statehood, independence, free association, being a territorial commonwealth, or none of the given options.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The [1980 referendum in Sweden on nuclear policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Swedish_nuclear_power_referendum) offered voters three choices.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: A multiple choice referendum can still result in a complex policy issue being simplified on the ballot.
1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: If a second Brexit referendum were to be held, many [commentators](https://theconversation.com/brexit-deadlock-this-three-way-referendum-design-could-break-it-108217) believe that multiple options should be on the ballot but the available choices cannot include all possible options.
1.2.3.1.4. Con: Multiple choice referendums can [encourage people to vote against their most hated position](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/07/justine-greening-second-referendum-brexit-three-question-brexit-chequers) rather than what they actually believe in.
1.2.3.2. Pro: The referendum in the Netherlands, in which 61 percent voted against ratifying an association agreement with Ukraine, [empowered](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.eu/article/brexit-direct-democracy-trouble-with-referendums-eu-leave/amp/) extreme figures like the far-right anti-Islam parliamentarian Geert Wilders.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Reducing an issue down to two options assumes there are two equally valid sides to an issue when in some cases one is much more extreme.
1.2.4. Con: "Fringe" movements are not inherently bad. They are just movements which have been kept out of power.
1.2.4.1. Con: The [ERG](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/revealed-the-files-that-expose-erg-as-a-militant-party-within-a-party/) is a fringe movement that has usurped the UK state machine entirely.
1.2.4.2. Con: Many of them have been kept out of power because of their harmful nature.
1.2.4.3. Pro: The [leftist Green Party](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-green-party-haidhausen-munich-elections-social-democrats-spd-is-the-new-red/), a [radical environmentalist](https://qz.com/331377/the-uks-green-party-has-some-far-out-policies-and-young-people-love-it/) political party, is gaining more support in many European countries.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Fringe movements can give hope and a promise for change to disenfranchised demographics.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Left wing populist movements are categorised as 'inclusionary' placing an emphasis on representing groups who have been left out of the political system. For example, in Latin America, populist leaders have focused on [policies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/exclusionary-vs-inclusionary-populism-comparing-contemporary-europe-and-latin-america/AAB33C1316BE16B8E4DE229519362E27) to help those from low socioeconomic groups \(p. 159\).
1.2.4.5. Pro: In Anchorage, Alaska, a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Municipality_of_Anchorage,_Alaska,_Proposition_1) was held to allow for sex-specific standards to be enforced on bathrooms. The referendum and its defeat allowed voters to become more aware of transgender issues.
1.2.4.6. Pro: Referendums have often been used to force the government to [provide greater protection for minority rights](https://lawspring.org/the-court-of-public-opinion-the-role-of-referendums-in-protecting-human-rights-9aa6a287fbe0).
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: In 2018 the Irish public voted in a referendum to overturn the [ban on abortion](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44256152) by 66.4% to 33.6%, with a turn-out of [64.5%](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/abortion-referendum/abortion-referendum-turnout-is-thirdhighest-ever-for-a-referendum-in-ireland-36949137.html).
1.2.4.6.2. Con: Studies suggest that referendums that would increase civil rights of minorities are [most frequently rejected at the polls](http://www.unige.ch/ses/spo/static/simonhug/hmfur/ecpr09bochsler_hug.pdf) \(p.4\).
1.2.4.6.2.1. Pro: This is [particularly strong in smaller communities](http://www.unige.ch/ses/spo/static/simonhug/hmfur/ecpr09bochsler_hug.pdf) where the tyranny of the majority may occur \(p.4\).
1.2.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Direct legislation that would strengthen the rights of homosexual minorities is [most often rejected](http://www.unige.ch/ses/spo/static/simonhug/hmfur/ecpr09bochsler_hug.pdf) in referendum votes in states with small populations \(p.4\).
1.2.4.6.2.2. Pro: [79% of the Bahamas voted against](http://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-direct-democracy-trouble-with-referendums-eu-leave/) a non-discrimination bill that would allow greater protection and equality for men and women.
1.2.4.6.3. Con: In 2018, Taiwan [voted to restrict marriage](https://qz.com/1474097/taiwan-votes-against-same-sex-marriage-in-referendum/) exclusively to heterosexual couples.
1.2.4.6.3.1. Pro: This referendum undid previous protections for minorities in Taiwan. In 2017, the Taiwanese High Court had ruled that [restricting marriage to heterosexual couples was unconstitutional](https://qz.com/1474097/taiwan-votes-against-same-sex-marriage-in-referendum/).
1.2.4.6.3.2. Con: Taiwan's voter threshold is unusually low, a referendum [only needs 25% of voters to vote yes](https://qz.com/1474097/taiwan-votes-against-same-sex-marriage-in-referendum/) in order for it to pass.
1.2.4.6.4. Con: In 2018, Romania tried to use referendums to [make same-sex marriages and unions](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/655209169/romanian-referendum-seeks-to-broaden-same-sex-marriage-restrictions-in-eastern-e) illegal in the state's constitution.
1.2.4.6.5. Con: In 2013, Croatia [voted to amend the country's constitution](https://www.politico.eu/article/croatia-to-ban-gay-marriage-following-referendum/) to permanently ban same-sex marriage.
1.2.4.6.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.6.2.2.
1.2.5. Con: Fringe movements often focus on issues that only a small group in society tends to care about. As such, it can be difficult to generate sufficient popular support for an issue to have a referendum on it.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Fringe movements include groups such as the early greens, far right and communist parties. They usually are usually [‘not electorally relevant’](https://www.kai-arzheimer.com/fringe-parties-arzheimer.pdf) \(p. 1\).
1.2.6. Pro: Even if the referendum is not successful, it makes a fringe issue more politically salient. This may result in politicians introducing similar, less extreme policies.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Following the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, Westminster introduced increased [devolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum#Domestic_reaction) powers to the Scottish parliament.
1.2.6.2. Pro: In close referendums, there will be close to 50% of voters who are not happy. A compromise policy may be offered by office-seeking politicians, in order to keep voters happy.
1.2.7. Pro: Referendums can breed populism.
1.2.7.1. Pro: This correlation can be shown by a series of votes in Europe in recent times. [Greece’s 2015 anti-austerity referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Greek_bailout_referendum), [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit), and [Hungary’s 2016 vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Hungarian_migrant_quota_referendum) against European Union migration policies are all examples of populists using referendums to push back against liberal institutions.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Three referendums over 10 years \([2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Turkish_constitutional_referendum), [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Turkish_constitutional_referendum), and [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum)\) have marked Turkey’s trajectory toward populist authoritarianism, and have altered Turkey’s political system from parliamentary to presidential.
1.2.7.3. Con: Constitutional referendums can be used to increase liberal safeguards against populist authoritarianism.
1.2.7.3.1. Pro: In 2018, voters in Ecuador approved a package of constitutional amendments that limits elected officials to two terms in office. [This barred](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/05/ecuador-votes-to-limit-presidents-terms-in-blow-to-rafael-correa) the left wing populist Rafael Correa from running for office again in the next presidential election.
1.2.7.3.2. Pro: [In 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bolivian_constitutional_referendum), Bolivian voters rejected the possibility of a fourth term for the left-wing populist President Evo Morales in a constitutional referendum.
1.2.7.3.2.1. Con: A year after Bolivia’s referendum, [the high court ruled](https://www.dailysabah.com/americas/2017/11/29/bolivias-top-court-ignores-referendum-results-allows-morales-to-run-for-4th-term) that term limits [could not](http://www.iconnectblog.com/2017/12/how-the-bolivian-constitutional-court-helped-the-morales-regime-to-break-the-political-insurance-of-the-bolivian-constitution/) be imposed, freeing Morales to run for re-election beyond the additional term the referendum might have secured.
1.2.7.4. Pro: [In 2016](https://www.democracy-international.org/how-dutch-government-trying-delete-referendum-law), [GeenPeil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeenPeil), a Dutch populist political initiative, [initiated](https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/136147) a referendum on the European Union-Ukraine association treaty. Although voter turnout was low \(32 percent\), disapproval of the treaty was relatively high \(61 percent\). This created a politically awkward situation for the Netherlands and the EU. In 2017, the Netherlands’ Council of State claimed that referendums were a [threat to democracy](https://nltimes.nl/2017/04/06/referendums-threat-democracy-dutch-council-state), and in February 2018, the Dutch parliament [voted to remove](https://www.ft.com/content/06166110-1af0-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6) the provision.
1.2.7.5. Con: Switzerland's political landscape is characterized by "[Direct Democracy](https://www.thelocal.ch/20180523/how-switzerlands-direct-democracy-system-works)", which requires for a referendum to be held on all important government decisions. The Swiss parliament is very balanced though. The populist parties are not the majority.
1.2.7.5.1. Con: Optional referendums held in Switzerland [are not](http://aceproject.org/ace-en/focus/direct-democracy/referendums/mobile_browsing/onePag) always binding.
1.2.7.5.1.1. Con: Following the precedent set by the Brexit referendum, advisory [referendums](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIV_yy_WsAA9uAf?format=jpg&name=medium) in the UK can be made binding by [simple diktat](https://www.radiofreeuk.org/blogs/paul/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ExternalLink_5169508516102144.png) from the Prime Minister.
1.3. Pro: People should have a right to vote on major policy decisions as these decisions will affect them directly.
1.3.1. Con: People shouldn't have the right to vote on major policy decisions that will affect them directly unless they are adequately informed on the actual facts.
1.3.1.1. Con: Determining whether one has adequate factual knowledge on every major policy decision, is likely to be difficult to determine.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Some may have more factual knowledge on one topic than on another topic. Thus, this process would involve tracking the knowledge of every individual in relation to every topic.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: A simple competence test before any referendum could be used.
1.3.2. Pro: Referendums afford citizens this right by allowing them to cast votes on major issues themselves, not indirectly by representatives on their behalf.
1.3.2.1. Pro: A [year-long international research initiative](https://www.civicus.org/index.php/re-imagining-democracy) on democracy, led by the global civil society alliance CIVICUS, [surveyed](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/do-referenda-improve-democracy/) the views and concerns of thousands of people in almost 80 countries worldwide and found that most feel excluded from political decision-making and want to have a direct say in the decisions that affect their lives.
1.3.3. Con: If referendums were held regularly, turnout for these referendums would likely decrease meaning they wouldn't always reflect popular opinion.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Switzerland holds referendums every year. Of the 10 referendums held in 2018, voter turnout was between [33.7% and 54.84%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Swiss_referendums).
1.3.3.1.1. Con: However, studies completed over multiple referendums in Switzerland found that around [three-quarters of the voting population participate regularly in referendums](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/democratic-duty_should-we-worry-about-low-voter-turnouts-in-switzerland-/44248880).
1.3.4. Con: The public does not always make good decisions in referendums.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Almost half of the population is below average intelligence: this makes it [unlikely](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/highly-intelligent-people-avoid-making-bad-decisions-by-doing-6-things-according-to-psychology.html) that the overall population will make intelligent decisions.
1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.3.4.3. Con: The alternative is that politicians make these decisions, who can also make poor decisions due to [arrogance and short-term thinking.](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2019/04/why-our-political-leaders-make-terrible-decisions)
1.3.4.4. Pro: Referendum votes often become [clouded by voter's views on the incumbent government or the popularity of particular politicians.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379415000384) \(pg 141\)
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: In the 1992 Canadian constitutional referendum the deal negotiated by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was referred to by its opponents as the "[Mulroney deal.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3232122.pdf)" \(pg 9\)
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3232122.pdf) has found that voters with negative views of Mulroney were more likely to vote against the "Mulroney deal". \(pg 29\)
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: The [standing of political parties in opinion polls](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html) influence how people vote in a referendum.
1.3.4.4.2.1. Pro: Opinion polls are often [misleading](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/25/dirty-little-secret-opinion-polls-general-election-why-wrong) and are a poor metric to gauge a party's popularity, leading to people basing their vote on misinformed information.
1.3.4.5. Con: We have two things: I\) better technology for communication and ii\) a better level of mass education, than in the times when 'representative' democracy was formed.
1.3.4.5.1. Con: Even so referendums could be improved further. We could ask everybody who completes a vote to pass a short set of test questions. We could even go further and 'upweight' their vote according to their baseline 'knowledge' score.
1.3.5. Con: Representatives are a necessary middle-man between the voting public and policy creation.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Organizing such frequent, large-scale referendums would be a massive financial undertaking. Organizing presidential elections is already an immensely expensive task \(paying poll workers and renting polling places\).
1.3.5.1.1. Con: In the United States, [referendums are often put on the ballot papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit) at the Presidential and Mid-term elections meaning there is no additional cost to running a referendum. Other countries could adopt this model.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: The 2018 Romanian gay marriage referendum [cost taxpayers $50 million.](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/08/655528971/romanian-referendum-that-would-define-marriage-fails)
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: Ireland has spent [over €133 million](https://www.thejournal.ie/referendums-costs-3106413-Jan2017/) on referendums since 2001.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: The cost of staging the 2016 British referendum on membership of the European Union was [£130 million](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-referendum-costs/britains-eu-referendum-cost-almost-130-million-pounds-to-organise-idUKKBN1OD1FT).
1.3.5.1.5. Pro: New Zealand's referendum on changing the national flag cost [$26 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Zealand_flag_referendums#Cost).
1.3.5.1.6. Con: Most important government functions such as healthcare, education or defence are costly undertakings. The cost is worth the benefits these functions bring to a state's citizens.
1.3.5.1.7. Con: In the future it is likely that e-voting will be used which '[reduces](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/digital-voting-could-boost-participation-but-there-is-a-dark-side/) costs for the state' meaning it will be easier to hold referendums.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Significant cumulative man-hours would have to be spent by the public on voting without representatives. The concept of electing a representative to vote for what you believe in saves the general public from sinking a disproportionate amount of time into voting on each individual policy proposal.
1.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Direct democracy has been shown to [not](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017700738) increase politicians' responsiveness to policy requests.
1.3.6. Pro: Policy makers are often beholden to other groups such as their party or lobby groups, meaning legislative outcomes do not always reflect the will of the people.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Lobby groups have been accused of [hijacking elections](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/how_wal_mart_stole_christmas%C2%A0%E2%80%94_and_hijacked_american_politics/), making politicians subservient to their will.
1.3.6.2. Pro: [Political donations](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political-donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise) often effect the voting behavior of politicians so they do not reflect the will of the electorate.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The Citizens United v. FEC [ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) gave greater power to corporations to make political donations. This [influences](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2823778) the position politicians can campaign for in referendums.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: This effect can be mitigated by stricter [laws](https://prospect.org/article/how-our-campaign-finance-system-compares-other-countries) limiting political spending and/or donations.
1.3.6.3. Con: Interest groups can also play an important role in skewing referendum outcomes so they don't reflect the true will of the people.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Weak campaigns by mainstream parties can [leave a vacuum](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/in-referendums-people-are-often-inclined-to-answer-a-different-question-1.1476406) ready for interest groups to influence popular opinion and decisions in referendums.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: The 1986 Irish referendum on divorce resulted in a surprising defeat, largely due to the [ability of interest groups to raise sufficient concerns](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/in-referendums-people-are-often-inclined-to-answer-a-different-question-1.1476406) over the plight of married women whom they claimed would be cast aside if divorce was introduced.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: Referendum campaigns are expensive to run \(spending for EU ref was capped at £7m per lead campaign according to [electoralcommission.org.uk](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/194586/Spending-for-EU-referendum-campaigners.pdf)\). If each major policy decision was to be campaigned on, it could create unfair advantages for causes supported by wealthy backers.
1.3.6.3.3. Pro: The Cambridge Analytica [scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) demonstrated the power that private groups can have on impacting voting results.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.
1.3.6.3.5. Pro: The 2018 Romanian referendum over banning gay marriage was [backed by American interest groups](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/08/655528971/romanian-referendum-that-would-define-marriage-fails) such as Liberty Counsel and the Coalition of the Family.
1.3.6.4. Pro: According to [a study](https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2018/02/26/americans-dont-tlected-officials/) conducted by Stanford researchers consisting of a nationally representative sample of 1,021 American adults, 70 percent of respondents perceive that elected officials pay substantially more attention to the preferences of campaign donors and economic elites than they do to the general public. Only 28 percent of Americans surveyed think that their representatives actually paid substantial attention to the general public's views.
1.3.7. Con: The volatile nature of voter turnout for these referendums means that they don’t always reflect popular opinion.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Many referendums have too low turnout which can lead to negative political outcomes.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: The 2018 [name change referendum](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/macedonia-future-uncertain-failed-referendum-181002115142668.html) in North Macedonia produced an unclear result because of low turnout \(and an opposition boycott\) and has complicated the government's path towards NATO and EU accession.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: Low turnout means that referendums can end up being shaped by minority opinions instead.
1.3.7.1.2.1. Pro: Because of low turnout in the 2016 Colombian referendum, areas that had been impacted by the rebel violence and voted for the deal were [outvoted by those in the interior of the country.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/03/colombia-just-voted-no-on-its-referendum-for-peace-heres-why-and-what-it-means/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e458ccbd8818)
1.3.7.1.2.2. Con: [Some referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_by_country#Summary_table) [require a certain percentage of voters to cast a vote in order for the decision to be validated](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit), thus removing the harms of low voter turnout.
1.3.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: The 2006 Montenegro independence vote ruled that [at least 55% of voters](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/22/balkans) had to vote in favour of independence in order for it to be formally recognised.
1.3.7.1.2.2.2. Pro: In Switzerland, [voting is mandatory](https://www.thelocal.ch/20180523/how-switzerlands-direct-democracy-system-works) for any referendum on an amendment to the constitution.
1.3.7.1.2.2.3. Pro: [In the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_the_Netherlands), a referendum on any piece of primary legislation may be requested by the public before it enters into force. For a referendum to be held, the request needs to be signed by 300,000 citizens. To reject the law, turnout has to reach 30%.
1.3.7.1.2.2.4. Pro: [In Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Hungary#Referenda), required voter turnout for a referendum to be valid is 50%.
1.3.7.1.2.2.5. Con: These limits can be set very low, thus not efficiently removing the harm of smaller groups dominating a referendum.
1.3.7.1.2.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.3.2.
1.3.7.1.2.2.5.2. Pro: In Romania, [30% of registered voters](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/07/romanias-anti-gay-marriage-vote-voided-over-low-turnout) must cast a ballot in order for the result to be valid.
1.3.7.1.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.2.5.2.
1.3.7.1.3. Pro: Only [38% of the population](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html) voted in Colombia’s peace deal.
1.3.7.1.4. Pro: A low-turnout can risk deepening political disputes rather than bridging them. Leaders have to choose whether to accept a result that does not demonstrably reflect popular will, or reject the result and risk a political backlash.
1.3.7.2. Con: Where the issue is important to the public it is likely that this will be reflected in high voter turnout, which grants legitimacy to the decision.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: A high turnout with a tiny majority may have less legitimacy than a smaller turnout with a massive majority.
1.3.7.2.2. Pro: In 2015 when Ireland had a referendum on same sex marriage [61%](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/05/18/why-referendums-are-not-always-a-good-idea) of the voting population turned out to the polls.
1.3.7.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.3.7.2.4. Pro: [72.2% of registered voters](https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/article/32/92/601/4459491) voted in the 2016 "Brexit" referendum.
1.3.7.2.5. Pro: [85%](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/people-politics-law/politics-policy-people/the-2014-scottish-independence-referendum-turnout) of registered voters voted in the 2014 Scottish independence vote.
1.3.7.2.5.1. Con: [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_second_Scottish_independence_referendum) is pushing hard for another referendum, suggesting that they don't hold the last one as legitimate.
1.3.7.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.1.
1.3.7.2.7. Con: The amount of people that turn out to cast their votes can be affected by a variety of factors.
1.3.7.2.7.1. Pro: The [weather on the day](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/americas/colombia-brexit-referendum-farc-cameron-santos.html) of the referendum can affect voter turnout.
1.3.7.2.7.1.1. Pro: Less than 40% of Colombians voted in the 2016 referendum. This was in part related to the fact that [the Caribbean region faced a hurricane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/03/colombia-just-voted-no-on-its-referendum-for-peace-heres-why-and-what-it-means/?utm_term=.4636a927c5b2), making the journey to the polls extremely difficult.
1.3.7.2.7.2. Pro: When voters are certain about what way they will vote, turnout is [higher](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444817745017). Therefore, for more complex issues where voters are less decisive, turnout may be lower.
1.3.7.2.7.3. Pro: Media having an affect on the way citizens vote is well [established](https://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-1-context/understanding-the-role-of-the-mass-media-in-the-eu-referendum/). Through highlighting factors such as the urgency to vote one way or another, media can affect turnout.
1.3.7.2.7.3.1. Con: Voters are often [aware](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/mar/10/a-third-of-young-people-think-social-media-will-influence-their-vote) of the affect media can have. Being aware of this means they can ignore bias to some extent, and make a decision to vote for themselves.
1.3.7.2.7.4. Pro: Voter turnout in referendums is based on how [important the public perceives](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/turnout) an issue to be. Therefore, many referendums are likely to have low turnouts.
1.3.7.2.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.3.7.2.7.4.2. Con: A significant number of referendums are on issues that are [important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_by_country) for people. Therefore, they are likely to have high voter turnouts.
1.3.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.2.
1.3.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.7.
1.3.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.3.
1.3.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.7.4.
1.4. Pro: Referendums foster a sense of inclusivity in democracy and make people feel part of the political process.
1.4.1. Con: In an ideal world the political process would be almost completely invisible, like the power and communications grids, which we only really notice when they break down. We want them to just work, without us having to worry about them.
1.4.2. Con: Seeing their elected representatives being actually representative, and looking after the best interests of the people is a far better way of fostering a sense of inclusivity.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Public referenda are used as politicians' cop-outs, allowing them to avoid making potentially unpopular and vote-losing decisions, even when they are in the best interest of the population.
1.4.3. Con: Referendum campaigns can become [politically divisive](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/referendums.aspx) which causes people to isolate themselves from politics.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The Brexit referendum was described as ["divisive, hostile, negative and fear-provoking."](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/05/16/acrimonious-and-divisive-the-role-the-media-played-in-brexit/)
1.4.3.2. Pro: Romanians experienced a [divisive referendum](https://euobserver.com/political/117085) in 2012 over their president.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Referendums with a binary choice serve to eliminate nuance.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Although many people in the UK campaigned for ["remain and reform"](https://medium.com/\@OwenJones84/why-i-worry-a-second-eu-referendum-would-boost-the-radical-right-8132cb40a022), the only options given were "Remain" and "Leave".
1.4.3.4. Con: [The process of collective decision-making](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/30/eu-referendum-fallout-britain-happiness-leave-voters-violence) in a referendum can be positive and make voters feel connected with their community.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Political parties may become split on the referendum issue which causes instability and in-fighting.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: In the UK, both Labour and the Conservatives have experienced [significant division](https://theconversation.com/brexit-identities-how-leave-versus-remain-replaced-conservative-versus-labour-affiliations-of-british-voters-110311) between Leave and Remain party members.
1.4.3.6. Con: Referendums can cause people to become more involved in politics because [they feel more strongly about individual issues](https://theconversation.com/britains-young-people-are-getting-back-into-politics-at-last-76682).
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: [64% of 18 to 24 years olds](https://theconversation.com/britains-young-people-are-getting-back-into-politics-at-last-76682) turned out to vote in the 2016 EU referendum, a higher percentage than in any UK general election since 1992.
1.4.3.6.2. Pro: [Research](https://theconversation.com/britains-young-people-are-getting-back-into-politics-at-last-76682) found that young people in the UK are selective about what type of political engagement they become involved in. For example they are not motivated by Westminister politics but still care about having input into other political processes.
1.4.4. Con: Referendums can spark regional violence over conflicting views on policy decisions.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The 2017 Iraqi independence referendum has [sparked violent confrontations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/10/31/for-kurds-in-baghdad-the-failed-kurdish-independence-bid-provokes-an-identity-crisis/?utm_term=.29b31bee648c) between the Kurdish and Arab populations.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The result of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum has resulted in [police violence against voters and protesters.](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qva3ep/one-year-on-catalans-on-their-referendum-and-the-violence-that-followed)
1.4.4.3. Pro: Territorial referendums pose existential, zero-sum questions to voters and states, often in polarized societies. Conflicting norms of [territorial integrity](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/11/13/when-do-referendums-lead-to-conflict/) and self-determination play out, making the referendums violent.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: The result of the referendum in [East Timor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14952883) led to violence by anti-independence militia.
1.4.4.3.4. Pro: The [independence referendum in Sudan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-borders-abyei-timeline/timeline-sudans-disputed-abyei-region-idUSTRE74U3KL20110531) was marred by clashes between north and south-linked groups.
1.4.4.3.5. Con: A central state and a breakaway region can negotiate the terms of a vote in advance to effectively mitigate risks of violence.
1.4.4.3.5.1. Pro: The [2014 vote in Scotland](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-referendum-agreement) was multilateral, as Edinburgh and London reached an agreement on the referendum prior to its organization.
1.4.4.3.5.2. Pro: Although the U.K. did not negotiate agreement with the EU in advance of the Brexit vote, [Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union) establishes the right of any member state to withdraw.
1.4.4.3.5.3. Pro: Canada has passed the [Clarity Act](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/clarifying-the-clarity-act/article586395/?arc404=true) on provincial secession to lay down the procedure and criteria for secession.
1.4.4.3.5.4. Con: Given that referendums are an [outcome of years of central state failure to manage autonomy arrangements](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/11/13/when-do-referendums-lead-to-conflict/), it is unlikely that such terms can be negotiated.
1.4.4.3.5.5. Con: A history of [mistrust and resentment](https://www.dawn.com/news/1166129) between the center and provinces makes it unlikely for such terms to be devised.
1.4.4.4. Con: Considering there are lots of referendums which do not lead to violence, it seems unlikely that referendums have a causal effect on violence.
1.4.5. Pro: Referendums give voters a [sense of satisfaction](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/30/eu-referendum-fallout-britain-happiness-leave-voters-violence) because they believe that the system is fair and responds to their preferences.
1.4.5.1. Con: The source also alludes to the fact that happiness from referendums is often dependent on the issue voted on in the referendum and which side is the victor.
1.4.5.2. Pro: When people have more trust in the system, they are likely to pay taxes. \([Hug & Sporri, p.1](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/58ea3a66-b66b-4978-8060-3730c59bbc9e.pdf)\)
1.4.6. Pro: Election cycles are [too long](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/referendums-bad-press-fix-britain-more-of-them-participatory-democracy) to allow the public to feel engaged with political issues and important government decisions.
1.4.7. Pro: In the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum, parties across the political spectrum [had an increase in new members](https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13205199.should-we-have-more-referendums-to-boost-participation-in-the-political-process/).
1.4.8. Pro: Referendums and other tools of direct democracy help increase political socialization and voter turnout.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Direct democracy creates an educative environment that empowers citizens and that, over time, leads to greater participation. Voters are thereby socialized by exposure to the institution of direct democracy and as a result are motivated to turn out to vote at higher rates \([pg.3](https://www.unf.edu/~n.seabrook/seabrook_dyck_mobilized.pdf)\).
1.4.8.2. Pro: When people are given more opportunities to participate, they learn to become better democratic citizens \([pg.3](https://www.unf.edu/~n.seabrook/seabrook_dyck_mobilized.pdf)\).
1.4.8.2.1. Pro: As people become more familiar with local democracy, they also become more interested \(and even more engaged\) in broader issues of regional, national or international scope \([pg.4](https://legacy.oise.utoronto.ca/research/tlcentre/conference2003/Proceedings/s_w.pdf)\).
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: Political participation, and the consequent learning that derives from it, fosters the development of more informed, critical and engaged citizens who are eager to learn more and to take on larger challenges. As citizens become more enlightened, empowered and confident, they become ready to go beyond their circle and become more active in other spheres \([pg.4](https://legacy.oise.utoronto.ca/research/tlcentre/conference2003/Proceedings/s_w.pdf)\).
1.4.8.2.3. Pro: Political participation equips people with the ability to assess the performance of their representatives \([pg.4](https://legacy.oise.utoronto.ca/research/tlcentre/conference2003/Proceedings/s_w.pdf)\).
1.4.8.2.3.1. Pro: Participant citizens have a greater capacity to develop political competencies than non-participant citizens. They are also more likely to clarify their values and interests, enlarge them in light of the values and interests of others, and be more responsive to claims of justice and the common good \([pg.5](https://legacy.oise.utoronto.ca/research/tlcentre/conference2003/Proceedings/s_w.pdf)\).
1.4.8.3. Pro: Voting [is a habit](https://www.rockthevote.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/research/rtv_voting_is_a_habit-2007.pdf) and through repeated exposure to direct democratic environments, voters develop a habit of participating in ballot measure elections, a habit that over time should produce an aggregate increase in voter turnout, as more and more individual voters are exposed to the direct legislation \([pg.4](https://www.unf.edu/~n.seabrook/seabrook_dyck_mobilized.pdf)\).
1.4.8.4. Con: Turnout in referendums is usually lower than in elections held on the same level of government.
1.4.8.4.1. Pro: In Switzerland, 112 out of 148 referendums between 1981 and 1999 saw lower turnout than the respective preceding national election. The mean turnout of referendums is lower \(40.8%\) than mean turnout in the five national elections held within the same period \(45.8%\) \([pg.3](https://aleininger.eu/downloads/leininger_heyne_2017_preprint.pdf)\).
1.4.9. Pro: Referendums help make democracies more representative.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Citizens often feel that their elected representatives don't represent the general public's interests well.
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.
1.4.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.4.9.2. Con: Research on elections provides evidence that turnout tends to be skewed towards citizens of high socio-economic status. If this is extended to referendums and participation in them is low, referendum outcomes are not representative of the preferences of the population at large either \([pg.3](https://aleininger.eu/downloads/leininger_heyne_2017_preprint.pdf)\).
1.4.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.4.
1.4.9.3. Pro: Instead of decisions being made for them by their elected representatives, people are now asked directly about their views on major political decisions.
1.4.9.3.1. Pro: This can free people up from party or personal loyalty in making their decisions.
1.4.9.3.1.1. Pro: People can support certain politicians for specific policies whilst rejecting their views on other issues.
1.4.9.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.
1.4.9.3.1.3. Pro: In the UK, affiliation with "Leave" vs "Remain" has [replaced](https://theconversation.com/brexit-identities-how-leave-versus-remain-replaced-conservative-versus-labour-affiliations-of-british-voters-110311) the traditional political division of Labour vs Conservative.
1.4.9.3.1.4. Con: Voters may still vote along party lines in a referendum. For example, an investigation of the 1994 Norway EU [referendum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1996.tb00393.x) shows that, when parties took clear stances on the referendum, party identification was strongly correlated with the way voters voted.
1.4.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.4.9.3.3. Con: There are ways for the will of the people to be accounted for, other than a referendum.
1.4.9.3.3.1. Pro: Polling data can also be used to guide representatives in their decision making, allowing for the people's views to be accounted for.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1. Con: Polling data can be inaccurate.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Many respondents [lie](https://www.infosurv.com/5-reasons-why-survey-respondents-dont-tell-the-truth/) when answering polling questions.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: People often give what they believe to be the [socially desirable answer](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/05/why-the-polls-keep-getting-it-so-wrong-and-a-solution-ask-people-who-their-friends-and-family-are-voting-for/) when they are being polled.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: There is an over-saturated public-opinion marketplace in which respondents begin to feel a mixture of [fatigue and irritation](https://theweek.com/articles/559473/how-did-political-polls-become-inaccurate-blame-obsession-data) that dilutes the accuracy of the polls.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1.3. Pro: Polls are not [representative](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/howcan-a-poll-of-only-100/) of the entire population.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: [Limited funding](http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_26.htm) makes it difficult to have a representative sample size.
1.4.9.3.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Polls often suffer from [selection bias](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-poll-margin-of-error-and-how-can-it-be-wrong-2016-8?r=US&IR=T) when choosing respondents.
1.4.9.3.3.2. Pro: The mandate a party was elected in on can allow for the will of the people to be represented.
1.4.9.3.3.2.1. Pro: Parties campaign on specific policies and voters trust these policies will be enacted when a party is elected. Therefore, representatives once elected will follow this mandate \(as they fear losing their seat in the next election\). This means the will of the people \(i.e. the mandate the majority voted on\) is accounted for.
1.4.9.3.3.3. Pro: In many countries the public can have input into policies through the select committee or similar consultative processes.
1.4.9.3.3.3.1. Pro: The [UK Parliament Outreach and Engagement Service](https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/committees/connecting-with-committees-events/) helps the public to give feedback to select committees.
1.4.9.3.3.3.2. Pro: In [New Zealand](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/) the public can make both written and oral submissions to select committees on proposed legislation.
1.4.9.3.3.3.3. Pro: In [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/consultations.html), government departments and agencies have open consultations with the public on a variety of issues.
1.4.9.3.3.3.4. Con: These processes are consultative only and the government is not bound to listen to public perspectives.
1.4.9.3.3.3.5. Con: [Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10991-016-9177-z) has found a significant obstacle to public hearings is the frequent failure of government official to perceive the general public as equals.
1.4.9.3.3.3.6. Pro: The European Union has a web portal - [Your Voice in Europe](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20120706STO48453/your-voice-in-europe-inform-the-eu-and-be-informed) - which allows citizens to have direct feedback into policymaking.
1.4.9.3.3.4. Pro: Governments can host public meetings or open consultations to get information on the public's views.
1.4.9.3.3.4.1. Pro: In 2019, the UK is holding a series of Citizens' Assemblies in order to [explore views on different policy options to combat climate change](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/news-parliament-2017/climate-change-and-net-zero-chairs-comments-17-19/).
1.4.9.3.3.5. Pro: Citizens can engage in peaceful protests to make their views known on particular issues.
1.4.9.3.3.5.1. Con: Protests can be extremely disruptive and it is harmful to have a population that engages in them regularly.
1.4.9.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: In 2018, France's 'Yellow Vest' protests had a [significant negative economic impact](https://www.businessinsider.com/france-yellow-vest-protests-will-keep-damaging-the-economy-2018-12?r=US&IR=T), halving the country's GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
1.5. Con: Deciding whether a political decision is 'major' or not may become a politicised process.
1.5.1. Pro: Parties may decide not to hold a referendum on an issue they do not support \(but believes will pass in a referendum\) and define it as insufficiently 'major' for a public vote.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In [Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_by_country), a super-majority in Parliament may overturn the holding of a referendum.
1.5.1.2. Pro: In [Venezuela](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics/venezuela-on-edge-after-anti-maduro-referendum-blocked-idUSKCN12L1EZ), the opposition's drive for a recall referendum was suspended despite the OPEC nation’s crushing economic crisis, Maduro’s unpopularity and public opinion in favor of a plebiscite.
1.5.2. Pro: Opposition parties may block referendums on issues they do not support if there is a supermajority requirement to hold a referendum.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Amending the [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan#Early_proposals_for_amendment) constitution requires a super-majority in parliament before it can be put to a referendum.
1.5.3. Con: In some countries, political decisions are classified as 'major' if they affect the country's constitution.
1.5.3.1. Pro: In Ireland, [all 37 referendums](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/referenda/constitutional_referendum_in_ireland.html) on major political decisions have been called in order to amend the country's constitution.
1.5.3.2. Pro: In Australia, referendums are used to [determined proposed changes](https://getparliament.peo.gov.au/the-australian-constitution/successful-referendums) to the Australian Constitution.
1.5.4. Pro: Politicians can decide to call referendums at politically convenient times and use them to justify decisions even when public will is no longer in their favor.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Agenda setters may [strategically](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.352.6954&rep=rep1&type=pdf) time referendums so that the outcome is likely to be close to their desired outcome \(p. 21\).
1.5.4.2. Pro: The public may be deceived to think a particular decision is in their best interest, even when it is not.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: A military dictator in Pakistan, Zia-ul-Haq, used an [ill-worded referendum](https://www.dawn.com/news/1364410) seeking the electorate’s approval for his draconian Islamic reforms and establishing his [presidency](https://storyofpakistan.com/referendum-1984).
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: The Thai military [restricted news coverage of the draft Constitution](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/10/05/news/why-national-referendums-are-messy-tools-of-democracy/), ensuring that there was no counter narrative that might portray it as a threat to democracy.
1.5.4.2.3. Pro: The Prime Minister of Hungary, in a referendum on whether immigrants should be allowed into the country or not, used [false information](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/hungary-migration-poll-divides-nation-viktor-orban) to convince Hungarians to vote against allowing immigrants into the country.
1.5.5. Con: Politicians would likely be subject to criticism if they refused to hold referendums on issues the public considered important.
1.6. Con: Some major political decisions are in fact decisions about the rights of citizens, and should not be subject to a referendum.
1.6.1. Pro: Close to half of the US population does [not support](https://news.gallup.com/poll/210887/americans-split-new-lgbt-protections-restroom-policies.aspx) anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ+ people. Given such polices are human rights issues, a referendum is not suitable.
1.6.2. Pro: In Alabama and South Carolina, [referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_referendum) \(in 2000 and 1998, respectively\) were held on overturning state-constitutional bans on interracial marriage. In each, over 40% of the electorate voted against overturning the bans.
1.6.3. Pro: Voters are [most likely to analyse issues from a personal perspective](https://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/the-dangers-of-direct-democracy/) and not consider the concerns of other groups including minorities.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Many people vote on [emotion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/07/voting-irrational-emotions-politics-ideology) rather than thoughtful deliberation. This results in poor decisions.
1.6.3.2. Pro: People often suffer from an [empathy gap](https://effectiviology.com/empathy-gap/) - a cognitive bias which makes it difficult for them to understand other people's perspectives.
1.6.4. Con: Government officials are likely to be as conservative, if not more so, than the population. Allowing them to make the decision will not result in better outcomes for the rights of citizens.
1.6.4.1. Con: The government is elected by citizens and represents their interests. If the government is likely to make a bad decision, then so is the general public.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Minority groups are often [underrepresented](https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=jur) in government. Consequently, issues important to these groups are often ignored by policymakers.
1.6.4.3. Pro: State legislators throughout the US [widely overestimate](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/study-congress-overestimates-the-publics-conservatism.html) the conservatism of their constituents; as a result, they implement more conservative policies than their constituents actually want.
1.6.4.4. Con: Most democratic systems have procedural safeguards when writing and enacting legislation which can protect the rights of minorities. These safeguards are often bypassed by a referendum.
1.6.4.4.1. Pro: The Senate rules in the US allow individual Senators to filibuster and take other actions potentially indefinitely to delay or prevent actions which they oppose. This allows a single Senator to protect minority interests against the majority. [\(Pg 1\)](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30850.pdf)
1.6.4.4.2. Pro: Representatives of minority interests are often granted procedural rights such as [mandatory committee seats, agenda setting powers and confidence motions](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d02/70d0603be86615285e91518957a6466bf427.pdf). \(pg 1\)
1.6.4.5. Pro: Despite the [vast majority](https://skepticalscience.com/politicians-more-conservative-than-citizens.html) of US citizens being in favour of policies to curb climate change, the Republican Party is the [only](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial) major party in the world to take a stance against climate change policies.
1.6.4.6. Pro: [Government policy mostly reflects public opinion](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/03/public-opinion-influence-policy), meaning governments are unlikely to protect citizens rights where the public majority would not.
1.6.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.1.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.4.6.
1.6.6. Pro: Certain rights are said to be [natural rights](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/#LawNat), regarded as 'certain moral truths that applied to all people, regardless of the particular place where they lived or the agreements they had made'. It would be principally unjust to grant the populous the power to remove such rights.
1.6.6.1. Pro: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is based on the principle that individuals have [certain inalienable rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Significance).
1.6.6.2. Con: It is difficult to recognise a set of natural rights, because there is no clear consensus on what natural rights should exist.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: John Locke argued that natural rights included the rights to "[rights, liberty and property](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/)" whereas Hobbes argued that there were [nineteen natural laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#Hobbes).
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: There is [disagreement](http://www.speakupspeakout.internews.org/?q=section-2-concepts-skills-and-tools/human-rights-controversies) as to whether cultural rights should be protected, especially where those rights conflict with other human rights.
1.6.6.2.3. Con: This demonstrates a difficulty in showing what the set of natural rights should contain, not that such a set should not exist at all. If it is agreed that some natural rights should exist, then it remains unjust to allow the populous to vote on them.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Many legal systems explicitly recognise the legitimacy of natural rights.
1.6.6.3.1. Pro: The American Declaration of Independence is based on the principle that people have certain natural rights: that people are "[endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/)."
1.6.6.3.2. Pro: The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen recognises people have certain rights which are "[natural, unalienable and sacred.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen)" These include liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression.
1.6.7. Pro: Prejudiced people's votes will create bad, prejudiced decisions if they have the same value as other more principled people.
1.7. Pro: Referendums can legitimize major political decisions.
1.7.1. Con: They can, but they are not likely to. Consider the Brexit referendum: while there may have been a case for leaving the EU, the [skulduggery](https://publicseminar.org/2019/02/brexit-dark-money-and-big-data/) [and](https://brexitlies.com/) [lies](https://www.shoutoutuk.org/2019/11/01/top-8-brexit-lies-debunked/) of the Leave campaign have entirely eliminated any legitimacy that the Prime Minister's decision to leave might have potentially had.
1.7.2. Pro: Referendums have provided legitimacy to decisions made by various governments.
1.7.2.1. Pro: In Ireland, the increasing separation of church and state has been legitimised by a series of referendums that showed there was [strong popular support for the move.](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/do-referenda-improve-democracy/)
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The decision to separate the state and church is legitimate on its own merit. Only the improper exercise of the power of the church had prevented this from happening before.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: The right to [practice any faith freely](http://www.ceceurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/HRTM_Fundamental_Right_to_Freedom_of_Religion.pdf), which is a fundamental human right, is [best actualized](https://time.com/5103677/church-state-separation-religious-freedom/) in a society in which the state and church are separate.
1.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many countries in the world are [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state#List_of_self-described_secular_states_by_continent). This indicates that the majority accepts the importance and legitimacy of separating the state and church.
1.7.3. Con: Politicians can phrase referendum questions in ways which make results more beneficial towards their agenda.
1.7.3.1. Con: Referendum questions are [set by](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/testing-eu-referendum-question) independent bodies such as the Electoral Commission and scrutinised by parliament. The EU question was going to be a "Yes/No" question, but it was deemed that "No" might seem negative.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Politicians can tie other issues into the question to prompt a positive response.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Referendums reduce complex issues to a binary yes or no choice.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.3.3.2. Pro: Most referendums are phrased in simplistic terms. The simplification of complex subjects undermines the ability of those voting on referendums to come to objective conclusions
1.7.3.3.3. Con: Reducing complex questions to a binary choice necessitates simplifying the problem. This is the fundamental basis of how computers work.
1.7.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.7.3.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.7.3.3.6. Con: Some referendums offer follow up questions to stop issues becoming overly simplistic.
1.7.3.3.6.1. Pro: The [2016 New Zealand flag referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/new-zealand-votes-to-keep-its-flag-in-referendum) asked citizens to pick a preferred alternative flag before then asking if they would want it to replace the country's existing flag.
1.7.3.3.7. Pro: Referendums treat issues in isolation, allowing voters to ignore the trade-offs or consequences of their policy choices.
1.7.3.3.7.1. Pro: The [1978 mini-referendum in California](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit) asked voters to approve a move to limit the state's ability to raise property taxes. This created knock on effects on social spending and state schools which most voters were unaware of when initially voting for the policy.
1.7.3.3.7.2. Pro: In California, referendums have been responsible for [both limiting taxes and mandating spending](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2011/04/20/the-perils-of-extreme-democracy). Voters treated these issues in isolation with the result that it is very difficult to do both these things and also balance its budget.
1.7.3.3.7.3. Pro: [In 2014](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit) the Swiss public voted to limit immigration numbers even though this put Switzerland in violation of various treaties in the EU.
1.7.3.3.8. Pro: The 'zero-sum' nature of referendums could [disincentive opposing sides from seeking compromises or finding common ground](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/sites/constitution-unit/files/ICR_Final_Report.pdf). \(Pg 63\)
1.7.3.3.9. Pro: This makes it difficult to interpret the results of these referendums and what they say about public opinion on the issue.
1.7.3.3.9.1. Pro: The open-end meaning of the 2016 Brexit referendum made it difficult for politicians to know what type of deal the British population wanted to leave the EU with.
1.7.3.3.10. Pro: This gives people less scope to express their political preferences when there is a limited number of options to choose from.
1.7.3.3.10.1. Pro: Giving people a limited choice is better than not giving them any direct input into the decision itself.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.
1.7.5. Con: Referendums frequently end with a lack of clarity on how a country should move forward.
1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.7.5.2. Con: Not all referendums have low turnout, so a lack of clarity is not an inherent feature of referendums.
1.7.5.3. Pro: Many referendums have incredibly close results; such narrow margins do not provide a clear mandate to the government to go implement the referendum result as it indicates that the country is far too divided on the issue.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: Referendums can have higher thresholds, such as 2/3, which make the public will clear.
1.7.5.3.2. Pro: Leave won the Brexit referendum by [51.9% to 48.1%.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887) The close nature of this result \(and subsequent [contradictory polls](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/27/public-thinks-eu-referendum-was-a-bad-idea-says-poll)\) has resulted in UK citizens calling for a [second referendum](https://www.euronews.com/2019/03/26/anti-brexit-protests-spur-calls-for-second-brexit-referendum).
1.7.5.3.3. Pro: The [1995 Quebec independence referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Quebec_referendum) was decided 50.58% to 49.42% and cast doubt on the future of the province.
1.7.5.3.3.1. Con: The referendum allowed the Canadian government to understand the frustration of individuals in Quebec and made them make [concessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Quebec_referendum) towards regional governance.
1.7.5.3.4. Con: This is not a problem exclusive to referendums but with voting in general.
1.7.5.3.4.1. Pro: Many [general election results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results) are close. That does not take away from the legitimacy of democratically elected governments.
1.7.5.4. Con: Even where a referendum results in a clear result, there is often a lack of clarity as to how the referendum result should be implemented.
1.7.5.4.1. Pro: In the Brexit referendum, it was [unclear](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/59896-2/) precisely what leaving the European Union would actually look like.
1.7.5.4.2. Pro: Voting systems are often the [subject of referendums](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/analysis-eby-pr-reform-may-30-1.4684681), however the exact implementation or rules of the voting system still need to be decided.
1.7.5.4.3. Pro: If Scotland had of voted in favour of independence, it was unclear what an independent Scotland would [look like in terms](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/scottish-independence-nicola-sturgeon-snp-indyref2-second-referendum-independent-look-like-a7641671.html) of its border, its [currency](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-47414870), its banking system and membership of international bodies.
1.7.5.4.4. Con: This can be mitigated through proper preparation \(e.g. in advance of the referendum, having a policy plan for all referendum outcomes\).
1.7.6. Pro: It is important for governments to know they have support when they make a major decision or else they have a higher risk of the public turning on them in the middle of the initiative.
1.7.6.1. Con: A government should know its population well enough to know if they have support for a policy. If they do not, then they are inexcusably out of touch. Referendums should not be used to excuse a government for lacking basic competence.
1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.9.3.3.
1.7.6.3. Pro: Officials should have the mandate to fully enact programs so that efforts are not halted at problematic times.
1.7.6.3.1. Pro: New governments discontinue beneficial policies or programs of a previous government. Through a referendum, if there is public support for such initiatives, new governments will find it difficult to do so. \([Economic Governance in Pakistan, p.3](http://www.iba.edu.pk/News/speechesarticles_drishrat/Economic_Governance.pdf)\)
1.7.6.3.1.1. Pro: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf \(PTI\) government has decided to [shelve](https://www.dawn.com/news/1457449) a major power project pushed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz regime under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor \(CPEC\).
1.7.6.3.1.2. Pro: The credit for the success of these initiatives is likely to go to the previous government. In order to stop a rival political party from scoring political points, these initiatives are halted.
1.7.6.3.1.2.1. Con: If these initiatives are beneficial, the new government is unlikely to discontinue them.
1.7.6.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: New governments can take credit for the success of the programs by claiming that these programs are more [successful](http://bisp.gov.pk/bisp-progress-during-pmln-tenure-august-18-2017/) in their tenure than in the previous government's tenure.
1.7.6.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Protests](https://www.geo.tv/latest/232683-ppp-protests-govts-move-to-rename-benazir-income-support-programme) are likely to take place if governments scrap beneficial initiatives.
1.7.6.3.2. Pro: Some decisions are difficult to reverse quickly without major consequences.
1.7.6.3.2.1. Pro: Accepting large numbers of refugees is a commitment governments must stick with. Reversal would mean a massive violation of rights.
1.7.6.3.2.2. Pro: Withdrawing quickly from an invasion without a transition can lead to massive destabilization.
1.7.6.3.3. Con: Some decisions could have devastating impacts and reversing them becomes essential.
1.7.6.3.3.1. Pro: [Brexit](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/28/18116763/brexit-economy-bad-deal-no-deal), which is likely to be devastating to UK's economy, is difficult to reverse.
1.7.6.4. Pro: This stamp of popular legitimacy is important to settle contentious national disputes that might otherwise lead to political turmoil or even to armed conflict.
1.7.6.4.1. Pro: Northern Ireland’s Good Friday peace deal in 1998 was followed by [two referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement), one in Northern Ireland and one in the Republic of Ireland. That gave communities a sense of having been included, and marginalized anyone who wanted to keep fighting and ended a [decade of violence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/14118775).
1.7.7. Con: If 'legitimacy' is given to a policy because it reflects the will of the people, then by virtue of the fact that policy makers are elected, the policy decisions they make are already legitimised.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.7.9. Con: The outcome of the referendum is not based on the referendum question, but other factors.
1.7.9.1. Pro: The Russian Federation heavily influenced the 2014 referendum in Crimea in order to justify its annexation of the territory.
1.7.9.1.1. Pro: The referendum was regarded as illegitimate by [most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_by_country#cite_note-UNGA-30) including all European Union members, the United States and Canada because of the [events surrounding it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) including the plebiscite being held while the peninsula was [occupied by Russian soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_by_country#cite_note-31).
1.7.9.1.2. Con: Given the referendum was [widely deemed illegitimate](https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/15/290404691/russia-vetoes-u-n-security-council-resolution-on-crimea), it is not a representative example.
1.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.
1.7.9.3. Pro: People can sometimes end up basing their vote [more on their attitude towards the government of the day](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/in-referendums-people-are-often-inclined-to-answer-a-different-question-1.1476406) than the actual issue itself.
1.7.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.
1.7.9.3.2. Pro: Voters often use the opportunity to [signal their support, or lack of support](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/in-referendums-people-are-often-inclined-to-answer-a-different-question-1.1476406), for the current government proposing the referendum.
1.7.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.8.2.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.7.3.3.
