Discussion Name: Should all companies be entirely owned by their workers?

1. All companies should be entirely owned by their workers.
1.1. Con: A state enforcing worker ownership of companies would be a violation of economic freedom.
1.1.1. Pro: Businesses are property and those who found businesses deserve to own them, sell them, and control them.
1.1.1.1. Con: A co-op is not forcing a person to give up their business. Co-ops are usually created by workers coming together to invest in the business. Once they make their investments back, they use the business to focus on job security.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: If all companies were entirely owned by their workers, all people who want to start a business would be forced to share their companies' profits with their employees.
1.1.1.2. Con: Founders don't necessarily entirely own their businesses.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Ownership of a business doesn't necessarily, by default, need to be based on who originally founded the business based on an assumption of "deserving" to own something.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Many businesses today aren't owned or controlled by the people who founded them; they're owned by shareholders, who acquire ownership by purchasing shares with money.
1.1.1.3. Con: Treating businesses as property is not the best option.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: This claim is analogous to one that states "those who found nations/states deserve to own them and control them." Compared to other practised governance models for nations/states, models that most often result in net-positive outcomes for their citizens are the ones that provide regular opportunities for the majority of people who reside in those nations/states to transfer political power and directly/indirectly make changes to society to improve their own lives.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Treating businesses as property allows individuals to create totalitarian domains in society. This forces those who aren't business owners to live their lives in a daily hierarchical dictatorship and trains them to be comfortable in that sort of societal structure.
1.1.1.4. Con: Businesses are not property.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Businesses are also a type of society of people. The constituents of societies deserve to have sufficiently equal power over the governance of the societies they reside in to provide formal mechanisms for protecting their rights and well-being as they exist in such societies.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Businesses are either more than just "property" or are not "property" per se. They're an organization \(or arguably a society of\) people who invest time and energy in doing work to produce goods and services for others to consume.
1.1.1.4.3. Pro: Despite Western society's acceptance of property rights as axiomatic, property rights are arbitrary and have no moral justification. Virtually all ownership of land \(and by induction, all property\) is justified by the right of conquest, which lacks moral authority. Even Western corporations weren't always considered property, they were established temporarily for the public good, and were more of a way to pool resources and labor than a profit-making venture in their earlier days.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: There is no moral justification in taking property from someone without their consent \(thievery\). It is always possible to create a "crowdshare" type company or corporation; it does, however, exist a fear that they would fail, outright, and that the "other guys" should be forced to play along to even the playing field.
1.1.1.5. Con: It is business owners themselves who are largely responsible for the creation of worker's cooperatives. For instance, [in the United States,](https://medium.com/fifty-by-fifty/getting-serious-about-scaling-up-worker-cooperatives-a2f6a44606be) several business started by the 'baby boomers' generation [have been sold to employees](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/baby-boomer-retirement-worker-owned-businesses) to form cooperatives in order to protect workers and ensure business continuity for the local community.
1.1.1.6. Pro: Business owners have put in time, effort and money to make their businesses flourish. They should be allowed to have the fruits of their labor.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: The labor of workers, rather than the labor of owners, is more essential to the functioning of the company.
1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: People own themselves and, consequently, their [labor](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/john-locke-justification-private-property). Therefore, they have a right to own the fruits of their labor.
1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The employees are essential to [provide the goods or service](https://www.educba.com/employee-most-valuable-intangible-assets/)s that the company has to offer.
1.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Employees are the [face of the organization](https://www.educba.com/employee-most-valuable-intangible-assets/) since they interact with customers. Therefore, the reputation of the company is in their hands.
1.1.1.7. Pro: There is no meaningful difference between the right to own wealth and to use it. Companies founded by owners are nothing more than the manifestation of their private wealth, just like goods and services they purchase are.
1.1.1.8. Pro: The products sold by businesses often represent the creativity of their owners, as they come up with the idea for a product. As with art or intellectual property, the same ownerships rights should be ascribed to business owners.
1.1.2. Pro: Not allowing individuals to purchase ownership in a company without working in it would be government over-reach and violate citizen's economic freedoms.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Capital investment is a voluntary event, driven by the perception of a risk/benefit ratio. Workers are legally able to organize businesses now as an alternative.
1.1.2.2. Con: Economic freedom is already limited in that sense in current circumstances; individuals cannot purchase ownership in a company in in a variety of situations. Workers co-ops are simply an extension of existing legislation, and don't significantly extend the government's control over investment.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: For example, citizens [cannot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_company_limited_by_shares) freely invest in privately listed companies.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Foreign investors face [restrictions](https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/legislation-regulation/framework-assessment/legal-environment/foreign-investor-currency-exchange-restrictions) regarding investment in/ownership of companies.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Many countries limit the share of companies’ equity capital in a target sector that foreign investors are allowed to hold. \([P.2](https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/2956455.pdf)\)
1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Many countries prohibit foreign ownership of companies. \([P.2](https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/2956455.pdf)\)
1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Foreign ownership is banned in the [fishing and energy sectors](https://www.government.is/topics/business-and-industry/restrictions-on-investments-by-non-residents-in-iceland/) in Iceland.
1.1.2.2.2.2.2. Con: Mexico has lifted the ban on foreign ownership in the [oil sector](https://inter-american-law-review.law.miami.edu/mexicos-government-ends-ban-foreign-investment-oil-industry/).
1.1.3. Pro: To create a society where all companies are worker owned, workers will need to be able to fully acquire the stock of the companies they work in. The state will need to force any unwilling owners and investors to sell.
1.1.4. Con: By ensuring all companies are entirely owned by workers, the state would maximize economic freedom.
1.1.4.1. Pro: An economy based on worker cooperatives will spread wealth, knowledge and power more evenly throughout society.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Founders, top management and big investors put themselves under financial and personal risks most people are not willing to take. This is why their effort should be economically rewarded by an order of magnitude higher than that of the workers.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Workers quite literally invest their lives in their workplaces. For workers who perform dangerous physical labor, they are putting their lives directly at far more risk than top management and big investors. This is why workers should be given formal democratic mechanisms of control over the organization they invest the majority of their waking lives in.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: The point of a worker cooperative isn't to directly reward workers more; it's to directly provide workers with a formal democratic mechanism for influencing the governance and direction of the organization they work in. Workers, through direct or representative democratic control \(e.g. by electing board members\) will reward their top management based on how well their top management performs at making their organization thrive in the marketplace.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Con: A co-op would more evenly spread the financial risk between multiple workers instead of a select few.
1.1.4.1.1.4. Con: An order of magnitude more than the the workers would be much less, in fact, than many CEOs who often make two to three orders of magnitude more than the average worker. No level of financial risk would warrant this level of inequality.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Economic systems in which worker's cooperatives are the pre-dominant form of private enterprise tend to create more opportunities for poverty reduction and GDP growth.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: [For example](https://libcom.org/library/sociology-economics-worker-cooperatives), the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, which houses one of the world's largest cooperative economies, spanning 20,000 cooperatives and 400,000 enterprises, contributes over 40% of the region's GDP and has lifted the area out of poverty.
1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Worker cooperatives are more [productive](https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/) than normal companies.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: An economy of worker coops would distribute power more widely in society because the decisions of the cooperatives are made democratically by their workers.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Currently only those that hold a [significant amount of equity ownership](https://www.shareable.net/six-operational-advantages-of-worker-cooperatives/) have control over the political power in a company.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: At present, only a small minority of workers have any ownership of the wealth produced by the companies they work for.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Currently [only 10% of Americans](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies) have equity stakes in their workplace.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Only key management personnel are offered [equity compensation](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/equitycompensationatprivatefirms.aspx).
1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: A single or minority number of owners who possess more than 50% of the equity interest can not only [control the decisions](https://www.shareable.net/six-operational-advantages-of-worker-cooperatives/) made by the company, but also often make these decisions [without even notifying](https://www.shareable.net/six-operational-advantages-of-worker-cooperatives/) workers or other equity holders.
1.1.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: In worker owned companies, all members get [one vote each](https://www.shareable.net/six-operational-advantages-of-worker-cooperatives/) which disperses power more equally.
1.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Distributing power empowers workers and provides them with a sense of [control over their lives](https://www.isaiahhankel.com/you-need-to-open-your-own-business-to-have-control-over-your-life).
1.1.4.1.4. Pro: Workers co-operatives spread wealth in a manner that is more equal amongst all their workers.
1.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.1.
1.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Salaries in worker co-operatives tend to foster gender equality.
1.1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: According to European Project–Active Women in Small and Medium Enterprises, in [93.8%](https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/jun/20/cooperative-myth-equal-pay) of cases in worker co-operatives in Spain, France and Italy, gender-based salary discrimination does not exist.
1.1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: At [Suma](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/01/how-to-fix-the-gender-pay-gap-food-co-op-suma-pays-everyone-the-same), male and female employees are paid equally.
1.1.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: According to the Spanish Confederation of Worker cooperatives \(COCETA\), men and women are compensated in [more equal terms](https://www.thenews.coop/39421/topic/democracy/more-gender-equality-european-worker-cooperatives/) in coops than in other private enterprises in the country.
1.1.4.1.4.2.4. Pro: [WAGES](https://www.co-oplaw.org/special-topics/worker-cooperatives-performance-and-success-factors/), a worker cooperative, provides high-quality employment to over 100 women.
1.1.4.1.4.3. Pro: The most comprehensive [study compilation](https://www.ica.coop/sites/default/files/publication-files/aci-ccr-2017-vol104-latin-america-453321311.pdf) of worker's cooperatives in Latin America to date shows that worker cooperatives provide enormous benefits in combating social inequality and wealth distribution.
1.1.4.1.4.4. Pro: People own themselves and their own labor. Accordingly workers should [own any wealth created by their labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property).
1.1.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: Distributing wealth on this basis is fair because most individuals are capable of working and therefore capable of accessing wealth. The current system is unfair because it limits wealth creation to those who already possess wealth i.e. business owners.
1.1.4.1.4.4.2. Pro: Worker's cooperatives [distribute](http://cdi.coop/profit-sharing-in-worker-coops/) profits amongst workers commensurate to the number of hours they have worked.
1.1.4.1.4.5. Con: Equality in employee salaries can make it hard for workers cooperatives to [attract and retain](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-23-why-co-ops-what-are-they-how-do-they-work-\(1944\)/what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-cooperative-business) competent employees and managers.
1.1.4.1.4.5.1. Pro: An inability to pay employees a competitive salary can cause strong managers and workers to be [drawn to higher-paid jobs in other companies](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-23-why-co-ops-what-are-they-how-do-they-work-\(1944\)/what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-cooperative-business).
1.1.4.1.4.6. Pro: Black worker cooperatives can be used to fight institutional racism.
1.1.4.1.4.6.1. Pro: Blacks are able to create a [sense of solidarity](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jmk8qk/how-black-co-ops-can-fight-institutional-racism) by using an economic structure that creates economic prosperity for all.
1.1.4.1.4.7. Pro: Equitable distribution of wealth is important for [social mobility](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/89976/wealth_and_education_3.pdf).
1.1.4.1.5. Con: In a world where only worker cooperatives exist, wealth inequality is likely to skyrocket, as only those individuals with the starting capital to invest in a workplace could gain a job. And for those with some limited starting capital, the choice of profession would be highly limited.
1.1.4.1.6. Con: Issues concerning concentration of wealth can be better tackled with legislation or government policy.
1.1.4.1.6.1. Con: These methods are not sustainable, as they are contingent on consistent public support and government attention which is unlikely to occur.
1.1.4.1.6.1.1. Pro: The wealthiest majority shareholders of corporations tend to use their economic power to influence government policy and voting trends.
1.1.4.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The largest private corporations and wealthiest individuals have a [history](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government) of successfully lobbying governments to reduce regulation and act in their interest.
1.1.4.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Private companies re-brand themselves as [interest groups](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/09/04/how-interest-groups-influence-public-opinion/) to influence public opinion.
1.1.4.1.6.1.2. Pro: In the US pervasive influence of large private corporations has led to the [erosion of unions and the dismantling of policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_union_busting_in_the_United_States) that protect workers.
1.1.4.1.6.1.3. Pro: By taking economic power away from a handful of the hyper-wealthy and distributing it equally and decentrally to every worker at every coop, worker protections established by workers themselves would be more sustainable.
1.1.4.1.6.2. Pro: Progressive taxation systems can be used to redistribute wealth by using tax money taken from the wealthy to fund services or tax breaks for others in society.
1.1.4.1.6.2.1. Pro: [Argentina, Canada, France, Spain, Norway, Switzerland and Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax#Current_examples) have a form of a wealth tax. Under these systems in addition to income tax, tax is also paid on personal assets such as real estate and personal trusts.
1.1.4.1.6.2.2. Pro: An [inheritance tax system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_tax) can be used to curb massive amounts of wealth being passed between generations.
1.1.4.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: In the United Kingdom, an estate tax is charged at [40%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_Tax_in_the_United_Kingdom) on the value of an inherited estate.
1.1.4.1.6.3. Pro: Governments can implement [minimum wage legislation](https://haasinstitute.berkeley.edu/six-policies-reduce-economic-inequality) which requires companies to spend more of their profits on worker's wages.
1.1.4.1.6.4. Pro: Policies that strengthen and support unions help to reduce wealth inequality, as unions [lobby for higher wages and push to hold down executive salaries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/business/labor-unions-income-inequality.html).
1.1.4.1.6.4.1. Con: Workers unions only let workers bargain for better working conditions and wages. Co-ops put workers in decision making positions, by allowing the workers to have a vote on who the board of directors are.
1.1.4.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Unions have been historically selective in their membership, and often reinforced racial and ethnic inequalities. \([Western and Rosenfeld, 2011](http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/WesternandRosenfeld.pdf), p. 21\). A universal vote for each worker within a workers' cooperative is unlikely to perpetuate such inequalities.
1.1.4.1.6.5. Pro: Laws that [regulate executive pay](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-wages-pay-gap-executive-salary-bonus-ratio-persimmon-bt-a8705786.html) can help to ensure profits are distributed more evenly amongst workers and management.
1.1.5. Con: The economic freedom of workers is better served by ensuring collective ownership of companies.
1.1.6. Con: Only insofar as banning child labor, indentured servitude and contractual slavery are violations of economic freedom. Banning the wage labor contract would leave the cooperative contract legal, just as banning indentured servitude leaves wage labor legal.
1.1.7. Con: Banning the wage labor contract and leaving the cooperative contract legal would lead to greater economic freedom just as banning child labor, indentured servitude and the slave contract does so. Being a slave is more of a loss than owning a slave is a win. Likewise, being an employee is more of a loss than being an employer is a win. Abolishing such asymmetrical labor relations results in a net-gain of freedom.
1.2. Con: It would be bad for the economy if all companies were entirely owned by workers.
1.2.1. Pro: If all companies were entirely owned by their workers, there would no longer be a stock market. The stock market is a vital part of an operating economy.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Without the stock market, there are limited mechanisms for retirement savings.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Without equity financing and stock markets, banks return to their more traditional role of giving out business loans and collecting interest from them. Retirement savings could be placed in banks and collect higher interest rates.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Returns on equity have historically been noticeably higher than return on debt. Forcing pension funds to invest only in debt will lead to smaller returns and smaller pensions.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Lower investment returns is a price worth paying for a more equal distribution of wealth.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Higher wages for workers offset lower pensions in the future.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Workers can save the extra disposable income for use upon retirement.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Workers having enough to sustain themselves and being compensated equally for their labor is a more pressing moral concern than the creation of additional wealth. This is why many economists find gross domestic product to be an inaccurate indicator of economic success.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.4.4.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: According to the World Economic Forum, the creation of additional value - summed up in GDP - [fails to capture](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/gdp-frog-matchbox-david-pilling-growth-delusion/) broader measurements of economic development, such as happiness, well-being, equality of opportunity and welfare.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Banks cannot pay interest if they cannot invest their funds and earn a profit on it.
1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Banks can still make investments in this model. They just wouldn't be given legal rights of ownership of businesses they invest in. Also, there are other entities to invest in besides businesses \(e.g. government bonds\).
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Society could provide retirement through social security insurance and pensions.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Social security, pensions, and other pay-as-you-go systems are pyramid schemes, and have horrible intergenerational equity. For example, you will never see a dime of what you paid into the social security system, notwithstanding the state's penchant for borrowing against it to fund unrelated programs.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Inflation will reduce the size of funds when they cannot make capital gains.
1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Inflation will reduce the value of retirement funds in real terms if they remain dormant and uninvested. Investing in the stock market allows these funds to make capital gains [which can outpace the rate of inflation and gain value in real terms.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/funds/10598725/The-UK-income-funds-that-outpace-inflation.html)
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Retirement funds often invest in companies, such as the [Government Pension Fund of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway). Their investment opportunities would be limited.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Stock markets are the best mechanism for individuals to invest and grow their savings.
1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Stock markets actually jeopardise savings-investments in situations where a traditional company has someone buy a majority of their stocks.
1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: A single entity now controls what happens in the company to create returns, prioritizing their concerns over those of other investors.
1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The majority shareholder will more than likely cut wages, benefits, and hours in the name of profit, which will in turn reduce the quality of the business until they can cannibalize the company. This is what happened to ["Toys R US".](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/08/amazon-didnt-kill-toys-r-us-wall-street-profiteers-did-column/491434002/)
1.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Savings accounts offer a [safer and more dependable route](https://money.cnn.com/2016/03/09/retirement/retirement-savings-safe/) to generate rent than investing in the stock market, and often with higher returns.
1.2.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: High-yield savings accounts [actually outperformed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/high-yield-savings-account-can-now-outperform-the-market-.html) \(offered higher dividends than\) the stock market in 2018.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Businesses that can't sell equity would struggle to raise capital making it harder to start or grow a business.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Most lenders will not loan significant capital to a venture without some [collateral](https://www.businessknowhow.com/money/collateral.htm).
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Many people invest in stocks all the time without any expectation or desire to have substantial power and control over how their investment is used. They make those investments in hopes of being able to sell them in the future to turn a profit.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: A co-op would not be one person trying to invest. This would be multiple employees from within the same field of work investing together. If the government got on board with co-ops to help with distribution of profit we could also demand our politicians incentivize banks to give out low equity loans to workers trying to create co-ops.
1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Banks give business loans all the time without substantial control over how their loans are used.  And this is in a world where equity financing is an option. If we remove equity financing as an option, business loans will be an even more palatable option for people with capital that needs to be used.
1.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Banks also give a lot of loans with substantial control over how that loan is used. In many cases, they even get a seat on the board of directors. Even in cases they don't have direct control, lenders can influence management of a company as long as they hold the purse strings.
1.2.1.2.1.4. Con: Worker owned businesses [tend to outperform their competitors](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies), meaning that they are [seen as an attractive investment opportunity](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies) for many funders.
1.2.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Studies have found that converting businesses to worker owned companies can [boost profits by as much as 14%.](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies)
1.2.1.2.1.5. Con: In [angel investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor), for example, you don't ask for control in return for capital.
1.2.1.2.1.5.1. Con: Some do anyway.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Worker co-operatives can raise capital through other mechanisms.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Cooperative federations, such as the [Mondragon Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation), provide an alternative means for raising capital: individual cooperatives can join a cooperative federation to share capital and other resources.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Worker coops can and do raise capital by selling stock of their company. They can sell their stock to raise capital without granting ownership or voting rights to non-workers.
1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Equal Exchange has [taken this approach](https://equalexchange.coop/how-equal-exchange-aligns-our-capital-with-our-mission) using existing US SEC law.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: Governments can [provide finance to businesses through grants or loans](https://www.fundera.com/blog/small-business-grants). In this way, communities can democratically decide what businesses they want to invest in.
1.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: Without the ability to invest in stock, banks will be more likely to give business loans.
1.2.1.2.2.4.1. Con: Debt financing may give banks power over companies, as they can set repayment terms which may influence the way a business operates.
1.2.1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: Excessive reliance on debt financing can [negatively affect a company's credit rating](https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/) and make it more difficult to secure such financing in the future.
1.2.1.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: Businesses will be required to keep sufficient cash flows at all times for debt repayment, which may hinder the growth of the company, as it cannot reinvest a significant amount of cash back into the company.
1.2.1.2.2.4.2. Con: Banks generally do not [provide equity funding](https://www.business.gov.au/finance/seeking-finance/sources-of-finance-debt-vs-equity-finance), as [equity investments greatly increase regulatory capital requirements](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs266.pdf). Asset managers, pension funds and insurance companies do that.
1.2.1.2.2.5. Pro: If wealth is spread more evenly, people will have money to loan to family and friends or to contribute to crowd funding campaigns.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1. Con: Small loans and crowd funding are not viable alternatives to equity financing.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Most start-ups have an extremely [high risk of default](https://medium.com/theventurecity/who-finances-the-startup-journey-96be3a9fccae), often only justified by a high potential upside. So either loans would have usurious rates or lenders wouldn't have an incentive to invest.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Most Kickstarter and IndieGoGo projects are very high risk, but that doesn't prevent them from being funded.  Crowdfunding, with no potential upside other than receiving the product and maybe a small gift, has been shown to work well even in an economy where equity financing is an option.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: Crowd funding is not suitable for large capital-intensive projects.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Large, capital-intensive projects \(new factories, plants, construction, private infrastructure\) require substantial committed equity \(often billions of dollars\).
1.2.1.2.2.5.2. Pro: Community owned-projects receive [substantial crowdfunding](https://www.exetercityfutures.com/power-of-crowdfunding-for-community-based-projects/); worker's cooperatives which derive their workforce from the surrounding community are likely to receive a similar level of support.
1.2.1.2.2.5.3. Pro: Loans worked just fine for capitalism until the late 19th century, when equities were introduced. Venture capitalism has only [existed since 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_private_equity_and_venture_capital).
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: [Private equity firms](https://hbr.org/2007/09/the-strategic-secret-of-private-equity) often invest in companies which are under-performing or under-valued and use their management knowledge and capital to turn the business around.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: A significant number of companies go bankrupt [after private equity buyouts.](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-biggest-buyouts/541078/) This leaves already struggling companies and its workers much worse off.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Capital is important for [major business changes](https://www.credibly.com/incredibly/accessing-working-capital/growth-capital-what-it-is-and-how-it-grows-your-business/) such as expansion, adding new business locations or products or a merger with another company.
1.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: If businesses do not have the capital to adapt and change in these ways, it is unlikely that they will survive in the long term.
1.2.1.2.5. Pro: In the past, the [precarious position of these employee-owned companies](https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=lrr) due to their lack of capital meant that these companies struggled to work efficiently \(pg. 87\)
1.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: Workers [now have to divert their time](https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=lrr) between raising the necessary capital to start the company up as well as work in order to compete successfully against other businesses \(pg. 87\).
1.2.1.2.6. Pro: Inability to raise equity will lead to substantially higher [leverage levels](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) and thus will exacerbate risks of economic shocks.
1.2.1.2.6.1. Pro: Highly leveraged companies [are very sensitive](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/danger-being-highly-leveraged-organization-75535.html) to economic declines and at higher risk for bankruptcy.
1.2.1.2.7. Con: Businesses which jump start growth via influx of capital do so by rushing through processes which would result in a better business \(for customers, shareholders, and employees\) were they given the time to organically come about.
1.2.1.2.7.1. Pro: Founders of businesses often rush to venture capital firms for capital influx in businesses [without](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/6-questions-every-founder-should-ask-before-they-raise-capital) being aware of the alternatives. This results in founders giving up 10% to 30% of business ownership to these venture-capital firms.
1.2.1.2.7.2. Pro: Being dependent on an influx of capital to jump-start the business means that the priorities of the initial investors will override the priorities of other stakeholders in the business \(such as those of shareholders, employees and the founders themselves\).
1.2.1.2.7.2.1. Pro: Unlike banks, equity investors tend to [provide more than just capital.](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/6-questions-every-founder-should-ask-before-they-raise-capital) They provide guidance and connections, and will often have an active interest in the operations of the company. Investors want to work with “coachable” CEOs, people who are willing to take outside input.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Having no ability to invest in stocks will cause a rise in the price of other publicly traded goods, such as food.
1.2.2. Con: Worker owned companies tend to be [more economically prosperous](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies) than other enterprises.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Worker ownership encourages companies to carry out [R&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development).
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Having a role in the ownership of a company means that workers [feel a greater sense of responsibility for and a personal stake](https://www.fastcompany.com/40572926/more-u-s-businesses-are-becoming-worker-co-ops-heres-why) in helping the business improve.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Otherwise, workers might feel frustrated as they are working only for the gains of somebody else.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: The majority of workers do not have the education and skills necessary to be innovative; [many jobs do not, and should not](https://medium.com/new-markets-insights/why-innovation-isnt-everyone-s-job-69c9e0afc48f), revolve around the function of innovating on behalf of the company.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: R&D workers [account for](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=190282) only just over 1% of total business employment in the Unites States.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: "[Innovation](https://www.ideatovalue.com/inno/nickskillicorn/2016/03/innovation-15-experts-share-innovation-definition/)" does not have to refer to research and development type innovation. It can involve improving processes or management or cutting costs which every worker can have useful ideas about.
1.2.2.2. Con: Worker cooperatives find it difficult to expand.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Conventional lenders](https://medium.com/fifty-by-fifty/are-cooperatives-really-so-difficult-to-finance-3adec81c70a8) remain skeptical about financing businesses that have multiple owners and don’t typically provide voting shares to outside capital.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: In a world where all companies are worker's cooperatives - owned by multiple owners - conventional lenders won't have the privilege of choosing between companies such as these and 'other' companies; hence, they are likely to finance these businesses.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.2.3. Con: Worker cooperatives are less efficient because they place a premium on job security.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: [Research](https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/) has shown that coops are more efficient than traditional companies because worker inputs into the management of the company improves worker productivity and morale.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Giving every worker [a say](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/no-bosses-worker-owned-cooperatives/397007/#https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/no-bosses-worker-owned-cooperatives/397007/#) can slow down decision-making.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Black Star Co-op](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/no-bosses-worker-owned-cooperatives/397007/) has spent years trying to approve the building of a cover on its patio to increase seating in the hot summer months.
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Workers will vote in their own favor rather than in the favor of the future of the company.
1.2.2.3.3.1. Con: Workers' interests are likely to align with the companies' best interests.
1.2.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: Investment in new technologies improves [company productivity](https://itstillworks.com/can-information-technology-improve-productivity-1599.html) but also improves[worker's job satisfaction](https://www.itproportal.com/news/enterprise-technology-is-increasing-job-satisfaction/).
1.2.2.3.3.1.2. Con: Spending on research and development may be good for a company long term but in the short term may hamper a companies ability to give pay rises.
1.2.2.3.3.2. Con: In the long term, companies where the workers choose to vote against the company will fail. This is similar to how companies with bad leadership fail in today's market.
1.2.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: In times of austerity and low profits, prioritizing worker's welfare and job security is likely to threaten the survival of the company.
1.2.2.3.3.3. Pro: When deciding on which factory to close there will be a stalemate between the workers in the different factories.
1.2.2.3.3.3.1. Con: Decisions to close factories are made by experts elected to the Executive Board who have both the skills and the democratic mandate to make the best possible decision.
1.2.2.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Board members elected by workers' cooperatives to make strategic decisions on their behalf are likely to be experts in economic governance and management.
1.2.2.3.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The [Governance Expert Reference Panel](https://www.thenews.coop/118280/sector/regional-organisations/guide-governance-steer-co-operative-ship/) - comprised of governance experts from various fields - has representation on the board of various UK Workers' Cooperatives.
1.2.2.3.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: The International Cooperative Alliance - the umbrella group advising worker cooperatives across the world - [has a host of economic and financial experts](https://www.ica.coop/en/about-us/our-structure/board-directors) serving on its Executive Board.
1.2.2.3.3.3.2. Con: The alternative is workers having no say in which factories close as decisions are made by shareholders.
1.2.2.3.3.3.3. Con: Workers in workers' cooperatives can have discussions on the matter from a position of greater bargaining power as they all possess a vote.
1.2.2.3.4. Con: The global economy can afford to trade some level of efficiency for worker and community stability.
1.2.2.3.5. Con: The efficiency loss in hiring and firing may be balanced by efficiency gains from increased worker incentives to work hard and innovate.
1.2.2.3.5.1. Pro: [Research analyzing data](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/worker_co-op_report.pdf) on workers' cooperatives in Europe, the US and Latin America has shown that giving workers a direct stake in managing production improves business efficiency and worker productivity.
1.2.2.3.5.2. Pro: Job security is an important measure for [job satisfaction](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2014.914148) which in turns enhances [workplace motivation](https://contactzilla.com/blog/5-psychological-theories-motivation-increase-productivity/).
1.2.2.3.6. Pro: Workers have little incentive to innovate in areas that result in a loss of jobs, such as automation.
1.2.2.3.6.1. Con: Worker co-ops could still innovate and take advantage of automation, but would just use automation differently than how a traditional business would.
1.2.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: Co-ops would use automation to increase leisure time and lower working hours with the profit created by automation. This would in turn pay the workers more and give them more time with family/life.
1.2.2.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: As co-operatives necessarily are more focused on their workers' welfare, they will likely apply automation this way, rather than to boost profit at the expense of workers' positions.
1.2.2.3.6.1.2. Pro: Traditional companies use automation in such a way that they [pay their workers less and cut jobs](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15086576/robot-jobs-automation-unemployent-us-labor-market). This leaves workers without jobs or struggling to make the money they and their families need to get by.
1.2.2.3.6.2. Con: A [study](https://res.mdpi.com/economies/economies-05-00048/article_deploy/economies-05-00048.pdf?filename=&attachment=1) focused on unemployment in European countries has concluded that research estimations do not suggest that technological innovations have an effect on unemployment.
1.2.2.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.3.2.1.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Worker-owned companies are more productive.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.5.1.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Worker owned enterprises [tend to outperform](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies) their competitors.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: Worker owned companies see on average [4-5% higher productivity levels](https://www.fastcompany.com/40572926/more-u-s-businesses-are-becoming-worker-co-ops-heres-why) than other companies.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Worker owned companies [suffer less from employee turnover](https://www.fastcompany.com/40572926/more-u-s-businesses-are-becoming-worker-co-ops-heres-why).
1.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: The annual staff turnover rate of John Lewis Partnership - a large worker's cooperative - was 21% compared to 38% and 43% respectively for its two main competitors. \([Oxfam, 2014, p. 9](http://uwsoxfampartnership.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Co-op-Business-Model-Report-final.pdf)\)
1.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: [Cooperative Home Care Associates](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-02-10/a-fair-share-worker-cooperatives-and-the-growth-of-shared-capitalism/), the largest worker-owned coop in the U.S, has an estimated turnover rate of 15% in an industry that averages 60%.
1.2.2.4.3.3. Pro: When a companies' employees are constantly leaving, it is [difficult to maintain the same level of output](https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/high-turnover-affect-productivity-5329.html).
1.2.2.4.3.4. Pro: High turnover usually has a [negative effect on the morale](https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/high-turnover-affect-productivity-5329.html) of the remaining employees, who can become insecure about their own jobs. Low morale tends to make employees [less enthusiastic and productive.](https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/high-turnover-affect-productivity-5329.html)
1.2.2.4.4. Pro: [Friction](https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-economy-business/) between bosses and the staff is likely to decrease, saving time and costs.
1.2.2.4.4.1. Con: Greater employee involvement in decision making may have a negative affect on work friction, as some of the responsibilities that come with increased participation entail excessive peer monitoring and pressure which leads to interpersonal friction among employees. \([Oxfam, 2014, p. 9](http://uwsoxfampartnership.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Co-op-Business-Model-Report-final.pdf)\).
1.2.2.5. Pro: Worker-owned companies are more resilient than other forms of business models.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: Research suggests that worker owned companies are [more durable and resilient](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-the-u-s-needs-more-worker-owned-companies) during economic downturns.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Workers [oversee the logistics](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067666/how-worker-co-ops-are-creating-economic-stability-in-uncertain-times) usually handled by a middleman in a traditional company, allowing the company to reduce unnecessary expenses.
1.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: Worker cooperatives are likely to cut costs by [slowing down expansion](https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/) to maintain current assets whereas traditional corporations may pay less attention to strategic planning and simply shed jobs to tighten budgets.
1.2.2.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.3.2.1.
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: Worker owned companies [statistically see lower rates of business closures](https://www.fastcompany.com/40572926/more-u-s-businesses-are-becoming-worker-co-ops-heres-why) than other companies.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: In Canada, worker cooperatives are more resilient than conventional businesses.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: [Alberta](https://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/3132) cooperatives created in 2005 and 2006 had a three-year survival rate of 81.5% compared to 48% for conventional businesses in that province.
1.2.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: [A 2008 study in Quebec](https://ccednet-rcdec.ca/en/evaluation-SROI) showed that co-ops had a five-year survival rate of 62% and ten-year survival rate of 44%, compared to 35% and 20%, respectively, for other Quebec businesses.
1.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: [In 2005](http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/documents/publication/wcms_108416.pdf), 1% of German businesses were declared insolvent, but the statistic for cooperatives was less than 0.1%.
1.2.2.6. Pro: An economy based on worker cooperatives would change the incentives around education and incentivize educating workers in these skills. This would leave them better equipped to start their own businesses and increase competition.
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: Worker's cooperatives in the United States [have been shown](https://ldn.coop/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WorkerCoops-PathwaysToScale.pdf) to foster social innovation, expand access to business ownership, and train people in democratic practice.
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: Participation in the business decision making structure creates incentives for workers to learn more about management and for the company to invest in business education for their workers
1.2.2.6.2.1. Con: There are representative democratic models of worker cooperatives, where workers elect their board members to make strategic business decisions on their behalf \(presuming their elected board members have the expertise to do so\). If their board members don't fulfill their promises, by the next election cycle workers have an opportunity to elect new board members.
1.2.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.3.3.1.1.
1.2.2.6.2.2. Con: Decisions in economic and financial matters rely upon specialisation gained through years of experience and learning. It is likely that workers will not be able to attain this level of knowledge required to make sound financial decisions regarding the future of the company.
1.2.2.6.3. Pro: Innovation and competition are [necessary](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http:/www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/economic_research/oft1390.pdf) for economic growth and improving overall economic performance.
1.2.2.7. Pro: Worker ownership encourage entrepreneurship.
1.2.2.7.1. Pro: Worker's cooperatives receive technical and research support from international cooperative networks such as the [International Cooperative Alliance](https://www.ica.coop/en) which drives innovation.
1.2.2.7.1.1. Pro: The International Cooperative Alliance has [conducted extensive research](http://www.cicopa.coop/publications/the-future-of-work-where-do-industrial-and-service-cooperatives-stand/) in helping workers' cooperatives find innovative solutions to globalization, automation and environmental issues.
1.2.2.7.2. Pro: Workers are likely to be motivated to innovate since they directly benefit from the gains they create.
1.2.2.7.2.1. Pro: If Apple were a worker cooperative, each employee would earn at least [$403,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/12/18/if-apple-was-a-worker-cooperative-each-employee-would-earn-at-least-403k/#12b63cbb2dee).
1.2.2.7.2.2. Con: Many worker cooperatives don't pay equally for equal amounts of work.
1.2.2.7.2.2.1. Pro: Many co-operatives do have [pay scales and pay differentials](https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/jun/20/cooperative-myth-equal-pay).
1.2.2.7.2.2.1.1. Con: At Calverts design & print co-op, all workers are paid hourly, and the hourly rate is the [same for all job functions](http://workerco-operatives.blogspot.com/2009/).
1.2.2.7.2.2.2. Con: Pay differentials in worker cooperatives are much less than those in [other companies](http://digg.com/2018/biggest-ceo-worker-pay-gap).
1.2.2.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: The maximum pay differential between workers within a Mondragon cooperative is only [six times the lowest salary](http://www.mondragon-news.com/). This a significantly more equitable pay distribution than is the norm for [private companies](http://digg.com/2018/biggest-ceo-worker-pay-gap).
1.2.2.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.6.3.
1.2.2.7.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.
1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.6.
1.2.4. Pro: Worker-owned companies suffer from a slower decision-making process.
1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.
1.2.4.2. Pro: This makes it harder for worker-owned companies to [respond quickly to market changes](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-23-why-co-ops-what-are-they-how-do-they-work-\(1944\)/what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-cooperative-business).
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: This can put worker-owned businesses at a [real disadvantage in competition](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-23-why-co-ops-what-are-they-how-do-they-work-\(1944\)/what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-cooperative-business) with businesses whose managers have a relatively free hand and can better seize these opportunities with the market.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Businesses suffer if they are unable to respond to an [economic crisis](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-challenges-of-managing-an-organisation-during-and-after-the-economic-crisis-2162-6359.1000222.php?aid=38692) quickly.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Businesses suffer if they are unable to respond to [technological changes](https://www.coxblue.com/how-your-business-can-keep-up-with-changing-technology-trends/) quickly.
1.2.4.2.4. Pro: It is essential for businesses to respond quickly to [new market competitors](https://opentextbc.ca/strategicmanagement/chapter/responding-to-competitors-moves/).
1.2.5. Pro: If innovators and inventors are not allowed to reap benefits from their ideas by enjoying the profits they make from them, this is likely to dissuade entrepreneurship.
1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.7.
1.3. Pro: Worker-owned businesses are less likely to cause [negative externalities](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Externalities.html) in the communities they exist in and are also more likely to have [positive externalities](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Positive_externalities.html).
1.3.1. Pro: Job security provided by workers' cooperatives has been linked to [positive externalities](https://www.kialo.com/worker-coops-can-and-do-raise-capital-by-selling-stock-of-their-company-equal-exchange-is-one-such-coop-that-has-done-4774.107?path=4774.0~4774.1-4774.5-4774.107) such as improved public health and less burdened public finances in the local communities that they operate in.
1.3.1.1. Con: This link is tenuous - even if it can be shown that income increases as a result of surplus distribution, many economists find it hard to link that to human well-being as there is scant data on how workers use the surplus income. \([Committee on Cooperative Research, 2017, p. 153](https://www.ica.coop/sites/default/files/publication-files/aci-ccr-2017-vol104-latin-america-453321311.pdf)\).
1.3.2. Pro: Significant levels of [worker representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codetermination_in_Germany) on executive boards in Germany [has been associated with](https://hbr.org/2018/09/what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-worker-representation-on-boards) comparatively lower unemployment rates in Germany than in other countries during the financial crisis.
1.3.3. Con: It is misguided to rely on private corporations of any kind to reduce negative externalities and increase positive externalities in the first place.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Lobbying the government to legislate and regulate the actions of private companies is the more sustainable route to reducing negative externalities generated by companies of all stripes
1.3.3.2. Con: This is not an argument about the handling of externalities to be left to corporations only, but rather an argument that there will be a lower incentive to create externalities to begin with.
1.3.4. Pro: Worker cooperatives act as an alternative to big corporations that have created massive [global problems](https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/).
1.3.5. Con: Worker cooperatives pay less taxes than other enterprises.
1.3.5.1. Con: Each employee that earns more money would pay their fair share of employment taxes and at a [higher “personal income” tax rate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/12/18/if-apple-was-a-worker-cooperative-each-employee-would-earn-at-least-403k/#12b63cbb2dee).
1.3.5.2. Pro: Worker cooperatives don't have to pay [payroll taxes or self-employment tax](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2018/01/28/loophole-may-allow-highly-paid-professionals-to-take-advantage-of-20-deduction/#18da9cb64589) on [patronage dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patronagedividend.asp).
1.3.6. Pro: Worker owned businesses are less likely to close factories and move them elsewhere, because those who work in the factories own the business.
1.3.6.1. Con: Factories would have to close down if the goods they produce are not price competitive in the global market.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: The products worker cooperatives produce may be [more expensive](https://www.moneycrashers.com/food-coop-costs-benefits-drawbacks/) [for consumers](https://civileats.com/2018/02/28/can-food-coops-survive-the-new-retail-reality/).
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: Small cooperatives are actually [price competitive](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/5-ways-worker-cooperatives-counter-corporate-power) compared to large private firms. For instance, [Amicus Solar Cooperative](http://mailstat.us/tr/t/bjpn4pjzyj94jzmp9/h/https://ilsr.org/working-together-small-solar-firms-compete-with-big-name-rivals-episode-45-of-local-energy-rules-podcast/) relies on cost-saving strategies, less expensive equipment and dis-economies of scale in the solar power industry to [out-compete](http://mailstat.us/tr/t/bjpn4pjzyj94jzmp9/i/https://ilsr.org/declare-energy-independence-with-solar-just-shop-around-first-episode-49-of-local-energy-rules-podcast/) large national firms.
1.3.6.2. Con: Factories being shifted is not necessarily bad. If they are shifted to other areas, jobs will be provided to people living in those areas.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: This denies a legally available working class of their ability to provide for the nation, as well as themselves. By extension, you are also exploiting the labor of workers elsewhere. There are many moral and ethical issues with this.
1.3.6.3. Pro: A factory in Chicago that was going to be closed down was [prevented from doing so](https://medium.com/chorus-foundation/a-new-era-for-workers-a-chicago-factory-goes-cooperative-836682988472) by the workers turning the factory into a cooperative.
1.3.7. Pro: Owners of cooperatives have to live in those communities as well.
1.3.7.1. Pro: In the majority of cases, workers who are employed by workers' cooperatives [live in the local community.](https://www.redpepper.org.uk/Workers-of-the-world-co-operate/)
1.3.8. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.
1.3.9. Pro: Worker owned companies improve worker welfare compared to other firms. This leads to [happier](https://www.thenews.coop/39464/topic/democracy/co-operatives-make-happy-place-work/) citizens.
1.3.10. Pro: Improved democratic participation is a [positive externality and often one of the salient goals of any government.](http://journal.apee.org/index.php?title=Spring2006_8) Worker coops contribute towards increasing this externality.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Countries with higher political participation also have better performing governments. [\(Figure 1\)](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/is-citizen-participation-actually-good-for-democracy/)
1.3.10.2. Pro: Regular participation in democratic processes within a company is likely to create a culture of democratic participation and incentivise companies to educate their workers on democratic processes. This is likely to engender greater democratic participation outside the company as well.
1.4. Con: Worker cooperatives are less transparent than companies that are publicly traded like shareholder-owned companies.
1.4.1. Con: Securities laws and regulations could be updated to include worker co-ops in their scope, thus requiring them to be similarly \(or exceedingly\) transparent with their internal financial information.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The United States has [already created new legislative mechanisms](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=99CB2BDAB2B541E7D930440A01C8EF3A?doi=10.1.1.631.1311&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to bring worker's cooperatives under the ambit of securities laws and regulations.
1.4.2. Pro: A lack of transparency makes worker-owned company structure more vulnerable to fraud.
1.4.2.1. Con: Many local governments [operate cooperative scrutiny boards](http://democracy.plymouth.gov.uk/documents/g6367/Public%20reports%20pack%20Wednesday%2006-Jan-2016%2009.00%20Co-operative%20Scrutiny%20Board.pdf?T=10) specifically intended to monitor the financial and economic activities of workers cooperatives. This oversight is likely to deter workers' cooperatives from committing fraudulent activities.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: For instance, the [Telford County Council Scrutiny Management](http://www.telford.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/4753/scrutiny_annual_report_201314.pdf) Board has a Cooperatives and Communities Council dedicated to scrutinising worker's cooperatives and other similar enterprises.
1.4.2.2. Con: Workers' cooperatives often adhere to a Code of Conduct/Standard of Practice established by each country's worker co-op community. Such good practice is likely to prevent fraudulent activity.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: For instance, the [UK’s Worker Co-operative Council Code](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/worker_co-operative_code_2nd_edition_0_0.pdf) insists on good financial controls and management, including cash flow forecasts and internal audits of all parts of the business.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Publicly listed companies owned by shareholders are obliged to publish a significant amount of information regarding the company's internal finances and ownership, which is scrutinized by financial authorities. This public disclosure and increased scrutiny deters fraud in such companies.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: For instance, the [EU requires](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/transparency-requirements-listed-companies_en) the disclosure of yearly and half-yearly financial reports and major changes in the holding of voting rights from companies which issue securities traded on regulated markets within the EU.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Companies can still attempt to commit fraudulent activities through masking illegal activities by manipulating the data they release to the public and financial authorities.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Common techniques](https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/10/corporate-fraud-executive-compensation-personal-finance-risk-list-2-10-kaplan.html#534d8d563aeb) to mask fraudulent activities include improper revenue recognition, followed by overstatement of assets and bogus expense recognition.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.6. Con: People should have a right to work at a job and not have the risks and responsibilities of ownership and management. This decision should be make by the worker and the employer, not forced onto them.
1.7. Pro: Giving employees shares/ stock in the company will give the balance sense of loyalty and reward at the same time.
1.8. Con: If companies are owned by workers, their success and stability depends on the cooperation and trust among them. This would be hard to achieve for companies of a certain size.
