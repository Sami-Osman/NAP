Discussion Name: Should Gerrymandering Be Abolished?

1. Gerrymandering should be abolished.
1.1. Con: Gerrymandering is another word for redistricting; it just highlights the partisan intentions behind it. Redistricting is necessary in a democracy and partisan intentions are inevitable, thus gerrymandering cannot be done away with.
1.1.1. Con: Many [states](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting) are employing independent commissions to draw their districts to prevent gerrymandering.
1.1.1.1. Pro: There is [large scale support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/voters-are-stripping-partisan-redistricting-power-from-politicians-in-anti-gerrymandering-efforts/2018/11/07/2a239a5e-e1d9-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html?utm_term=.007d180dc270) for the use of independent commissions to redraw districts.
1.1.2. Con: [Computers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/06/03/this-computer-programmer-solved-gerrymandering-in-his-spare-time/?utm_term=.b3a10b70d5a1) can redistrict without knowledge of any area’s voting history, simply using the population numbers to calculate the best lines based on what the goal is \(most compact, adherence to city lines, etc\).
1.1.3. Pro: States are [legally required](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesberry_v._Sanders) to ensure that electoral districts have roughly equal populations. This makes redistricting inevitable as populations shift and after a census.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The [next round of redistricting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_redistricting) therefore already has a set date: 2022, after the 2020 nationwide census.
1.2. Pro: Gerrymandering negatively affects political representation.
1.2.1. Pro: Votes don’t matter in gerrymandered districts.
1.2.1.1. Pro: In the 2018 [midterm elections](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/17991938/what-is-gerrymandering) in North Carolina Republicans kept control of their 10-3 majority despite democratic candidates getting the same number of votes.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Gerrymandering in [Wisconsin](https://www.gq.com/story/republican-gerrymandering-wisconsin) has made it basically impossible for Republicans to not win elections.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The GOP won 161k [more votes statewide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/04/several-layers-republican-power-grabbing-wisconsin/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d77d59c4ede1) in 2016 and 29 more seats in the assembly. In 2018, the Democrats won 205k more votes -- and the GOP won 27 more seats.
1.2.1.3. Con: Democrats were still able to win [seats](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-08/midterm-election-results-democrats-gain-on-gerrymandering) in gerrymandered districts in the 2018 election.
1.2.1.4. Pro: In 2012, Republican congressional candidates in Ohio received just more than half of the statewide vote and won [75% of the seats](https://www.fairdistrictsohio.org/blog/four-reasons-gerrymandering-is-killing-democracy).
1.2.2. Con: Gerrymandering does not influence the results of elections such as the [governorship](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dems-cant-blame-gerrymandering-for-this-problem-gop-governors-holding-strong), allowing citizens to still be represented.
1.2.3. Pro: States such as Ohio have had [bipartisan support](https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/06/everyone-complains-gerrymandering-ohio-just-did-something/310438002/) in redrawing districts after recognizing how unrepresentative gerrymandered districts were.
1.2.4. Con: The number of Democrats within the House of Representatives is currently the same [proportion](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-12/gerrymandering-is-not-the-problem-with-america) of the national population who identify as Democrat.
1.2.5. Con: Despite attempts by the GOP in [Texas](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-12/gerrymandering-is-not-the-problem-with-america) to gerrymander districts in their favour, they won much fewer votes than they planned. Voters within gerrymandered districts can still be represented.
1.2.6. Pro: Gerrymandering benefits the party currently in power, decreasing their likelihood of getting democratically voted out and losing that power.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Gerrymandering increases [voter apathy](https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/06/everyone-complains-gerrymandering-ohio-just-did-something/310438002/) by members of the opposition parties. These voters are made to feel they can never win the election and thus there is not a point in voting.
1.2.7. Pro: Gerrymandering tears apart communities. Some cities exist within three or more different congressional districts to carve up cities, diluting their voting strength.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Some states suffer from such [extreme gerrymandering](https://rantt.com/the-top-10-most-gerrymandered-states-in-america/) that [court cases](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/supreme-court-to-hear-partisan-gerrymandering-cases.html) have been brought to demand redistricting.
1.3. Con: Gerrymandering allows officials to better represent the interests of their constituency.
1.3.1. Pro: If a district is drawn to favor one party, then a majority of people in that district will be happy with their representative. In districts that are close, depending on the voting method at least a big section to upwards of over 50% of the people in that district would be unhappy with their representative.
1.3.1.1. Con: This is true of representation within the district but not at the state or national level due to how gerrymandering splits voters up. As a result this leads to less [representation overall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGLRJ12uqmk).
1.3.1.2. Con: Politicians are supposed to represent all members of society. If they know they will never be beaten by a candidate from an opposing party, then there is no incentive to help members of that party.
1.4. Pro: Gerrymandering [brings out partisan extremes](https://www.fairdistrictsohio.org/blog/four-reasons-gerrymandering-is-killing-democracy), increasing polarization.
1.4.1. Pro: Polarization [harms society](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/12/22/why-polarization-matters/) because it segregates groups and produces social echo chambers in which people increasingly rarely befriend or even personally encounter someone who disagrees with their political views.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Polarization and echo chambers are leading to a greater [levels of hate](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/dec/04/echo-chambers-are-dangerous-we-must-try-to-break-free-of-our-online-bubbles) in society.
1.4.1.2. Con: Voters within America are not that [polarized](https://www.thenation.com/article/america-is-less-polarized-than-you-think/) from each other and share similar viewpoints on a large variety of issues.
1.4.2. Con: [Studies](https://q-aps.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/Gerrymandering_0.pdf) have not shown a link between gerrymandering and polarization \(pg.3\).
1.4.3. Con: There are [numerous](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/201809/why-has-america-become-so-divided) other reasons which can explain the increase in polarization.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The rise and popularity of social media and the corresponding [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) are [widely seen](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/is_social_media_driving_political_polarization) as a source of the growing polarization of American politics.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Outside interference contributes to polarization. One of the goals of Russia's meddling with American politics has been the [exploitation and promotion of political divides](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/russia-us-politics-social-media-facebook) over political issues in the United States.
1.4.4. Pro: The unfair nature of gerrymandering has led to large [protests](https://georgetowner.com/articles/2017/10/05/protesters-gather-outside-supreme-court-protest-partisan-gerrymandering-photos/) by unhappy voters who blame the actions of the opposing political party.
1.5. Con: Eliminating all gerrymandering makes it much less likely that enough [members of a racial or ethnic minority](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/could-gerrymandering-be-good-for-democracy-119581?o=1) could elect a representative from their group.
1.5.1. Con: Gerrymandering itself is the reason why many members of minorities are unable to elect representatives from their own groups.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In [Milwaukee](https://www.propublica.org/article/partisan-gerrymandering-is-still-about-race), a city where white and black areas are geographically relatively clearly separated, gerrymandering has packed African-American and Latino voters into predominantly white voting districts. This makes it practically impossible for them to elect politicians who clearly represent them.
1.5.1.2. Pro: It has been argued that thousands of African American and Latino voters have been shifted out of [Georgia's House District 105](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/house-district-105-among-the-many-tight-contests-shifting-gwinnett/d6BN82hrLDL2Kz6anrflJM/) before the 2016 election. The result was that Republicans were able to secure the heavily contested district.
