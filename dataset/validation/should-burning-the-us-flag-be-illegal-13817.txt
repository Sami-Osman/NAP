Discussion Name: Should Burning The US Flag Be Illegal?

1. Burning the US flag should be against the law.
1.1. Pro: Burning the national flag is a crime in [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration#By_jurisdiction).
1.1.1. Con: Other nations are less attached to their national symbols [compared to](https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/national-traditions/why-americans-love-display-flag.htm) the US.
1.1.1.1. Con: In countries such as [Israel, Saudi Arabia, and France](https://www.msuilr.org/msuilr-legalforum-blogs/2017/3/23/a-survey-of-flag-desecration-laws-around-the-world), flag burning is a criminal offense and is considered a far more serious issue than it is in the US.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The flags of 64 out of the world's 196 countries include [religious symbols](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/25/64-countries-have-religious-symbols-on-their-national-flags/)(A third of the world’s 196 countries currently have national flags that include religious symbols, according to a new Pew Research analysis. Of the 64 countries in this category, about half have Christian symbols \(48%\) and about a third include Islamic religious symbols \(33%\), with imagery on flags from the world’s two largest religious groups appearing across several regions.); people's attachment to their flag in such places may extend beyond political identity.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The US [protects](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/burning-koran-legal-flag-burning-cases-answers/story?id=11602696) people's right to burn religious symbols.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Despite the public attention given to [cross burnings](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Most-cross-burning-ruled-illegal-No-1st-2656655.php)("The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation," she wrote.\n\nBut, O'Connor said, one provision of the Virginia law is unconstitutional because it allows a jury to conclude that a cross burning was committed for the purpose of intimidation, without prosecutors having to present any evidence that was what the defendant had in mind.\n\nThe court cited that provision in overturning a Klan leader's conviction for leading the cross burning at the KKK rally and ordered a lower court to reconsider the second case.), such behavior is only illegal in cases where it occurs on another's private property for the purpose of terrorizing or intimidating.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Religious ideas and symbols often [precede the formation of nations](https://brill.com/downloadpdf/journals/jlrs/9/1/article-p95_95.xml)(This means that the religious message and symbols were foundational for both the social and political community. No conception of power, sovereignty, and law existed outside the ones given through the gods recognized and worshipped by the group. In premodern times, religious and political communities were aligned. From this perspective, religion was key to justifying the distribution of power and to creating cohesion and collective identification through shared symbols and rituals.) and national symbols, and may be directly associated with ethnocultural identity \(p. 100\).
1.1.1.1.2. Con: It is only illegal to burn the French flag at [publicly organized events](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/22/flag-desecration-france)(Under French law, only insulting the French national anthem or flag at a publicly organised event is illegal.).
1.1.1.2. Pro: There are [many countries](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/flag-desecration-laws) where burning the flag is legal, such as Australia, Canada, Belgium and Denmark.
1.1.1.3. Con: Countries with a [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_monarchs_of_sovereign_states) are often closely attached to their royal family, even if they are merely symbolic heads of state.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: In Thailand, it is [illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9_in_Thailand) to defame or insult the king.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: [Australians](https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/how-do-australians-really-feel-about-the-royal-family/10381732)(For example, 65 per cent of us say that the British Royal family makes no difference to our views of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn terms of consuming news about the Royals, 64 per cent of Australians are not at all interested\n...\nI think all this boils down to the fact that Australians consider the Royal family to be vaguely interesting, but largely irrelevant.) and [Canadians](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/royally-indifferent-canadians-no-surprise/article753023/)(A new Ipsos-Reid poll finds -- quelle surprise -- that 65 per cent of Canadians are "indifferent" to the Royal Family's importance, and believe it should not have a formal role and the family members should be regarded as "simply celebrities.") are largely indifferent to the Royal Family.
1.1.1.4. Con: It has been suggested that [American concern with national symbols has declined](https://las.illinois.edu/news/2016-01-15/violence-and-symbolism)(The point is that these sites were profound symbols of American power to much of the rest of the world. Yet, their symbolic significance needed explaining to many Americans, as did, in fact, the far reach of American global power. In my book, I suggest that all this needed explaining in part for historical reasons: In the Cold War, Americans lost their taste for great symbols and monuments. They seemed fascist, communist or otherwise totalitarian.) since the Cold War era.
1.1.2. Con: The US differs substantially from many other countries in its approach towards political dissent.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Since we have the [right](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/law-protects-flag-burning-united-states/story?id=43855624)(The act is considered offensive by many, but flag burning is legal in the U.S. under Supreme Court rulings that it is constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment.) to burn the flags of other countries in America, we should also have the right to burn the US flag.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In Germany, Denmark, and Japan it is illegal to [burn the flags of other countries](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-flag-burning-law-eu-israel-foreign-merkel-a9518911.html)(The amendment is expected to pass Germany’s upper house in June before being signed by the president and written into the federal criminal code.\n\nJapan and Denmark have had laws protecting foreign flags for decades, although in Denmark, the Danish national flag — known as the Danneborg — is not protected. Norway overturned a ban on burning foreign flags in 2008.).
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The right to burn foreign flags is distinct from the right to burn the US flag, since the implications of doing so are very different.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: It is the mandate of the US government to protect US interests, not the interests of other nations.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The [burning of foreign flags](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/flag-desecration-laws)(There are other reasons for these laws as well. Denmark, for example, bans the burning of any flag, with one exception: the Danish flag itself. According to Danish law, burning the flag of a foreign nation is a provocation that can hurt Denmark’s status in the world community.) does affect US interests as it can change how other countries perceive and relate to the US.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Unlike other countries, the US generally upholds the right of political dissenters to express their positions \([p. 1620](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3058&context=mlr)("The dissent model assumes that in large-scale societies powerful interest groups and self-seeking politicians and bureaucrats are unavoidable". In consequence, "\[d\]issenters and the dialogue that follows will always be necessary". "The value of dissent, then, in this context is not that it fosters individual development\nor self-realization, or even that it exposes injustice and brings about\nchange". Rather, it is a kind of "cultural glue" that binds the political community together.)\).
1.1.2.2.1. Con: There has been a rise in government-sanctioned [intolerance of dissent](https://www.aclu.org/other/freedom-under-fire-dissent-post-911-america)(Some government officials, including local police, have gone to extraordinary lengths to squelch dissent wherever it has sprung up, drawing on a breathtaking array of tactics - from censorship and surveillance to detention, denial of due process and excessive force. Police have beaten and maced protesters in Missouri, spied on law-abiding activists in Colorado and fired on demonstrators in California, and campus police have helped FBI agents to spy on professors and students in Massachusetts. Ashcroft's Justice Department has further asserted the right to seize protesters' assets and deport immigrants under anti-terrorism statutes rushed through Congress after the attacks, and debated whether to revoke U.S. citizenship in some cases.\n\nSome of the most insidious government practices, such as the compiling of political dossiers on protesters arrested in New York, didn't come to light until they were exposed and challenged by the ACLU.) in the US since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Political dissent is [actively discouraged or illegal](https://cpj.org/reports/2019/09/10-most-censored-eritrea-north-korea-turkmenistan-journalist/)(Repressive governments use sophisticated digital censorship and surveillance alongside more traditional methods to silence independent media.) in many countries.
1.1.2.3. Con: Countries like Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, are very tolerant of political dissent and are rated as having a high degree of [freedom of speech](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-freedom-of-speech)(Poland was the second-most tolerant with a median score of 5.66, followed by Spain and the United Kingdom with median scores of 5.62 and 4.78, respectively.).
1.1.2.4. Pro: Only authoritarian countries disallow citizens from protesting against the government in a peaceful manner. Therefore, [disallowing](https://cpj.org/reports/2019/09/10-most-censored-eritrea-north-korea-turkmenistan-journalist/) Americans from burning the flag would make the country seem undemocratic.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Allowing nonviolent protests and free expression of dissent can decrease the motivation for insurrection and thus [effectively drive political change](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/mightier-sword-unexpected-effectiveness-nonviolent-resistance)(Activists from around the world reach out to Harvard Kennedy School Professor Erica Chenoweth on an almost daily basis. And they mostly ask the same question: How can we fight authoritarianism — and the often-brutal repression that comes with it — without resorting to violence ourselves? They turn to her because her groundbreaking research has shown that, when done the right way, nonviolent civil resistance is actually more effective at driving political change than taking up arms.).
1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: It is healthy for people to [vent their anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/201404/6-virtues-and-6-vices-venting) in nonviolent ways. Flag burning could be one way to help channel disapproval into a constructive outlet.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: Research suggests that governments can effectively [reduce domestic political conflict](https://www.jstor.org/stable/174013) with a combination of policies that includes suppression of certain forms of dissent \(p. 266\).
1.1.2.4.3. Con: It is also important for people to [respect and take pride in their country](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/04/pride)(A new study finds a strong positive relationship between feeling good about your country and feeling good about yourself, particularly among people living in non-Western nations with low standards of living.\n\nThe study, published in the February issue of Psychological Science \(Vol. 22. No.2\), used results from a series of Gallup World Polls conducted annually before 2008 of more than 136,000 people in 128 countries. People rated their past, present and future lives and their feelings of satisfaction with their nation on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst possible, and 10 the best. Gallup also collected information on residential mobility, household income and people’s satisfaction with their standard of living, personal health and jobs.).
1.1.3. Pro: Burning the flag can incite violence and provoke uprisings against the government.
1.1.3.1. Con: Violence and uprisings against the government are, under certain conditions, justified.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The US was founded on sedition and a [violent uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) against unfair [British taxation policies](https://hsp.org/unfair-taxes-and-loyalties)(The Taxation Acts were passed by the British government during the 1760s and 1770s to help pay off the debt the British had incurred during the French and Indian War. These taxes on trade and commerce caused unrest that would lead to the American Revolution. "Taxation without representation" was one of the central issues colonists had with the British because all laws and taxes were imposed by the British government without any colonist involvement. Many of the colonists believed that, because they were British citizens, they should be represented in Parliament if Parliament was going to make any laws that affected the colonists.).
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)(We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\n...\nBut when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.) states that overthrowing an unjust government is a right and a moral duty.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Sedition and revolution are not protected rights under the [US Constitution](https://www.encyclopedia.com/politics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/right-revolution)(The right of revolution is not a right that is defined and protected by the Constitution but a natural right. It would be absurd for a constitution to authorize revolutionary challenges to its authority. However, it would not have been absurd for the preamble to the Constitution to have acknowledged the right of revolution, as, for example, the preamble to the pennsylvania constitution of 1776 had done. It was unnecessary to include such an acknowledgment in the Constitution of 1787, for the Constitution did not supplant the declaration of independence of 1776, which remained the first organic law of the United States.), and remain [crimes](https://law.jrank.org/pages/10113/Sedition.html)(Sedition is the crime of revolting or inciting revolt against government. However, because of the broad protection of free speech under the FIRST AMENDMENT, prosecutions for sedition are rare. Nevertheless, sedition remains a crime in the United States under 18 U.S.C.A. § 2384 \(2000\), a federal statute that punishes seditious conspiracy, and 18 U.S.C.A. § 2385 \(2000\), which outlaws advocating the overthrow of the federal government by force.) under US law.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Acts of [civil disobedience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-disobedience/) have played a long and important role in American history.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Since most acts of civil disobedience include [fidelity to the rule of law](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-disobedience/#FidLaw)(What makes an act of civil disobedience special? On some accounts, an act that satisfies the criteria of civility identified above, especially non-evasion, signals disobedients’ respect for and fidelity to the legal system in which they carry out their protest, in contrast with ordinary offenders and revolutionary agents \(Rawls 1999, 322\). Signaling one’s fidelity to law by abiding the demands of civility is seen as necessary to thwart fears of disorder or counter the impression that civil disobedients are contemptuous of democratic procedures.), civil disobedience should not be classified as violence or uprising.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Important acts of American [civil disobedience](http://historydr.com/civil-disobedience-american-history/)(The Declaration of Independence, 1776. Those who signed accepted that the hangman’s noose was their fate if caught.\n \nThe Underground Railroad, 1790 to 1860. Consider the famous case of Simeon Bushnell. He and his cohorts defied the Fugitive Slave Act to save a captured runaway slave from being returned to bondage. Bushnell et al were fined and jailed. When they got out of jail, they rescued other runaways, and everything they did was illegal.\n \nMartin Luther King’s March on Selma, 1965. King’s famous 1963 Letter from the Birmingham Jail gave mankind its greatest articulation of civil disobedience theory. He distinguished just laws from unjust laws.\n \nBurning draft cards in the 1960s. Draftees during the Vietnam War who did not believe the war was just, including Muhammed Ali, who loudly refused to fight. His actual words are in dispute, but “Why should black folks fight a war against yellow folks so that white folks can keep a land they stole from red folks?” became famous.) include: the signing of the Declaration of Independence; the Underground Railroad; Martin Luther King’s march on Selma, Alabama; and the burning of draft cards during the Vietnam War.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: This reasoning can be used to justify unwarranted attacks against the government.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The [January 6, 2021, attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack) on the US Capitol was instigated by people who wanted to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election.
1.1.3.1.3.2. Con: Attempts to justify unwarranted uprisings do not lessen the value of justified ones, in the same way that an attempt to morally justify an unwarranted murder is unrelated to the morality of a [justifiable homicide](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/laws/justifiable-homicide/)(The legal definition of excusable homicide is when a person kills someone on accident and while engaged in a lawful act. Justifiable homicide is when a person kills someone intentionally but does so for a “justifiable” reason \(such as acting in self-defense\).).
1.1.3.2. Con: Flag burning can just as easily be part of peaceful protests and take the place of violence.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: US, Israeli, and British flags are [commonly burned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/iran-factory-us-israeli-flags-protesters-burn) during peaceful ceremonies and protests in Iran.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Even if burning the flag is part of a peaceful protest, it may lead to [violent reactions by police](https://www.fox44news.com/news/settlement-reached-in-flag-burning-lawsuit/)(An attorney for a protester arrested during the 2016 Republican National Convention says Cleveland will pay his client $50,000 to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit.\n\nAttorney Subodh Chandra says Richard Newburger in July 2016 joined fellow protesters preparing to burn an American flag when Newburger and others were assaulted by police and sprayed with fire retardant.\n\nThe flag burning was led by Gregory Lee Johnson, whose arrest at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidating state flag-burning laws\n\nMisdemeanor charges filed against Newburger, of Chicago, and Johnson, of San Francisco, were eventually dismissed.\n\nA Cleveland spokesman declined to comment Saturday about the settlement\n\nCleveland previously agreed to pay Johnson $225,000 and protester Stephen Fridley $50,000 to settle their lawsuits.) or offended citizens.
1.1.3.3. Pro: [Inciting violence](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/inciting-to-riot-violence-or-insurrection.html)(Criminal incitement refers to conduct, words, or other means that urge or naturally lead others to riot, violence, or insurrection. Many states and the federal government have enacted laws prohibiting inciting riots, violence, or insurrection, whether by those names or under laws prohibiting disorderly conduct, public disorder, mobs, or breach of peace.) or [resistance against lawful authority](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sedition)(Sedition: incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority) are illegal under US law.
1.1.3.4. Con: Flag burning is less likely to incite violence than [burning effigies of public figures](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/flag-desecration-laws)(Because flags are fairly recent developments, the concept of flag burning, or flag desecration of any sort, is a fairly recent idea as well. Effigies were a much more common form of big-concept protest prior to the modern era. In the United Kingdom, it has been a tradition to burn an effigy of the Pope, or of failed Catholic plotter Guy Fawkes, for hundreds of years. Leaders embodied the state, so in the absence of other symbols of a legal territory, people burned representations of specific people.), which is more common and predates flag burning.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Burning the likeness of a specific individual or group can [incite violence against them](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/jewish-poland-effigy-easter-ritual-burned-judas-a8880801.html)(A Jewish effigy has been hanged and burned as part of an Easter ritual in Poland, an incident condemned as “deeply disturbing” by the Jewish community.\n...\nPoles also expressed their disgust at the revival of the antisemitic ritual, with many posting photos online of the same ritual being carried out before the Second World War.\n\nRobert Singer, chief executive of the World Jewish Congress, said: “Jews are deeply disturbed by this ghastly revival of medieval antisemitism that led to unimaginable violence and suffering.), while burning a symbol of a large, abstract entity like a nation can help defuse anger and rage.
1.1.3.5. Pro: There have been incidents where [police officers have been assaulted](https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2016/07/violence_breaks_out_during_ame.html)(Two Cleveland police officers were assaulted and about a dozen people were arrested as protesters outside the Republican convention burned the American flag.\n\nIt was the most turbulent protest since the convention began Monday, according to the Associated Press, and it briefly blocked delegates and media from getting inside Quicken Loans Arena.) during demonstrations featuring flag burning.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: It is difficult to establish causation between flag burning and assaulting police officers.
1.1.3.5.2. Pro: Flag burning symbolically undermines the rule of law, and thus reduces respect for the authority of law enforcement \([p. xvii](https://www.shotspotter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Presidents-Commission_p.163.pdf)(The fundamental purpose of law enforcement is to preserve the rule of law. Because law enforcement officers cannot and should not be omnipresent, it follows that it is not the badge and gun that protects communities from crime. Rather, this protection comes from a system of rules and a social compact in which Americans have faith and an expectation that anyone who breaks those rules—no matter who they are—will be held accountable by an impartial justice system enforced by competent officers of the law.)\).
1.1.4. Pro: The flag is a powerful national symbol for many people.
1.1.4.1. Con: Burning a flag doesn't change what it stands for or the honor it carries.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The US flag is printed on clothing, cups, mugs, stickers, etc., yet these uses are not considered a violation of the flag's honor.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The examples listed are violations of the [flag code](http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html). Though the code is unenforceable due to the First Amendment, it remains a guide on proper respect for the flag.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The flag code only applies to actual US flags, not to images of the US flag.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Perceptions of honor are subjective; some people believe that the act of burning the flag [dishonors](https://www.csmonitor.com/1990/0625/aburnt.html)(``It is wrong to desecrate the Constitution to prevent desecration of the flag. We do not honor the flag - indeed, we dishonor the flag - when we diminish the freedoms for which it stands.'') it.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Many American citizens consider the act of flag burning to be highly offensive.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Burning the American flag is as offensive as burning flags that represent other groups of people.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: A man in Iowa was sentenced to [15 years in prison](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50861259) for burning an LGBT pride flag. It is a double standard to criminalize this and allow the burning of the US flag.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: It is seen as a [hate crime](https://globalnews.ca/news/7975157/pride-flag-burned-huntsville-hate-crime/) to burn pride flags, but it is legal to burn the US flag, which represents all Americans.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Burning a pride flag that one owns is not inherently a hate crime since, although it may be a hate-motivated act, it does not also consist of a [traditional criminal offense](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes)(A hate crime is a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias. For the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” Hate itself is not a crime—and the FBI is mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties.).
1.1.4.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Burning the US flag should be a hate crime since it discriminates against Americans on the basis of their [national origin](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes)(At the federal level, hate crime laws include crimes committed on the basis of the victim’s perceived or actual race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.).
1.1.4.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Even if motivated by hatred of Americans, there must also be an underlying crime in order for any act to qualify as a [hate crime](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes)(Under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, people cannot be prosecuted simply for their beliefs. People may be offended or upset about beliefs that are untrue or based upon false stereotypes, but it is not a crime to express offensive beliefs, or to join with others who share such views. However, the First Amendment does not protect against committing a crime, just because the conduct is rooted in philosophical beliefs.).
1.1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: The man in question also [stole the flag from a church with a gay pastor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50861259)(Adolfo Martinez, 30, admitted to the media that he took the flag from Ames United Church of Christ due to his animosity towards homosexuals.\n\nPolice say the crime spree began at Dangerous Curves, a strip club, when police were called because a man was making threats. By the time they arrived, he had already been kicked out by bar staff.\n\nAfter leaving the club, Martinez then travelled to the church and ripped down its flag. He then returned to the strip club where he used lighter fluid to burn the flag in the street. He also threatened to burn down the bar.) and threatened to burn down a bar. The theft and destruction of another's property and violent threats are what made this a [hate crime](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes)(In the simplest terms, a hate crime must include both “hate” and a "crime."), not the burning of the pride flag itself.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Con: An audience being offended by ideas or expressions is [insufficient justification](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/88-155)(The fact that an audience takes offense to certain ideas or expression, the Court found, does not justify prohibitions of speech. The Court also held that state officials did not have the authority to designate symbols to be used to communicate only limited sets of messages, noting that "\[i\]f there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.") for limiting free speech.
1.1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that flag burning is [considered offensive](https://share.america.gov/why-protect-offensive-speech)(If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\n\n— Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan) by some people is precisely the reason that the right to do so should be protected.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: Allowing flag burning may result in less of such actions, since attempts to ban it are often met with an [increased number](https://www.ushistory.org/betsy/more/desecration.htm)(Passage of the Flag Protection Act resulted in a number of flag burning incidents protesting the new law.) of protests in which flags are burned.
1.1.4.2.4. Pro: Since the US flag is a significant source of American identity, burning it has negative psychological effects on those who identify with it \([p. 60](https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=kaleidoscope)(Public identity is negotiated in an event-driven process of performance and response;” one that is epitomized by the visual artifact the American flag. \n...\nThe context in which individual bodies exhibit the flag is critical to understanding the meaning the body is assigning. The body’s effect, therefore, on the flag can be understood through its utilization which brings forth new meaning to the flag.)\).
1.1.4.3. Con: Symbols do not have rights that can be violated.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: This notwithstanding, it does not remove the importance of the flag to certain Americans, and so it should be respected for their sake.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Symbols are [social constructs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016950400706) that evolve according to time and place.
1.1.4.4. Con: The power of the flag as a national symbol is the very reason why burning it in protest is effective.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: The power of any effective national symbol is dependent upon its ability to [trigger emotional reactions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1469-8219.00052)(It is only when symbols gain meaning as effective triggers of associated sentiments in many linked contexts, including that of daily life, that they become powerful. It is what is perceived as the proved ability of the state to correct disobedience to its rule and violation to its sovereignty that commands commitment and loyalty, necessary for state symbols to become effective. As long as the link between symbol and effect can be made credible as a natural connection of cause and effect, by rational or irrational means, by folk narrative or academic theory, triggering the national symbol works in the mind of its believers.).
1.1.4.4.2. Con: Using the high regard that many hold for the flag as a way to increase the emotional impact of protests promotes [disunity](https://reflections.yale.edu/article/who-are-we-american-values-revisited/disunited-states-america)(More than gender, race, age, or class, Americans are divided by political values, and those divisions are intensifying, according to the Pew Research Center American Values survey.) among Americans.
1.1.4.5. Pro: People have sacrificed themselves out of the love and respect they hold for the flag.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: Many current and former servicepeople and their families feel a strong affinity for the flag as a symbol that represents their sacrifice.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Many of those who have fought on behalf of America feel that burning the flag is a highly [personal attack on their ideals](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/12/house-section/article/H3726-2)(I personally feel, if one burns the flag of the United States of \nAmerica, one is burning a little piece of me, because I feel I have a \nlittle piece of that flag and I suspect every American feels that way. \nI think if one tears the flag, one is tearing a little piece of me. I \nthink every American feels that way.\n I would suggest that we do not want to encourage that kind of thing; \nwe should discourage it, and I would suggest that in the event that \nthere is an incident involving the flag, the side of law and order \nought to be on those who are protecting the flag, not on the side of \nthose who would destroy one of our most sacred symbols.).
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Even veterans, oft assumed to oppose flag burning, support its legality.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Gary May, who lost both legs to a landmine explosion while serving in Vietnam, [said](https://www.aclu.org/other/their-own-words-compendium-veterans-quotes-against-flag-desecration-amendment): "Ultimately, my responsibility was to support and defend the protestors' under the First Amendment to the Constitution to freely express their opinion, even if I disagreed with what they were saying."
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.2. Con: The opinion of individual veterans should not play a role in legal matters.
1.1.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: The opinions of [veterans should be respected](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/09/a-proclamation-on-veterans-day-2021/)(On Veterans Day, we honor our Nation’s veterans, who have given so much to protect our freedoms and the freedom of others around the globe. They represent the highest ideals of our country. While we can never fully repay the debt we owe these heroes, we will honor their service and provide them the care and support they deserve. We also salute and show gratitude for all who ensure our Armed Forces remain strong, united, and unmatched.), as they have often made significant sacrifices to protect American ideals.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Con: US service members take an [oath](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap31-sec502.htm)(Enlistment Oath.—Each person enlisting in an armed force shall take the following oath:\n\n“I, ____________________, do solemnly swear \(or affirm\) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.”) to support and defend the Constitution, not the flag.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: People have also died while committing atrocities on behalf of the US, which the flag symbolizes.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: The atrocities committed by the US legitimize the desecration of the flag in some circumstances.
1.1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Some American actions during the Vietnam War were [serious atrocities](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/my-lai-massacre-1) carried out under the orders of the US military.
1.1.4.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: The 1968 [My Lai massacre](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/my-lai-massacre-1)(The My Lai massacre was one of the most horrific incidents of violence committed against unarmed civilians during the Vietnam War. A company of American soldiers brutally killed most of the people—women, children and old men—in the village of My Lai on March 16, 1968. More than 500 people were slaughtered in the My Lai massacre, including young girls and women who were raped and mutilated before being killed. U.S. Army officers covered up the carnage for a year before it was reported in the American press, sparking a firestorm of international outrage. The brutality of the My Lai killings and the official cover-up fueled anti-war sentiment and further divided the United States over the Vietnam War.) led to widespread public outrage and demonstrations.
1.1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: Photos of the torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners in the [Abu Ghraib prison](https://theworld.org/stories/2012-03-12/5-major-atrocities-us-military-history)(In 2004, the world was shocked when photos were released of American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, a sprawling prison west of Baghdad which was notorious for its frequent torturing sessions and executions under Saddam Hussein, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe photos, which showed Iraqi detainees being beaten, abused and sexually assaulted, fueled Arab and Muslim rage against the United States, and were used as a powerful tool to recruit insurgents in Iraq and elsewhere, according to the Times. \n\nNine US soldiers were found guilty in the abuse case, which also fuelled multiple other military and Congressional investigations. Former President Bush proposed to destroy the complex after the crimes were uncovered, but an American military judge ordered that it be preserved as a crime scene, the Times reported. In March 2006, the military announced that it would clear out all remaining prisoners from Abu Ghraib.) at the hands of US soldiers led to international outrage and nine convictions.
1.1.4.5.2.1.3. Con: The US government [investigates allegations of atrocities and war crimes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/01/iraq.warcrimes), and holds those responsible accountable. Burning the flag over an atrocity ignores the US commitment to justice.
1.1.4.5.2.2. Con: Though individual Americans have committed atrocities, the [ideals](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)(The Declaration of Independence expresses the ideals on which the United States was founded and the reasons for separation from Great Britain:\n\n"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.") for which the country \(and by extension, the flag\) stands are worthy of being honored.
1.1.4.5.3. Con: The flag symbolizes a group of ideas; people have died for these ideas, not for the flag.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Pro: People have died to protect the US and the rights of US citizens, which include the right to burn the flag \([p. 2](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/free-speech-flag-burning_1.pdf)(ISSUE Whether flag burning constitutes "symbolic speech" protected by the First Amendment.\n\nRULING Yes.)\).
1.1.4.5.3.2. Con: US servicepeople have, at times, [died protecting the US flag](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/07/american-flag-men-died-for-it/)(Our troops have literally fought for the flag, for its physical advance and preservation. This is the story of color sergeants during the Civil War.\n\nColor sergeants carried the flag —typically, both the U.S. flag and the regimental flag — into battle, and not a weapon. They depended for protection on the color guard, a small contingent of troops dedicated to the task. The flag, held aloft and leading the way, was important as a matter of tactics \(to mark the location of the unit in the confusion of battle\), of morale \(to provide a rallying point for the troops\), and of devotion and honor \(to lose the flag to the enemy was a deep disgrace\).\n\nNeedless to say, this was hazardous duty that demanded the utmost bravery and dedication. According to Michael Corcoran in his book on the flag, For Which It Stands, the 24th Michigan Regiment lost nine color bearers on the first day of Gettysburg alone.) itself.
1.1.4.6.

A community that does not respect and defend its symbols or icons from abuse in the public domain cannot command respect in any society. In this age of postmodern cultural imperialism, the defense of cultural symbols and icons has become more vital than ever before.) for the country.
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: The US is [less respected](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/17/international-relations-experts-and-u-s-public-agree-america-is-less-respected-globally/)(International relations experts at American colleges and universities overwhelmingly say the United States is less respected by other countries today than it was in the past – and the U.S. public agrees with this assessment, though to a lesser extent.\n\nAmong the foreign affairs experts, 93% say the U.S. is less respected by other countries today compared with the past, according to a survey of international relations \(IR\) scholars conducted in October 2018 by the Teaching, Research and International Policy \(TRIP\) Project at the College of William and Mary. The poll included 1,157 respondents who are employed at a U.S. college or university in a political science department or professional school and who teach or conduct research on international issues. Only 4% of these experts believe the U.S. is as respected as in the past, with a mere 2% saying the U.S. gets more respect from abroad than it has previously received.) by foreign nations now than in the past.
1.1.4.6.1.1. Con: Lower levels of respect for the US are caused by [concerns over the country's policies](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/10/01/americas-international-image-continues-to-suffer/)(Looking back over the past few years, far fewer people across the countries surveyed say the U.S. government respects personal rights. In fact, in 17 of the countries surveyed in both 2013 and 2018, there has been a significant downward shift in the share saying the U.S. respects its people’s rights.\n...\nThe view that the U.S. is doing less to solve international problems is especially widespread in Canada and Western Europe.

1.1.4.6.2. Con: Silencing dissent, such as making it illegal to burn the flag, would be an ideological victory for the enemies of American democracy \([p. 4](https://med.virginia.edu/ciag/wp-content/uploads/sites/313/2015/12/report_threats_to_symbols_c2000.pdf)(No one knows better than the people in this room the pain that results from\nattacks on our national symbols, the symbols of democracy...\n\nWe started out talking about symbols of democracy as buildings or\nstructures, and I think we quickly switched over to looking at freedom of\nspeech, freedom of religion and . . . freedom of the press. Those are the\nreal symbols of democracy and we never lost sight of that.)\).
1.2. Pro: Burning the flag is not an effective method of protest.
1.2.1. Pro: Burning the flag doesn't make a coherent point.
1.2.1.1. Con: Every act or expression can mean something different from person to person; some people see burning the flag as making a coherent point.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Nonverbal acts can make a coherent point.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many ["silent" protests](https://www.history.com/news/the-silent-protest-that-kick-started-the-civil-rights-movement) have inspired social change.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Although nonverbal acts can make coherent points, they [do not always do so](https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/artshum/materials/spch/Buxton/W05/225/ch4VerbalAndNonVerbalSignals4.htm)(By their nature, nonverbal signals are ambiguous.).
1.2.1.1.2. Con: The nature of an act or expression is an essential factor in the meaning that people ascribe to it. A general or vague expression, such as flag burning, is more easily misinterpreted than a focused, clear expression.
1.2.1.2. Con: Even if no coherent point is being made in some instances of flag burning, freedom of expression is not contingent upon the coherence of that expression.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Incoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoherents) or [absurdity](https://englishsummary.com/absurdism-literature/) is a celebrated tradition of artistic expression. Flag burning could be seen as one such action.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Other forms of flag desecration have been [used by artists](https://www.dreadscott.net/portfolio_page/what-is-the-proper-way-to-display-a-us-flag/) to raise awareness of social issues.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Freedom of expression can be contingent upon coherence in some cases; an incoherent expression could be interpreted as belonging to one of the [unprotected categories of expression](https://www.britannica.com/topic/First-Amendment/Permissible-restrictions-on-expression).
1.2.1.3. Pro: The flag is too general of a symbol to represent the specific social ills that someone might want to protest.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Burning the flag is an expression of vague hatred for America, which is a form of [sedition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sedition)(incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority).
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: A modern definition of sedition typically requires an [overt act](https://law.jrank.org/pages/10113/Sedition.html)(The crime of seditious conspiracy is committed when two or more persons in any state or U.S. territory conspire to levy war against the U.S. government. A person commits the crime of advocating the violent overthrow of the federal government when she willfully advocates or teaches the overthrow of the government by force, publishes material that advocates the overthrow of the government by force, or organizes persons to overthrow the government by force. A person found guilty of seditious conspiracy or advocating the overthrow of the government may be fined and sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.) advocating, teaching or organizing the violent overthrow of the government. Flag burning does not meet this requirement.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Since many people find the burning of the US flag to be inflammatory and offensive, there is always a possibility that it will incite them to violent action.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Typically, when flag burning is used as a form of protest, the protesters are open about their intent, cause, and goals in making such a demonstration.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Flag burning was [commonly used](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/30/blaze-of-glory-the-grand-tradition-of-burning-the-american-flag)(In 1967 in Central Park, the star-spangled banner was burned in a much more literal way when the flag was set alight at a huge anti-war protest caught on camera in pictures that define the era. The squares were shocked, as they were meant to be, by a photograph of a ragged countercultural mob hailing the flaming flag, waved aloft in a parody of patriotic display. In another picture from the same protest, the bright flames of the blazing Old Glory light up a misty day as if bringing the napalm brutality of war from Vietnam’s burning villages into the heart of the US.) by protesters during the Vietnam War as a demonstration against US involvement.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The association between the American flag and many protested issues is tenuous at best.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: The American flag was burned in protest of [bank support for the Dakota Access Project](https://littlevillagemag.com/flag-burning-in-downtown-iowa-city-led-to-confrontation-citations/)(Jordan Adams, of Iowa City, who was among the protesters, said that the incident on Thursday grew out of a similar incident on the Ped Mall on Friday afternoon in which Andrew Alemao set a flag on fire and a bystander intervened.\n\nAdams said they selected the location in front of the downtown Wells Fargo branch in protest of the bank’s support of the Dakota Access Pipeline.). It is unclear how burning the flag relates to this issue.
1.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: The American flag was burned to protest [Fox News' coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/protesters-burn-american-flag-tucker-carlson-picture-outside-fox-news-hq-youre-all-racist-nazis-kkk/)(The protester who burned the American flag and the picture of Carlson was also seen lighting a smoke signal. He called for Fox News to “stop \[villanizing\] us” or else — he threatened — there would be “real smoke.”). It is unclear how the US flag represents Fox News.
1.2.1.3.3.3. Con: The bulk of the protests in which US flags are burned are protests of US government policies.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Burning the US flag as a protest against the US is [incoherent](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-03-29-9503290010-story.html)(Of course, the reason burning the flag is so stupid is because the burner is trashing the symbol of the country that gives them the freedom.), since the US itself is protecting the freedom of the protester to do so.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Burning the flag can be a protest of other aspects of America besides the First Amendment.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: The flag is a broad, general symbol of the entire US; burning it does not express dissatisfaction with one element or another of the US, it expresses discontent with the whole.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Part of what the flag symbolizes is the American right to protest.
1.2.1.5. Con: Burning the flag is an expression of protest.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Flag burning is used [worldwide](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/protestors-in-tirana-protest-open-balkan-initiative-burn-serbian-flag/) as a symbol of protest. Such widespread use implies a universal acknowledgement of the meaning of flag burning.
1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: Tibetans in exile burned the Chinese flag in [protest](https://swarajyamag.com/insta/watch-tibetans-in-exile-burn-chinese-flag-outside-embassy-in-delhi-protest-against-beijing-olympics) of the 2022 Beijing Olympics.
1.2.1.5.1.2. Con: The meaning of flag burning cannot be universal, since the meaning of a flag itself is not universal.
1.2.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: [Protest](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protest)(something said or done that shows disagreement with or disapproval of something) must necessarily involve both an act and a thing being protested. Flag burning does not meet this requirement on its own as it makes no claim as to what is being protested.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Con: It is implicitly understood that the thing being protested is the country that the flag represents.
1.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: The ideas that are intended to be expressed by those burning the flag are often inconsistent and [ambiguous](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/united-states-v-eichman/)(Justice Stevens, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, and Justice O’Connor, dissented. Justice Stevens said that the ideas expressed by flag burners are various and often ambiguous and that government should protect the symbolic value of the flag regardless of the specific object and content of the flag burners’ speech).
1.2.2. Con: Burning the flag seems to be a particularly effective demonstration of disapproval, if not the most effective.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The additional attention that is given to flag burning helps to spread awareness of protests and demonstrations.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If flag burning was made illegal, it would generate even more attention if and when it occurred.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Protests that involve [breaking the law](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott)(But on December 1, 1955, African American seamstress Rosa Parks was commuting home on Montgomery’s Cleveland Avenue bus from her job at a local department store. She was seated in the front row of the “colored section.” When the white seats filled, the driver, J. Fred Blake, asked Parks and three others to vacate their seats. The other Black riders complied, but Parks refused.\n\nShe was arrested and fined $10, plus $4 in court fees.) have been effective throughout US history.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Such increased attention would come at the cost of additional legal repercussions for protesters.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Flag burning adds an element of [shock value](https://buttesports.com/not-protest-without-shock-value/) to a protest that causes people to focus on the issue.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Because of the great symbolic value of the US flag, people will inadvertently pay more attention to the news whenever flag burning is involved.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Using flag burning as a tool for capturing media attention is disrespectful and unethical.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.2.2. Con: Flag burning played a negligible role in America's most effective [protest movements](https://www.ucf.edu/news/7-influential-protests-in-american-history/).
1.2.2.2.1. Con: There is a long tradition of [US resistance and protest movements](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/30/blaze-of-glory-the-grand-tradition-of-burning-the-american-flag)(It works as a provocation because flag-burning has a warm and special place in US cultural history. \n...\nBurning the flag has become a powerful symbol of that free speech – and the history of this iconoclastic act should warn Trump that he won’t get a free ride to trample rights. The fact that many Americans hold it to be a truth self-evident that flags were made to burn reveals how strongly resistance to power is written into the US’s history.\n...\nWhen a nation creates a sacred image of itself – the eternal American icon that is the star-spangled banner – it also provides an instant, potent means of symbolic dissent.) using flag burning as an effective method of dissent.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Flag burning has only become common relatively recently due to the [increased attention paid to images and symbols](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/30/blaze-of-glory-the-grand-tradition-of-burning-the-american-flag)(The sudden urge to burn flags that gripped the young in the 60s was not just about Vietnam. It has to be understood as part of a new attitude to images that started with pop art. Fascinatingly, the reason flag-protection laws appeared in the US in the first place was to prevent the use of the stars and stripes by advertisers and product designers. It was commercialisation that threatened to trivialise the sacred banner.) in modern times.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Flag burning has been supported by many government officials as an effective protest method.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: North Carolina Congresswoman Deborah Ross has publicly characterized efforts to ban flag burning as [ridiculous](https://freebeacon.com/politics/north-carolina-dem-deborah-ross-american-flag-problem/)(Ross, who had been with the ACLU since 1994, had been a steadfast supporter of free speech issues involving the flag.\n\nRoss fought legislation in 1995 that would have outlawed desecration of the flag, saying "we have a First Amendment right to burn the flag as symbolic speech." She said efforts to take away that right were "ridiculous."\n\nThe North Carolina ACLU celebrated the defeat of the "proposed constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag" in 2000 on its website, calling it "a tremendous victory for free speech and the Bill of Rights." The site also praised the "pivotal role" veterans played in defeating the amendment.).
1.2.2.3.2. Con: [President Trump](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/flag-burning-supreme-court-trump/index.html)("We have a different court and I think that it's time that we review that again. Because when I see flags being burned -- they wanted to crawl up flag poles in Washington and try and burn flags but we stopped them," the President told governors, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. "They're weren't able to do it. They would've done it if we didn't stop them. I think it's time to relook at that issue, hopefully the Supreme Court will accept that."\n\nHe continued: "If you wanted to try to pass a very powerful flag burning statute again -- anti-flag burning, I hope you'll do it because we'll back you 100% all the way. Okay? I hope some of you do it.") publicly supported measures to make burning the US flag illegal.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Lawmakers have often [proposed bills and amendments](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1109/flag-desecration)(Because the American flag is arguably the most sacred U.S. symbol, flag desecration remains one of the nation’s most controversial and polarizing issues. Several times during the 20th century, the Supreme Court handed down decisions on flag desecration.\n...\nIn every Congress between 1995 and 2005, the House of Representatives, when controlled by Republicans, has proposed such an amendment by the necessary two-thirds majority, but each time the amendment has fallen short in the Senate, which is less sympathetic to amendments in general.) to ban the burning of the US flag.
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Former US Senator John Glenn has been outspoken in his [opposition to a ban on flag burning](https://www.aclu.org/other/testimony-former-senator-john-glenn-against-flag-desecration-amendment)(This amendment should be defeated. The dangers from it far outweigh the threat that we have to the flag. I simply do not believe that this is a major problem for this country requiring an amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. \n\nOur most revered symbol stands for freedom but is not freedom itself. We must not let those who revile our way of life trick us into diminishing our great gift or even take a chance of diminishing our freedoms.).
1.2.3. Con: Effectiveness shouldn't be a factor in determining the legality of a method of expression.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Allowing forms of protest based on their effectiveness is problematic, since riots have proven highly effective as a method of protest \([p. 1](https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/McCoy_Research.pdf)(Observing the conditions and characteristics of street protests and determining whether they helped achieve the protesters’ goals is simply an empirical matter, not a prescriptive one. Moreover, as we shall see, it turns out that riots are effective in getting what the rioters wanted not when they are planned beforehand \(and in fact, a “planned riot” might be an oxymoron\) and not when people get hurt or killed, but when the riots are spontaneous and damage property only.)\).
1.2.3.1.1. Con: The use of offensive or violent tactics often [reduces support](https://peacesciencedigest.org/movement-violence-can-lead-to-a-decline-in-public-support/)(The academic research on this topic shows that nonviolent movements are more successful in achieving their long-term goals, whether influencing policy or bringing about regime change. Many researchers theorize that broad-based public support for protest movements is instrumental to their success and that the use of violence may weaken this support.) for a movement.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Although violence and destructiveness can be more effective at bringing about change, this does not mean that such methods should be legalized or encouraged.
1.2.3.2. Con: The US Government maintains the right to restrict the [time, place, and manner](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Time%2c+Place%2c+and+Manner+Restrictions)(The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees Freedom of Speech. This guarantee generally safeguards the right of individuals to express themselves without governmental restraint. Nevertheless, the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment is not absolute. It has never been interpreted to guarantee all forms of speech without any restraint whatsoever. Instead, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that state and federal governments may place reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of individual expression. Time, place, and manner \(TPM\) restrictions accommodate public convenience and promote order by regulating traffic flow, preserving property interests, conserving the environment, and protecting the administration of justice.) of speech in a way that supports public convenience and promotes order.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Ineffective demonstrations cause more disorder and are more inconvenient for the public.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: As long as a protest adheres to the laws governing the [right to assemble peacefully](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-assembly/freedom-of-assembly-overview/)(The First Amendment protects peaceful, not violent, assembly. However, there must a “clear and present danger” or an “imminent incitement of lawlessness” before government officials may restrict free-assembly rights. Otherwise, the First Amendment’s high purpose can too easily be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, it is imperative to protect the right to peaceful assembly, even for those with whose speech we disagree, “in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means.”), it should be allowable.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Using the effectiveness of a protest as a basis for its legal status would lead to ridiculous laws against benign but ineffective protest methods.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: By this rationale, harmless protests such as John Lennon and Yoko Ono's [bed-in for peace](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/john-lennon-yoko-ono-bed-peace-amsterdam/)(The innocent and somewhat naive mindset that the couple triumphed is one that Ono would later reflect on years later as part of a MoMO retrospective on her career. “John and I thought after Bed-In, ‘The war is going to end.’ How naïve we were, you know? But the thing is, things take time. I think it’s going to happen. I mean, that I think we’re going to have a peaceful world. But it’s just taking a little bit more time than we thought then,” Ono reflected.) against the Vietnam war would become illegal.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Benign but ineffective protests are a [waste of time and effort](https://peacenews.info/node/9240/why-protests-are-usually-waste-time)(For mobilising numbers of people, the easiest tactics to use for one-off protest organisers are marches and rallies. Those are also remarkably predictable and boring, likely to raise questions in participants’ minds about effectiveness: ‘How is this march going to change anything?’ \n...\nCampaigns are not enough to make fundamental change. Other activities are important, like building economic and social alternatives and stimulating cultural and personal transformation. But the power to handle the opposition of a determined or rigid opponent requires a nonviolent action campaign.\n...\nIf the civil rights movement had relied on one-off protests, today’s activists would never have heard of it. The movement had staying power because it used the campaign technique. Each campaign had its target: a department store or restaurant or school board or bus company or political entity. As the trainers of the Midwest Academy point out, a ‘target’ is able to meet your demand.), and they distract public attention from serious, pressing issues.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Attempting to ban ineffective but harmless protests would lead to the creation of laws that would be almost impossible to enforce.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Creating [unenforceable laws](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opinion-the-trouble-with-legislation-that-s-difficult-to-enforce-1565025977165.html)(One simple way by which more crime occurs in society is criminalizing more activities. To deter certain actions by criminalizing them increases the amount of crime in society and reduces the probability of being punished.\n\nTherefore, when enforcement resources are constrained, the expected value of the penalty facing potential violators falls as the frequency of violation rises. The late Mark Kleiman dubbed this “enforcement swamping". Consequently, the third effect is that even sensibly crafted pre-existing laws that were enforced to some degree will now be enforced to a less degree because of overloading of the enforcement infrastructure. More individuals will be incentivized to break those laws, resulting in more criminal behaviour in society.) undermines respect for the rule of law.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Con: Although such laws might be unenforceable now, they could become enforceable at some point in the future.
1.2.3.4. Con: Ineffective protest methods undermine public respect for political dissent in the US.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Protest methods that are ineffective can alienate potential supporters, and trivialize the protested issue to the public. For example, the [use of Nazi imagery to protest COVID-19 health measures](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2021/10/25/22745180/utah-governor-nazi-swastika-covid19-protest-jewish-holocaust-offensive)(One of the most disgraceful and misplaced of the myriad comparisons used to decry the public health measures are Holocaust analogies and Nazi symbols.\n\nEarlier this month, a group of protesters outside the Governor’s Mansion displayed enormous banners with swastikas formed out of the image of syringes — equating vaccination with Nazism. Comparing the two makes a mockery of the scale and scope of the Holocaust and the systematic murder by the Nazis of 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children and millions of other innocents. \n\nProtecting public health should never be equated to the horrors committed by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust. Encouraging vaccinations does not compare to schemes hastening the mass murder of millions of innocent people. Tying the Holocaust to anti-vaccine and anti-mask protests is as shocking as it is inaccurate and offensive. Policies designed to save lives do not equate with policies devised to mete out death.), such as masks and vaccinations, caused widespread outrage ad discredited the concerns of the protesters.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: The lack of respect for dissent in the US today stems from a [toxic and hostile communication environment](https://thehumanist.com/commentary/shake-things-sitting-pledge-allegiance/)(One thing that exacerbates the sharp divisions in America today is that there is very little respect for dissent. Indeed, the divisiveness that predominates in this country is not so much the result of widely varied opinions but the hostile, toxic atmosphere in which the conflicting views seem to clash. We live in a society where online rants and mean-spirited tweets are the rule, where the notion of seriously listening to opposing views and engaging in productive discussion of issues is a rarity.), not from ineffective protests.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Because the effectiveness of a protest is almost impossible to judge until after the fact, this could easily lead to [discrimination against particular groups or perspectives](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opinion-the-trouble-with-legislation-that-s-difficult-to-enforce-1565025977165.html)(The first is that low capacity to enforce leads to arbitrary enforcement. So, some individuals will get away while others will be punished. This tends not to be random. Typically, rich and politically well-connected individuals get away. Selective enforcement can also be pernicious, where the government uses these laws to punish its Opposition or target particular groups and individuals.).
1.2.3.5.1. Pro: It is not a simple matter to determine the effectiveness of awareness campaigns. Some seemingly ineffective protests may have far-reaching effects long after the protest.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: It is in the interest of the US government to place strong regulations on protest wherever possible to [promote law and order](https://www.icnl.org/wp-content/uploads/Global-Trends-October-2018-final.pdf)(The United States, like many other countries in recent years, has\nwitnessed mass protest activity by large-scale movements. The Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter, Women’s March, Dakota Access Pipeline protests, climate change activism, #MeToo movement, and most recently, March for Our Lives are just a few prominent examples of recent protests. Many elected officials in the United States federal and state governments have responded to the rise in protest activity–a trend that has led some civil society experts to describe the current moment as the “age of rage”–by seeking to restrict the right to assemble.\n...\nUnder international human rights law, the right to peaceful assembly is not\nabsolute. It can be restricted in certain exceptional situations, but only if\nsuch restrictions are necessary, proportionate, and done for certain narrowly construed purposes, such as protecting public health or safety) \(p. 1\).
1.2.4. Pro: There are other ways to voice disapproval without insulting all of America by burning the flag.
1.2.4.1. Pro: [Picketing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/picketing)(Picketing is a method of protesting where individuals stand outside of a workplace or organization to publicize an issue, often a labor dispute, and persuade employees or customers to withhold their work or business. Picketing allows the picketers to notify the public of the existence of a strike, to disseminate information concerning the controversy, and to communicate the facts dealing with their side of the dispute. Usually, the picketers bear signs with messages voicing their grievances.) is an effective way to protest specific social issues.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Picketing was [effective](https://www.loc.gov/collections/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/tactics-and-techniques-of-the-national-womans-party-suffrage-campaign/) at helping the Women's Suffrage Movement.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Picketing does not draw as much attention to an issue as flag burning.
1.2.4.2. Pro: It is often not effective to offend those whose support you are hoping to gain.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Offensive and insulting arguments are seen as [inappropriate](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/06/19/the-bounds-of-political-debate-and-criticism/) by a majority of people.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: The purpose of a flag burning protest might not be to gain support but to incite systematic change.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: It is difficult to incite systematic change without broad support in a democracy.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.4.3. Con: The existence of other forms of protest is not a sufficient reason to disallow flag burning.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: It is arbitrary to make flag burning illegal if other forms of protest are allowed.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Many [other forms of protest](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/the-purpose-and-power-of-protest)(Protests can take the form of marches, sit-ins, boycotts, and include speeches, music, chanting, performance art, poetry, using symbols, holding signs and confronting people, assembling near symbols and in places of significance to the cause \(e.g., a monument\) or occupying a specific building or space.) do not undermine the rule of law as flag burning does.
1.2.4.4. Con: Burning a symbol is not inherently disrespectful to that symbol or what it represents. The perception of disrespect is subjective.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: The [US Flag Code](https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/usflag/uscode36.html)(The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.) recommends burning as the correct and dignified way to retire a flag.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: Since protests involving flag burning do not follow the correct [protocol](https://www.legion.org/flag/ceremony), they cannot be considered respectful.
1.2.4.4.1.2. Pro: If there are conditions under which it is considered respectful to burn a flag, the act cannot be intrinsically disrespectful.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: Burning a symbol within the context of an anti-American protest whose goals are explicitly stated cannot be interpreted in any way other than disrespect.
1.2.4.5. Con: It is not illegal to insult America.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.2.4.5.2. Con: According to the [fighting words doctrine](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/personal-public-expression-overview/fighting-words/), speech and expressions that are likely to result in violent action can be illegal. Flag burning could qualify as such in the case of people who are highly attached to the symbol.
1.2.4.6. Pro: [Lawsuits](https://www.protestlaw.org/)(The Center for Protest Law and Litigation was launched by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund to bring a nationally coordinated and strategic fightback against the attacks on democracy and fundamental civil rights and liberties.\n\n For over 25 years, we have been leaders in bringing high impact, landmark civil rights and First Amendment litigation. Our work has forced systemic changes in law and policy governing police conduct. We have won groundbreaking cases enforcing constitutional rights. This transformative work is carried out in partnership with those most affected, centering the social and political demands of communities and activists that are the subject of the repression underlying the litigation.) can be a particularly effective method of protest.
1.2.4.6.1. Con: Unlike flag burning, lawsuits can be [prohibitively expensive](https://calbizjournal.com/lawsuit-basics-how-much-does-it-cost-to-sue-someone/)(It’s difficult to come up with an average number for how much suing someone costs, but you should expect to pay somewhere around $10,000 for a simple lawsuit. If your lawsuit is complicated and requires a lot of expert witnesses, the cost will be much, much higher.) to low-income individuals.
1.2.4.6.1.1. Con: [Civil rights litigation](https://www.clearinghouse.net/) is common in the US, and is often undertaken by [civil rights organizations](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/resources/civil-rights-organizations) on behalf of citizens.
1.2.4.6.2. Con: Lawsuits are only effective in cases where there is a legal issue at stake and would be ineffective in protesting a war, for example.
1.2.4.6.3. Pro: Aside from resolving the immediate issue at hand, lawsuits often drive changes to legislation \([p. 1882](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2046&context=ulj)(Lawsuits may effectively highlight issues with deep cultural import, thereby forcing government to examine them.\n...\nStoddard suggests that legislative lawmaking is the most effective means for creating social change. He\nadvocates that it is "the avenue of change most likely to advance 'culture-shifting' as well as 'rule-shifting' - the method of lawmaking most likely to lead to absorption into the society of new ideas and relationships. ')\).
1.3. Con: Banning flag burning would violate the First Amendment.
1.3.1. Pro: [Texas v. Johnson](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/88-155) held that flag burning is constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment.
1.3.1.1. Con: Texas v. Johnson was decided by a [5:4 decision](https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-texas-v-johnson) against banning flag burning. Since the court was not unanimous, many still consider the decision contentious.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: It is [fairly common](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/23/trey-wingo/despite-popular-misconception-supreme-court-9-0-ru/) for unanimous rulings to occur on the Supreme Court. The fact that they were split suggests that there were political motivations behind the decision.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: The law states that only [a majority is needed](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1)(A majority of Justices must agree to all of the contents of the Court's opinion before it is publicly delivered. Justices do this by "signing onto" the opinion. The Justice in charge of writing the opinion must be careful to take into consideration the comments and concerns of the others who voted in the majority. If this does not happen, there may not be enough Justices to maintain the majority. On rare occasions in close cases, a dissenting opinion later becomes the majority opinion because one or more Justices switch their votes after reading the drafts of the majority and dissenting opinions. No opinion is considered the official opinion of the Court until it is delivered in open Court \(or at least made available to the public\).) to enact a Supreme Court decision. The number of dissenting opinions is irrelevant to the final outcome.
1.3.2. Con: There are cases in which [restrictions on free speech](https://www.britannica.com/topic/First-Amendment/Permissible-restrictions-on-expression)(Second, a few narrow categories of speech are not protected from government restrictions. The main such categories are incitement, defamation, fraud, obscenity, child pornography, fighting words, and threats. As the Supreme Court held in Brandenburg v. Ohio \(1969\), the government may forbid “incitement”—speech “directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action” \(such as a speech to a mob urging it to attack a nearby building\). But speech urging action at some unspecified future time may not be forbidden.) are justifiable.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The First Amendment does not protect acts of destruction, which flag burning is.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The First Amendment does not allow the destruction of [other people's property](https://editorials.voa.gov/a/the-importance-of-the-first-amendment-/3733070.html)(Destruction of the property of others is not protected by the First Amendment.), which remains a criminal act; destroying one's own property is allowed.
1.3.2.2. Con: These restrictions are largely focused on inciting [imminent lawless action](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/personal-public-expression-overview/incitement-to-imminent-lawless-action/)(The Supreme Court has said that for speech to lose First Amendment protection, it must be directed at a specific person or group and it must be a direct call to commit immediate lawless action. The time element is critical. The Court wrote that “advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time … is not sufficient to permit the State to punish Hess' speech.” In addition, there must be an expectation that the speech will in fact lead to lawless action.), whereas flag burning is a vague demonstration of displeasure.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.2.
1.3.3. Con: The First Amendment does not specifically mention flag burning, this is only a [court's interpretation](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1109/flag-desecration)(Because the American flag is arguably the most sacred U.S. symbol, flag desecration remains one of the nation’s most controversial and polarizing issues. Several times during the 20th century, the Supreme Court handed down decisions on flag desecration. \n\nConcerns about the flag generally fall into three distinct periods. In the years prior to and during World War I, states began to adopt flag desecration laws. The World War II era saw many states adopting flag salute laws. In the years since the Vietnam War, Congress and the Supreme Court have once again been grappling with the issue.) of it; another court might decide on a different interpretation.
1.3.3.1. Con: Supreme Court decisions are [rarely overturned](https://qz.com/2098152/how-often-are-supreme-court-decisions-overturned/), thus suggesting that this interpretation is likely to remain part of the law.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Despite representing a small percentage of the total number of decisions, there have been [over 300 Supreme Court cases](https://explorethearchive.com/overturned-supreme-court-cases)(Over the past 200 years, there have been over 300 Supreme Court cases that have been overturned. More recently, about 60 cases have been overturned in the last 46 years, often due to the shifts in political climate or societal views, especially surrounding race and gender.) where prior rulings were overturned.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: A Supreme Court ruling would not be necessary to change the law; the legislative branch can pass a [Constitutional amendment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/)(The founders also specified a process by which the Constitution may be amended, and since its ratification, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. In order to prevent arbitrary changes, the process for making amendments is quite onerous. An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the States request one, by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each State for ratification.).
1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: There have been [27 amendments](https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendments.html)(Since the Constitution was ratified in 1788, the document has been amended twenty-seven times. Some of these amendments became pillars of American law; others were repealed. And a few, while still technically in effect, became inconsequential with the passage of time. The first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were passed in 1789.) made to the US Constitution.
1.3.3.1.2.2. Con: Proposed Constitutional amendments are [very difficult to pass](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/12/a-look-at-proposed-constitutional-amendments-and-how-seldom-they-go-anywhere/)(The U.S. Constitution is famously difficult to amend: It takes a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, then ratification by three-quarters of the states. Although Congress can also call a convention to propose amendments upon application by two-thirds of the states, that threshold has never been reached.\n... \nOf the roughly 12,000 amendments proposed since the Constitutional Convention, only 33 have gone to the states for ratification, and just 27 have made it all the way into the Constitution. Since 1999, members of Congress have introduced 747 proposed constitutional amendments, or an average of nearly 75 per two-year term. ... But not one has become part of the Constitution, or even come close. In fact, the last time a proposed amendment gained the necessary two-thirds support in both the House and Senate was 1978) and are overwhelmingly rejected.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Many fundamental concepts in American law, such as the [separation of church and state](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/e-lessons/reynolds-v-united-states-1879), have been reinterpreted by the courts over the years.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The ability of the US Supreme Court to [interpret and clarify the Constitution](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx)(As the final arbiter of the law, the Court is charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law and, thereby, also functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court is "distinctly American in concept and function," as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes observed. Few other courts in the world have the same authority of constitutional interpretation and none have exercised it for as long or with as much influence.) is a distinctly American practice, and is considered an essential element of American democracy.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Although the courts have reinterpreted the First Amendment to allow for a number of [reasonable restrictions on free speech](https://theconversation.com/the-idolization-of-free-speech-in-the-united-states-155778)(Free speech is not absolute – US law does recognize a number of important restrictions to free speech. These include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, harassment, incitement to illegal conduct and imminent lawless action, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising, copyright or patent rights.\n\nPolitical speech, on the other hand, is one of the most protected categories.), political speech remains one of the most protected categories.
1.3.4. Pro: Freedom of speech extends to nonverbal acts. To express yourself in a creative way, such as by burning something, is American at its core.
1.3.4.1. Con: Symbolic speech that [threatens public order](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1022/symbolic-speech)(Symbolic speech consists of nonverbal, nonwritten forms of communication, such as flag burning, wearing arm bands, and burning of draft cards. It is generally protected by the First Amendment unless it causes a specific, direct threat to another individual or public order.) is not protected by the First Amendment.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Burning the flag does not constitute a [specific or direct threat](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1022/symbolic-speech)(Symbolic speech consists of nonverbal, nonwritten forms of communication, such as flag burning, wearing arm bands, and burning of draft cards.

1.3.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.1.1.1.
1.3.4.3. Pro: It is [patriotic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAMJafbZm5k) to burn the flag.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Patriotism can often [require political dissent](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/defending-the-right-of-radical-dissent-is-the-highest-expression-of-patriotism/)(Washington’s warning “to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism” was a good one. A straitjacketed liberty, which imagines patriotism to be expressed only in the most cautious and predictable forms, is antithetical to the American experiment. \n...\n“Let them call me rebel and welcome, I feel no concern from it,” Paine announced in The Crisis, “but I should suffer the misery of devils, were I to make a whore of my soul by swearing allegiance to one whose character is that of a sottish, stupid, stubborn, worthless, brutish man.”\n\nThis is the true faith of the American experiment, as it has been handed down, across the generations, to those who would demand not just the rhetoric but the reality of “liberty and justice for all.” It is a faith that says it is possible—and often necessary—to be both a patriot and a radical.).
1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: Expressing displeasure with specific policies and actions can be a sign of legitimate concern for a country's welfare.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: Because it expresses anger or hatred towards one's country, flag burning inherently cannot be [patriotic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patriotism)(Definition of patriotism: love for or devotion to one's country).
1.3.4.3.2.1. Con: Different people express patriotism and dissent in different ways.
1.3.5. Pro: If the government gets permission to curtail an individual's right to speak in this way, they are likely to prevent people from speaking in other ways.
1.3.5.1. Pro: It has been suggested that the movement to criminalize flag burning is associated with [intolerance of dissent](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/29/13776570/trump-ban-flag-burning-patriotism-dissent)(Donald Trump is laying out his agenda: He wants flag-burning to be a crime, possibly resulting in a loss of citizenship or even a year in jail, he tweeted Tuesday morning.\n\nHe was likely referring to an anti-Trump protest at the liberal Hampshire College in western Massachusetts, at which an alleged flag-burning took place.\n\nHis statement can easily be interpreted as yet another inflammatory and distracting Trump tweet — there have been many, after all. But Trump’s calls for punishing flag-burners hinges on more substantial themes behind his political rise: an intolerance for dissenting voices and critique, and a willingness to turn a blind eye to certain inalienable rights afforded by the US Constitution.).
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: A key feature of freedom of speech is the ability to express ideas that are unpopular with those in power. Allowing lawmakers to ban an expression they dislike undermines this principle.
1.3.5.2. Con: Without concrete steps as to how these consequences may come to pass, this is a fallacious [slippery slope argument](https://www.britannica.com/topic/slippery-slope-argument)(... the fallacy of arguing that a certain course of action is undesirable or that a certain proposition is implausible because it leads to an undesirable or implausible conclusion via a series of tenuously connected premises, each of which is understood to lead, causally or logically, to the premise \(or conclusion\) that follows it.).
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Allowing the legislature to define what constitutes a "flag" and what constitutes "desecration" could easily result in new restrictions on the acceptable uses of flags and flag-related imagery.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.4. Con: There are more pressing issues than making flag burning a crime.
1.4.1. Con: Laws should be based on morality and justice, not whether the issue is urgent.
1.4.1.1. Pro: There are plenty of laws that are focused on insignificant [infractions](https://www.alllaw.com/criminal/what-is-an-infraction.html) like loitering or jaywalking, but these are still important parts of the justice system.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: [Nuisance laws](https://www.timesleader.com/archive/1145129/nuisance-laws-found-to-often-target-blacks)(Blacks are arrested for alleged minor offenses far more frequently than whites in some suburbs where police aggressively enforce nuisance laws to fight drugs and violence, a newspaper reported Sunday.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer said its yearlong investigation showed that such police tactics “can — and often do — go awry, resulting in the arrest of many innocent people and creating resentment and racial strains in community after community.”\n\nMany police chiefs in suburban Philadelphia say nuisance laws — such as those regarding noise, loitering, disorderly conduct and jaywalking — are an indispensable tool in their quest to rid the streets of serious criminals. Targeting small crimes helps discourage larger ones, some say.), such as those against jaywalking and loitering are not based on morality or justice, and have been used to unfairly target ethnic minorities.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Many laws about insignificant infractions are intended to prevent greater harms, such as forbidding jaywalking in order to avid [danger to motorists and pedestrians themselves](https://www.drivesafeonline.org/traffic-school/what-is-jaywalking/)(Although jaywalking is mainly an urban issue, a pedestrian dies every 113 minutes and is injured every 8 minutes due to pedestrian-vehicle accidents.\n...\nAlthough vehicles are still required to give pedestrians the right of way whether or not they’re at a marked crosswalk, nearly 80% of all pedestrian-vehicle accidents say that the pedestrian was at fault. \n...\nEven if you think you’ve got your eye on every vehicle on the road, the fact is that other people’s actions remain unpredictable. That’s precisely why drivers may drive defensively. This tactic entails being hyper-aware of other drivers, to the point where you’re prepared to react to any situation.).
1.4.1.2. Con: Given that the US justice system already faces a [backlog](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1015526430/the-nations-courthouses-confront-massive-backlogs-in-criminal-cases) of cases, it would be wrong to further burden the system by prosecuting victimless crimes like flag burning.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: There are [many other victimless crimes](https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/criminal-defense/what-are-some-examples-of-victimless-crimes.html)(Is there such a thing as a victimless crime? Yes. Criminal justice laws are created by the government to restrict unwanted behavior and actions. Many of these criminal laws are meant to protect others, such as laws against assault or abuse. However, a number of laws criminalize consensual behavior or actions where there are no victims. This may include laws against recreational drug use or prostitution.), such as [trespassing or public nudity](https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/criminal-defense/what-are-some-examples-of-victimless-crimes.html), that are prosecuted under US law.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Victimless crimes](https://www.laralaw.com/blog/2017/07/how-many-of-us-commit-victimless-crimes/)(A victimless crime is where there is no identifiable victim. The offense is against the cultural norms of a community, that community’s values, attitude and beliefs. Thus, what is considered a crime in one country, or state or even county may not be considered a crime in another.) should not be treated as important issues in the US justice system.
1.4.2. Con: Flag burning is a highly charged political act that has serious implications for society.
1.4.2.1. Con: Flag burning is a good indicator of society's displeasure with the direction that the country is taking. By making it illegal, it will be more difficult for policymakers to judge the will of the people.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: An expression of general displeasure with a country's policies is not specific enough to be actionable in terms of guiding policy change.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Legitimizing flag burning could also legitimize other acts of political subversion.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Flag burning could inspire people to [desecrate](https://globalnews.ca/news/7048340/christopher-columbus-statues-destroyed/) other national symbols, such as statues, monuments, and government property.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Flag burning may inspire large numbers of people to [stop paying their taxes](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/legality-of-refusing-to-pay-income-tax.html), which would seriously impede the ability of the government to function.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: There is no causal link established between flag burning and other acts of political subversion.
1.4.2.3. Con: Many people, including some [lawmakers](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-06-19-mn-381-story.html)(Former Sen. J. William Fulbright expressed disappointment with his successors in government, saying it is a “great tragedy” that politicians have shifted their attention from world events to debate a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.\n...\nAsked to comment on the flag amendment, he said, “I think it’s a great tragedy that in this time of very promising issues that we should be diverted by such an . . . utterly emotional and unimportant issue.\n\n“I just don’t understand it. But I thoroughly disapprove of fooling with \(the Constitution\). I think it ought to be left alone.”), do not consider flag burning to be a serious issue.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Many lawmakers do believe that flag burning is a [serious issue](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/558375-gop-senator-introduces-constitutional-amendment-to-ban-flag-burning)(GOP Sen. Steve Daines \(Mont.\) on Monday reintroduced a constitutional amendment to bar the "physical desecration of the American flag."\n\n“The American flag is a symbol of liberty and a beacon of hope. It represents the ideals that our nation was built upon and for decades, brave men and women have carried its colors into battle to defend the United States of America,” the Montana senator said in a statement released on Flag Day.\n\n“The Stars and Stripes are a representation of freedom. We must always protect and respect the American flag,” he added.\n\nDaines has introduced this amendment two times before.) and consistently launch proposals to outlaw it.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.
1.4.2.4. Con: Some have attributed the recent attempts to present flag burning as a pressing issue to [manipulation of the news cycle](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/donald-trump-flag-burning-tweet-inflames-distracts-offends-the-constitution/)(Donald Trump declared that there “must be consequences” for people who burn the American flag, and proposed they should face a year in prison or even be stripped of their citizenship.\n...\nGiven Trump’s history of manipulating the news cycle with intentionally provocative tweets, it is difficult to know whether the tweet was a serious sign of his intentions to crack down on political dissent – or simply an attempt to incite left-wing critics and distract from other stories, like the recent coverage of his and his son-in-law’s extraordinary conflicts of interest.) and the generation of media distractions.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Politicians and news media often utilize [distractions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/magazine/the-politics-of-distraction.html)(Foreign objects might not exist literally in modern campaigns. But there are figurative devices, known as ‘‘shiny objects,’’ that rely on the same principles of distraction, outrage and misdirection. They also involve a hapless dupe in the middle of it all — in this case, us.\n...\nIn 1962, the historian Daniel Boorstin published ‘‘The Image: Or What Happened to the American Dream,’’ in which he identified the dawning of the ‘‘age of contrivance,’’ marked by ‘‘pseudo-­events’’: staged happenings that animate a cultural calendar \(Hallmark holidays, anniversaries\), as well as political set pieces \(photo ops, candidate ‘‘announcement’’ ­speeches\). \n...\nIn other words, the press colludes with politicians in this culture of distraction-­mongering. Meanwhile, a new class of political figures has built careers almost entirely on shiny-object status. It’s more fun than writing policy treatises and much easier than actual governing — and it pays better too.) to their advantage.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: Flag burning has been bought back into the spotlight by the increased number of protests associated with [racial unrest in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_and_protests_of_the_2020%E2%80%932022_United_States_racial_unrest)(Following the murder of George Floyd, unrest broke out in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area on May 26, 2020, and quickly spread across the country and the world. Further unrest quickly spread throughout the United States, sometimes including rioting, looting, and arson. By early June, at least 200 American cities had imposed curfews, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C, had activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel in response to unrest. By the end of June, at least 14,000 people had been arrested at protests.\n\nPolls have estimated that between 15 million and 26 million people have participated at some point in the demonstrations in the United States, making them the largest protests in United States history.) and the [2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/11/09/student-protesters-burn-american-flags-at-confrontation-over-trump-victory/)(Several hundred students gathered in front of a campus center that holds the dining hall and classrooms, while protesters used matches and lighters to set several American flags ablaze.

1.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.3. Pro: It isn't against the law for an individual to damage something they own.
1.4.3.1. Con: While an individual flag my be privately owned, the symbolic meaning of the flag belongs to all Americans.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The symbolic meaning of the American flag may be different for different people.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: It is common for flags to hold different meanings for different people.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Confederate flag](https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-confederate-flag-so-offensive-143256) is seen as a symbol of historical heritage by some people and a symbol of systematic racism by others.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: National flags are highly [multivocal](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/multi-vocal-symbols)(Symbols which are capable of more than one interpretation, hence becoming a possible cause of conflict, as different groups attempt to have their particular definition adopted as the standard.) symbols, with a wide range of possible meanings.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: For people of Middle Eastern descent, the American flag may be reminiscent of America's many [wars](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/07/27/30-years-after-our-endless-wars-in-the-middle-east-began-still-no-end-in-sight/) in the region.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: The meaning of the flag is [clearly defined](https://www.pbs.org/a-capitol-fourth/history/old-glory/)(Today the flag consists of 13 horizontal stripes, seven red alternating with six white. The stripes represent the original 13 Colonies and the stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor, white symbolizes purity and innocence, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.) by its design and not open to interpretation.
1.4.3.1.1.3.1. Con: The thirteen stripes of the flag represent the [thirteen colonies](https://www.monticello.org/slavery/paradox-of-liberty/african-slavery-in-colonial-british-north-america/)(Directly or indirectly, the economies of all 13 British colonies in North America depended on slavery. By the 1620s, the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco for European markets was established in Virginia, with white indentured servants performing most of the heavy labor. Before 1660 only a fraction of Virginia planters held slaves. By 1675 slavery was well established, and by 1700 slaves had almost entirely replaced indentured servants.), all of which were directly or indirectly reliant on slavery. This makes the flag a hurtful symbol for some people.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The flag represents the core values of America and the [struggle to live up to these ideals](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/columnists/shawn-windsor/2020/07/03/american-flag-july-4-conservative-democrat/5369405002/)(In fact, the flag has become so politicized that studies show there are votes to be gained when politicians drape themselves in the flag. No wonder there are so many flags at political rallies, where flags are flown not just to appeal to patriotism, but to suggest that the other side is not. \n\nYet the flag was never intended to inspire such a narrow view. It was meant to be about the struggle to live up to an ideal, a struggle we contend with to this day. \n...\nIt doesn’t belong to a political party or to the military or to any one of us in particular. It belongs to everyone, and to a place we haven’t yet reached.) that are shared by all Americans in common.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Symbolic meaning cannot be considered a form of property.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: There are many situations in which symbols can be considered [intellectual property](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/intellectual_property)(Creations of the mind such as musical, literary, and artistic works; inventions; and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related rights. Under intellectual property law, the holder of one of these abstract “properties” has certain exclusive rights to the creative work, commercial symbol, or invention by which it is covered.).
1.4.3.2. Pro: The US flag is already desecrated in many ways other than burning.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Trump's [supporters](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2020/06/19/what-might-emerge-from-trumps-tulsa-rally-cheers-clashes-contrition-and-contagion/) have placed his face and slogan on the US flag, which is a form of desecration.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: The US [flag code](https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/usflag/uscode36.html#176)(The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.) forbids placing any images or words on the US flag.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The Westboro Baptist Church frequently [displays](https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2013/03/20/westboro-baptist-church-rainbow-house-gay-pride-kansas-next-door) offensive imagery using the US flag to support their anti-LGBT agenda.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: US veterans have flown the US flag [upside down](http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/the-stream/the-stream-officialblog/2013/10/2/disabled-veteranfliesusflagupsidedowntoprotestshutdown.html) to protest certain policies.
1.4.3.2.4. Con: These methods are not as offensive as burning the flag.
1.4.3.2.5. Con: Other forms of flag desecration should also be illegal.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Forbidding someone from doing what they want with a piece of cloth that they own, regardless of what pictures may be on it, is tyrannical.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: People should be forbidden from using symbols or images in certain ways, regardless of what material they are printed on. For example, using images to [threaten and intimidate](https://www.courthousenews.com/leader-of-neo-nazi-group-convicted-in-scheme-to-threaten-journalists-anti-defamation-league-employees/)(Different versions of the posters, which primarily targeted Jewish people and journalists of color, included statements such as "You have been visited by your local Nazis" and "Death to Pigs,” the same message that followers of Charles Manson scrawled in victims’ blood during a home invasion murder, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The posters also had threatening images, including a hooded figure preparing to throw a Molotov cocktail at a house.\n...\nThe jury convicted Cole of conspiracy, three counts of mailing threatening communications, and one count of interfering with a federally protected activity following a two-day trial and about 90 minutes of deliberation, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.) is illegal.
1.4.4. Pro: There is no one directly harmed by a flag being burnt.
1.4.4.1. Con: Burning a flag is a [fire hazard](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/iranian-man-ironically-catches-fire-while-burning-an-israeli-flag-watch-667684) that could cause other things to catch on fire.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: This is true for any fire. By this logic, all fires should be outlawed.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: There are anecdotal reports of protesters who have [accidentally set themselves and others on fire](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-07-21/burning-the-flag-is-ok-but-starting-fires-sometimes-isn-t)(The police said the person who set the flag on fire accidentally set his own pants on fire, too. A police officer with a fire extinguisher approached to put out the flames. The flag burner tried to keep the flag away from the officer, and in the process two other protesters caught fire.) while burning flags at protests.
1.4.4.2. Con: As flags are often made of [nylon or polyester](https://www.flagsusa.com/flag-material-comparison-guide/), burning them releases [toxic fumes](https://www.sidmartinbio.org/are-nylon-fumes-toxic/) into the atmosphere, which can cause health issues.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: There are toxic fumes associated with many [everyday chemicals](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/01/health/everyday-chemicals-we-need-to-reduce-exposure-to/index.html)(Everyday chemicals carry toxic burden. These everyday chemicals, including organophosphates, flame retardants and phthalates, can be found in food, plastics, furniture, food wrap, cookware, cans, carpets, shower curtains, electronics and even shampoo. They are pretty much everywhere around us. Scientists and researchers are concerned that many of these chemicals may be carcinogenic or wreak havoc with our hormones, our body's regulating system. But the impact of these chemicals may be most severe on the developing brain, Perera said.), such as cleaning products, that represent a far greater health risk.
1.4.4.3. Pro: As long as people stay away from the flames, burning a flag is no more dangerous than burning any other kind of material.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Flag burning often occurs during crowded protests, where the danger posed by a fire is far greater.
1.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.
1.4.5. Pro: According to research, [flag burning does not rank among the top ten issues](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/views-of-the-major-problems-facing-the-country/) about which Americans are most concerned.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Flag burning has [rarely](https://www.ushistory.org/betsy/more/desecration.htm) risen to the public's attention since the founding of the USA.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Flag burning is not very common. As of 2000, there had only been about [200 reported instances](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2000-04-25/html/CREC-2000-04-25-pt1-PgS2856-3.htm)(According to Professor Robert Justin Goldstein, a noted author on this topic, there have been only 200 reported incidents of flag burning during the entire history of our country--that is less than one a year. There is no epidemic of flag burnings plaguing our nation.) of flag burning in US history, and half of these occurred during the Vietnam War.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: Flag burning has been the subject of [five US Supreme Court cases](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1109/flag-desecration)(Because the American flag is arguably the most sacred U.S. symbol, flag desecration remains one of the nation’s most controversial and polarizing issues. Several times during the 20th century, the Supreme Court handed down decisions on flag desecration.\n...\nAfter the decision in Eichman, Congress once again considered a proposed constitutional amendment to protect the American flag. In every Congress between 1995 and 2005, the House of Representatives, when controlled by Republicans, has proposed such an amendment by the necessary two-thirds majority, but each time the amendment has fallen short in the Senate, which is less sympathetic to amendments in general.) as well as numerous laws and proposed Constitutional amendments.
1.4.5.2. Con: The level of concern does not impact the necessity of passing a law.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: There are many [obscure laws](https://www.usatoday.com/list/news/nation-now/weirdest-laws-every-state/53ad0541-3518-4432-adc4-0fec193d389e/) that still play a role in helping society function.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Some research has shown that public opinion has [almost no impact](https://act.represent.us/sign/the-problem)(Professors Martin Gilens \(Princeton University\) and Benjamin I. Page \(Northwestern University\) looked at more than 20 years worth of data to answer a simple question: Does the government represent the people?\n\nTheir study took data from nearly 2000 public opinion surveys and compared it to the policies that ended up becoming law. In other words, they compared what the public wanted to what the government actually did. What they found was extremely unsettling: The opinions of 90% of Americans have essentially no impact at all.\n\n“The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”) whatsoever on US law.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: Since the US is a representative democracy, the level of public concern should impact the necessity of a law.
1.4.5.3. Pro: There are a number of more [substantial issues and challenges](https://www.governing.com/next/the-biggest-issues-to-watch-in-2022)(In 2022, whether it’s addressing elections — or climate or energy or immigration or cybersecurity — states will continue to be highly active, even as Congress remains mired in its habitual gridlock.) facing the US today.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: It is unclear how banning flag burning would improve the lives of American citizens.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: The US faces [far more serious issues](http://pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/15/americans-views-of-the-problems-facing-the-nation/)(Health care costs is the only issue of the 15 asked on the survey seen as a very big problem by a majority of Americans, though about half say that the federal budget deficit \(49%\), violent crime \(48%\), illegal immigration \(48%\) and gun violence \(48%\) are very big problems. A similar share \(47%\) name the coronavirus outbreak as a very big problem – though that is down significantly from last summer, when nearly six-in-ten \(58%\) said this.) with healthcare costs, the federal budget deficit, violent and gun crimes, and immigration.
1.4.5.3.3. Con: The relative importance of various social issues is highly subjective. While some people may believe that other issues are more important, this does not prove them so.
