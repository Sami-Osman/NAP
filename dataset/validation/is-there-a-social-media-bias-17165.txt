Discussion Name: Is there a social media bias?

1. Social Media sites disproportionately target conservative users.
1.1. Con: Trump is not banned from Twitter even though his tweets could be seen as violation of Twitter's policy.
1.1.1. Pro: Twitter even [expanded protection](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/technology/twitter-trump-rules.html) for Trump by invoking a special status for world leaders.
1.1.2. Pro: Trump's account is too valuable to Twitter to be banned. Since he is president, his tweets generate a tremendous amount of site usage and financial benefit for site.
1.1.2.1. Con: Twitter's [user growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/) has plateued during the last 5 years and growth is fairly stagnant irrespective of Trump's tweets.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Trump is often cited through what he is tweeting in the media. This gives extra coverage.
1.1.3. Pro: Trump has over 70 million followers on Twitter, being the 10th most followed account on the entire social network. If there is a social media bias, Trump would have been banned long ago. He wouldn’t even have that much followers.[tweetbinder.com](https://www.tweetbinder.com/blog/top-twitter-accounts/)
1.1.4. Con: Twitter [claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/technology/twitter-trump-rules.html) that president Trump did not violate Twitter's Terms of Service.
1.1.5. Con: Although Trump is not outrightly banned from Twitter, he is targeted by other methods, such as limiting distribution, warning the reader of the content, and more.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Many of Trump's tweets are tagged with a [fact-checking warning](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52815552) by Twitter.
1.1.6. Con: Twitter and Facebook [banned](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html) Trump because he said that the march on capitol hill was peaceful and should stay that way.
1.1.7. Con: Trump’s Twitter account was temporarily banned.
1.1.7.1. Con: Twitter said the account was taken down because of a [human error](https://twitter.com/TwitterGov/status/926238960594178048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E926238960594178048&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2017%2F11%2F2%2F16600732%2Fdonald-trump-twitter-account-gone-realdonaldtrump).
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: It was [done by an employee on their last day of work](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16600732/donald-trump-twitter-account-gone-realdonaldtrump).
1.1.7.2. Con: The account was banned for [11 minutes](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16600732/donald-trump-twitter-account-gone-realdonaldtrump) only.
1.1.7.3. Pro: [Trump's Twitter account](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16600732/donald-trump-twitter-account-gone-realdonaldtrump) was banned for 11 minutes before 7pm ET on November 2, 2017.
1.1.8. Con: Subtle censorship cannot work if you ban the head of the Republican party. The thesis refers to an inconsistent application of the rules to hold conservative voices to a higher standard than liberal ones.
1.2. Pro: Tech companies in Sillicon Valley are skewed against conservativism even in their workforce.
1.2.1. Pro: [James Damore](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/08/james-damore-sues-google-discrimination-white-male-conservatives) claims that Google is intolerant towards white conservative males.
1.2.1.1. Con: Some say that Damore holds a grudge against [Google](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-google-three-years-misery-happiest-company-tech/?fbclid=IwAR2u__55Br2W0qiccY3fq-wW2sOQpIYLHD4dt-hDkdhfCGIVhnpBymrSgT4), having been fired by them, and cannot be seen as neutral when commenting on tolerance/intolerance within the company.
1.3. Pro: Media companies’ ‘impartial’ algorithms [disproportionately impact](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/social-media-companies-discriminate-against-conservatives/) conservative material.
1.3.1. Pro: The creators of the algorithms often do not understand why fake news, radicalized video's, and conspiracy theories are [amplified](https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-is-not-the-same-as-free-reach/) over other, more accurate and moderate discussions.
1.4. Pro: It has progressed to the point that active measures are taken to [remove political ads](https://www.dailywire.com/news/facebook-censors-pro-trump-ad-on-biden-raising-taxes-after-fact-checker-admits-claim-may-be-true-rules-mostly-false-anyhow?utm_source=Jeeng) under the false pretense of fact-checking even after admitting the ad is, in fact, true.
1.5. Pro: Social media sites have been evidenced to disproportionately target conservatives.
1.5.1. Pro: Facebook has deliberately targeted Conservatives. For example, Facebook told [two women](https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) their pro-Trump videos were "unsafe."
1.5.1.1. Con: Banning two users doesn't show disproportionality, unless only one liberal Facebook user was banned.
1.5.1.2. Con: Given Facebook has more than [2.41 billion monthly active users](https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/), a sample size of two users isn't representative.
1.5.1.3. Pro: A Berlin court has issued one of the first known injunctive sentences against Facebook, one tech company, for [censoring](http://www.alertadigital.com/2018/11/10/google-facebook-y-twitter-silencian-el-pensamiento-conservador/) [dissenting](https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/politics/free-speech-german-court-overturns-facebook-censorship/23581834.html?ticket=ST-783962-faKsTuFX3rqHqhtpoafK-ap3) voices. Under the threat of a € 250,000 fine or a prison term, Facebook is obligated to restore a user's comment that had been deleted by the social network address. In addition, the sentence prohibits the company from blocking the user for his comment. I think that this sentence is more than enough to see what's going on with this app.
1.5.1.4. Pro: A [Facebook](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Felpais.com%2Ftecnologia%2F2016%2F05%2F10%2Factualidad%2F1462874046_524079.html) ex-employee opened a debate on American political life, accusing the social media network of systematically deleting conservative content on their site. [elpais.com](https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2016/05/10/actualidad/1462874046_524079.html)
1.5.1.4.1. Con: It seems like a case of a biased person looking for a reason to complain more than a legitimate suppression of conservative media.
1.5.1.4.2. Con: The news stories simply [weren't](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Felpais.com%2Ftecnologia%2F2016%2F05%2F10%2Factualidad%2F1462874046_524079.html) worthy of being in the top trends; "Among the topics buried or removed from the list: former IRS officer Lois Lerner, who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately examining conservative groups; Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker; popular right-wing news aggregator Drudge Report; Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was killed in 2013; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder. "
1.5.2. Pro: Twitter has been accused of "[shadow banning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning)" conservatives.
1.5.2.1. Con: The cause of the bans have been 'troll-like behaviour' and other violations of terms of service. The banning is [not due to](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/twitters-not-shadow-banning-republicans-but-get-ready-to-hear-that-it-is/) the political ideology of the accounts, but the manner in which the political ideologies are using the platforms.
1.5.2.2. Pro: On [July 26, 2018](http://didtrumptweetit.com/1022454412512509952-2/), President Trump sent a tweet accusing Twitter of shadow-banning conservative users of the site.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: President Trump has won awards for his [lies](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/). The fact that he claimed Conservatives were being shadow-banned does not mean that it is factually correct.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: President Trump provided no credible evidence for his accusation.
1.5.2.3. Con: "Shadow banning" on Twitter was caused by a glitch in their search engine, specifically with a "troll trap." This has been resolved by fixing the search engine mechanism.[thewrap.com](https://www.thewrap.com/twitter-responds-to-shadowbanning-scandal-we-have-a-lot-more-work-to-do-to-earn-peoples-trust/)
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Several Conservatives and Republican politicians have argued that Twitter did not fix their search engine mechanism as Twitter claimed.[Rep. Gaetz files FEC Complaint.](https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/07/28/gop-rep-matt-gaetz-follows-up-with-fec-complaint-over-twitter-shadow-banning)[nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/technology/twitter-trump-rules.html)
1.5.3. Pro: That [Alex Jones was banned](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17655658/alex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories) illustrates how social media sites target conservative users.
1.5.3.1. Con: Youtube correctly banned several Alex Jones videos for inappropriate content.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Alex Jones was originally suspended from live streaming for 90 days \(according to [YouTube](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838707/infowars-youtube-moderation-war-room-susan-wojcicki-letter-supremacist-content-bans), he was violating their 'community guidelines against hateful content'\) but received a permanent ban when he did not comply with the suspension.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: He allegedly [endorsed](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17613492/youtube-alex-jones-strike-hate-speech-child-endangerment) harming innocent children
1.5.3.1.3. Con: Correct banning is not an argument against the premise. It is a data point that might support a lack of bias, but only if statistically significant when compared to incorrect banning of conservatives.
1.5.3.2. Con: Alex Jones is not a conservative.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: [Alex Jones interviewed Donald Trump before he was elected as President of the United States.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LeChPL0sLE) They both espouse the conservative ideals of limited government, free market capitalism, freedom of speech, and even the importance of God. Alex Jones is a conservative.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: Alex Jones spreads [conspiracy theories](https://www.insider.com/joe-rogan-alex-jones-spread-conspiracy-theories-challenge-podcast-2020-10).
1.5.3.2.2.1. Con: The fact that he spreads conspiracy theories doesn't exempt him from being a conservative. Take as an example Donald Trump. He spreads conspiracy theories such as [this one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/27/trump-just-pushed-one-his-worst-conspiracy-theories-yet/), where he claims that the coronavirus is being "weaponized" by his enemies to hurt him politically and that the CDC may be exaggerating the threat of coronavirus.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: [Republican congressman](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/congressman-regrets-infowars-appearance/) attack Alex Jones.
1.5.3.2.3.1. Con: The fact that Alex Jones was attacked by a republican congressman, doesn't turn him into the opposing wing.
1.5.3.3. Pro: [Infowars has been banned permanently by Facebook, Apple and Google \(YouTube\) in few hours time.](https://www.rt.com/usa/435259-infowars-ban-twitter-reacts/)
1.5.4. Con: Social media doesn't intentionally target conservative users.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.5.4.2. Pro: In May, Twitter announced that they were ["introducing new behavior- based signals into how Tweets are organized and presented in areas like conversations and search"](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/twitters-not-shadow-banning-republicans-but-get-ready-to-hear-that-it-is/) in order to improve the health of conversation.
1.5.4.3. Con: There is a long list of Twitter suspensions and most are on conservatives or other right wing groups or organizations. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_suspensions)
1.5.4.3.1. Con: Many of these suspensions are not conservatives, such as[Iyad El-Baghdadi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_suspensions) who was mistaken for Islamist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by Twitter staff.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Conservatives are the [main users](https://www.fastcompany.com/1690878/republicans-dominate-democrats-social-media?position=1&campaign_date=02092019) of social media for politics, and thus their points of view are disproportionately represented as a sample on many platforms; not suppressed.
1.5.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.
1.5.4.6. Pro: Some conservatives have a reason to be banned.
1.5.4.6.1. Con: Many progressives also have a reason to be banned.
1.5.4.6.1.1. Pro: [Violent rhetoric](https://heavy.com/news/2020/09/jacob-blake-sr-dad-father-facebook-biden/) from the progressive arm of the Democratic Party are allowed on social media, sometimes with direct relation to violent behavior.
1.5.4.6.1.2. Pro: A Democratic Mayor in California expressed vile hate speech against Trump, his supporters, and even dead conservative Supreme Court justices. These posts was allowed and were not [flagged](https://www.thefolliesofdistributism.com/2020/04/california-democrat-mayor-dr-bill-kirby.html) as hate speech.
1.5.4.6.2. Con: Marxist BLM organizations are [allowed](https://ncri.io/reports/network-enabled-anarchy/) to foment violence on social media, whereas conservatives are removed for expressing a non-violent opinion.
1.5.4.6.3. Pro: Some conservatives on social media post fake information.
1.5.4.6.3.1. Pro: A [conservative senator](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/cigarette-sparked-one-nation-truck-fire) claimed one of her campaign trucks was deliberately lit and someone fled the scene, but the police who looked over footage discredited the later claim and they don't believe the first
1.5.4.6.3.2. Pro: Conservatives make [hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_\(United_States\)#Hoaxes) to try and discredit opposing groups.
1.5.4.6.3.3. Pro: Charlie Kirk recently tweeted Texas State University had voted to ban a conservative student group in an attack on free speech. The University issued [various statements](https://www.chronicle.com/article/students-ban-of/246097) saying it had not banned the group and no intention of doing so. Still, Kirk has made no attempt to remove, edit, correct, or clarify his false tweet.
1.5.4.6.3.4. Pro: Conservatives receive false news.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1. Pro: [Fox news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z28JxLWy820&feature=youtu.be) unfairly and purposely shows Antifa as bad without letting them explain themselves. They use a lot of manipulative techniques rather than logic or reason.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1. Pro: They talking about non harmful things as something bad.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: They say "Normalized ignoring federal law" as if it is a bad thing, and possibly to make it sound like the group may as well be criminals.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Ignoring the law can sometimes be beneficial, such as when [Oskar Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler) saved 1200 Jews during the Holocaust.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Ignoring federal law undermines the rule of law.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: They emphasised that police were under order to stand down, as the journalists way of implying that the police should not have stood down.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: Andy blames the city being secular for preventing people the opportunity to dedicate their life to service, even though that's what the protesters are doing, it's just not in the way the guest speaker liked.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.1.4. Pro: It's claimed that Antifa is an "anti-American" movement, which is an irrational buzzword that does nothing except make patriots and other similar irrational people upset with the group. Claiming something is good purely because it is for part of a country is a [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag-waving).
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2. Pro: Fox news made claims that require evidence without providing any.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: They claimed that Antifa protesters are "rich kids" without evidence. This is possibly to unfairly make people not sympathise with them, even though it's likely that most of them were not rich kids
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Interviewing a 'Portland resident' as commentator gives the impression that his personal perspective is objectively true.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: The anchorman commented on this perspective as "deep and true analysis".
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2.2.2. Con: The commentator is actually a journalists and regularly attends those demonstrations. This gives him more information to base his judgement on.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2.3. Con: Violence is clearly visible from the footage.
1.5.4.6.3.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.4.6.3.4.1.2.3.
1.5.4.6.3.4.2. Pro: [Right wing](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/02/18/we-need-to-stop-calling-it-political-correctness/) groups keep falsely insisting that PC is trying to [rename](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/08/winterval-modern-myth-christmas) Christmas.
1.5.4.6.3.4.3. Pro: Reporter [Saraacarter](https://saraacarter.com/teen-vogue-magazine-hails-antifa-a-group-that-aspires-toward-creating-a-better-world/?fbclid=IwAR0Sq2CIOUit83V5sW7aKrnxq-4AUP89xGz2aiDd6n5cQRWLzUe0NIjvByI) lies about claims of Antifa being violent and throwing concrete milkshakes at people, even though there is [no evidence](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/portland-protests-proud-boys-milkshakes-cement-antifa-alt-right-police-a8982726.html).
1.5.4.6.3.4.4. Pro: [Andy Ngo](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/3/20677645/antifa-portland-andy-ngo-proud-boys) helped make people believe Antifa put concrete in milkshakes after his victims didn't want him at a rally, and [misinformed](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/3/20677645/antifa-portland-andy-ngo-proud-boys) people to get them to think Islam was invading Britain.
1.5.4.6.3.5. Pro: [National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/social-media-companies-discriminate-against-conservatives/) calls fact-checking websites "left wing", as if the truth is something just for the left wing.
1.5.4.6.3.5.1. Con: Fact-checkers make judgements on future occurrences. It is impossible to know the future, thus their facts are not facts.
1.5.4.6.3.6. Con: [Fact-checkers lean left and have been caught](https://www.acsh.org/news/2019/11/04/debunkers-debunked-who-fact-checks-fact-checkers-14378) calling conservative statements that are proven correct to be false. They do this without correcting their misinformation.
1.5.4.6.4. Pro: Conservative sites are more likely to produce hate speech.
1.5.4.6.4.1. Con: In the USA, "[Hate Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States)" is legal because of rigorous freedom of speech laws.
1.5.4.6.4.1.1. Con: Even in the USA, freedom of speech does [not](https://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2016/11/can-you-violate-the-freedom-of-speech-on-the-internet.html) apply online.
1.5.4.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: The caveats of free speech in the USA \(Harassment, Defamation, Libel, and Inciting Violence,\) apply the same online and in person, as explained in that very [article](https://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2016/11/can-you-violate-the-freedom-of-speech-on-the-internet.html).
1.5.4.6.4.2. Pro: Pauline Hanson has asked [violence](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/pauline-hanson-suspended-from-twitter-over-cattle-prod-stunt/news-story/41297ee8211d810055baa5ba2839e2cb) to be used against non violent protestors.
1.5.4.6.4.3. Pro: Hate speech [should](http://www.mtv.com/news/3120869/social-media-has-a-hate-speech-problem-why-wont-companies-do-something-about-it/) be removed, but social media aren't doing enough to prevent it.
1.6. Pro: Wikipedia has a list of [Twitter suspensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_suspensions) in which many were suspended for conservative, alt-right or other right-wing leaning comments.
1.6.1. Con: An estimated at least 7x more users were banned for conservative content for a good reason than users who whosed conservative content without good reason.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Of the seven conservatives banned without good reason given, 2 were errors and 3 were for unknown reasons, 1 was temporary. The few people are: Craig R. Brittain, David Duke, Donald Trump, James Allsup, Candace Owens, David Horowitz, and Eoin Lenihan. Are arguable: David Duke. Min # of people banned for conservative reasons that were good reasons as of July 19: 46 \(Some may have been missed\),
1.7. Con: Social media has also blocked liberal users.
1.7.1. Pro: Blogger Ijeoma Oluo was [blocked by Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/another-black-activist-ijeoma-oluo-is-suspended-by-facebook-for-posting-about-racism/)
1.7.1.1. Con: Demonstrating one instance of a blocked low-level "blogger" with 275,000 followers does not demonstrate the proportionality the claim makes. In the same citation, Facebook later stated they blocked her in error.
1.7.2. Con: While liberals have been banned in some cases it does not provide proof of an equal and consistent standard of the rules. On Twitter, right wing commentators can be banned [for accusing someone of being pro-sharia law](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/11/29/18118529/far-right-activist-laura-loomer-twitter-protest-handcuff-nyc-hq) yet left wing commentators are free [to refer to Jews as "termites"](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2018/10/18/twitter-has-a-huge-louis-farrakhan-problem/amp/).
1.7.2.1. Con: It can't be a case of an inconsistent standard when even the left wing example has been [removed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/farrakhan-tweet-comparing-jews-to-termites-is-gone-after-twitter-policy-change/).
1.7.2.2. Con: [Defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law) is already illegal in the united states, meaning social media have to focus on removing that before anti-semitic speech.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.5.4.6.
