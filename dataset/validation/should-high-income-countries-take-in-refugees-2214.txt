Discussion Name: Should high-income countries take in refugees?

1. High-income countries should take in significant numbers of refugees.
1.1. Con: Taking in refugees has negative economic, health, and security-related consequences for host countries.
1.1.1. Pro: Taking in refugees harms [native workers](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216).
1.1.1.1. Pro: Many European countries already face high levels of unemployment \([p. 1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8939932/3-31052018-AP-EN.pdf/a5d2c7ec-01c3-4cf8-ba33-a2ccadd91b93)\). Additional workers from abroad will exacerbate this.
1.1.1.2. Con: Research indicates that foreigners are more likely than native citizens to create start-ups, which generate new jobs at a [faster rate](https://hbr.org/2016/10/immigrants-play-a-disproportionate-role-in-american-entrepreneurship)(Immigrants constitute 15% of the general U.S. workforce, but they account for around a quarter of U.S. entrepreneurs \(which we define as the top three initial earners in a new business\). \[...\] Compared to older firms, which show modest growth regardless of their size, young firms and new entrants have more dynamic patterns that foster greater job creation. Immigrant-founded firms display more of this behavior.) than older firms.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The recent wave of immigration in Germany has [boosted](https://www.eu-startups.com/2019/05/migrants-and-startups-a-match-made-in-the-eu/) the number of new startups. 44% of new businesses in 2015 were founded by people with foreign passports.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Migrants to the US engage in [entrepreneurship](https://www.eu-startups.com/2019/05/migrants-and-startups-a-match-made-in-the-eu/)(Also, early research conducted between 1995 and 2005 in Silicon Valley found that the share of immigrant founders exceeded 50% and that foreign-born scientists and engineers were “generating new jobs and wealth for the California economy”.) - and fuel the associated creation of [jobs](https://hbr.org/2016/10/immigrants-play-a-disproportionate-role-in-american-entrepreneurship) - at a much higher rate than US natives.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: On average among employer firms, immigrant-owned businesses tend to have fewer employees and a smaller payroll than non-immigrant-owned businesses \([p. iii](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs396tot.pdf)(Among immigrant owned businesses that hire employees these firms hire an average of 8.0 employees with an average payroll of $253,000. Employer firms owned by non-immigrants hire an average of 11.9 employees with an average payroll of $429,000.)\), suggesting that foreign business-owners do not generate as many new jobs overall.
1.1.1.3. Con: There is little evidence to suggest that migration has any substantial impact on wages or employment in host countries \([p. 8](http://www.apdr.pt/siteRPER/numeros/RPER24/24.1.pdf)(A meta-analysis by Longhi et al. \(2008\) concludes that the effects of immigration on local or national labour markets \(i.e. wages, employment, unemployment and labour force participation\) are either insignificant or very small.)\).
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: High-income countries rely on a workforce of highly skilled workers. Refugees will generally not be able to fill these roles.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The lack of education of many immigrants living in [Sweden](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-immigration-idUSKBN14B1OK) makes it hard for them to enter the Swedish job market, where the majority of jobs are higher-skilled.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: There is no reason to assume that refugees are unlikely to perform highly skilled roles. In fact, refugees are more likely to be overqualified for many roles than either other types of migrant or natives of their host country \([p. 6](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/87a8f92d-9aa8-11e6-868c-01aa75ed71a1)(Refugees are much more likely to be overqualified than other migrants. In total, almost 60% of employed tertiary-educated refugees in the EU are overqualified for the jobs they occupy, more than twice the level of the native-born and also well above the levels for other migrant groups. The reasons for the observed large discount of refugees’ formal qualifications relate to the fact that most of them have foreign qualifications which employers may have difficulties in evaluating and they also often lack documentation of their degrees.)\).
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: A 2014 study found no evidence-based research or mass public opinion to support the claim that immigrants take jobs from native workers \([p. 1](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/10/pdfs/do-migrants-take-the-jobs-of-native-workers.pdf?v=1)(Neither public opinion nor evidence-based research supports the claim of some politicians and the media that immigrants take the jobs of native-born workers.)\).
1.1.1.4. Pro: Refugees often take lower-paying [jobs](https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-migrants-take-the-jobs-of-native-workers/long)(A country that becomes dependent on low-cost immigrant workers may have to outsource jobs when these workers are not available.), which may negatively impact low-income communities and promote the reliance upon cheap outsourced labor.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: In a [poll](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants) of US economists, the majority agreed that increased numbers of low-skilled foreign workers would harm low-skilled American workers.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Many refugees have joined the informal, low-cost labour workforce in Turkey, which has had a net negative impact on employment for Turkish women and the least educated Turkish men, who would usually undertake this same type of work \([p. 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294722817_The_Impact_of_Syrian_Refugees_on_the_Turkish_Labor_Market)(However, the net impact on employment is negative for women and the least educated \nTurkish.)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: The disproportionately high uptake of low-cost informal labour among refugees in Turkey could be arguably mitigated if the process to obtain a refugee work permit were made easier.
1.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Despite the launch of the official permit programme in 2016, only [14,000](https://text.npr.org/543477446) of the 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey were granted permits to legally join the Turkish workforce in 2017.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Even in the low-skill and low-wage job market, native citizens and immigrants often take on [different jobs](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/immigrant-and-native-workers-compete-different-low-skilled-jobs)(A large and growing share of the low-skilled workforce are immigrants, many of whom are unauthorized. This often makes people think that immigrants are pushing US citizens out of their jobs. To bring some evidence to this contentious issue, I set out to find what types of jobs low-skilled natives and immigrants hold. I found that, even within the narrowly defined group of workers with no high school diploma, immigrants and natives do different jobs.), meaning that the two groups rarely compete for work.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Many refugees carry out [undesirable jobs](http://www.dw.com/en/economist-geis-33000-jobs-for-refugees-a-success/a-19397020)(Most refugees have found work in the low-wage sector - such as service sector jobs as cleaners or security guards. Those are jobs that most Germans do not want to do...) that most native citizens of high-income countries refuse or do not want to do.
1.1.2. Pro: Taking in refugees may pose security risks for host countries.
1.1.2.1. Pro: It is virtually impossible to [vet refugees](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/12/carlos-beruff/fbi-admitted-it-cannot-properly-vet-middle-eastern/) thoroughly. This leaves the door open for terrorists to migrate to a country posing as refugees.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Local intelligence agencies find it [challenging](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/12/carlos-beruff/fbi-admitted-it-cannot-properly-vet-middle-eastern/) to undertake thorough background checks on refugees.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: [Longstanding US Immigration Officers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/01/refugees-are-already-vigorously-vetted-i-know-because-i-vetted-them/) have stated that the US vetting process to discern a refugee's motivations is incredibly thorough.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: The terrorist threat posed by foreign refugees in high-income countries tends to be significantly [misconceived](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/).
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Leaders in the EU and the US often downplay the threat of domestic terrorism while [overemphasizing](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/refugees-trojan-horse-of-terrorism/)(Contrary to such assertions, the number of refugees who have committed terrorist acts is negligible.) the risk of immigrant terrorists.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: At least in the case of the United States, refugees have been found to pose a [negligible](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis)(For instance, the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year while the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an illegal immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year.) safety risk with respect to terrorism.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: The Danish Security and Intelligence Service \([PET](https://www.thelocal.dk/20150923/danish-intelligence-terrorists-are-not-among-refugees)(“Based on the intelligence we have, we don't believe that organized militant groups will use human smugglers or refugee routes in an attempt to get terrorists into Denmark – simply because the route is not desirable,” Andersen said at a joint press conference with Justice Minister Søren Pind and the head of the Danish National Police \(Rigspolitiet\) Jens Henrik Højbjerg.)\) concluded in 2015 that refugees pose no credible terrorist threat to Denmark.
1.1.2.2. Con: Much of the research on the relationship between immigration and crime has centred around correlation rather than addressing causality, meaning that it is uncertain whether or not refugees pose a safety risk \([pp. 3-4](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/469/pdfs/crime-and-immigration.pdf?v=1)(While there have been many papers that document various correlations between immigrants and crime for a range of countries and time periods, most do not seriously address the issue of causality.)\).
1.1.2.3. Pro: Taking in refugees will increase criminality within host countries.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Of the US cities that accepted the highest relative proportion of refugees, the majority saw crime levels [dramatically decrease](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/crime-falls-in-cities-with-big-refugee-populations).
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Refugees tend to have poorer socioeconomic status than native citizens and lower socioeconomic status [correlates](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.559.483)(Crime rates and inequality are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling for other crime determinants) with higher crime rates.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Differences in criminal activity are a product, in part, of childhood [socioeconomic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15225338/)(This study suggests that the higher rates of crime found amongst young people from socio-economically disadvantaged families reflect a life course process in which adverse family, individual, school, and peer factors combine to increase individual susceptibility to crime.) conditions. This is exacerbated by the longer [path](https://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/)(A refugee has a longer path to employment than a migrant worker, for example.) to employment faced by refugees compared to those in other communities.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: This is a reason to ensure better prospects for refugees once they have arrived, not to turn refugees away.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: The socioeconomic conditions of refugees depend on the laws and policies of their host country, meaning it is the latter's responsibility to provide adequate financial and social support for refugees.
1.1.2.3.3. Con: [Studies indicate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html) that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native population, suggesting that refugees are highly unlikely to have a negative impact on crime rates in their host country.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: People tend to [overestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime) the relationship between immigration and crime.
1.1.2.3.4. Pro: [Reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/12/why-some-migrants-are-more-likely-to-commit-crimes-than-others/?utm_term=.88805c535c80)(Given the sheer number of migrants who have come to Germany during the past years, authorities have struggled to deport individuals whose asylum applications were rejected — leaving many in a long-term limbo which increases their risk of becoming criminals.) suggest that the longer asylum seekers are left in limbo, the more likely they are to commit crimes. This is an issue for countries like Germany, whose large number of asylum seekers means they are slow to deport those whose applications are rejected.
1.1.2.4. Con: Accepting Syrian refugees is [good for US security](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-bier/five-reasons-refugees-are_b_9534010.html) because it undermines ISIS propaganda and might bring valuable intelligence.
1.1.3. Con: The international reputation of high-income nations will benefit from taking in refugees.
1.1.3.1. Con: Taking in some refugees from some conflicts but not others shows an international bias that may have negative diplomatic repercussions and showcase the country hosting the refugees in a bad light.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Until early 2017, the US accepted any Cuban refugee provided they managed to make it to land. Under this "wet foot, dry foot" policy, Cuban refugees received [preferential treatment](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article126506564.html) compared to refugees from other countries, who were routinely detained or deported as illegal immigrants.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Preferential treatment of Cuban refugees under the policy was seen as unfair, given the [thousands](https://international-and-comparative-law-review.law.miami.edu/387-2/)(Contrast this with the current situation for Mexicans and Central Americans, who are crossing the Mexican border illegally in what is often a flee from gang violence, that at minimum disrupts economic opportunity in their country and at worst threatens safety for their life. In January and February alone, nearly 50,000 immigrants were apprehended while trying to cross the border illegally. Since October, immigration authorities have deported about 29,000 individuals to Central America and about 128,000 to Mexico.) of people who get stopped at the Mexican border whilst trying to flee violence.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: A strong anti-Western sentiment [exists](https://www.rt.com/politics/230559-russia-west-attitude-poll/) in places like Russia and the Middle East. Attempts by Western countries to act positively can be seen as hostile and concealing an insidious motive.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Countries like North Korea produce [anti-Western propaganda](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/1/9/16773364/trump-kim-summit-sign-agreement-denuclearization-propaganda) regardless of what actions Western countries take, suggesting that there is little reason for wealthy Western countries to turn refugees away on these grounds.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Western policies in the Middle East and South Asia [conflict](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-00637-3_14)(One major obstacle has been the upsurge of nationalism in this region, which has made the Arabs morbidly suspicious of Western connections; another the intractable problem of Israel. No satisfactory Middle East policy will be possible for the West until the problem of Israel’s future is permanently settled; but even then the extremely difficult problem of achieving satisfactory relations with Arab nationalism will still have to be dealt with.) with the resurgence of nationalism in these areas. Western interference is often viewed as a threat to local autonomy and control.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: The possibility of being accused of bias is not a sufficient reason for turning refugees away and instead supports the need for internationally supported resettlement policies.
1.1.3.2. Pro: High-income countries that have taken in many refugees, such as Germany and Austria, have been [applauded](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2015/9/55eae4116/unhcr-applauds-austria-germany-refugees-march-across-hungary.html) by the UN Refugee Agency \(UNHCR\).
1.1.3.3. Con: Sweden has been criticized for taking in a large number of refugees.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: A [report](http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/) released by the Swedish government refutes claims that taking in refugees has made Sweden economically unstable or unsafe.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Following the refugee crisis in 2015, the right-wing [Sweden Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats) gained popularity, largely due to their strong [anti-immigration](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-rise-of-sweden-democrats-and-the-end-of-swedish-exceptionalism/)(Every interviewee cited the 2015 \[refugee\] crisis and the government’s response to it as one of their main reasons in supporting the Sweden Democrats.) stance.
1.1.4. Pro: Taking in refugees could lead to overpopulation in the host country or region, which could overstretch its resources \([p. 40](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=joseph_wharton_scholars)(On the negative side, refugees can be a burden to the host country by \(1\) straining public and private services \(2\) causing physical and economic overcrowding and \(3\) increasing societal strife and the potential for civil conflict.)\).
1.1.4.1. Con: Were the global refugee population of [26 million](https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) permanently resettled proportionately between the [80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy#List_of_high-income_economies_\(as_of_2021_fiscal_year\)) high-income countries worldwide, there would unlikely be a sufficient increase in population size to impact the quality of life or demand for resources in those countries.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Refugees taken in by high-income countries are unlikely to return to their home country.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Over 600,000 displaced Syrians returned home in the first seven months of [2017](https://www.iom.int/news/over-600000-displaced-syrians-returned-home-first-7-months-2017).
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: As high-income countries provide a safer and more prosperous socio-economic environment, refugees are unlikely to opt for voluntary repatriation, even if the situation in their home country improves.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: According to a [2015 survey](https://www.adoptrevolution.org/en/pr-survey/)(A majority of respondents \(52%\) in the five German cities surveyed said they would need Bashar al-Assad to leave before considering going home.) among Syrian refugees in Germany, the majority did want to return home, but not as long as Bashar al-Assad remained in power.
1.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Definitions of the term "refugee," for example [by the United Nations](https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/what-is-a-refugee/), usually do not contain any reference to an individual's interest or will to return home. This suggests that the will to return home or make a home elsewhere is irrelevant.
1.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: [Research](https://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/return/alajlan.pdf)(Most of them \[refugees\] have received education and training in Germany and have learned German; many are earning good salaries and feel integrated into German society. Yet none of their qualifications will be of use to them in Syria. This group of refugees is therefore unlikely to want to return. Many of these young Syrian refugees who are now earning in Germany would, by Syrian standards, have been considered to be poorly educated, and would have had very difficult lives even before the war, often doing hard physical work in construction or agriculture. After enjoying safety, social and health insurance, and – most importantly – dignity in Germany, they are unlikely to choose to return to Syria.) suggests that the safety, social and health insurance, and dignity that Syrian refugees find in Germany deters many from voluntarily returning to Syria.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: 85% of refugees residing in Germany in 2015 stated a wish to remain in Germany indefinitely \([p. 22](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/Finding-their-Way-Germany.pdf)(In a 2015 survey among refugees from the main origin countries, 85 % of all respondents stated that they would like to remain in Germany indefinitely,)\).
1.1.4.3. Pro: Property prices and rents in many German cities are rising to a degree that [they would not](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/refugees-to-trigger-german-house-price-spike-postbank.html) without the influx of refugees.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Cities in [Eastern Germany](https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/06/14/eastern-germany-really-needs-immigrant-workers-in-the-future/?sh=6a84f3856338) might profit from the population influx as they are expected to shrink.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The population of what was once [East Germany](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/decades-after-fall-berlin-wall-east-german-towns-try-lure-n1078636)(According to a study by the Institute for Economic Research, the population in what was once West Germany is 60 percent larger than it was before World War II, while East Germany’s is 15 percent smaller. What’s more, the East’s population of 13.9 million is roughly the same as it was in 1905 and is predicted to drop by 12 percent more in the next 15 years.) is now 15% smaller than it was before WWII, and is predicted to drop by 12% more in the next 15 years. This creates a dire situation because there is a shortage of workers, which harms local economies.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: In [Berlin](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/refugees-to-trigger-german-house-price-spike-postbank.html)(In Berlin, where settled refugees are expected to boost the urban population by 4.7 percent, property prices are expected to soar 14.5 percent by 2030. Without the refugee influx, prices would rise 8.5 percent during that period, Postbank explained by email.), for example, the price of apartments is expected to rise by almost 15% until 2030. Without the refugee influx, this rise would be about 6% lower.
1.1.4.4. Con: In 2015 and the first months of 2016, the total number of refugees and migrants to the EU was [1.2 million](http://www.unhcr.org/europe.html)(In 2015, and the first months of 2016, almost 1.2 million refugees and migrants reached European shores, most fleeing conflict and persecution.). This number represented under [0.3%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253372/total-population-of-the-european-union-eu/) of the total EU population at the time.
1.1.5. Con: Evidence suggests that refugees provide a net financial benefit to their host countries.
1.1.5.1. Pro: It is likely that many long-term refugees will [become citizens](https://fullfact.org/immigration/uk-refugees/)(It partly depends on who you consider a “refugee”, given that people’s residence status can change over time after being granted asylum. They may start on a time-limited residence permit, move to permanent residence, through to British citizenship.) or permanent residents, which means the government will continue receiving monetary benefits from taxes without paying further welfare.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Once settlement and welfare costs are accounted for, it is estimated that the US Federal Government ends up with a net gain of around [$21,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-do-refugees-cost-us-taxpayers-2017-6?r=US&IR=T)(A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that refugees who entered the US as adults from 2010-14 paid, on average, $21,000 more in taxes than they got in any kind of welfare payments.) in tax revenue from each refugee aged 18-45.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Nationalized refugees in [some countries](https://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/migrants/national-insurance-migrants/how-does-uk-state-pension-work-migrants) can qualify for some of the same benefits that citizens have, such as state pensions once they reach retirement age.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Analysis of 30 years of data from 15 countries in Western Europe [shows](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaaq0883)(in particular, significant positive effects on GDP are observed from 3 to 7 years after this shock.) that asylum seekers positively affect the economy for up to 7 years after their arrival.
1.1.5.3. Con: Immigrants are especially costly for state and local governments [in the US](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550)(Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets are generally positive at the federal level but remain negative at the state and local level).
1.1.5.3.1. Con: A 20-year study in the US found [no difference in economic outcomes](http://www.nber.org/digest/aug17/w23498.shtml) between refugees who arrived as children and US-born citizens.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: Second- and third-generation immigrants pay [more](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)(However, as adults, the children of immigrants \(the second generation\) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population.) taxes on average than native citizens with no recent history of familial immigration to the US.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Refugees resettled in host countries could help the growth of [international trade and investment](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/06/19/refugees-are-a-win-win-win-formula-for-economic-development/)(Refugees could play a fundamental role in fostering\ninternational trade and\ninvestment. Since they know the business environment quite well, they can mediate between business people in both countries who are willing to invest in the local community and trade with local businesses.) and benefit both their home and host countries by acting as liaisons between businesses in each nation.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: [Research](https://voxeu.org/article/long-run-trade-effect-vietnamese-boat-people)(Our results show that the share of US exports going to Vietnam over the period 1995-2010, i.e. following the lifting of the trade embargo in 1994, was higher and more diversified in those states with larger Vietnamese populations, themselves the result of larger refugee inflows two decades beforehand. We find that states with larger Vietnamese populations, measured in either levels or as shares of state populations, total migrant stocks or Asian migrant stocks, are associated with greater exports to Vietnam, whether expressed as shares of state GDP or total exports, or as the share of industries with positive exports, i.e. the extensive margin.) indicates that states with larger populations of Vietnamese refugees export significantly more goods to Vietnam, suggesting that Vietnamese refugees living in the US help mediate international trade.
1.1.6. Con: Accepting refugees could help [mitigate](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-population-un-factbox/factbox-ageing-europe-could-benefit-from-refugees-and-migrants-u-n-idUSKBN19C2AI) the ageing - and in some cases, shrinking - population problem in many high-income countries.
1.1.6.1. Pro: High-income countries tend to have low birth rates, often leading to ageing and shrinking populations \([p. 191](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/pdf/FVVinObGyn-1-191-193.pdf)(Developed countries tend to have a lower fertility rate due to lifestyle choices associated with economic affluence where mortality rates are low, birth control is easily accessible and children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost involved in bringing up children. Higher education and professional careers often mean that women have children late in life. This can result in a demographic economic paradox.)\). Low-income countries tend to have [higher birth rates](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income), leading to a relatively youthful population. It makes economic sense to balance the ageing populations in richer economies by taking in young workers from countries with growing populations.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: While many of the world's refugees are young and able to work, around [8.5%](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/12237/meeting-the-needs-of-older-refugees)(They may be fewer in number, but older migrants and refugees still make up a sizable group in many European countries, and it is increasingly acknowledged that they have specific concerns and needs.\n \nA report by the Centre for Policy on Ageing in the UK recently identified the main issues facing older refugees and asylum seekers as lack of income, problems learning the language, loneliness and isolation, loss of social status and mental health problems.\n\[...\]\nOlder refugees face even greater income problems than refugees in general. They are less likely to be able to get paid jobs.) are over 60 years of age, so could neither contribute to the long-term workforce nor increase the birth rate of their host country.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Across almost all industrial nations, the share of the population at working age \(15-64\) is expected to decline significantly in the coming decades \([p. 14](https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/2060%20policy%20paper%20FINAL.pdf)(With unchanged policies, high-income countries would experience an average fall of 5 percentage points in participation \(among the population older than 15 years\) over the next 50 years)\).
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: [Analysis](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/population-ageing-and-immigration-germanys-demographic-question)(If Germany sustains its current level of economic growth in the coming decades, all three drivers of population growth – immigration, fertility, and average life expectancy – could rise, and the population would remain relatively constant. In this scenario, if Germany can integrate immigrants into the labor market and increase older workers’ labor-participation rate, it would be in a better position to finance existing social-welfare programs.\n\nBut we must not forget the one “constant” in all demographic forecasts: the aging of the population. Right now, baby boomers are still economically active, and will remain so for some time. But, by 2035, they will have retired, and Germany will have more than 21 million inhabitants over the age of 67; half of them will be over 80 by 2050. And if longevity rises faster than is currently expected, this age group will be even larger.\n\nGermany cannot expect to see a sustained, moderate shrinking of its retirement-age population until after 2060.) predicts that rising immigration to Germany - influenced significantly by the influx of refugees in recent years - could reduce the percentage of its total population who are of retirement-age in years to come.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: In 2015, the foreign population in Germany made up [10.5%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/890258/foreigners-share-germany/) of the total population, yet accounted for [20%](https://www.dw.com/en/record-rise-in-babies-with-foreign-mothers-in-germany/a-35952212) of all births that year.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: [Almost half](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/08/02/4-asylum-seeker-demography-young-and-male/) of all refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 were young males.
1.1.6.2. Con: Accepting refugees is only effective against a high-income country's ageing population if a sufficiently high proportion of them joins the labour force, which is not a given.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: [Social networks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2017/09/11/using-social-networks-to-advance-your-career/#773e5dc50a66) can be pivotal in finding and increasing the job prospects needed to integrate successfully into the host country's workforce. Educating immigrants on how to use social networks effectively could improve their employability.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Only between a [quarter to a third](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/820480/Germany-migrant-crisis-refugees-long-term-unemployment-benefits-Angela-Merkel) of new refugees are likely to enter the labour market.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Even when refugees desire to integrate fully into their host countries, there is often insufficient access to [language education](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/16/language-barrier-refugees-english-classes-integration-esol)(“Refugees come to the UK with skills and experience, so it may be only the lack of English language which gets in the way.”), which prevents them from making substantial contributions to the labour market.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: Many refugees living in Germany have not had access to a good [education](https://wenr.wes.org/2017/05/lessons-germanys-refugee-crisis-integration-costs-benefits)(The level of educational attainment among the current refugees is diverse and tied to country of origin, but generally falls below German attainment levels. According to estimates by the German Agency for Labor from early 2016, less than half of the current refugees from Afghanistan, for instance, had more than elementary education, 27 percent did not have any form of formal schooling at all.) prior to their arrival there, making their odds of obtaining employment in Germany unfavourable.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Con: While refugees are less educated than German citizens, they tend to have [more education](https://wenr.wes.org/2017/05/lessons-germanys-refugee-crisis-integration-costs-benefits)(While these attainment levels are short of European standards, they often outstrip education levels in refugees’ home countries. The fact that the passage to Europe is costly means that privileged and educated segments of society tend to be overrepresented among the refugees, while less wealthy people have little means of escape.) than the citizens remaining in their home countries. This suggests that refugee populations are willing and able to learn.
1.1.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.6.2.5. Con: In many cases, there are [policies](https://apolitical.co/en/solution_article/banning-refugees-working-means-they-drive-down-wages-more-not-less) in place that prohibit or delay refugees from entering the workforce. These could be changed to make it easier for refugees to join the labour force.
1.1.6.3. Pro: [High-income nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country#High_income_UN_members) with [population decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline#Contemporary_decline_by_country) include Japan, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, and to some extent Russia.
1.1.6.4. Pro: If refugees are allowed to work and contribute to social services through the taxes they pay, they will effectively finance the ageing native population's healthcare and pensions.
1.1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.2. Con: Countries do not have any obligations to people who are not their citizens or residents.
1.2.1. Con: High-income countries have signed international legislation and agreements to take in refugees.
1.2.1.1. Pro: All high-income countries are signatories to the [1951 Refugee Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees), obliging them to take in refugees.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The [1951 Refugee Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html) does not oblige a state to take in refugees unless it is [their first safe country](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position) of arrival.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: This is a legally binding Convention for the 145 countries that ratified it \([p. 5](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4ec4a7f02.pdf)(The principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the return of a refugee to a territory where his or her life or freedom is threatened, is considered a rule of customary international law. As such it is binding on all States, regardless of whether they have acceded to the 1951 Convention or 1967 Protocol. A refugee seeking protection must not be prevented from entering a country as this would amount to refoulement.)\).
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Article 32 of the Refugee Convention lists "grounds of national security or public order" as the only reasons for which refugees with a legitimate claim to asylum can be expelled \([p. 29](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10)(The Contracting States shall not expel a refugee lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order.)\).
1.2.1.2. Pro: Many high-income countries have signed the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)\), which clearly underlines the human right to seek asylum in foreign countries.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Article 14](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)(Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.) of the UDHR clearly states that everyone has the right to seek asylum.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: [Article 9](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)(No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.) of the UDHR clearly outlaws the arrest, detention, or exile of anyone for arbitrary reasons. High-income countries that imprison, [detain](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/11/americas-us-government-endangers-asylum-seekers-with-unlawful-policies/) or expel refugees violate international law.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: The UDHR is not [legally binding](https://www.coalitionfortheicc.org/news/20160930/what-universal-declaration-human-rights)(The UDHR is not a legally binding treaty.).
1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: [Israel](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/syrian-refugee-crisis-how-different-countries-have-responded-france-lebanon-uk-a7220616.html)(Despite its proximity and high level of economic development, Israel has refused to take any Syrian refugees.), a [signatory](https://fanack.com/israel/human-rights/)(Israel signed the Convention and Protocol on 1 August 1951, and ratified it on 1 October 1954.) of the UDHR, has refused to take any refugees and has not suffered any legal repercussions.
1.2.1.2.3.2. Con: The principles of the UDHR are legally enforceable via the many other international agreements that have been directly founded upon them.
1.2.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The laws surrounding the handling of asylum seekers in the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_in_the_European_Union) are based on the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is in turn based on Article 14 of the UDHR.
1.2.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The UDHR definition of fundamental freedoms and human rights is [used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Legal_effect) in the [United Nations Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations), which is binding for all member states.
1.2.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \([ICESCR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly in 1966. It obliges its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights.
1.2.1.2.3.2.4. Pro: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \([ICCPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights)\) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly. It obliges its parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals.
1.2.1.2.3.2.5. Con: Many of these agreements are either ineffective, counterproductive, openly ignored, or otherwise unclear. They do not provide adequate legal accountability for nations breaking these treaties.
1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1. Pro: [The Dublin regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation#Criticism) fails to provide fair, efficient, and effective protection for refugees. The regulation is criticized for undermining refugee rights.
1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: Increased pressure on border states due to the Dublin Regulation [has led to](https://euobserver.com/justice/25910)("Greece is not a safe place for those in need of protection," Bjarte Vandvik, the head of the ECRE, said. \n\n\[...\] However, Mr Vandvik believes that the current problems in Greece are "only a symptom of fundamental and far-reaching flaws inherent in the Dublin system".\n\nUnder the rules, responsibility over an asylum seeker usually lies with the member state that played the greatest part in the applicant's entry into or residence on EU territory.\n\n"After ten years in operation, the Dublin system still fails to achieve its aims," the ECRE's head said, underlining that "responsibility is assigned but not carried out".) unacceptable conditions for asylum claimants, and the risk of other serious human rights violations.
1.2.1.2.3.2.5.2. Pro: The [UN Human Rights Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Committee), which is tasked with holding member states accountable to the international treaties on human rights, is [highly ineffective](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2223298)(In particular, the positive reputation of the HRC \(and some of the other treaty bodies\) has not translated itself into high levels of compliance with the state-parties’ procedural reporting obligations; nor, perhaps, to a high degree of compliance with the Committee’s substantive recommendations. In addition, the HRC and the other treaty bodies face significant backlogs in their work, and have been forced to reduce the average time allocated to the review of each country report – endangering thereby the quality of their output.).
1.2.1.2.3.2.5.3. Con: This is a call to hold countries accountable for breaking international agreements, rather than a reason to consider agreements like the UDHR flawed or unclear.
1.2.1.3. Pro: [Some countries](https://www.realfirstaid.co.uk/restoftheworld)(Some civil law systems, which are common in Continental Europe, Latin America and much of Africa, impose a far more extensive duty to rescue. The duty is usually limited to doing what is “reasonable”. In particular, a helper must not endanger their own life or that of others but should, at the least, include alerting the emergency services. \n\nThese countries include:\n\n Albania\n Andorra\n Argentina\n Austria\n Belgium\n Brazil\n Bulgaria\n Croatia\n Czech Republic\n Denmark\n Estonia\n Finland\n France\n Germany\n Greece\n Hungary\n Iceland\n Israel\n Italy\n Netherlands\n Norway\n Poland\n Portugal\n Russia\n Serbia\n Spain\n Switzerland\n Tunisia) abide by [Duty to Rescue](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/03/duty-rescue) laws, meaning individuals in or from that country are bound by law to protect and rescue someone \(regardless of nationality\) providing it does not put them in personal danger.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea prescribes that all commercial and naval ships give swift assistance to any person found at sea in distress or danger of being lost, as far as is possible and safe to do so without endangering the ship or anyone aboard it \([pp. 3-4](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/f629fbdb-6aba-480c-95a8-1ba9663f5dba.pdf)(Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers: \(a\) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost; \(b\) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him.)\).
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: In Denmark, anyone who fails to help another person who is in mortal danger, appears to be lifeless, or is a victim of a shipwreck or similar accident can be fined or imprisoned for up to two years, provided the rescue would not have endangered them or others \([p. 64](https://www.legislationline.org/download/id/6372/file/Denmark_Criminal_Code_am2005_en.pdf)(§ 253 Any person who, though he could do without particular danger or sacrifice to him-self or others, fails 1\)to the best of his ability to help any person who is in evident danger of his life; or 2\)to take such action as is required by the circumstances to rescue any person who seems to be lifeless, or as is ordered for the care of persons who are victims of a shipwreck or any other similar accident; shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years.)\).
1.2.1.3.3. Con: While Duty to Rescue laws currently oblige those in signatory states to rescue refugees from immediate peril, these laws do [not](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/28/4/637/2548395)(The general duty is not to admit refugees on the territory of a particular State, much less to refrain from returning them to risk, but to rescue them from imminent peril) generally legally extend to hosting refugees long-term or refraining from sending them back to a place that poses general safety risks.
1.2.1.4. Con: The [Dublin Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation)(In July 2017, the European Court of Justice upheld the Dublin Regulation, declaring that it still stands despite the high influx of 2015, giving EU member states the right to transfer migrants to the first country of entry to the EU.) only requires EU member states to take in refugees if they are the first EU country in which the refugee arrived after leaving their home country.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1.
1.2.1.5. Pro: In 2007 the EU signed the [European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/european-consensus_en), a policy outline in which it reaffirms its commitment to the fundamental [principles of humanitarian aid](http://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/humanitarian-principles_en) and to the respect of [International Humanitarian Law](http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/ihl_en.pdf).
1.2.1.5.1. Con: It is possible for the [basic humanitarian principles](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/humanitarian-principles_en) defined by the Geneva Convention to conflict with each other \([pp. 198-199](https://international-review.icrc.org/sites/default/files/irc_97_1-2-8.pdf)(A closer look at the operational reality of humanitarian organizations reveals a number of hidden dilemmas that are, to some extent, inherent to humanitarian principles. At times, there can be tensions or even outright contradictions between them.)\).
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: One of the Geneva Convention's humanitarian principles is that "human suffering must be [addressed](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/humanitarian-principles_en) wherever it is found, with particular attention to the most vulnerable."
1.2.1.6. Con: Goldsmith and Posner \(2015\) argue that international legislation and treaties are limited in that they lack moral force, because states only follow them to serve their own self-interests \([p. 165](https://iuristebi.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-limits-of-international-law.pdf)(Henkin’s observation that “almost all nations observe almost all\nprinciples of international law and almost all their obligations almost all of the time” \(1979, 47\) has inspired a generation of international law scholars, who have assumed that this observation can be true only because international law, by exerting normative force, constrains the pursuit of state interest. The theory of international law set forth in parts 1 and 2 of this book has tried to show that Henkin’s dictum is misleading. The behavioral features of international law—how it originates and changes, when and why states act consistently with and violate it, why it has such limited\ncontent—are better explained by a theory of state self-interest than\nby the various alternatives.), [pp. 225-226](https://iuristebi.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-limits-of-international-law.pdf)(International law is a real phenomenon, but international law scholars exaggerate its power and significance. We have argued that the best explanation for when and why states comply with international law is not that states have internalized international law, or have a habit of complying with it, or are drawn by its moral pull, but simply that states act out of self-interest.)\).
1.2.2. Pro: It is a country's right as a [sovereign nation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sovereignty/Sovereignty-and-international-law)(The theories of the English philosopher John Locke \(1632–1704\) and the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau \(1712–78\)—that the state is based upon a formal or informal compact of its citizens, a social contract through which they entrust such powers to a government as may be necessary for common protection—led to the development of the doctrine of popular sovereignty that found expression in the American Declaration of Independence in 1776. \[...\] sovereigns who make the laws cannot be bound by the laws they make \[...\] This statement has often been interpreted as meaning that a sovereign is not responsible to anybody and is not bound by any laws.) to self-govern and thus decide against helping those who are not its citizens or residents.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Many democratic countries have made formal commitments in their [constitutions](https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en) to defend their borders and serve the interests of their own citizens before the wellbeing of non-citizens.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [Preamble](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/preamble) of the American Constitution states that the document and its purposes are dedicated "to ourselves and our Posterity", not the citizens of any other nation.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The second article of the [French Constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/France_2008?lang=en) states that the principle of government shall be "of the people, by the people and for the people", which presumably refers to the French people and not those of other nations.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: The first lines of the [German Constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/German_Federal_Republic_2014?lang=en)(Conscious of their responsibility before God and man, Inspired by the determination to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united Europe, the German people, in the exercise of their constituent power, have adopted this Basic Law.) establish Germany's commitment to world peace and the wellbeing of Europe, which suggests that other countries and their citizens are a priority.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The [United Nations Charter](https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html)(The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.) upholds the [Westphalian principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty) that each state is the exclusive sovereign of its territory, stating that the United Nations cannot "intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state."
1.2.2.2.1. Con: [Critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty#Principles_and_criticism) of the Westphalian model claim that it is obsolete and leads to rivalry and tension instead of building community.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: The UN stipulates that its vow not to intervene in a member state's domestic matters will [not](https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html)(Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll) prevent it enforcing the measures outlined in [Chapter VII](https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html)(All Members of the United Nations, in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, undertake to make available to the Security Council, on its call and in accordance with a special agreement or agreements, armed forces, assistance, and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.) of its Charter, in which it says that members must provide international assistance - including rights of passage - in instances where it is necessary to maintain international peace and security.
1.2.2.3. Con: Not all countries self-govern, help and protect their own citizens effectively. In these cases, international law states that other countries are obliged to step in and provide international protection for these citizens \([pp. 15-16](https://www.unhcr.org/3d4aba564.pdf)(States are responsible for protecting the rights of their citizens. When governments are unable or unwilling to do this, people may face such serious threats that they are forced to leave their country and seek safety elsewhere. If this happens, another country has to step in to ensure that the refugees’ basic rights are respected. This is known as “international protection”.)\).
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.4. Con: The [Vienna Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties), an international agreement regarding the law of international treaties, only regards state sovereignty as something to [keep in mind](https://www.oas.org/legal/english/docs/Vienna%20Convention%20Treaties.htm)(Having in mind the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, such as the principles of the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, of the sovereign equality and independence of all States, of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States, of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and of universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all,), suggesting that national sovereignty does not take precedence over international obligation.
1.2.3. Con: High-income countries are complicit in - and profit from - exploitative activities that have contributed to the current worldwide refugee crisis.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The exploitative actions of high-income countries have sometimes exacerbated or triggered human conflict in low-income countries, leading to refugee crises there.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Low-income countries also contribute to conflicts that result in refugee flows and therefore have an obligation to take these refugees in.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The moral obligation of both high- and low-income countries to help refugees is not mutually exclusive. High-income countries simply have more obligation to help.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo \([DRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo#Continental_and_civil_wars_\(1996%E2%80%93present\))\), sparked by regional genocide and previous warfare, displaced many individuals. Today, [more than 600,000](http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20DRC%20Factsheet%20-%20July%202017.pdf) refugees and asylum seekers from the DRC are in other African countries.
1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: A lot of the instability in the DRC that contributed to the two Congo wars dates back to the removal and assassination of Patrice Lumumba. There is [substantial evidence](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22006446)(But piecing together information suggests that while MI6 did not kill the politician directly, it is possible - but hard to prove definitively - that it could have had some kind of indirect role.) pointing to Western involvement in this event.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Many high-income countries profit from conflict in low-income countries by supplying weapons and supplies to militant groups, which enables violence and [contributes](https://medium.com/\@williamhartung55/how-war-and-weapons-trading-are-fueling-the-global-refugee-crisis-1132c31cf1f3) to refugee crises.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The [US](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html) and Canada are [major exporters](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-now-the-second-biggest-arms-exporter-to-middle-east-data-show/article30459788/) of arms to the Middle East.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Moral responsibility lies with the perpetrator of an act of war, not the vendor of the weaponry.
1.2.3.1.2.2.1. Con: High-income countries can reliably predict that when, for example, they sell arms to Saudi Arabia, those weapons will be used to kill civilians in [Yemen](https://www.france24.com/en/20190717-interview-radhya-al-mutawakel-yemen-war-mwatana-saudi-uae-france-arms-sales)(Western countries "are fuelling the war in Yemen by selling arms to the Saudis and Emiratis"). It is morally wrong to knowingly facilitate the unjust killing of others.
1.2.3.1.2.3. Pro: The invasion of Afrin in Syria by Turkey has been conducted using a lot of [German](https://anfenglish.com/news/germany-s-part-in-afrin-exposed-in-billboards-35481) manufactured weapons.
1.2.3.1.2.4. Con: Global arms trades are linked to international tensions, such as those between the US, [Russia](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/10/europe/russia-arms-production-scli-intl/), and [China](https://www.avascent.com/news-insights/perspectives/new-customers-for-chinese-weapons-opportunities-for-chinese-arms-exports-in-the-western-defense-marketplace/#_ftn1). This suggests that, even if many countries were to cease weapons trading, there would be alternative [sources of weaponry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#World's_largest_arms_exporters) available.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Western oil companies and governments seeking to exploit oil production in [Iraq](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/19/opinion/iraq-war-oil-juhasz/index.html) arguably fuelled the war there.
1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Companies like ExxonMobil are [primarily interested](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=151842205)(Think of their business model. They make money by drilling holes in the ground all over the world and then sitting on top of those holes, for up to 40 years at a time, to make back the cost of drilling the hole in the first place. They want a stable world. They want a world in which the holes they drill are not overtaken by wars, or coups or guerrilla uprisings. So when they look out at the Middle East, which is a pretty unstable place, what they urge for governments to promote stability.) in the stability of the region in order to continue their operations, which suggests that they would have little interest in promoting violence.
1.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Major oil companies [greatly benefit](https://merip.org/2020/06/the-oil-for-security-myth-and-middle-east-insecurity/)(By posing as the protector of the global economy’s most essential energy resource, the United States was able to extract geopolitical power from Middle Eastern oil. Growing insecurity in the Middle East, in turn, has allowed the North Atlantic oil industries to derive economic power from this politically manufactured scarcity. Beyond dramatic episodes of direct military intervention by the United States, the backbone of these security policies is the region’s hyper-militarization, efforts to exacerbate conflicts \(often by preventing peaceful resolution\) and support for neoliberal authoritarians, all of which have only made the region less secure. Although the destabilizing contradictions of this dependency have now undercut both American hegemony and the power of the North Atlantic hydrocarbon industries, the oil-for-insecurity entanglement has nonetheless created dangerously strong incentives for more conflict ahead.) from regional instability in the Middle East because it creates a global sense of oil scarcity, increasing the value of oil.
1.2.3.2. Pro: High-income countries redefined many other countries' borders during the 20th century, leading to continuous sectarian conflict that these wealthy countries have done little to resolve.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The [Sykes-Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) of 1915 between Britain and France is seen as a root cause of many sectarian conflicts that have plagued the Middle East ever since.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: [No actual state borders](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/05/16/the-bullshistory-of-sykes-picot/)(Let me get right to the point: Sykes-Picot did not—repeat, did not—establish the borders of the modern Middle East. That ought to make it hard to blame Sykes-Picot for anything, since it never came into effect.) were ever drawn based on the Sykes-Picot Agreement. With the exception of demarcating the line on which the future Syrian-Iraqi border would be based, the accord had, therefore, [no impact at all](https://theconversation.com/obsession-with-sykes-picot-says-more-about-what-we-think-of-arabs-than-history-58775) on the region.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: The agreement is among the root causes of the ongoing [conflict between Israel and Palestinians](https://theconversation.com/the-sykes-picot-agreement-and-the-making-of-the-modern-middle-east-58780), both of which lay claim to land that they perceive as having been promised to them by colonial powers during and after World War I.
1.2.3.2.1.3. Con: The contemporary conflicts in the Middle East are not about nor based on national borders. They are [rooted in the authoritarian nature](https://politicstheorypractice.com/2016/05/23/sykes-picot-is-not-responsible-for-the-failing-middle-east/)(Obviously, then, the problem is not poorly designed European borders. Instead, it is ineffective and oppressive governments that are triggering much of the conflict and violence in the Middle East.) of the region's governments and their exploitation of identity as well as ethnic and religious conflicts.
1.2.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Studies indicate that](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/getting-religion-puzzling-case-islam-and-civil-war)(The theory holds that embattled political elites will tender religious bids when they calculate that increasing their religious legitimacy will strengthen their chances of survival.) the link between Muslim countries and religious civil wars can be explained with their authoritarian regimes that exploit religious cleavages to increase their own legitimacy and chances for survival.
1.2.3.2.1.3.2. Con: While these conflicts may not be about national borders, the drawing of national borders [without much regard](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36300224) to ethnic, sectarian, and linguistic lines has paved the way for conflict.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The Korean Peninsula was [split into two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea) by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1945. The [prevailing conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea#Post-armistice_relations) between North and South Korea is thus an indirect result of that division.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Pakistan was split off from India in 1947 under British rule by the [Radcliffe Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Line), provoking prevailing [disputes and conflict](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=776f6f2151e74c7cabc641fd3ab0802a) between the resultant nations.
1.2.3.2.4. Con: After World War I, the world powers came together to form the [League of Nations](https://www.britannica.com/topic/League-of-Nations#ref337580), which helped establish peace and [resolve tensions](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/league-of-nations#section_4) between countries.
1.2.3.3. Con: In many cases, high-income countries are not causally responsible for creating the conditions that displace refugees.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Interventions by high-income countries in the Middle East have been [instrumental](http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/middleeast/2015/09/iraq-war-root-europe-refugee-crisis-150908151855527.html) in creating the current refugee crisis.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: The largest single population of refugees have fled the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War), which is an ongoing conflict within Syria.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The civil war was [sparked by protests](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35806229)(A peaceful uprising against the president of Syria...turned into a full-scale civil war.) following the Arab Spring, not due to any foreign intervention.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: While this is true, the Arab Spring protests were [influenced](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/barack-obama-arab-spring-cairo-speech)(America, the president said, with a humble nod to these ageing Arab autocrats – and in a lightly coded reference to Bush's controversial "freedom agenda" – did "not presume to know what is best for everyone". But there was a bigger nod: "I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose."\n\nEighteen months later, the uprisings of the Arab spring tested that awkward construct. From the short and mostly peaceful revolution in Tunisia to carnage in Syria, Obama's responses have, as one admirer put it, mixed "pragmatism and values".) by the US presence in the Middle East.
1.2.3.3.1.1.2. Con: [Russian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34418849) intervention in Syria has made the conflict worse.
1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: Many high-income countries either tolerated or [actively supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-National_Force_%E2%80%93_Iraq#Troop_deployment_in_Iraq_2003%E2%80%932011) the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, which by the end of 2008 had displaced [2.6 million](https://www.pewglobal.org/2016/10/18/conflicts-in-syria-iraq-and-yemen-lead-to-millions-of-displaced-migrants-in-the-middle-east-since-2005/)(Sectarian violence in Iraq led to a total of 2.6 million internally displaced people within Iraq by the end of 2008.) people.
1.2.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: The American invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent destabilization of the country and wider region, have [been blamed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-collapse-iraq-the-rise-isis-made-america-13913) for the rise of ISIS, which has fueled many of the conflicts that now cause refugee streams.
1.2.3.3.1.2.2. Con: While it did cause a high level of instability in the region, the US intervention in Iraq aimed to install and support democracy and independent self-governance.
1.2.3.3.1.2.2.1. Con: While the US and its allies claimed to desire political stability, they were primarily [motivated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/28/iraq.usa)(There were only two credible reasons for invading Iraq: control over oil and preservation of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.) by the value of oil and US currency in the future.
1.2.3.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.3.
1.2.3.3.1.2.3. Con: Germany and France [were opposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War#Opposition_in_European_countries)(People and groups opposing the war include the governments of many nations which did not take part in the invasion, including both its land neighbors Canada and Mexico, its NATO allies in Europe such as France and Germany, as well as China and Indonesia in Asia, and significant sections of the populace in those that took part in the invasion.) to the 2003 Iraq War and did not participate.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Even if not directly involved, high-income countries have not done enough to prevent the global refugee crisis.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: High-income countries have been [standing by](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-yemens-misery-the-west-is-complicit)(With fighting flaring in the critical port of Hodeidah this week, the UN envoy delayed planned talks until the end of the year. \[...\] It took the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul to push Washington into issuing the ceasefire call. Yet the Trump administration, transfixed by its enmity with Iran, wants an end to conflict only when it suits its Saudi and Emirati allies.) while Saudi Arabia has turned Yemen [into a humanitarian crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-yemen.html).
1.2.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Military and arms assistance from the [US](https://theconversation.com/senate-vote-could-end-us-complicity-in-the-saudi-led-genocide-in-yemen-111952), [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/saudi-arabia-uk-arms-sales-weapons-yemen-civil-war-house-lords-report-a8781181.html), and [Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/in-yemen-war-coalition-forces-rely-on-german-arms-and-technology/a-47684609) further implicates these countries in the Yemen crisis.
1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: When Myanmar's government was committing atrocities against and displacing more than 700,000 ethnic Rohingya from 2017 on, many high-income countries around the world [did not intervene](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/08/myanmar-shameful-anniversary-highlights-lack-of-accountability-for-atrocities-against-rohingya/).
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Mass migration is often directly tied to a local [cause](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/reasons-why-people-become-refugees/) like cultural, gender-based, or religious persecution, civil war, or political unrest.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Refugees from Afghanistan, the [second-largest source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Countries_of_origin_of_\(non-EU\)_asylum_seekers_in_the_EU-28_Member_States,_2015_and_2016_\(thousands_of_first_time_applicants\)_YB17.png) of refugees in recent years, are fleeing from a [conflict between](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/16/dispatches-why-afghans-are-leaving) the government and the Taliban, which preceded the international presence in the country.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Con: Ethnic tensions in Myanmar, estimated to have generated over 1 million refugees to date, were reignited during its time as a forcibly divided nation under British colonial rule \([pp. 22, 30](https://www.burmalibrary.org/docs3/Ethnic_Groups_in_Burma-ocr.pdf)(Inter-ethnic harmony was badly subverted by the uninvited intrusion of British rule in the 19th century \(22\). \n\nUnofficial numbers, however, were estimated at over three times that figure, meaning that over one million exiles and migrants were subsisting precariously around Burma's troubled borders. \(30\))\).
1.2.3.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.2.3.3.3.4. Con: The refugee crisis is linked directly to [global poverty](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/20/the-refugee-crisis-is-a-problem-of-poverty-not-just-migration) rates, which extend far beyond local political circumstances.
1.2.3.4. Pro: The economic activities of high-income countries have contributed massively to climate change, which creates an obligation for them to make reparations for the increased number of climate-linked humanitarian disasters that can trigger refugee crises \([p. 206](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332638066_Reparative_Justice_for_Climate_Refugees)(The The Polluter Pays\nPrinciple \(PPP\) holds that ‘emitters of high quantities of greenhouse\ngases \(GHG\) are responsible for compensating those negatively\naffected’.)\).
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Low-income nations are more susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as [extreme drought](https://www.climatecentral.org/news/worlds-poorest-most-at-risk-from-drought-conflict-20793) and [flooding](https://earth.org/sea-level-rise-will-disproportionately-affect-developing-countries/), which can create the economic and social conditions that trigger conflict and resultant refugee crises.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: As climate change continues, it will likely render [large swathes of the world](https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/what-the-world-will-look-like-4degc-warmer) uninhabitable, thus compounding the problem.
1.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/06/12/climate-change-cause-armed-conflict/)(In a scenario with 4 degrees Celsius of warming \(approximately the path we’re on if societies do not substantially reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases\), the influence of climate on conflicts would increase more than five times, leaping to a 26% chance of a substantial increase in conflict risk, according to the study.) estimates that a global temperature increase of 4 degrees celsius will greatly increase the influence of climate on conflicts, leading to a 26% chance of a substantial increase in conflict risk.
1.2.3.4.1.3. Pro: Senior US military officials [claim](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/01/climate-change-trigger-unimaginable-refugee-crisis-senior-military)(The generals said the impacts of climate change were already factors in the conflicts driving a current crisis of migration into Europe, having been linked to the Arab Spring, the war in Syria and the Boko Haram terrorist insurgency.) direct links between climate change and the Arab Spring, the war in Syria, and Boko Haram, all of which have been massive contributors to the current refugee crisis.
1.2.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: Scientists believe that rural migration into cities, brought about by a global warming exacerbated drought, triggered the [Syrian civil war](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/3/150302-syria-war-climate-change-drought/).
1.2.3.4.1.4. Con: Low-income countries are more susceptible to such impacts largely due to flaws in their existing [infrastructures](https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/world-resources-report/how-low-income-countries-can-plan-climate-change-impacts)(Some of these measures will undoubtedly require significant investment and transfer of know-how. These include, for example, investments in suitable infrastructure as well as in improving the quality and coverage of climate information.). High-income countries could help support these areas by increasing and improving their infrastructure and policies to better withstand the effects of climate change.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: High- and upper-middle-income countries are responsible for [86%](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-by-income-region)(When aggregated in terms of income, we see in the visualization that the richest half \(high and upper-middle income countries\) emit 86 percent of global CO2 emissions.) of global [CO2 emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions).
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Climate refugees forced to flee from catastrophic weather disasters caused by [global climate change](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/20/621782275/the-refugees-that-the-world-barely-pays-attention-to) are increasingly common.
1.2.3.4.4. Con: China, whose [income](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview)(But its per capita income is still only about a quarter of that of high-income countries) per capita is only a quarter that of high-income countries, is the world's leading contributor to climate change, with annual CO2 emissions [double](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions) those of the next highest contributor.
1.2.3.4.5. Con: While a climate refugee crisis is possible, it can be mitigated with new [policies](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/climate-change-migration-refugees-can-be-prevented/).
1.2.3.5. Con: Refugees should be taken in by those whom choose to do so by having signed the [1951 Refugee convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees) and/or by those whom caused a refugee crisis in the first place by invading a foreign country; eg, [Operation Enduring Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participants_in_Operation_Enduring_Freedom). Wealth should not be a primary issue here.
1.2.3.6. Pro: High-income countries enjoyed significant economic growth as a result of [colonial](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/20/past.hearafrica05) slavery, trade, and the collection of resources from developing countries.
1.2.3.6.1. Pro: Studies show that, even when controlling for other variables, areas subjected to damaging colonial activity in the past have a significantly [lower](https://blogs.worldbank.org/allaboutfinance/did-yesterday-s-patterns-of-colonial-exploitation-determine-today-s-patterns-of-poverty)(However, areas that suffered from bad colonial activities today have about 30% lower GDP per capita, and areas that suffered ugly colonial activities have about 15% lower GDP per capita than areas with no or good colonial activities.) GDP per capita today than other areas.
1.2.3.6.2. Con: Instead of taking in refugees, high-income countries could return wealth taken from the victims of colonialism through foreign aid or other methods.
1.2.3.6.2.1. Con: The [impact](https://voxeu.org/article/economic-impact-colonialism) colonialism had upon the development and prosperity of countless countries around the world throughout history is so great that it is difficult to calculate the amount that would have to be repaid in foreign aid to compensate for it.
1.2.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: In many cases, like the British [colonisation](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/this-economist-says-britain-took-away-usd-45-trillion-from-india-in-173-years/story/292352.html) of India, the total amount taken from the colonised by the coloniser was much greater than any [aid](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/uk-foreign-aid-budget_uk_57d953afe4b00f741735477f?guccounter=1) the latter may have provided to the former in the subsequent years.
1.2.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: The past colonisation of certain countries by high-income nations is a [major driving factor](http://blogs.worldbank.org/allaboutfinance/did-yesterday-s-patterns-of-colonial-exploitation-determine-today-s-patterns-of-poverty) behind the poverty and conflict that persist and generate refugees in these countries.
1.2.3.6.2.1.2.1. Con: [Studies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2029575)(Moreover, the end of colonialism in the 1950s produced an era of rapid economic growth and rising literacy levels and life expectancy in nearly all the former colonies.) indicate that formerly colonised countries enjoyed a surge in economic growth, literacy levels, and life expectancy when the era came to an end in the 1950s, suggesting that present-day poverty and conflict are not the result of a colonial past.
1.2.3.6.2.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.6.1.
1.2.3.6.2.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.3.2.
1.2.3.6.2.1.2.3. Pro: The export of slaves, for example to the Caribbean and the US, in the context of colonialism hurt the African continent and stifled its development until the present day \([p. 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~baileymj/Whatley_Gillezeau.pdf)\).
1.2.3.6.2.1.2.4. Pro: The philosopher [Frantz Fanon](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frantz-fanon/)(Across these discussions, Fanon develops his notion of the inferiority complex, which is his subtle and important account of how anti-Black racism is internalized by Black people and how that internalization adds complexity to the pathologies of living under colonial rule.) argues that colonialism engenders a lingering debilitating inferiority complex in the citizens of colonized nations, which perpetuates and normalizes racial and economic inequality.
1.2.3.6.3. Con: Countries that are considered high-income countries today are not solely responsible for colonialism and imperialism throughout history. This suggests that high-income countries should not be singled out for any moral obligations that arise from these past practices.
1.2.3.6.3.1. Pro: For example, slavery was [practiced](https://web.archive.org/web/20040804001522/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm) among the Native tribes of North America.
1.2.3.6.3.1.1. Con: Historians have uncovered that Native American tribes were encouraged to participate in the slave trade by [Europeans](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/01/native_american_slavery_historians_uncover_a_chilling_chapter_in_u_s_history.html)(Europeans didn’t just displace Native Americans—they enslaved them, and encouraged tribes to participate in the slave trade, on a scale historians are only beginning to fathom.).
1.2.3.6.3.2. Con: Slavery and servitude throughout history and across different cultures should not be equated with the [Transatlantic Slave Trade](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/whp-origins/era-5-the-first-global-age/54-the-transatlantic-slave-trade-betaa/a/read-the-transatlantic-slave-trade-beta)(This overview of the event known as the transatlantic slave trade shows a major economic development depended on the horrific treatment of enslaved humans. The violence and scale of the transatlantic slave trade seems to exceed any other known instance of slavery in history.), which was especially violent and egregious.
1.2.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: The Transatlantic Slave Trade was the largest human trafficking event in history. Research shows that [over 12 million](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/)(Between 1525 and 1866, in the entire history of the slave trade to the New World, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the New World.) Africans were traded to the Americas.
1.2.3.6.4. Pro: Colonialism [exploited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_colonialism) developing countries. Today, [neocolonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism) continues to exploit them.
1.2.3.6.4.1. Pro: Consumers in high-income countries are able to enjoy cheap consumer goods off the back of extremely poorly paid manufacturing workers in the developing world, while corporations in high-income countries turn a profit through this process. This is an exploitative, [neo-colonial](http://warwickglobalist.com/2019/04/04/sweatshop-colonialism/) relationship.
1.2.3.6.4.1.1. Con: [Sweatshops](https://web.northeastern.edu/econsociety/why-the-world-needs-sweatshops/) are beneficial for the economic development of poor countries.
1.2.3.6.4.1.1.1. Con: The benefits of [sweatshops](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-sweatshops) for economic development come at the cost of endangering individuals and communities by forcing them to seek little pay under harsh conditions just to survive. The economic upsides do not outweigh the moral downsides.
1.2.3.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.6.2.1.2.
1.2.4. Con: As part of a global community, we are all global citizens and have moral responsibilities towards each other that transcend national boundaries.
1.2.4.1. Pro: According to [utilitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#ClaUti) arguments, which support the universal minimization of suffering, countries should [take in](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/immigration/#Uti) refugees because everyone is a part of the same [global village](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm)(Unfortunately for those who like to keep their moral responsibilities limited, instant communication and swift transportation have changed the situation. From the moral point of view, the development of the world into a "global village" has made an important, though still unrecognized, difference to our moral situation. Expert observers and supervisors, sent out by famine relief organizations or permanently stationed in famine-prone areas, can direct our aid to a refugee in Bengal almost as effectively as we could get it to someone in our own block. There would seem, therefore, to be no possible justification for discriminating on geographical grounds.).
1.2.4.2. Con: There are practical [limitations](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/08/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-global-citizenship/261128/) to actualizing the metaphor of global citizenship, so expecting such global moral responsibility is currently unrealistic.
1.2.4.3. Con: National identity is more significant to most people's personal identity than their status as global citizens.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The existence of [events](https://www.frommers.com/slideshows/846677-11-top-independence-celebrations-around-the-globe) and traditions centered on patriotism suggests that national identity is morally significant to many.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: Cultural traditions and events would be very unlikely to disappear upon accepting refugees from different countries.
1.2.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Even with an influx of immigrants, states would presumably still put a lot of funding into protecting and promoting their national traditions and heritage.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: [93%](https://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/01/18/3410719.htm) of Australians consider Australia Day, the official 'national day' of Australia, to be one of the nation's most significant celebrations, with 74% saying this day makes them feel proud to be Australian.
1.2.4.3.1.2.1. Con: [Most refugees](https://amesnews.com.au/lead-story/migrants-embrace-australia-day-survey-finds-3/)(A large majority of migrants and refugees new to Australia plan to become citizens and believe it is important to celebrate Australia Day, according to a new survey.) in Australia who wish to settle there believe that celebrating Australia Day is an important aspect of their journey to citizenship.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: In the United States, [sanctuary city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city) laws represent local efforts to protect immigrants from investigation and deportation, suggesting that US citizens of many cities have formally recognized the importance of global citizenship.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: National identity often takes the form of nationalism, which is a problematic and [harmful form of patriotism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/#PatNat). Its existence should not, therefore, be encouraged or used as justification for a nation shirking its responsibility towards citizens of the world.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: Nationalism is a form of harmful social control, as it can shape the behaviour of groups to foster collective hostility towards others \([p. 43](http://bev.berkeley.edu/Ethnic%20Religious%20Conflict/Ethnic%20and%20Religious%20Conflict/2%20National%20Identity/Druckman%20nationalism.pdf)\).
1.2.4.3.3.2. Con: Not all forms of nationalism conflict with global duty and citizenship.
1.2.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: [Civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism) revolves around shared social values rather than shared ethnic heritage, so is harmonious with progressive values like freedom, equality, and tolerance.
1.2.4.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Civic nationalism emphasizes the value of one's national policies and principles, both of which can be used to isolate cultural out-groups \([p. 4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi-nMmZ6KXtAhVpplkKHYNCBc04ChAWMAB6BAgFEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.harvard.edu%2Ffiles%2Fbonikowski%2Ffiles%2Fsimonsen_and_bonikowski_-_is_civic_nationalism_necessarily_inclusive.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0IMitnWJ8AnR-6BlJ74bOj)(It is not self-evident, however, that placing a premium on voluntary criteria of belonging makes civic nationalism immune from the vilification of out-groups. Commitment to a nation’s political principles – the mainstay of civic nationalism – may be seen by some as a deeply rooted cultural disposition that is inherently lacking among immigrants and ethnoreligious minority groups \(Mouritsen & Olsen 2013; Tonkens & Duyvendak 2016\). Indeed,\nas Brown \(2000: 290\) argues, ‘the civic nation similarly \[to the ethnocultural nation\] clothes itself in the myths and symbols of family’ in order to offer its members a coherent sense of temporally durable community.)\).
1.2.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Forms of nationalism that reject xenophobia, aggression, and intolerance actively complement global citizenship and its values.
1.2.4.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Sports nationalism](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nationalism-is-not-necessarily-a-bad-thing/article/2599075), best illustrated by the Olympic games, is a form of nationalism that embraces ethnic and racial diversity and creates opportunities for people to come together and celebrate.
1.2.4.3.3.2.3. Con: If this is true, it only serves to bolster the argument that global citizenship and duty exist and should be respected.
1.2.5. Pro: The [libertarian](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/#Libertarian)(For libertarians, just outcomes are those arrived at by the separate just actions of individuals; a particular distributive pattern is not required for justice.) form of distributive justice rejects that countries can have moral obligations and instead hold that only individuals have moral obligations.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [Libertarianism](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/libertarian-thinking-redistribution) opposes government redistribution of property. Taking in refugees who rely on government handouts requires such a redistribution of property.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Libertarians [support](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/libertarian-thinking-redistribution)(Arguably, then, some form of wealth redistribution is not only compatible with a thoroughgoing libertarian theory but necessary to it.) wealth redistribution in dire circumstances.
1.2.5.2. Con: Libertarianism recognizes the importance of national [open border policies](https://mises.org/library/breaking-boundaries-investigation-libertarian-open-borders)(We are all human beings, whether we were privileged enough to be born into a society which reflects our values or whether we were unfortunate enough to be born into an oppressive society which we seek to escape through migration.\n\nWithout an enforceable right of free movement, individuals would not be able to determine their plans of life meaningfully. Without having these rights enforced, human beings are effectively gridlocked at the whims of pernicious governments that claim to be defending life and liberty while simultaneously eroding both.), implying its acknowledgement of some obligation to help and accept those from other nations.
1.3. Pro: It is in the long-term interests of humanity for high-income countries to host refugees.
1.3.1. Con: The flight of refugees causes harm to their home countries.
1.3.1.1. Con: The major source countries of refugees are de-facto [failed states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Fragile_States_Index), for example, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, and South Sudan. It is unlikely that those who flee these countries could make much of a difference under these conditions.
1.3.1.2. Con: Many refugees flee their home countries because they are oppressed, [persecuted](https://www.freemovement.org.uk/what-is-the-legal-meaning-of-refugee/)(The legal definition of the term “refugee” is set out at Article 1A\(2\) of the Refugee Convention, which defines a refugee as a person who: Owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it.), discriminated against, or outright driven out. It is unreasonable to assume that refugees have the choice to continue living in their home countries.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Groups like the Rohingya in Myanmar, hundreds of thousands of which [have fled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people#Rakhine_State_conflicts_and_refugees_.282012.E2.80.93present.29) to neighboring Bangladesh and other countries, are oppressed and persecuted to the extent that they are [not even recognized as citizens](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/29434/Rohingyas-not-recognized-as-citizens-since-1982-OCHA)(1982: The year the government in Myanmar passed a law identifying 135 national ethnic groups as “recognized” groups that can claim citizenship. However, the Rohingya Muslim minority concentrated in Rakhine was not among these groups, and thus they became stateless. Myanmar considers the Rohingya to be economic migrants from Bangladesh, though most can show their families have been in the country for generations.) of Myanmar.
1.3.1.3. Pro: If large numbers of young, educated refugees flee their home countries, they will leave these countries with a severe [shortage of skilled human capital](https://fpif.org/brain-drain-politics-immigration/)(Today, the term has come to explain the large-scale emigration of educated individuals from the countries of their birth. When a nation exhausts its human capital, economic development is impeded, leaving the citizens who remain in dire straits.).
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Research on return migration implies that refugees may learn beneficial skills and values from living in a host country that they can later disseminate back in their home country \([p. 1](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/123/pdfs/who-benefits-from-return-migration-to-developing-countries.pdf)\), with some studies suggesting this may happen [regardless](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0010414009331733) of whether they ever make a physical return.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Reports suggest that it is primarily well-educated, relatively wealthy Syrians who have been able to leave Syria as refugees, which has led to a [shortage](https://thearabweekly.com/brain-drain-means-syria-cant-recover-generation) of skilled human capital in the country.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Around 2,000 university professionals have left Syria as refugees over the last 8 years. This has allegedly contributed to the [deterioration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-48664331) of its Higher Education system.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: It is misleading to place the blame on university professionals for fleeing Syria, given the [dangers](https://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2015/02/syrian-professor-recipe-tragedy/)(Syrian professors can’t win when it comes to politics. Those believed to support the country’s rulers are threatened by opposition forces. Those believed to support the insurgents are threatened by government forces. With no one allowed to be neutral, many professors flee to neighboring countries or migrate to Europe. A few of them are debating if a new university might be set up in one of the more stable opposition regions or in Turkey.) involved with working at a university.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Con: It is misleading to suggest that people with the means to flee Syria are harming the country given the dire nature of the [security](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/16979186) and [healthcare](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-lack-adequate-covid-19-response-puts-thousands-lives-risk) crises that Syria is currently facing.
1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.3.2. Con: Refugee migration negatively impacts the environment.
1.3.2.1. Con: The world's refugees combined are highly likely to have a far lower carbon footprint than the world's richest [10%](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-worlds-richest-people-also-emit-the-most-carbon)(On Wednesday, British charity Oxfam released a study that found the richest 10 percent of people produce half of the planet’s individual-consumption-based fossil fuel emissions, while the poorest 50 percent — about 3.5 billion people — contribute only 10 percent.).
1.3.2.2. Pro: The displacement of refugees often results in large, overcrowded refugee camps near borders. The urgent need for shelter, fuel, and other basic resources in such circumstances can lead to [environmental issues](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/protection/environment/3b039f3c4/refugees-environment.html)(With only a few families involved, the environmental impacts are unlikely to be too serious or long-lasting. With thousands of desperate people, however, the results can be disastrous for the environment.) such as deforestation, soil erosion, and pollution and depletion of water.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Refugees in Uganda](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/18/massive-deforestation-by-refugees-in-uganda-sparks-clashes-with-local-people) are causing massive deforestation in some regions of the country by cutting down trees for shelter, fuel, and charcoal.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Refugee-induced deforestation is driven by the need for a greater amount of [agricultural](https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/2020/the-ecological-footprint-of-refugees/) land, rather than for extraction of raw materials. As such, [soil erosion](https://graniteseed.com/blog/how-do-plants-help-prevent-erosion/) is unlikely to be a significant problem.
1.3.3. Pro: Global [cultural diversity](https://www.coe.int/en/web/interculturalcities/intercultural-cities-and-refugees/) is beneficial and is significantly [improved](https://www.grin.com/document/419497)(It is evident how the refugees bring with them new cultures and communities that benefit host nations.) when high-income countries accept refugees.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The places in which immigrant or refugee populations are concentrated have become ethnic enclaves and thus cultural and culinary attractions.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Both [Koreatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown,_Los_Angeles) and [Little Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tokyo,_Los_Angeles) in Los Angeles have become tourist hotspots.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: [Little Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Haiti) is a culturally rich enclave of Miami.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: [Greektown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greektown,_Detroit) is a historic district of Detroit and famous for its food, culture, and architecture.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: Enclaves can impede immigrant integration with wider society \([pp. 21-22](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/2376/1/Ethnic%20Enclaves%20Impedes%20Integration_RR%201.pdf)(Living in regions with high own-ethnic concentrations reduces the likelihood of immigrants integrating into the host-society)\).
1.3.3.2. Pro: [Diversity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/)(Diversity enhances creativity. It encourages the search for novel information and perspectives, leading to better decision making and problem solving. Diversity can improve the bottom line of companies and lead to unfettered discoveries and breakthrough innovations.) makes people more economically productive and enhances creativity.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Racial and cultural diversity brings informational diversity - a wider range of [perspectives](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/07/12/11900/the-top-10-economic-facts-of-diversity-in-the-workplace/)(Bringing together workers with different qualifications, backgrounds, and experiences are all key to effective problem-solving on the job. Similarly, diversity breeds creativity and innovation.) and ideas.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Increased immigration increases [linguistic diversity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nataly-kelly/immigration-benefits_b_2523562.html)(Immigration enhances our multilingualism. America is already rich in natural language resources, with approximately one out of every five people who live here speaking a language other than English at home. With the exception of some native-born populations, such as those who speak Native American languages or use American Sign Language, the majority of that linguistic diversity is owed to immigrants who brought their languages here, just like English speakers originally did. We lag behind many countries when it comes to teaching children other languages in our educational system. Yet, our own government — including the Department of Defense and the State Department — rely heavily on skilled multilingual individuals in order to accomplish critical work, such as translating information for intelligence purposes and providing language training to diplomats who will serve overseas. The bulk of our nation’s language capacity is thanks to its immigrants.) in the general population, which [increases cultural diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonising_the_Mind#Language_and_culture)(Language as culture is the collective memory bank of a people's experience in history. Culture is almost indistinguishable from the language that makes possible its genesis, growth, banking, articulation, and indeed its transmission from one generation to the next \[...\] Language as communication and as culture are then products of each other. Communication creates culture: culture is a means of communication. Language carries culture) with it.
1.3.3.4. Con: An abrupt increase in a host country's diversity via a sudden influx of refugees may spark long-term sociopolitical backlash and instability there.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: The recent rise of problematic right-wing populism and associated xenophobia in many high-income countries may have been driven by refugee crises \([p. 165](https://www.ifsh.de/file-CORE/documents/yearbook/english/15/PisoiuAhmed-en.pdf)(The FPÖ is also not the only group to profit from an atmosphere of fear – fear of crime, fear of terrorism, and a diffuse feeling of unease, which is often attributed to the high proportion of unemployed young men among the migrants, or questions of religion or security. Indeed, all Europe’s far-right parties have jumped on this bandwagon as a means of obtaining quick and easy electoral capital.)\).
1.3.3.4.1.1. Con: Latent xenophobia may intensify in times of increased immigration, but it is not created by immigration.
1.3.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The fact that immigration is not the root cause of xenophobia is irrelevant. If increased diversity in a community exacerbates xenophobia, it is a contributor to increased social friction in that community.
1.3.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Rejecting refugees due to the rise of xenophobia in the West wrongly harms refugees to appease prejudices.
1.3.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Xenophobia and right-wing nationalism are positively [correlated](https://oxfordre.com/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-368?__prclt=hS1Go6B3)(While radical right parties are not necessarily equivalent to anti-immigrant parties and even the notion of a new anti-immigrant “party family” \(van der Brug et al. 2000; Bjorklund and Andersen 2002\) is contested, these concepts strongly overlap.), which suggests that they must be addressed together.
1.3.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Poland and Hungary have [barely taken in any refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees). Anti-refugee sentiment within them predates any refugee intake.
1.3.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Poll results indicate that, before the refugee crisis, the Polish population was generally [more pro-immigration and pro-refugee](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/diminishing-solidarity-polish-attitudes-toward-european-migration-and-refugee-crisis)(Some commentators have claimed that the lack of experience receiving refugees and immigrants predisposes countries such as Poland to intolerance and even xenophobia. Polling data belies this presumption, however. Perhaps due to the high levels of emigration from Poland to other EU countries, the Polish public typically held very high opinions of migration throughout the 2000s \(see Figure 1\). \n\nData from the European Social Survey between 2002 and 2012 show that Poles consistently held some of the most pro-immigration views in Europe, expressing similar views towards refugees and asylum seekers.) than many other European countries.
1.3.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: The fear of perceived outsiders is [innate](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/28/14425658/fear-of-refugees-explained)(There’s a reason every country with immigration has pockets of xenophobia. It’s our instinct to be distrustful of those whom we perceive as being "them" rather than “us.” In prehistoric times, this is what kept us safe. In the modern age, it’s what nudges us toward bigotry.) and very impactful in human beings.
1.3.3.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: People [reinforce](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/dec/04/echo-chambers-are-dangerous-we-must-try-to-break-free-of-our-online-bubbles)(Individuals empowered to screen out material that does not conform to their existing preferences may form virtual cliques, insulate themselves from opposing points of view, and reinforce their biases. \n\nAn analysis of the 2016 US presidential election by the Columbia Journalism Review noted that “… a right-wing media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyper-partisan perspective to the world.”) their own prejudices by subscribing only to feeds that confirm their existing biases and which often have political designs to do so.
1.3.3.4.1.1.4. Pro: The US has a long history of anti-immigrant [xenophobia](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/long-history-xenophobia-america) that predates the modern global refugee crisis.
1.3.3.4.1.2. Pro: Those who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election have cited his [stance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/why-did-people-vote-for-donald-trump-us-voters-explain)(Trump promises to rebuild our army and fight for our safety, I look to see terrorism defeated and the war on cops to end, a solid declaration of war on Isis and a halt to the preference of immigrants before citizens.) on refugees and immigration as an important factor.
1.3.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Donald Trump is the only president in the history of the United States that has been impeached [twice](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jan/13/donald-trump-impeachment-nancy-pelosi-joe-biden-mike-pence-congress-covid-coronavirus-live-updates), suggesting that Trump's political platform is losing popularity.
1.3.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Supporters of Donald Trump have celebrated his administration's tightening of [asylum-seeking](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/the-things-trump-got-right/617424/)(In mid-2020, the Trump administration revised the asylum rules to return them to their original purpose. Asylum seekers who spent more than two weeks in any country en route to the United States will have to file their claim in that country. Fear of crime will no longer be deemed persecution, for asylum purposes. Claims deemed frivolous can be closed.) rules, which force many refugees to seek asylum elsewhere.
1.3.3.4.1.3. Pro: [Islamophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia) has increased in many countries with a greater intake of refugees.
1.3.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: In the United States, hate crimes against Muslims [increased](http://www.newsweek.com/fbi-hate-crimes-are-down-us-not-against-muslims-395578) following the acceptance of Syrian refugees.
1.3.3.4.1.3.1.1. Con: The rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the US has been attributed to the [9/11 terrorist attacks](https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-12/data-hate-crimes-against-muslims-increased-after-911) in 2001 and thus has little to do with immigration.
1.3.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: A study found that Greek island residents who were directly exposed to greater numbers of passing refugees showed a significant increase in their anti-Muslim attitudes \([p. 444](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320338659_Does_Exposure_to_the_Refugee_Crisis_Make_Natives_More_Hostile)(We ﬁnd that direct exposure to the refugee crisis has statistically and politically meaningful effects on natives’ exclusionary attitudes, preferences over asylum and immigration policies, and political engagement. Exploiting the exogenous variation in refugee arrivals caused by distance to the Turkish coast—our instrument—we ﬁnd that respondents directly exposed to the refugee crisis\nexperience a 1/4 standard deviation \(SD\) increase in their anti-asylum seeker and anti-immigrant attitudes as well as a 1/6 SD increase in their anti Muslim attitudes.)\).
1.3.3.4.1.3.3. Con: The rejection of refugees and the rise of Islamophobia in the West are based on irrational prejudices driven by a general climate of [anti-Muslim](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/anti-muslim-activity/) rhetoric that [misleadingly links](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/muslims-vs-islamists) militant Islamist organizations to the Muslim community.
1.3.3.4.1.3.4. Con: Global Islamophobia resulted from the major political, technological, and economic changes of [globalization](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/xinjiang-germany-islamophobia-global-phenomenon), meaning that the refugee crisis has only played a small part.
1.3.3.4.1.3.5. Con: A 2019 [poll](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/topics/latest-news/2019/july/religious-tolerance-is-widespread-but-it-does-not-extend-to-islam)(Overall, about half of those surveyed perceive Islam as a threat. \[...\] These findings, recorded in spring 2019, are largely similar to the results of previous Religion Monitor surveys taken in 2013, 2015, and 2017.) in Germany found that roughly half of all respondents perceived Islam as a threat. However, this result was largely similar to those of previous surveys conducted in 2013, 2015, and 2017, suggesting that Germany's [2015 refugee influx](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/germany-merkel-refugee-asylum/405058/) has not significantly fuelled Islamophobia in Germany.
1.3.3.4.1.3.6. Pro: [Surveys](https://www.mei.edu/publications/europes-islamophobia-and-refugee-crisis) conducted in Europe indicate an increase in Islamophobia since the start of the refugee crisis in 2015.
1.3.3.4.1.4. Con: Robust and evidence-based integration programmes in the host country could help mitigate these issues.
1.3.3.4.1.4.1. Pro: The majority of Syrian immigrants living in the US integrate very [successfully](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2016/12/13/294851/syrian-immigrants-in-the-united-states-a-receiving-community-for-todays-refugees/)(Considering this negative rhetoric, it may come as a surprise to some that immigrants from Syria who live in the United States are in fact doing very well. They are learning English, getting good jobs, owning homes, and starting businesses at impressive rates.) into American society. Syrian refugees are purposefully relocated to regions with an established Syrian immigrant community in the US to encourage similar success.
1.3.3.4.1.4.2. Con: [Studies](https://www.thelocal.se/20170918/what-lessons-can-sweden-learn-from-its-yugoslavian-refugees)(Similarities in level of education was particularly vital to the long-term success: Yugoslavia's education system, where primary schooling was compulsory until the age of 15 and students were encouraged to follow upper secondary education until the age of 19, was not dissimilar to Sweden's \[...\] A comparable standard of education not only made it easier for those from former Yugoslavia to adapt to Sweden's own education system, but also for them to go on and become employed.) indicate that refugee integration success may be dependent on education levels among the refugee population. This suggests that integration success cannot be guaranteed by integration programmes alone.
1.3.3.4.1.4.2.1. Con: The [studies](https://www.thelocal.se/20170918/what-lessons-can-sweden-learn-from-its-yugoslavian-refugees) concluded that the success of long-term resettlement was predicted by providing immigrant families access to education and social services, concluding that host countries should do more, rather than less, for incoming refugees.
1.3.3.4.1.4.3. Pro: Hundreds of thousands of Bosnian refugees have successfully integrated into Norwegian society since their arrival in the 1990s, with many citing Norway's prompt [scattered resettlement strategy](https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/bosnians-the-integration-champions) as a key contributory factor.
1.3.3.4.1.4.4. Pro: International bodies such as the UN Refugee Agency and the [EU Parliamentary Research Service](https://epthinktank.eu/2017/02/08/integration-of-refugees-and-migrants-participation-in-cultural-activities/) have produced comprehensive integration policy guidance to aid host countries in achieving integration of their refugee populations \([pp. 120-121, 123-130](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/522980604.pdf)\).
1.3.3.4.1.4.4.1. Con: Even though host countries are instructed on how to best integrate refugees, that does not guarantee that they will adopt recommended policies.
1.3.3.4.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: The few refugees whom Japan accepts have significant difficulties integrating due to a reportedly [inadequate](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2012/07/17/our-lives/profiles/refugee-groups-slam-japans-struggling-resettlement-plan/) resettlement programme.
1.3.3.4.1.4.5. Pro: [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/canada-role.html) provides a comprehensive resource package for refugees to help them build links with native Canadians in their communities, access language learning resources, and integrate themselves into society.
1.3.3.4.1.4.6. Pro: Refugees to [New Zealand](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/what-we-do/our-strategies-and-projects/supporting-refugees-and-asylum-seekers/refugee-and-protection-unit) are welcomed with a comprehensive resettlement strategy which supports individuals and families to become self-sufficient and active members of the wider community.
1.3.3.4.1.4.7. Con: Positing refugee integration as a key solution to host-country xenophobia and racism is [problematic](https://furmancenter.org/research/iri/essay/the-problem-of-integration)(Promoting integration as the means to improve the lives of Blacks stigmatizes Black people and Black spaces and valorizes Whiteness as both the symbol of opportunity and the measuring stick for equality. In turn, such stigmatization of Blacks and Black spaces is precisely what foils efforts toward integration.), as it places responsibility to resolve these issues largely on the victims rather than on the perpetrators.
1.3.3.4.1.4.7.1. Con: Adopting a whole-community approach to integration \([p. 11](https://esrc.ukri.org/files/news-events-and-publications/evidence-briefings/integration-disadvantage-and-extremism/)(Integration is not just a duty of migrants and minorities, but of the whole of society and its institutions. Mainstream social policy instruments should be rigorously scrutinised to identify how best they can affect equal outcomes across society.)\) could be a way for host countries to continue using refugee integration as a strategy against xenophobia without putting the duty of implementation solely on refugees.
1.3.3.4.1.4.7.2. Con: Educational opportunities for the host community in the different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs of those they receive could be used as an additional strategy to achieve peaceful multiculturalism.
1.3.3.4.1.4.7.2.1. Pro: [Research](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar03/vol60/num06/-What-Promotes-Racial-and-Ethnic-Tolerance%C2%A2.aspx) indicates that school-based programmes and comprehensive teacher training in multiculturalism can promote a community's interracial tolerance.
1.3.3.4.1.4.7.3. Pro: Discrimination [harms resettlement and integration](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-8068-3#Sec24)(Discrimination harms resettlement and integration for refugees and asylum seekers as well as health, and for those fleeing trauma and persecution it can be particularly detrimental. ...There is a clear moral imperative to address discrimination in resettlement countries if they are to fulfill their obligations to provide a ‘safe haven’ for those who seek protection.) in host countries. This suggests that more needs to be done to address xenophobia and other negative attitudes towards refugees before they can comfortably and safely integrate into their new communities.
1.3.3.4.1.5. Pro: Right-wing nationalist political parties in [Europe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36130006) have gained popularity through anti-immigration campaigning.
1.3.3.4.1.5.1. Pro: In Germany, [the right-wing Alternative for Germany](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37274201) won 13% of the vote in the [2017 national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2017), running mostly on an anti-immigrant, anti-Islam rhetoric. In the previous election, it won less than 5% of votes.
1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: Germany has seen a significant increase in xenophobia and racism that is correlative with the significant increase in its refugee population from [2015](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/germany-merkel-refugee-asylum/405058/) onwards.
1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: In Germany, there was a [sixteen-fold increase](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur23/4112/2016/en/) in attacks on shelters for asylum seekers between 2013 and 2015.
1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.4.1.3.5.
1.3.3.4.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: In Germany, the number of crimes against asylum seekers' homes in 2016 was roughly [5 times higher](https://www.thelocal.de/20170203/thousands-of-crimes-against-refugees-reported-in-2016-report)(The number of crimes against asylum homes was a drop from 2015 at the height of the influx of refugees arriving in the country, when 1,031 such crimes were reported. Both numbers were roughly five times higher than the crimes recorded in 2014 - 199.) than that of 2014, the year before the country experienced a mass influx of refugees.
1.3.3.4.1.5.2. Pro: The far-right [Freedom Party of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria) \(FPÖ\) achieved its highest ever share of the vote in the [2015 Vienna elections](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/11/social-democrats-win-vienna-election-despite-freedom-party-gains) and the 2016 presidential elections, following campaigns centred around the European refugee crisis.
1.3.3.4.1.5.2.1. Con: A study found that Austrian citizens hosting refugees in their community were 4.42% less likely to support the FPÖ \([p. 1](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9790.pdf)\).
1.3.3.4.1.5.3. Con: European election results in 2017 signalled a sizeable decrease in the popularity of European right-wing populism, despite the [continued, relatively large refugee movement into Europe](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20170629STO78630/asylum-and-migration-in-the-eu-facts-and-figures) in 2017.
1.3.3.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: The right-wing populist, anti-immigrant UK Independence Party suffered historical losses in the UK's [2017 general election](http://www.bbc.com/news/election/2017/results/england).
1.3.3.4.1.5.3.2. Pro: In 2017, the far-right Front National [lost](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/21/frances-national-front-lost-big-in-the-last-two-elections-now-the-far-right-party-is-in-chaos/) by a landslide in the French presidential elections.
1.3.3.4.1.5.3.3. Pro: The far-right [Freedom Party](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/europes-governments-signal-relief-as-dutch-election-defeats-far-right) \(PVV\), who had led the polls for the previous two years, lost by a [significant margin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/pm-mark-rutte-set-to-beat-geert-wilders-in-dutch-election) in the 2017 Dutch parliamentary elections.
1.3.3.4.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.2.
1.3.3.4.2. Con: If there is a relatively high level of cultural diversity in a given population, this tends to increase intercultural tolerance in that population.
1.3.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Marketing research](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/to-increase-charitable-donations-appeal-to-the-heart-not-the-head/) demonstrates that people are more sympathetic to the plight of others when faced with "identifiable victims" as opposed to unnamed, “statistical victims." The presence of refugees in a host community is, therefore, likely to increase tolerance within it.
1.3.3.4.2.1.1. Con: This presumes that all communities hosting refugees - as in a charity advert asking for donations - would have been made aware of the latter's personal stories and struggles, which may not be the case.
1.3.3.4.2.2. Con: Switzerland, which has one of the proportionately [largest](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/migration-series-part-1-_who-are-the-25-foreign-population-in-switzerland/42412156) growing immigrant populations in the world, passed an [initiative](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/world/europe/swiss-voters-narrowly-approve-curbs-on-immigration.html) restricting immigration in 2014. This suggests that tolerance is decreasing as immigration increases.
1.3.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Votes in favour of this initiative were [highest](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2014/02/what_the_swiss.html)(Swiss anti-immigration voting was highest in the places with the least immigrants!) in Swiss areas with the fewest immigrants. This indicates that increased tolerance correlates with increased migrant population levels.
1.3.3.4.2.3. Con: The area of the UK that experienced a [460% rise](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/28/in-boston-britains-most-pro-brexit-town-voters-are-fed-up.html)(More than three quarters of the people of Boston, in the county of Lincolnshire in the East Midlands of England, voted to leave the EU in 2016.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2014, the town’s migrant population grew by 460%, and the proportion of residents of the Borough of Boston born in EU accession countries such as Lithuania, Poland and Latvia, stands at around 12%.) in immigration in the decade preceding the Brexit referendum voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU, a decision that correlates strongly with antipathy towards immigration.
1.3.3.4.2.3.1. Con: This area of the UK is considered an outlier. The overall [correlation](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138)(But our new analysis for this article shows that, in most cases, high proportions of Leave voters were not concentrated in areas of high immigration. Apart from a few outliers, the districts with the highest vote for Leave were those with the lowest levels of immigration.) between Leave-voting and immigrant populations was negative.
1.3.3.4.2.4. Con: It is not always possible to definitively conclude that increased immigration and diversity are what has caused or contributed to an increase in tolerance.
1.3.3.4.2.4.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994587/#idm140664718702272title)(A common pattern of immigrant residential mobility is initial settlement in an urban ethnic enclave “gateway” community—usually a lower income neighborhood where large numbers of people from the same ethnic background reside. This is followed by movement to residential areas of greater diversity and higher income over time, believed to correspond to increasing acculturation.) indicate that migrants usually begin by settling in gateway communities and then move to neighborhoods with diverse immigrant and nonimmigrant populations. This suggests that migrants usually settle in areas that are already relatively diverse and tolerant.
1.3.3.4.2.4.2. Pro: Within the US, white Americans have a long history of relocating in large groups to avoid living in racially diverse communities \([pp. 417-421](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiLya321IXtAhUIlFkKHYwLCeQQFjADegQIBhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.princeton.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Flboustan%2Ffiles%2Fresearch02_whiteflight.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2N-az3qdckQpjVtB2KMs8d)(Racial segregation by jurisdiction has historical roots in two\npopulation flows: black migration from the rural South and white\nrelocation from central cities to suburban rings. Both flows peaked\nduring World War II and the subsequent decades. Between 1940 and 1970, four million black migrants left the South, increasing the black population share in northern and western cities from\n4% in 1940 to 16% in 1970. Over the same period, the median\nnonsouthern city lost 10% of its white population. \n\nThis paper shows that white departures from central cities were, in part, a response to black in-migration. In every decade, cities that received a larger flow of black migrants also lost a larger number of white residents.)\). This [white flight](https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2018/03/white-flight-didn-t-disappear-it-just-moved-suburbs/)(The term “white flight” is usually used to refer to a migration phenomenon in the post-World War II era. As people of color moved into predominantly white neighborhoods in cities from which they had previously been excluded, many white residents of those neighborhoods picked up and left. They resettled in newly built, overwhelmingly white suburbs.) phenomenon may predict an increase in tolerance in diverse areas, because the least tolerant people necessarily tend to move away rather than cohabitate.
1.3.3.4.2.5. Pro: A study found a [passive tolerance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/16/passive-tolerance-beacon-hope-diverse-communities) effect among white people living in more diverse areas, whereby they were less racially prejudiced simply due to living within a diverse community.
1.3.3.4.2.6. Pro: [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550617731496) in Social Psychology indicates that race essentialism, racism, and [social dominance orientation](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/group/social-dominance-orientation/) decrease with increased exposure to racial diversity.
1.3.3.4.3. Con: The majority of people worldwide say they would actively [welcome](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/05/survey-4-in-5-worldwide-welcome-refugees/) refugees into their country and community, suggesting that sociopolitical backlash as a result of taking in refugees may be much smaller than anticipated.
1.3.3.5. Con: Harvard professor [Robert Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam) argues that diversity [decreases civic engagement](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/)(The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.) and trust between community members.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: While Putnam argues that diversity brings challenges, he [emphasizes](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357) that diversity is [good overall](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12802663)(it's not merely a fact that America's becoming more diverse. It's a benefit. America will - all of us will, over the long run, benefit from being a more diverse, more heterogeneous place. Places that are more diverse have higher rates of growth on average and they have better cuisine. And it's just a more interesting place to live.\n\nSo in the long run, waves of immigration like we're going through now and that we've gone through in the past and increasing diversity is good for a society.).
1.3.3.5.2. Con: [Research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/)(After reanalyzing the same dataset used by Putnam, Abascal and Baldassari asserted that when it comes to distrust and diversity, most of the distrust is expressed by Whites who feel uncomfortable living amongst racial minorities. In other words, greater distrust may stem from prejudice rather than from diversity per se. Therefore, Putnam’s conclusion that racial diversity leads to less altruism and cooperation amongst neighbors was incorrect.) suggests that reduced civic engagement is better predicted by the existence of prejudice than diversity alone.
1.3.3.5.3. Pro: Increased community trust is instrumental in fostering a number of [important factors](https://www.bi.team/blogs/social-trust-is-one-of-the-most-important-measures-that-most-people-have-never-heard-of-and-its-moving/)(Levels of social trust, averaged across a country, predict national economic growth as powerfully as financial and physical capital, and more powerfully than skill levels – over which every government in the world worries about incessantly. It is also associated with many other non-economic outcomes, such as life satisfaction \(positively\) and suicide \(negatively\). In short, it’s not much fun living in a place where you don’t think most other people can be trusted.), such as a healthy economy, increasing life satisfaction, and reductions in suicide.
1.3.3.6. Con: If a high-income country takes in many refugees from vastly different cultural backgrounds who do not share its traditions and values, this may threaten the host nation's entire cultural identity.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: Immigrants that do not share cultural values and traditions with their host country are more likely to struggle with integration.
1.3.3.6.2.1. Con: This is a secondary issue relative to the importance of saving refugees from life-threatening situations in their home country.
1.3.3.6.2.2. Pro: Refugees are [more likely](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0365-z)("People who share the same languages \[...\] have a strong likelihood that they share the same culture") to face [language barriers](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/16/language-barrier-refugees-english-classes-integration-esol)("The results show that people with better English skills are more satisfied with their job and education and have a better understanding of British culture."), which often prevent them from gaining the cultural insight, education, and employment needed to integrate well.
1.3.3.6.2.2.1. Con: [A report](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigrants-united-states-how-well-are-they-integrating-society)(Just as previous immigrants incorporated into mainstream American life, an examination of the most recent inflow of immigrants shows they are integrating well, according to five indicators: language proficiency, socioeconomic attainment, political participation, residential locale, and social interaction.) by the US Migration Policy Institute notes that immigrants to the US integrate well into American society according to 5 key socioeconomic, linguistic, and political criteria.
1.3.3.6.2.3. Con: Many refugees aim not to impose their own culture on a host country, but to integrate and adopt the culture of the country in which they live.
1.3.3.6.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.2.1.
1.3.3.6.2.3.2. Pro: In a 2008 UK regional report, the majority of the refugees interviewed emphasised the importance they placed on contributing and integrating into their new communities \([p. 6](https://www.migrationyorkshire.org.uk/userfiles/file/PolicyandResearch/YHRMP_Reports/YH_RefugeeFocusGroups_Nov08.pdf)(In all three focus groups the idea of making a contribution to the new community in which they found themselves was strongly expressed. In many respects refugees were keen to emphasise the positive potential of their new lives. Involvement in the local community, fitting in with their new neighbours and contributing via paid work were all seen as important aspects of integration and ultimately steps on the way to becoming ‘British’.)\).
1.3.3.6.2.4. Pro: Refugees hosted in a country whose culture is vastly different to their own often miss out on employment opportunities that would facilitate integration due to their lack of 'cultural capital' \([pp. 21-23](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268058096_Challenging_Barriers_to_Employment_for_Refugees_and_Asylum_Seekers_in_London)("Drawing on Bourdieuian theory, it is suggested that a person or group’s possession \(or lack\) \nof ‘cultural capital’ \(e.g. their knowledge and information of both formal and informal \nsystems and practices in society\) will have a profound impact on their potential achievement \nand success within that society \(e.g. Bourdieu 1986b; Byrne & Rodgers 1996; Lareau 1987; \nReay et al., 2001\). The refugees we interviewed were very aware that they were disadvantaged due to their lack of understanding and experience of the UK job market \(e.g. \nhow and where to apply for jobs\), which was often very different to their countries of origin, \nand due to cultural differences, such as the ‘taken for granted’, everyday knowledge about \nBritish cultural practices.")\).
1.3.3.6.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.4.1.4.4.
1.3.3.6.3. Con: [Cultures are not static](https://culturalevolutionsociety.org/story/What_is_Cultural_Evolution), but adapt and evolve over time due to multiple sociocultural influences. Refugee migration to high-income countries cannot, therefore, fundamentally threaten the latter's respective cultural identities.
1.3.3.6.3.1. Pro: The increased popularity of [Spanish-language songs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/despacito-is-the-first-spanish-language-song-to-be-1-in-the-us-since-the-macarena_us_591dab8fe4b03b485caf3b29), [bilingual schools](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/spanish-language-immersion-schools-gain-popularity-n225776), and [Mexican](https://www.chd-expert.com/mexican-food-is-the-3rd-most-popular-menu-type-in-the-usa-representing-8-percent-of-the-total-national-restaurant-landscape/) food in the US reflects the increase in [Spanish-speaking immigrants](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country) residing there over time.
1.3.3.6.3.2. Pro: German immigrants to the US [introduced](https://americansall.org/legacy-partner/german-americans-contributions-our-nation)(German Americans established the first kindergartens in the United States and the Christmas tree tradition. They also introduced popular foods such as hot dogs, hamburgers, pretzels, strudel, sauerkraut and lager beer to America. All in all, German Americans have been influential in almost every field in American society, including science, architecture, business, sports, entertainment, theology, politics, and the military.) Christmas trees, the Easter bunny, pretzels, and hot dogs, all of which are now staples of modern American culture.
1.3.3.6.3.3. Con: The fact that cultures are always changing does not mean that they should welcome every possible change.
1.3.3.6.4. Pro: Some high-income countries, like [Japan](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/ethnicity-in-japan) and [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Denmark#Ethnic_groups), are ethnically and culturally homogeneous, so increased numbers of people from different cultures and ethnicities are likely to threaten their national identity.
1.3.3.6.4.1. Con: Many nations do not base their national identity on homogeneity and lack of outside influence, so they would not see incoming refugees as a threat to this.
1.3.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: [Luxembourg](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314295417_Identity_and_Its_Construal_Learning_from_Luxembourg) is a paradigmatic example of a country that has intentionally negated its national identity, resulting in increased cultural diversity and acceptance.
1.3.3.6.4.1.2. Pro: Many nations premise their national identity on diversity and inclusivity: for example, [the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus) and [Canada](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-justin-trudeau-canada-immigration-ban-muslim-countries-a7552186.html)(“To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,” he tweeted.\n\nThe tweet has received over 369,000 retweets so far and “Welcome to Canada” began trending in the country.\n\nThe Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, echoed Mr Trudeau's sentiments saying: “We understand that as Canadians we are almost all immigrants ...).
1.3.3.6.4.1.3. Con: It is unfair to link a country's cultural diversity to its ability to take in refugees, because doing so risks placing all of the responsibility to host refugees on only the most diverse and inclusive high-income countries.
1.3.3.6.4.2. Con: The homogeneity of the Japanese-ness \(or [Nihonjinron](https://apjjf.org/-Chris-Burgess/2389/article.html)(A central premise of Nihonjinron is that the Japanese are a homogeneous people \(tan'itsu minzoku\) who constitute a racially unified nation \(tan'itsu minzoku kokka\). Ironically, it has been pointed out \(Revell 1997: 74\) that the origins of this post-war discussion on national identity are not Japanese but rather American, specifically Ruth Benedict’s \(1946\) The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.)\) is an imposed narrative or myth that tells a misleading story of the superiority of the Japanese people.
1.3.3.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.4.3.3.
1.3.4. Con: Taking in refugees can spark fierce disagreement between high-income countries, and is therefore a threat to peaceful international relations.
1.3.4.1. Pro: There were reports that the EU was destabilised [to the brink of disintegration](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/25/fears-eu-is-self-destructing-on-migrant-crisis.html)(European ministers are meeting Thursday to discuss the latest escalation in the region’s migrant crisis amid rising concerns that the survival of the region could be at stake.) as a result of significant differences in its member states' stances on refugee policy in 2016.
1.3.4.2. Con: In such cases, it is the dangerously inequitable division of responsibility among host countries, rather than taking in or refusing refugees per se, that has the worst effect on international relations.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.4. Con: There are better alternatives to helping refugees than for high-income countries to take them in.
1.4.1. Pro: High-income countries could instead increase financial donations to the United Nations Refugee Agency \([UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/donors.html)\).
1.4.1.1. Pro: As of 2015, the head of the UNHCR [described](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/refugee-crisis-un-agencies-broke-failing)(The global humanitarian community is not broken – as a whole they are more effective than ever before. But we are financially broke.) the international humanitarian community as "financially broke," with funding for emergencies such as Syria and South Sudan remaining about a third behind the agency's requests.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The UNHCR is dealing with a growing gap between the funds it requires and the voluntary donations it receives from states, even though numbers of [globally displaced people](https://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2016/6/5763b65a4/global-forced-displacement-hits-record-high.html) are at a record high \([p. 19](http://www.unhcr.org/publications/fundraising/564da0e20/unhcr-global-appeal-2016-2017-needs-funding-requirements.html)(The numbers and needs of people of concern have been growing considerably faster than the level of funding available globally for humanitarian aid.)\).
1.4.1.3. Con: The UNHCR lists the [resettlement of refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/resettlement.html)(UNHCR is mandated by its Statute and the UN General Assembly Resolutions to undertake resettlement as one of the three durable solutions.) as one of its core competencies, so donating to the UNHCR is not an alternative to the resettlement of refugees in foreign countries.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Via the [New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants](https://www.unhcr.org/new-york-declaration-for-refugees-and-migrants.html), which was adopted by all UN member states in 2016, the UNHCR was tasked with - among other things - expanding refugees' [access](https://www.unhcr.org/comprehensive-refugee-response-framework-crrf.html)(Expand access to resettlement in third countries and other complementary pathways) to resettlement in foreign countries.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: Funding the [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/history-of-unhcr.html) is an alternative for countries that are not opposed to the safe resettling of refugees in foreign countries, but who are not necessarily in a position to take them in themselves.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Donating to the UNHCR is widely believed to be one of the most effective ways to [help](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/syria-refugees-what-you-can-do-to-help--2)(Recommended and experienced humanitarian and relief agencies that you can support include:\n...\n UNHCR’s Emergency Appeal) refugees.
1.4.2. Pro: High-income countries could attempt to resolve the issues and conflicts that displace refugees in the first place.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Corruption in refugees' home countries, which is a [leading](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/finding-connections-nexus-between-migration-and-corruption)(This article concentrates on a simple point at the national level: countries where corruption is perceived to be widespread are largely countries of emigration \[...\] In post-conflict settings, corruption can disrupt property restitution mechanisms or reintegration assistance and thereby discourage the return of refugees.) cause of their initial flight and subsequent reluctance to return, could be mitigated through high-income countries holding corrupt rulers and warlords properly accountable.
1.4.2.2. Con: The needs of refugees are immediate. Any attempt at solving the conflicts that caused them to leave their home countries would take years, if not decades.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Not only would conflicts need to end, but massive reconstruction efforts would need to take place to render conflict zones inhabitable again.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Bashar al-Assad remains in power in [Syria](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256). For most refugees, [returning](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Aleppo-victory-shifts-civil-war-in-Assads-favor-475201)(“In my case, if Assad remains in power, I wouldn’t be able to visit Assad-controlled areas because I would either be thrown into prison for the rest of my life or would become another name on the international lists of victims and the disappeared,”) to live under his regime is not a viable option.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.2.1.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: Even if it takes time and does not help today's refugees, working to resolve these conflicts would help reduce the number of individuals displaced in the future.
1.4.2.3. Con: Intervention efforts generally fail, and are often actively counterproductive.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: [More than half](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) of the world's refugees currently come from Syria, Afghanistan, and South Sudan. Years of engagement by the international community have not been able to pacify the situation in these countries. This is unlikely to change.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: In spite of recent peace talks, after 20 years of military presence by the international community, the number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan remains [high](https://www.statista.com/chart/9634/civilian-deaths-and-injuries-in-the-afghanistan-conflict/).
1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Prolonged efforts of the international community have been unsuccessful in pacifying long-lasting conflicts that have sparked large refugee streams, for example those in Somalia, Sudan, and the DR Congo \([p. 16](http://www.unhcr.org/576408cd7.pdf)\).
1.4.2.3.1.3. Con: This is an argument for comprehensive reform of international refugee and migration policies and practices and not an argument to give up on intervening altogether.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.
1.4.2.3.3. Con: The [failure of the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/10/syria-washington-obama-iraq-middle-east-intervention-assad-isis/505202/) to either fully commit to, or refrain from, [intervening](http://theweek.com/articles/667310/how-obama-made-syrias-civil-war-much-much-worse)(Along the way, the U.S.'s half-hearted intervention possibly created the worst of all worlds. It encouraged people to invest themselves in a doomed fight much longer than was necessary. It caused rebels to place their hopes in a more broad intervention that was never coming. And it lengthened one of the most disastrous civil wars of the modern era, one whose aftershocks and refugee flows have brought terror to Europe and helped empower a resurgent nationalism that is shaking the political and economic foundations of the European Union.) in Syria made the conflict worse.
1.4.2.3.3.1. Con: It makes sense that the US chose not to fully commit to the Syrian conflict, given that the interventions in [Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/) all ultimately failed and strained the American military.
1.4.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Given that the US also failed to fully commit to the conflicts in [Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya](https://www.csis.org/analysis/americas-failed-strategy-middle-east-losing-iraq-and-gulf), it makes little sense to argue that failing to commit to the conflicts in Syria would have a different outcome.
1.4.2.3.3.2. Con: The US could [provoke continued conflict with Russia](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/syria-war-us-russia-tensions-iran-drones-jet-miss-assad-putin-trump-latest-a7799576.html) if it were to fully commit to the Syrian conflict.
1.4.2.3.3.3. Pro: It took [three years](https://apnews.com/article/96701a254c5a448cb253f14ab697419b) for the US to mobilise military action into Syria, during which time President Assad sanctioned the killing of many rebels and civilians using chemical missile attacks.
1.4.2.4. Pro: By ceasing trading arms to warring countries that refugees are fleeing from, high-income countries would help prevent further conflict in low-income countries.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.1.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.3.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.4.
1.4.2.5. Con: The citizens of high-income countries have no interest in further interventions abroad for the purpose of resolving conflicts there.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: In a [2018 survey](https://www.thenation.com/article/new-poll-shows-public-overwhelmingly-opposed-to-endless-us-military-interventions/)(The headline findings show, among other things, that 86.4 percent of those surveyed feel the American military should be used only as a last resort) of American citizens, a majority indicated a desire for restraint in using the American military abroad and for any purpose that is not a last resort.
1.4.2.5.2. Pro: When surveyed in 2013, the majority of EU, US, and Turkish citizens indicated that they opposed intervention by their respective countries in the Syrian conflict \([p. 6](https://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/files/1376944979TT2013_complete_web.pdf)(Asked about the desirability of intervention in Syria, majorities in the EU \(up 13 percentage points since 2012 to 72%\), the United States \(up seven percentage points to 62%\), and Turkey \(up 15 percentage points to 72%\) said their countries should stay out of the Syria conflict completely.)\).
1.4.2.5.3. Con: Small-scale interventions with clear goals can find popular support. When France [intervened in Mali in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Serval) against the rise of Islamic militants, a clear majority of French citizens voiced their support in surveys \([p. 2](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/Pew-Research-Global-Attitudes-Project-Mali-Report-FINAL-July-25-2013.pdf)(In France, 62% approve of the military incursion in Mali)\).
1.4.3. Pro: High-income countries could pay lower-income countries that are geographically closer to the refugees' home countries to take in refugees.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Most refugees who do not make it into high-income countries do not return to their home countries and instead remain [displaced](https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) in neighboring countries.
1.4.3.2. Con: The situation that many refugees face in countries closer to their home is significantly worse than in high-income countries.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Due to the dangers of migrating long distances, the geographical distance between refugee countries of origin and their prospective host countries is more important when considering which countries should take in refugees.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: High-income countries accepting refugees encourages more people to attempt long, difficult journeys to reach these countries, which increases the harm to refugees overall.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Germany's open-door policy](https://theweek.com/articles/669030/angela-merkel-destroying-europe) in 2015 may have encouraged many more refugees to risk the journey to Europe.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The solution to this issue is not to refuse refugees entry to high-income countries, but to organise safe passage for them to get there.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Given the sheer [number](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) of refugees fleeing especially volatile parts of the world, it is unlikely that safe passage could be made available for everyone.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Some EU countries have granted refugees from non-EU countries [temporary humanitarian visas](https://www.politico.eu/article/for-a-few-refugees-safe-passage-to-europe/)(According to these treaties, EU member countries can admit citizens from non-EU countries by issuing temporary humanitarian visas that are valid only within that country’s own borders.) that ensure they can take legal and thus safer routes to their host country.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Creating humanitarian corridors for refugees [fights human trafficking](https://www.safepassage.org.uk/how-we-work) and smuggling since they are no longer vulnerable to the exploitation that occurs on illegal routes.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: High-income countries officially closing their borders to refugees and making it harder for them to travel there does not deter refugees, but leads them to attempt even more [dangerous](https://theconversation.com/european-policy-is-driving-refugees-to-more-dangerous-routes-across-the-med-56625) journeys to arrive in such countries.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Following the closure of the [Balkan route](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/balkans-refugee-route-closed-say-european-leaders), thousands of refugees resorted to [crossing](http://www.newsweek.com/europe-refugee-crisis-libya-italy-central-mediterranean-446528) the "most dangerous" route across the sea to Italy in order to reach the EU.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: The [tightening of port security](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53699511)(As port security has been tightened, more attempts have been made to send people by boat.) around vehicles travelling from France to the UK has allegedly pushed more refugees to attempt this journey in dangerously overcrowded and small boats.
1.4.3.2.1.1.3. Con: That people are willing to take significant risks in order to seek asylum in high-income countries suggests that the situations they are fleeing are particularly dangerous, and thus fleeing them may result in less overall harm.
1.4.3.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Refugees may be unaware of the degree of risk associated with attempting dangerous journeys such as the Mediterranean crossing, the mortality rate of which has significantly [increased](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/for-those-crossing-the-mediterranean-a-higher-risk-of-death/)(For the refugees and migrants who made the desperate decision to attempt a perilous crossing across the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe last year, there was a one in 269 chance they would die.\n\nThis year, it’s a one in 88 chance.) over time.
1.4.3.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Guidance and advice is often disseminated on [social media](http://news.sky.com/story/refugees-use-social-media-as-journey-guide-10347981) by refugees who have already made such journeys to help others yet to make them.
1.4.3.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Refugees are 50% less likely than the general population to have a phone with internet access, and 20% of rural refugees have [no internet access](https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/connectivity-for-everyone/)(Globally, refugees are 50 percent less likely than the general population to have an Internet capable phone. While 20 percent of rural refugees have no access to connectivity, urban refugees often have access but cannot afford to get online.) at all. Any advice given on social media cannot, therefore, reach all refugees.
1.4.3.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Refugees have first-hand knowledge of the risks involved with seeking asylum, and thus should be considered [informed rational agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory).
1.4.3.2.1.1.4. Pro: Smugglers exploit refugees attempting to reach Europe and subject them to horrific risks.
1.4.3.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: About half of all refugees are women. Various UN agencies stress the "grave protection risks" that many of them face \([p. 3](https://www.unhcr.org/569f8f419.html)(The assessment found that women and girl refugees and migrants face grave protection risks and that the current response by governments, humanitarian actors, EU institutions and agencies and CSOs is inadequate.)\). Amnesty International [emphasizes](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/female-refugees-face-physical-assault-exploitation-and-sexual-harassment-on-their-journey-through-europe/) the prevalence of physical assault, exploitation, and sexual harassment.
1.4.3.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: Reporters [uncovered](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/libya-migrant-auctions/) an active slave trade being run by refugee smugglers in Libya, one of the countries on a common refugee route to Italy.
1.4.3.2.1.1.4.3. Con: For many refugees, the risk of short-term exploitation by smugglers has to be balanced against the long-term, life-threatening risk of staying in their country of origin.
1.4.3.2.1.1.4.4. Pro: [Many minors](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/17/traffickers-smugglers-exploit-record-rise-unaccompanied-child-refugees-migrants-unicef-report)(“Ruthless smugglers and traffickers are exploiting their vulnerability for personal gain, helping children to cross borders, only to sell them into slavery and forced prostitution. It is unconscionable that we are not adequately defending children from these predators.”) who attempt to reach Europe alone are instead forced into slavery or prostitution.
1.4.3.2.1.1.4.5. Pro: Migrants often end up suffocating in transport containers or drowning on unsafe boats because of the [neglect of smugglers](https://www.unodc.org/toc/en/crimes/migrant-smuggling.html).
1.4.3.2.1.1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.
1.4.3.2.1.1.5. Pro: Many refugees are at risk from drowning when attempting to flee their home country to far-off host countries.
1.4.3.2.1.1.5.1. Con: In response to the large number of asylum seekers risking their lives at sea to get to Europe in 2017, the French government made plans to establish migrant [hotspots](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40738199) in which to process asylum requests on the ground in Libya.
1.4.3.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: In 2018, an average of [six people](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/press/2019/1/5c500c504/six-people-died-day-attempting-cross-mediterranean-2018-unhcr-report.html) died each day while attempting to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
1.4.3.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: Refugees [often](https://www.deseret.com/2015/8/16/20485599/migrants-mass-in-turkey-to-take-shortest-route-to-europe#migrants-mostly-from-iran-including-children-start-their-journey-on-a-dinghy-from-the-coastal-town-of-bodrum-turkey-to-the-nearby-greek-island-of-kos-early-sunday-aug-16-2015)(Migrants, mostly from Syria, but also from Afghanistan, Iran and African nations often try to cross from the secluded beaches of Bodrum peninsula in groups upward of eight people in inflatable plastic boats meant for a maximum of four, powered by tiny electric outboard motors and plastic paddles.) attempt to cross an open sea by inflatable boat in numbers well over the vessel's safe maximum capacity with no life vests, meaning the risk of capsizing and then drowning is very high.
1.4.3.2.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: This happened in the widely-circulated case of 3-year-old [Alan Kurdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Alan_Kurdi) who, along with members of his family, drowned while attempting to cross the Mediterranean.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: In Lebanon, cases of refugee [exploitation and slavery](https://theconversation.com/syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-are-falling-into-slavery-and-exploitation-57521)(A new report from the Centre for Trust, Peace and Social Relations at Coventry University, supported by the Freedom Fund, has also found that more and more refugees in Lebanon are falling prey to slavery and exploitation. \[...\] According to our interviewees, these problems are now so endemic among the refugee population in Lebanon that they can almost be considered the norm.) are highly common.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Con: This could be effectively [mitigated](https://theconversation.com/syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-are-falling-into-slavery-and-exploitation-57521)(\[...\] slavery and exploitation flow from structural factors perpetrated by the Lebanese government.\n\nDenied refugee status by a government, which has imposed a series of highly restrictive residency requirements on Syrians including denying the right to legally work, families have few legal and safe ways to support themselves.\n\nSince the Lebanese authorities deem refugees without valid paperwork to be in the country illegally, many are at constant risk of arrest and detention, and of potential mistreatment once detained. \[...\]\n\nAs a result, women and men engage in any form of employment they can find, no matter how bad the conditions or how severe the risks of slavery and exploitation.) by changes to the residency requirements and work permit programme for refugees in Lebanon, which are highly [restrictive](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/12/lebanon-residency-rules-put-syrians-risk).
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Refugee camps, where many refugees in countries like Turkey and Jordan spend years of their lives, have been described as a [failed concept](https://bostonreview.net/editors-picks-world/elizabeth-dunn-failure-refugee-camps), [overcrowded](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pictures-life-turkey-s-2-5-million-syrian-refugees-crisis-migrant-a6969551.html), and [soul-destroying](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dispelling-the-myth-of-the-humane-refugee-camp-a6915746.html)(I have visited refugee camps on three continents. At best they tend to be soul-destroying – places that keep people alive but stop them from living, as one academic put it so succinctly. There may be food, schools and health clinics in many. But they can also be grim centres of incarceration, designed to herd traumatised people into places that make it easier to control them, either for host governments or aid agencies trying to help. They are seen as short-term solutions yet drift into permanence – just look at Palestinian camps going back 68 years – while gangs, guns, violence and sexual abuse can be rampant. \[...\] These centres are routinely placed in remote areas by governments to segregate refugees. \[...\] Several people told me they saw it as a prison - an uncomfortable comparison Rawlence also makes in his Dadaab expose.).
1.4.3.2.3.1. Con: Of the refugees from Syria, [only around 5%](https://www.unrefugees.org/emergencies/syria/)(The majority of Syrians in the region live with host communities. Only five percent of Syrian refugees live in a refugee camp - 50 percent less than five years ago.) currently live in camps across Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt.
1.4.3.2.4. Pro: Turkey has become increasingly hostile towards its refugees, which has presented significant safety risks for the refugee population there.
1.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: In 2016, reports from Amnesty International alleged that Turkey was [illegally deporting](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-illegally-forcing-refugees-back-syria-say-amnesty-international-a6963771.html) Syrian refugees back to Syria.
1.4.3.2.4.2. Con: A [long-term plan](https://hbr.org/2017/04/turkey-badly-needs-a-long-term-plan-for-syrian-refugees)(A long-term framework for integrating Syrian refugees is a pressing domestic policy to head off tensions like these. \[...\] It’s time for the Turkish government to \[...\] work toward long-term integration of refugees into the economy. My research and the work of others suggest that targeted training programs, tax incentives, and steps to ease credit constraints could offset, at least partially, the financial cost of accommodating Syrian refugees, not to mention future social costs. \[...\] Syrians no longer feel as welcome as they did when the Turkish border first opened to give them safe harbor. But with the right policies, the spirit of hospitality that reigned in those early days can result in a better economic future for all involved.) for integrating Syrian refugees would likely resolve the tensions that have fuelled Turkish hostility towards refugees.
1.4.3.2.4.3. Pro: In 2016, there were [reports](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-shooting-dead-syrian-refugees-flee-civil-war-a6960971.html) that Turkish soldiers had begun shooting Syrian refugees dead as they attempted to cross the border into Turkey.
1.4.3.2.5. Con: Even if conditions in neighboring middle and low-income countries are not ideal, asylum acceptance rates in these countries are often higher and more stable than in high-income countries, meaning that seeking asylum in nearby countries is likely the best option in most cases.
1.4.3.2.5.1. Pro: Acceptance rates are [positively correlated](https://blogs.worldbank.org/dev4peace/will-i-be-granted-asylum-what-influences-country-accept-or-reject-asylum-applications)(Geographical and cultural proximity also influenced asylum approval policies. Applying for asylum in neighboring countries increased the number of favorable decisions of any kind made on asylum claims and reduced the number of applications rejected . Distance between origin country and host country showed the opposite effect.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, more than 60 percent of asylum applications went to EU or OECD countries. Most of these applications came from non-neighboring countries. Although the EU countries received the majority of applications, these countries represented an acceptance rate of only 13 percent. However, the acceptance rates averaged 25 percent in non-EU OECD countries and 30 percent in the rest of the world \(all non-OECD countries\).) with geographical proximity to the refugee's country of origin, meaning that neighboring \(typically low- or middle-income\) countries tend to have higher acceptance rates than countries farther away.
1.4.3.2.5.2. Con: This is an argument to establish more stable asylum acceptance policies and to challenge the link between political rhetoric and refugees in high-income countries, rather than a reason to encourage refugees to settle elsewhere.
1.4.3.2.5.3. Pro: Acceptance rates in low- and middle-income countries are not typically negatively affected by shifting [political opinions](https://blogs.worldbank.org/dev4peace/will-i-be-granted-asylum-what-influences-country-accept-or-reject-asylum-applications)(To better understand asylum admission policies and processes in host countries, I asked the following questions: How do host countries differ in terms of efficiency \(if procedures for status recognition are fast or slow\), generosity \(the number of favorable decisions upon asylum claims\), and the type of protection granted \(full refugee status or other forms of protection\). In particular, I wanted to better understand the role of political and economic factors in explaining these differences.\n\nI found that political factors negatively affected the number of asylum claims accepted only in high-income countries but not low- and middle- income countries \(country GDP for high-income countries = $12,375 or more; middle-income= $1,026 to $12,375; low-income= $1,025 or less\).), whereas those of high income countries are, meaning acceptance rates in lower income neighboring countries are higher and more stable.
1.4.3.3. Pro: It is far cheaper for high-income countries to provide adequate aid for refugees residing in lower-income countries than in high-income countries.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: High-income countries that provide funds for refugees within their borders, rather than for refugees settled elsewhere, retain greater control over what such funds are spent on.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: Due to the large difference in both [currency value](https://www.thebalance.com/how-do-exchange-rates-work-3306084) and [living costs](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&country2=Turkey) between high- and low-income countries, money sent from a high-income country to support refugees in a lower-income country will provide more benefit for both the refugees and their host country than if that same money were used to support refugees living in a high-income country.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: The [Center for Immigration Studies](https://cis.org/Report/High-Cost-Resettling-Middle-Eastern-Refugees)(Although we do not consider all costs, our best estimate is that in their first five years in the United States each refugee from the Middle East costs taxpayers $64,370 — 12 times what the UN estimates it costs to care for one refugee in neighboring Middle Eastern countries.) has estimated that the cost of resettling refugees to other Middle Eastern countries is 1/12th the cost of resettling them in the US.
1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Since 2015, the EU has funded an Emergency Social Safety Net \(ESSN\) programme in [Turkey](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_5049)(The ESSN programme provides refugees with monthly financial assistance through a special debit card which can only be used within Turkey and whose use is strictly monitored. It helps refugees integrate into the local economy and society as they pay for basic needs themselves such as food and rent. \[...\] over 1.6 million refugees receive around €20 per person per month, plus quarterly top-ups to help meet their basic needs such as rent and food.) that provides €20 per month, plus quarterly top-ups, to Syrian refugees residing there. While this sum helps meet their basic food and accommodation needs in Turkey, it would not come close to doing so in higher-income countries.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: After the initial settlement year, the subsequent annual cost of accommodating refugees in high-income countries declines considerably \([p. 1](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\).
1.4.3.4. Pro: Financial support from high-income countries would work to ensure good living conditions for refugees in low-income host countries closer to their home.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Foreign aid has been shown to aid development and [reduce poverty](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2019.1625741)(The survey results show that foreign aid has a positive impact on poverty, as reported by the majority of studies in both the non-momentary and monetary measures of poverty groups. This means that in general, foreign aid reduces poverty, irrespective of the type of poverty measures used.) in low-income countries \([p. 1](https://www.oecd.org/dev/34353462.pdf)(This paper surveys empirical literature on the macro level effectiveness of aid, paying special attention to studies of these inflows and economic growth. It finds overwhelming evidence that aid increases growth and other poverty-relevant variables. By implication, therefore, it can be inferred that poverty would be higher in the absence of aid.)\).
1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: Foreign aid helps bolster infrastructure and encourage innovation and technology, stimulating economic growth in low-income countries \([pp. 80-81](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264123571-5-en.pdf?expires=1606254349&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=650B2B67FEA95E2733C116DB69175D6A)(Stimulating economic growth: This was an early focus of development aid and, although new priorities emerged later, it remains important. It’s mostly achieved through investment in infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, spending on sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and mining, and encouraging innovation and technology sharing.)\).
1.4.3.4.1.2. Pro: [Research](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/2016/06/15/does-foreign-aid-have-an-effect-on-economic-growth-new-research-adds-to-the-debate/)(The results show that a one percent increase in the aid to gross net income \(GNI\) ratio increases annual real per capita GDP growth by 0.031 percentage points.) shows that an increase in foreign aid leads to increases in a low-income country's GDP.
1.4.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/28/south-korea-development-model)(South Korea, the host of this week's fourth high-level forum on aid effectiveness, believes other countries could learn from its development experience \[...\] After the Korean war, South Korea was one of the world's poorest countries with only $64 per capita income. \[...\] South Korea, however, benefited from big injections of foreign aid, first from the US, then Japan.) largely attributes its huge [increase](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/gdp-per-capita) in GDP since the 1960s to foreign aid it received from high-income countries.
1.4.3.4.1.2.2. Con: Increases in GDP can disguise persisting and significant income inequalities, which may still cause displacement through extreme poverty.
1.4.3.4.1.3. Con: There are many [problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jan/06/pros-cons-aid-developing-economies) inherent in foreign aid that make it seldom effective in decreasing a low-income country's poverty.
1.4.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: Foreign aid has little effect on - and may even further fuel - [corrupt](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/01/why-aid-fails/)(Giving money can feed the hungry, and help the sick — but it does not free people from the institutions that make them hungry and sick in the first place. It doesn’t free them from the system which saps their opportunities and incentives. When aid is given to governments that preside over extractive institutions, it can be at best irrelevant, at worst downright counter-productive.) political and economic institutions, which perpetuate poverty and inequality in low-income countries.
1.4.3.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Aid can help [strengthen institutional structures](http://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/aid-and-corruption)(First, there is very little evidence that cutting-off aid reduces the extent of corruption in the country \(think about Zimbabwe\). \n\nSecond, rampant corruption is a symptom of widespread failure of institutions throughout the country. To reduce corruption, therefore, we need to strengthen these institutions, a process that takes a long time, and requires fairly continuous engagement by external experts. Unfortunately, when aid is cut off, so is the engagement.) which fight corruption.
1.4.3.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Some studies indicate that it is democratic political regimes, and not foreign aid, that are effective in reducing poverty in low-income countries \([p. ii](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/302942122.pdf)(In the first place, foreign aid is not effective in reducing poverty, neither in the full sample nor when we only consider the low-income countries. Secondly, political regime seems to have an important role in poverty alleviation, suggesting that a more democratic regime contributes directly to a decrease in poverty.)\).
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: In 2020, the European Commission's Budget Committee pledged increased funds of [€585 million](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200622IPR81718/meps-approve-EU585-million-to-support-refugees-from-syria) to ensure continued and better support of refugee projects in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: Even if high-income countries pledge money and resources for lower-income countries closer to refugees' home countries, there are often many [complex logistical barriers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/syrian-refugees-jordan-london-conference) to overcome in order for this money to effectively help refugees living in these countries.
1.4.3.5. Con: Addressing the refugee crisis with foreign aid is [problematic](https://theconversation.com/foreign-aid-less-about-helping-poor-countries-than-maintaining-a-power-imbalance-110136)(As the anthropologist Arturo Escobar satirically explains, the poverty of certain parts of the world appears to have been “discovered” after World War II. Then, as part of the doctrine of the then US president, Harry S. Truman, the narrative surrounding the planet’s poorest people moved to one of delivering them from their destitution.\n\nIt was as though the former colonial exploiters had suddenly discovered a moral compass, when in actual fact the post-war growth of the foreign aid industries was part of attempts to ensure imperial continuity in this post-colonial era.\n\nMore broadly, we know that governments do not purposefully give away their power and do not want to create an abundance of rival powers. Therefore, any assistance provided by aid is usually geared towards making its recipients more efficient producers within their designated world economic position.) because it primarily benefits and [empowers](https://israelrising.com/foreign-aid-form-neo-colonialism/)(Foreign aid allows western governments to impose conditions on the recipient countries in exchange for the funding, which ultimately only increases the dependency and helplessness of the recipient nation.) high-income countries by pressuring recipient countries to serve the interests of high-income countries.
1.4.3.6. Con: Populist movements in high-income countries are often [strongly opposed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/13/how-to-save-foreign-aid-in-the-age-of-populism-usaid-dfid/)(Around the world, extreme poverty has fallen, access to basic health care and education have risen, and deaths due to violence are at historic lows. Yet all is not well. Inequality within countries is rising, the number of forcibly displaced persons is at an all-time high, and climate change is exacerbating epidemics of drought, flood, migration, and disease.\n\nThese challenges require robust responses, but the political mood in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other wealthy Western countries has turned against spending on foreign aid. National interests, not global goals, seem the currency of the times. The win-win mindset inherent in U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s invocation that “a rising tide lifts all boats” is today challenged by a Trumpian zero-sum mindset that appeals to America Firsters, Brexiteers, and nationalist, xenophobic, populist parties across Europe.) to foreign aid policies, which suggests it may be difficult to pass such policies to aid refugees overseas.
1.4.3.6.1. Con: Modern debates about conservative economic policies around the world are [ongoing](https://globalnews.ca/news/7700528/erin-otoole-foreign-aid/)(Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole reversed his predecessor’s position on foreign aid spending Tuesday, saying that if elected, a Conservative government wouldn’t cut that budget.\n\nBut he said he would look to mirror previous Conservative foreign aid programs that tied funds to specific, measurable outcomes.\n\n“I want to maintain and modernize and make more accountable our development funding,” he said during a virtual event with Cooperation Canada, an umbrella organization for international development agencies.), but there are many conservative voices that [support](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-budget-foreign-aid/republicans-push-back-against-trump-plan-to-cut-foreign-aid-idUSKBN18J2DC)(Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee responsible for diplomacy and foreign aid spending, said Trump’s proposal to cut the diplomacy and aid budget by one third would “gut soft power.”\n\n“If we implemented this budget, you’d have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk,” Graham told reporters. “This budget is not going to go anywhere.”\n\nCongress sets the federal government budget, and Republicans who control both houses and Democrats have said they do not support such drastic cuts.\n\nThe funding cuts in Trump’s plan for the fiscal year beginning in October would mark a stark decrease in non-military U.S. government engagement abroad as the administration pursues Trump’s “America First” world view.) foreign aid despite the rise of populist rhetoric against it.
1.4.4. Con: The only way to achieve a long-term solution to the problem is to offer refugees permanent asylum in high-income countries.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Most plans by high-income countries to accept refugees involve [permanent resettlement](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/european-commission-seeks-resettle-50000-refugees-170927170931800.html).
1.4.4.2. Pro: Attempting to improve the situation in refugees' home countries is unlikely to be an imminently viable solution, so resettlement is the only available option.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: While Iraq formed a new government in 2020, it still [cannot](https://www.usip.org/publications/2020/08/current-situation-iraq) be considered stable: the country still suffers from significant financial pressures, political tensions, and the continued threat of ISIS.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: Syria is [still](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/insights/28041/the-syria-civil-war-might-be-ending-but-the-crisis-will-live-on)(The return to high-intensity fighting in Idlib has created yet another humanitarian crisis, sending waves of refugees toward the Turkish border and adding to the war’s already staggering humanitarian cost. \[...\] Even as the conflict winds down, it is unclear when or if they will be able to return. Once the fighting finally comes to an end, Assad will still face the challenge of rebuilding the country, including areas where he allegedly deployed chemical weapons against his own citizens.) torn by violence and a lack of resources, so Syrian refugees returning home in the near future is unlikely to be a viable option.
1.4.4.2.3. Pro: [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\(1978%E2%80%93present\)) has suffered almost [2 decades](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49192495) of conflict, and [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Civil_War) has been in a state of civil war for over 25 years.
1.4.4.2.4. Con: A country remaining destabilized after a conflict indicates that post-war resolutions were insufficient and that more time and money need to be invested in its stabilization.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.4.
1.4.5. Con: Using the existence of alternatives to justify inaction and mitigate responsibility is an example of the [bystander effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/unpacking-social-relations/202009/when-good-people-do-nothing).
1.4.5.1. Pro: Knowing or believing that there are alternatives to solving a refugee crisis [diffuses the sense of responsibility](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/diffusion-of-responsibility)(Diffusion of responsibility makes people feel less pressure to act because they believe, correctly or incorrectly, that someone else will do so. And, when we don’t feel responsible for a situation, we feel less guilty when we do nothing to help.), urgency, and guilt that would usually drive action-taking, because it is always presumed that 'someone else' will provide the solution.
1.5. Pro: Due to the particularly precarious and vulnerable position refugees are in, there is a moral obligation on high-income countries to take them in.
1.5.1. Con: It is problematic to assert that someone's apparent vulnerability alone morally obliges others to help them.
1.5.1.1. Con: The [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) is a commonly accepted moral standard and dictates that one should treat others as one would like to be treated by others. As a basic standard of justice, the fact that most people would expect help in a crisis obliges them to provide help in crisis situations.
1.5.1.2. Pro: If vulnerability morally obliges others to help someone, criminals can fake it to exploit others.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: Cases like these are [extremely rare](https://www.globalcitizen.org/fr/content/these-are-the-facts-on-refugees-and-crime/). Falsely implying that they present a substantial security risk may further fuel harmful [conspiracy theories](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/29/18037580/pittsburgh-shooter-anti-semitism-racist-jewish-caravan) surrounding refugee criminality.
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: The ex-Somali colonel [Yusuf Abdi Ali](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48359092) was able to enter and resettle in the US after his wife sought asylum there by [falsely](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/01/us/accused-war-criminal-works-at-dulles-airport/index.html)(Ali entered the U.S. on a visa through his Somali wife, Intisar Farah, who became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, she was found guilty of naturalization fraud for claiming she was a refugee from the very Somali clan that Ali is accused of torturing.) claiming to be a member of a Somali clan that Ali had previously tortured.
1.5.2. Pro: Historically, high-income countries have neglected these responsibilities by neglecting vulnerable refugees. Inhabitants of these countries, therefore, inherit [an obligation](https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/rights-refugees)(A country with a history of military involvement in the life of another country may also have special obligations. The United States recognized its special duty to receive refugees from Vietnam following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. And though U.S. military engagement in Iraq was not the sole cause of the displacement of many Iraqis, the U.S. intervention was the occasion of the huge forced migration of Iraqis that followed.) to make up for those past moral failures.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The US turned back the [St Louis](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267), a ship carrying over 900 Jewish refugees in 1939, resulting in the deaths of 254 of the refugees in the Holocaust.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Even in 1941, when reports about the Holocaust began filtering in, the US State Department [placed stricter restrictions](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005139)(During the second half of 1941, even as unconfirmed reports of the mass murder perpetrated by the Nazis filtered to the West, the US Department of State placed even stricter limits on immigration based on national security concerns.) on immigration.
1.5.2.3. Con: After the Vietnam War ended, the Ford administration [passed legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochina_Migration_and_Refugee_Assistance_Act#Opposition) to allow 130,000 refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and surrounding areas, despite [opposition](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/07/archives/ford-asks-nation-to-open-its-doors-to-the-refugees-president-in-tv.html)(President Ford, described today as “damned mad” about widespread opposition to resettlement of 130,000 Vietnamese and Cambodians in this country, appealed tonight to the nation to “welcome these people.”) from [many](https://qz.com/670921/forty-one-years-ago-the-us-took-a-big-gamble-on-vietnamese-refugees/) US-Americans.
1.5.2.4. Con: Sweden has a [long history](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/sweden-refugee-policy-sets-high-standard-2013112485613526863.html)(Sweden has a history of being refugee-friendly. It took in thousands of asylum seekers from Chile in the 1970s, from Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, from Somalia and the Balkans in the 1990s, and from Iraq once again in the 2000s.) of incredible generosity towards refugees.
1.5.2.5. Pro: According to the concept of [reparative justice](https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2019/05/08/reparations-for-historic-injustice/#_ftn1)(Most arguments for reparations are grounded in the principle of reparative justice, the idea that victims of wrongdoing or injustice are morally entitled to some form of repair.\[1\] If I wrong you, say by stealing from or physically harming you, you are entitled to my making amends for this wrong, by acknowledging it, returning the stolen property, or paying damages. The underlying idea is that past wrongs must be made right.), philosophers argue that countries can be held morally accountable for the harms that they have caused in the past.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.
1.5.3. Pro: Consigning refugees to their home countries via closing borders and sending back those who attempt to flee is equivalent to committing acts of violence against refugees.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Significant numbers of refugees would be subjected to imprisonment, torture, or starvation if they [returned](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/27/sending-refugees-back-makes-the-world-more-dangerous/) to their home region.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: The alternative for refugees is often to [return to war-torn areas](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/fear-forces-refugees-dadaab-kenya-worlds-largest-camp-return-conflict-zones-human-rights-watch-warns) where their lives are at severe risk.
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Some Afghani asylum seekers, whose applications for refugee status in safe host countries were rejected, have been [murdered](https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-asylum-seeker-we-sent-home-to-his-death-20141112-9l57.html) by the Taliban since being sent back to Afghanistan.
1.5.3.2. Con: It is problematic to frame the denial of resources as an act of violence because any allocation of state funding must come at the cost of another state-run program, meaning that some harms are unavoidable.
1.5.4. Con: High-income nations already have sizeable populations of vulnerable citizens whom they must protect and provide for. If these countries take in greater numbers of refugees, this may result in a harmful deprioritization of their most in-need citizens.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Across the 27 EU member states in 2008, nearly [116 million](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:People_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion,_EU-27_and_EU-28,_2005-2015.JPG) people were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, pushing the EU to adopt the target of lifting 20 million people from this category by 2020.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: If limited financial resources are the primary reason for denying entry to refugees, then European countries could reduce military or [administrative](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/2020-eu-budget-areas/) spending.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Military spending amounted to only [1.2% of GDP](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence)(In 2019, 'defence' expenditure amounted to 1.2 % of GDP both for the EU-27 and the euro area.) for the EU in 2019. This cannot be reduced much further if countries still want to maintain robust defense capabilities.
1.5.4.2. Pro: In the USA, there were over [half a million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/11/25/the-u-s-cities-where-the-largest-homeless-pop-infographic/#22d0d53d4dde)(Approximately 550,000 Americans were homeless at the start of this year with one out of every five of them living in New York City or Los Angeles.) homeless Americans at the start of 2016, approximately [one-third](https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/fixing-the-system/features-and-news/2596-how-many-people-with-serious-mental-illness-are-homeless) of which were suffering from severe and untreated mental health conditions.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: This is an argument for the US to focus on the redistribution of wealth to combat homelessness rather than an argument for rejecting refugees.
1.5.4.3. Pro: [1 in 4 people](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-literacy-america) in America are still illiterate when they reach adulthood, which in turn increases their risk of incarceration, impoverishment, and prematurely dropping out of formal education.
1.5.4.4. Con: While refugees and disenfranchised citizens of high-income countries are both vulnerable, the moral obligation to intervene in each case cannot be easily compared.
1.5.4.5. Con: Claiming that high-income countries can help either their citizens or refugees is a [false dilemma](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/False-Dilemma)("When only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes. False dilemmas are usually characterized by “either this or that” language, but can also be characterized by omissions of choices.") because high-income countries are often able to help both groups.
1.5.4.6. Con: There is no guarantee that high-income countries would reserve the funds reallocated from refugee programs exclusively for their in-need native populations.
1.5.5. Pro: The moral duty to [prioritize](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#Pri)(Suppose that for any person, the lower her lifetime well-being score—the amount of well-being she gains or is now expected to gain over the course of her life—the more morally valuable it would be to secure an incremental gain of well-being for her \(or to avoid a small loss\). This is the root idea of prioritarianism.) the needs of vulnerable members of society is a major cornerstone of Western liberal society.
1.5.5.1. Con: Western liberal high-income countries accepting vulnerable refugees may fuel [Western Saviourism](https://medium.com/\@anniewindholz/unpacking-white-saviorism-7d7b659dcbb3) and [cultural imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism), which are harmful overall to refugees.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: In Western Saviourist terms, the taking in of refugees by high-income countries may contribute to the imperialist erasure and disempowerment of marginalised people and their identities, as predominantly wealthy, white countries 'save' refugees by assimilating them into their culture and way of life \([p. 3](https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/86199)(Hence, the ‘white saviour’ reinforces a “psycho-existential complex” \(Fanon, 1970: 5\) of inferiority by victimising people of colour and only showcasing them as the inverted other of White civilisation \(Manji,2015\))\).
1.5.5.1.2. Con: If high-income countries adopt models of refugee resettlement that facilitate access to formal employment and education, this avoids a harmful relationship of perpetual dependency - the hallmark of Western Saviourism - and instead [empowers](https://www.cfr.org/interview/empowering-refugees-times-crisis)(Governments have traditionally managed refugee inflows by setting up camps, but this age-old strategy has run its course, says Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Centre at Oxford University. “We need a paradigm shift—one that is not based on seeing refugees just as having vulnerabilities, but one that recognizes their capacities,” he says. For instance, countries like Uganda and Jordan have expanded employment opportunities for refugees, he explains.) refugees to become self-sustaining, independent members of their host society.
1.5.5.1.3. Con: Alternative ways that high-income countries could help refugees may fuel these phenomena just as much.
1.5.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.
1.6. Pro: Due to their wealth, high-income countries have the financial ability and a special obligation to take in refugees.
1.6.1. Con: High-income countries are discharged from this obligation as they already use their wealth to help low-income countries through foreign aid, trade, and charitable donations.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In 2014, the OECD spent about [$135 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/foreign-aid-spending-2014-least-developed-countries) on foreign aid.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The amounts that high income countries spend on foreign aid are negligible, relative to what those countries could spend. In 2013, [only 5 members of the OECD](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/foreign-aid-which-countries-are-the-most-generous) were donating more than 0.7% of their GDP.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: Despite this high sum, the world's least-developed countries received [16% less](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/foreign-aid-spending-2014-least-developed-countries) in foreign aid in 2014 than in 2013, suggesting that high total foreign aid sums do not necessarily correlate to a high amount of aid given to the poorest countries.
1.6.1.2. Con: Trade is also [beneficial](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Why_do_countries_trade.html) to the high-income countries, so trading with poor countries does not really involve discharging a moral obligation to help those countries.
1.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.1.
1.6.1.4. Pro: [Australia, New Zealand, the US, and the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/08/charitable-giving-country) are high on the list of countries who give large quantities of money to charity in private donations.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: [Charitable giving](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/04/help-refugees-donations-government-political-action) by private individuals does not fulfill the national obligations that result from a history of colonial governance. These types of obligations must be fulfilled by the national government.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Australia is one of the world's [most generous](https://www.smh.com.au/national/extraordinarily-high-two-postcodes-stand-out-for-charitable-giving-20191018-p5324h.html)(Australia has just been named one of the world’s most generous nations. The World Giving Index released on Tuesday by the UK-based Charities Aid Fund ranked Australia fourth behind the US, Myanmar and New Zealand.) nations.
1.6.1.4.3. Pro: The [majority](https://www.nptuk.org/philanthropic-resources/uk-charitable-giving-statistics/) of people in the UK donate to charity.
1.6.1.4.4. Pro: US charity donations have hit a [record high](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1040) in recent years.
1.6.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.6.2.1.
1.6.1.6. Pro: The US government spends [billions](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-does-us-spend-its-foreign-aid)(According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \(CRS\), which uses the broadest definition of aid, including military and security assistance, total spending was roughly $49 billion in 2016, the last full fiscal year analyzed.) on foreign aid every year, even without including private charities and individual citizen donations.
1.6.1.6.1. Pro: As the world's wealthiest nation, the US contributes [more](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/what-every-american-should-know-about-us-foreign-aid/)(As the world’s wealthiest nation, the U.S. provides more assistance than any other country,) to foreign aid than any other country.
1.6.1.6.1.1. Con: Compared with many other nations, the US donates a [relatively small percentage](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/what-every-american-should-know-about-us-foreign-aid/)(The average for all wealthy nations is around 0.3 %. The U.S. ranks near the bottom at below 0.2 %.) of its overall wealth \(GNP\) as foreign aid.
1.6.1.6.2. Con: Foreign aid alone is [unlikely](https://cis.org/Sussis/More-Foreign-Aid-Wont-Solve-Border-Crisis)(While it is indeed true that standards of living and quality of life are higher by nearly every quantifiable metric in the United States relative to much of Latin America, and that these disparities are likely a factor driving immigration, it is unrealistic to expect that America can simply "fix" the serious structural challenges in these developing countries by increasing foreign aid.\n\nAs the past eight years indicate, there is little evidence that foreign aid does much to stem the tide of migration. While it is possible that aid has positive long-term effects, it certainly does not appear to have shown up in the data yet. In the shorter term, the United States faces the pressing challenge of a humanitarian and political crisis at the border.) to resolve the US border crisis.
1.6.1.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.
1.6.2. Con: National wealth should not be used as the main criterion for deciding which countries have the biggest obligation to take in refugees.
1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.
1.6.2.2. Con: Countries with higher incomes tend to be [safer](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/safest-countries-to-live-in-the-world-a7415221.html) than those with lower incomes. Since refugees are specifically fleeing a lack of safety in their native country, it is most logical to primarily use criteria - such as a country's wealth - that are indicators of safety.
1.6.3. Pro: High-income nations have greater [discretionary resources](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryincome.asp) than low-income ones, meaning that there would be a much fairer balance of humanitarian benefit to refugees and financial burden on hosts in a high-income nation than a low-income one.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Germany's federal government had a budget surplus of [6.2 billion euros](https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-budget-idUSB4N18L02A)(Germany’s federal government posted a budget surplus of 6.2 billion euros \($6.60 billion\) last year, helped by a strong economy and low borrowing costs, senior government sources said on Thursday, adding they wanted to use the windfall to amortize debt.\n\nIt is the third consecutive year Europe’s biggest economy has not needed net new borrowing. The 2015 federal surplus was 12.1 billion euros, said the sources.) in 2016, and entered its 3rd consecutive year of no net new borrowing.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Relative to the [size](https://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2017/2/58b001ab4/poorer-countries-host-forcibly-displaced-report-shows.html)(By comparing the number of refugees to the size of a country’s population or its economy, UNHCR’s report brings the contribution made by host nations sharply into context. For example, relative to the sizes of their populations, Lebanon and Jordan host the largest number of refugees, while in terms of economic performance the biggest burdens are carried by South Sudan and Chad.) of their respective populations and national economies, lower-income countries take on a far greater number of refugees, and thus a much greater financial burden, than high-income countries.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Germany spent [$20bn](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-refugees-spend-20-billion-euros-2016-angela-merkel-crisis-budgets-middle-east-north-africa-a7623466.html) on refugees in 2016, which only constituted around [0.58%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=DE) of its total GDP that year.
1.6.3.3. Con: Taking in refugees comes with significant financial responsibilities and burdens that make it unreasonable to place the obligation on high-income countries.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: The costs of accommodating and supporting asylum seekers in their first year of residency are estimated to be at least €10,000 per person \([p. 1](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\).
1.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: In 2015 alone, Germany spent around €17,000 on each new refugee arrival, and Sweden spent €37,000 \([p. 2](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\).
1.6.3.3.1.2. Con: In Sweden, annual spending per refugee decreases by about 70% within seven years of arrival \([p. 6](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\), indicating that the cost to high-income countries decreases significantly over time.
1.6.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.2.
1.6.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.6.3.3.4. Con: In many high-income countries, there is public support for spending on foreign aid. This suggests the populations of these nations feel the benefits of spending outweigh the drawbacks.
1.6.3.3.4.1. Pro: In 2005, nearly all member-states of the EU accepted the United Nations target of spending 0.7% of GDP on foreign aid by 2015. [They](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/04/uk-among-six-countries-hit-un-aid-spending-target-oecd) had not yet reached this target upon agreeing to it, implying that there was general governmental support to increase foreign financial aid.
1.6.3.3.4.1.1. Con: Many Britons want to [scrap](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/11/25/two-thirds-britons-support-cutting-foreign-aid-bud) Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7% of its GDP on foreign aid.
1.6.3.3.4.2. Pro: In an international poll, the large majority of citizens in the UK, France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland said they supported [at least some](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2013/11/09/British-amongst-least-generous-overseas-aid) foreign aid spending.
1.6.3.3.4.2.1. Con: The majority of these same poll respondents think the amount their nation spends on foreign aid should be [decreased](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2013/11/09/British-amongst-least-generous-overseas-aid).
1.6.4. Con: If a high-income country were to take in sufficiently large numbers of refugees to meet the international need, the extent to which it could provide for each refugee would be greatly reduced. This would be counter-productive to the cause.
1.6.4.1. Con: While this is hypothetically true, it depends on the assumption that no other high-income countries would contribute any aid or accept any refugees.
1.6.4.2. Pro: All countries, including high-income nations, have a [carrying capacity](https://iefworld.org/spcapacity.htm)(Carrying capacity refers to how many organisms can live sustainably in a particular environment without destroying its resources. Many things can be limiting factors, such as food or water supply, amount of shelter, capacity to absorb wastes, or predation, and different factors can be the limit that determines carrying capacity at different times and places.\n\n\n\nThere are already signs that we are exceeding the carrying capacity of many parts of the planet. Some of the worst humanitarian crises since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, in countries like Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia, share as underlying causes, behind obvious political and ethnic divisions, a high and rapidly increasing density of population, extreme poverty, and a shortage of essential environmental resources, in particular a drop in per capita food production.) of how many individuals they can comfortably sustain with the resources they have. In accepting larger numbers of refugees, high-income nations risk nearing or breaching this capacity, thus reducing the availability of per capita resources for all inhabitants, refugees included.
