Discussion Name: Should Colleges Have Safe Spaces?

1. Colleges should not have safe spaces.
1.1. Pro: Safe spaces often exclude particular demographics.
1.1.1. Pro: Many safe spaces are [women only spaces.](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/kate-milner/creating-safe-spaces-for-_b_12076304.html)
1.1.2. Con: This is precisely the point of many safe spaces: in order to feel safe for the user, it must practise protective exclusion and only accommodate people who belong to a certain demographic.
1.2. Pro: It is practically impossible to create any kind of public space that is truly safe; to set up and brand such a space as wholly 'safe' would thus be irresponsible.
1.2.1. Pro: Even if an environment is labelled as a safe space, this does not guarantee tolerance and non-judgement.
1.2.1.1. Pro: If I entered a safe space and outlined plans to partake in something that was considered to be in the moral 'grey area', it is unlikely that this will be met by tolerance and non-judgement.
1.2.2. Pro: If vulnerable individuals enter so-called 'safe spaces' with expectations of complete safety and these are not met, this may cause more psychological harm and trauma than if they had entered a space with expectations of feeling unsafe.
1.2.3. Con: Some [organisations](http://bluestockings.com/about/safer-space/) have navigated this issue by branding their designated safe spaces as 'safer' spaces, ensuring that such spaces are still strived for while managing the expectations surrounding them.
1.2.4. Pro: There are countless instances throughout recent history in which supposedly safe spaces have been violated with relative ease.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The [deadliest](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/12/11911616/pulse-gay-nightclub-shooting-in-orlando-what-we-know) mass shooting in American history was carried out in 2016 at Pulse, a Florida nightclub intended to be a safe space for LGBTQ+ and Latinx people at the time of the massacre.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The 2015 [Charleston Church Shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_church_shooting) was a mass shooting in which 9 African Americans were killed by a White Supremacist attending a Bible study at one of the oldest Black Churches in the US.
1.3. Con: Safe spaces are highly [beneficial](https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/creating-safe-spaces/) for the wellbeing and success of vulnerable and marginalised individuals.
1.3.1. Pro: Safe spaces [help those](https://resilienteducator.com/classroom-resources/creating-safe-spaces/) who have no resources at home.
1.3.2. Pro: Safe spaces are important for students' mental health.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Many college students suffer from anxiety. Safe spaces can help them feel [supported and protected](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/safe-spaces-college#3) from having to explain themselves.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Protecting students' mental health is particularly important at this time, as America is going through a [mental health crisis](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heading-toward-suicide-crisis-in-america#2).
1.3.2.3. Pro: Trigger warnings can [provide support](https://time.com/4471806/trigger-warnings-safe-spaces/) to students who are victims of violence and suffer from PTSD.
1.3.2.4. Con: Safe spaces could make students [acquire the fears of others](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/). This could have negative impacts on their mental health.
1.3.2.5. Con: Students should be encouraged to [deal with their trauma](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) instead of silencing views that could trigger it. That would be more beneficial for their mental health.
1.3.3. Pro: Safe spaces lead to academic improvement in groups that otherwise face adversity in institutionalised environments.
1.3.3.1. Pro: "Belonging uncertainty" [undermines](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-23056-007) the motivation and thus achievement of groups that are stigmatised in academic settings and elsewhere. For these groups, interventions such as the introduction of safe spaces that mitigate doubts about social belonging in school are likely to raise their academic achievement.
1.3.4. Pro: Safe spaces allow marginalised groups to discuss their lived experiences and trauma in a place that has clearly outlined policies of tolerance and non-judgement. In a world where the safety of marginalised groups is often compromised, this is vital for their wellbeing.
1.3.4.1. Con: Trauma should be processed with the guidance of a mental health professional, not in a public space.
1.4. Pro: Safe spaces send a problematic message to young people about what they can realistically expect in the way of support once they leave instutionalised education.
1.4.1. Pro: Safe spaces convey the idea to young people that they can simply avoid, escape, or put off solving their life's problems; while this can happen in school, it is not realistic in adulthood.
1.4.2. Con: The solution to this is not to cancel safe spaces, but rather to change the narratives surrounding them.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If safe spaces are marketed as spaces to develop and grow so as to be able to better face the harsh realities that await, rather than to escape, ignore or delay them, this will allow for such places to exist for both short and long-term wellbeing.
1.4.3. Pro: Safe spaces are a way of accommodating and pandering to young people's emotional needs, which can develop an unhealthy sense of entitlement to such treatment throughout life.
1.5. Con: Everyone has the right to a safe space.
1.5.1. Pro: In the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.themeister.co.uk/economics/udhr.htm), Article 3 asserts that 'everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person'. The right to security is the right to a safe space.
1.5.2. Con: People need safe spaces to be protected from offensive speech. Granting people the [right not be offended is difficult in a democracy](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-moses-right-not-to-be-offended-ipso-freedom-of-speech-a9260741.html). Therefore, it would be equally difficult to grant this right to people in spaces designed for vigorous intellectual discourse.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Judgment about what is [offensive is subjective](https://culturalanalysis.net/2018/01/19/why-we-cannot-have-right-not-to-be-offended/) and, therefore, should not be the basis of banning expression.
1.6. Con: Colleges have a duty to provide their students with safe spaces.
1.6.1. Con: Safe spaces are therapeutic spaces whereas colleges are intellectual spaces. Since they are incompatible by nature, colleges do not have a responsibility to prove students with safe spaces.
1.6.1.1. Pro: For students to expand their knowledge and gain different perspectives, it is important they engage with ideas and views that are different from their own.
1.6.2. Pro: Universities in the US are required by [two civil-rights statutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html?_r=0), Title VII and Title IX, to ensure that their campuses don’t create a “hostile environment” for groups subject to harassment.
1.6.3. Pro: Institutions have a duty to prevent or remediate all harm to students within their walls. Since emotional injury is now regarded as [equivalent](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8706323/college-professor-afraid) to material injury, providing safe spaces is a natural prerequisite of this duty.
1.7. Pro: Safe spaces may be incompatible with freedom of thought and expression.
1.7.1. Pro: Discussion is possible and fruitful when [there is room to tolerate disagreement](https://culturalanalysis.net/2018/01/19/why-we-cannot-have-right-not-to-be-offended/). If certain disagreements, which are deemed to be offensive, are muted, it limits the scope of discussions.
1.7.2. Pro: Many have voiced that safe spaces can be a direct [threat](https://theconversation.com/why-safe-spaces-at-universities-are-a-threat-to-free-speech-94547) to free speech.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The Dean of the University of Chicago wrote a letter to all incoming students reaffirming the university's commitment to free speech via the [renunciation](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/2016/08/24/university-to-freshmen-dont-expect-safe-spaces-or-trigger-warnings/) of "intellectual ‘safe spaces’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own".
1.7.2.2. Pro: A UK parliamentary inquiry found that university safe-space policies are used by some to try to [prevent](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/27/safe-spaces-used-to-inhibit-free-speech-on-campuses-inquiry-finds) the free speech of others whose views they disagree with.
1.7.2.3. Pro: During a 2016 speech at Howard University's commencement ceremony, former US president Barack Obama [warned](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obamas-howard-commencement-transcript-222931) students against 'shut\[ting\] folks out \[...\] no matter how much you might disagree with them', citing 'a trend around the country' of cancelling those with 'a different point of view'; some have interpreted this as an implicit [rejection](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/09/15/obama-criticizes-coddled-progressives-campus-call-culture/) of the college safe-space culture due to its curtailing of free speech.
1.7.2.4. Pro: There are numerous examples of universities who have cancelled controversial debates or other events and disinvited commencement speakers due to pressure from the student population with regards to safe spaces.
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: Oxford's Christ Church college censors [cancelled](https://cherwell.org/2014/11/17/christ-church-refuses-to-hold-quotabortion-culturequot-debate/) a debate on abortion that would have been led by two men, citing "potential security and welfare issues" as the reason.
1.7.2.5. Con: On the contrary, many of those who use safe spaces are those denied a voice by society; safe spaces allow them a place in which they can express themselves freely without fear.
1.7.2.6. Con: The right to free speech should not safeguard that which inflicts emotional injury through racist, sexist or other stigmatisation; disallowing safe spaces on free speech grounds may do just this.
1.7.2.7. Con: There is nothing inherent about safe spaces that means they disallow free speech from occurring elsewhere in the institutions they are built in. Free speech and safe spaces are not mutually exclusive.
1.7.3. Pro: Safe spaces can encourage problematic [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) and the creation of ideological echo chambers.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Survey data shows that negative feelings between Republicans and Democrats have grown steadily stronger since the 1970s; some political scientists fear that college safe space policies [fuel](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) this increasing hostility toward ideological opponents in their encouragement of totally separated groups.
