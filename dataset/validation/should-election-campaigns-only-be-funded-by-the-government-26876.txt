Discussion Name: Should Election Campaigns only be Funded by the Government?

1. Election campaigns should only be funded by the government.
1.1. Con: State-funded election campaigns increase the burden on the taxpayer.
1.1.1. Pro: As governments have limited budgets, they will have to reallocate funding from other projects towards campaign financing.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In the US, money is likely to be diverted from [welfare programs](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/10/17221292/trump-welfare-executive-order-work-requirements) to fund election campaigns.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is immoral to divert money that is aimed to benefit the poor towards the benefit of the rich.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Considerable sources of public funding [earmarked](https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/understanding-ways-support-federal-candidates/presidential-elections/public-funding-presidential-elections/) for campaign spending in the biggest election races already exist, reducing the possibility of substantial cuts to welfare.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The diversion of public funds towards funding election campaigns in Washington DC [has led to concerns from Mayor Muriel Bowser](https://www.salon.com/2018/02/20/could-public-funding-of-elections-revolutionize-politics/) that there will be less money for the pressing needs of residents.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: Partial public funding systems for election campaigns [already exist](https://www.salon.com/2018/02/20/could-public-funding-of-elections-revolutionize-politics/) for state legislatures across the United States. Since significant public funding of campaigns in the status quo hasn't led to widespread cuts in welfare funding, an extension towards full public funding is less likely to be a significant compromise on welfare funding as well.
1.1.2. Pro: Governments will have to increase taxes to raise sufficient revenue for such a fund.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The spending power of people is likely to go down, decreasing their ability to purchase essential goods and services.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is misleading given the current distribution of wealth. The spending power of most people would likely stay the same or go up, as they would have access to services and laws that were tailored to their interests, rather than to those of private special interest groups.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Higher corporate tax would increase business costs leading to undesirable social outcomes.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: If a higher corporate tax was to be enacted, many businesses would likely [discontinue their operations](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/higher-tax-rates-influence-business-decisions-69966.html), leaving their workers unemployed.
1.1.2.3. Con: Governments could restructure their finances rather than increase taxation.
1.1.3. Con: Progressive taxation systems are likely to significantly reduce the burden on those least able to contribute towards such a fund.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Progressive tax systems would [benefit](https://www.thebalance.com/progressive-tax-definition-examples-4155741) the economy and thus are likely to be adopted.
1.1.4. Con: Introducing publicly-funded elections does not need to cost that much relative to government budgets.
1.1.4.1. Pro: A 2007 analysis suggested that implementing a public financing scheme for US congressional elections would cost less than a billion dollars a year, when the federal budget was two trillion dollars. Such a scheme, therefore, would only cost [0.05% of the federal budget](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33814.html) and less than $10 a year per-taxpayer.
1.1.4.2. Pro: In [Norway](https://www.statsbudsjettet.no/Upload/Statsbudsjett_2017/dokumenter/pdf/R-0650%20E_Budget%202017.pdf), publicly funding two thirds of political party spending only cost around 0.0004 % of the budget in 2017.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Norway's campaign finance laws are radical and should be considered an [outlier](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/index.html).
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Norway bans running [political ads](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/index.html) on the radio and television, which significantly reduces expenditure.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Norway generally spends less on [elections](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/index.html) than other democratic states like the UK and the US.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: In 2017, 67.2% of political party funding in [Norway](https://www.ssb.no/en/partifin) came from the government, which amounted to 500 million NOK of the state's 1,301,806 million NOK. budget.
1.1.5. Pro: The public funding of political parties is morally wrong, as it forces people to fund causes that they may find outrageous.
1.1.5.1. Con: Many causes now seen as ethical have historically faced public outrage \(e.g. women's suffrage, civil rights movement, marriage equality\).
1.1.5.2. Pro: Many LGBTQ+ people may be uncomfortable with their taxes being used to fund political parties which advocate for anti-LGBTQ+ policies, for example.
1.1.5.3. Con: Taxpayers fund things they don't agree with all the time.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Conservative taxpayers cannot stop their money from used to fund the welfare functions of their state.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Pro-secularism taxpayers in countries with religious governments do not have any choice in controlling the flow of their money towards strictly secular state enterprises.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Vegans and vegetarians might be forced to see their money go towards policies which subsidize ranching and the meat industry at large.
1.1.5.5. Pro: Advocates of welfare states may find their money being used to fund small government parties who intend to strip back the functions of the state.
1.2. Con: The public funding of elections further polarises politics by facilitating the rise of parties which are fundamentally opposed to each other and cannot find grounds for compromise.
1.2.1. Pro: Public funding of elections for state legislatures in the United States [pushed candidates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/15/how-public-funding-of-elections-makes-politics-even-more-polarized/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d0b5ac910957) from both parties further away from the centre, making them less likely to be able to compromise with one another.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Research shows that the partial public funding of elections [increases political polarisation](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/58893/1/__lse.ac.uk_storage_LIBRARY_Secondary_libfile_shared_repository_Content_American%20Politics%20and%20Policy_2014_May_blogs.lse.ac.uk-Public_funding_of_elections_increases_candidate_polarization_by_reducing_the_influence_of_moderate_do.pdf) by reducing the influence of interest groups which tend to be more moderate than individuals in the way that they donate.
1.2.1.2. Con: Subsequent research has found that [there is no impact](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/22/is-public-funding-really-electing-extremists/?utm_term=.3516251d6e59) of public funding on political polarisation of state legislatures.
1.2.2. Con: Small donors tend to be [highly partisan, and private donations sourced from them](http://bostonreview.net/bonica-small-donors-polarization) often go towards the most ideologically polarising candidates, further contributing towards polarisation of politics.
1.2.2.1. Con: The contribution to polarization from small donors is overstated. It is likely that the moderate majority of voters simply do not make donations, meaning the number of these donors is relatively low and likely inconsequential.
1.2.3. Con: Public funding should be made available to all parties and candidates in equal measure. This will give an equal platform to moderate as well as extreme voices.
1.2.3.1. Con: Private donations tend to have a [moderating effect](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/04/24/how-wealthy-campaign-donors-may-reduce-political-polarization-and-weaken-the-tea-party/) on the political playing field, thus balancing out the influence more extreme parties and candidates have.
1.2.4. Con: The amount of money governments provide candidates to spend on elections will be considerably less than what they could raise privately. This reduction in available money will force candidates to focus more on raising awareness of their policies rather than spend money on attack ads.
1.2.4.1. Pro: For any electoral campaign to work, essential functions such as paying staffers and administrative costs need to be fulfilled. Since candidates for office will now have less money to spend on their campaigns, and some of it will go towards fulfilling these essential functions, there will be less money to spend on political advertisements and attack ads.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Advertising has been the [biggest component](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) of election spending in US Congressional Elections; a reduced budget due to public funding of elections would reduce the amount spent on adverts with a greater proportion of funding allocated towards discussing policy issues.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Given that advertising is actually of [little use](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) when it comes to winning elections, it is likely that politicians will first reduce this part of their electoral campaign budget.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Political advertising is important in raising levels of voter turnout.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: In research conducted on the 2008 US Presidential election, younger voters reported that watching political ads ["made them feel more confident that they possessed the information and knowledge necessary to participate in the political system."](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002764211398071)
1.2.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: In the [2016 US Presidential election](https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/facebook_political_advertising/), directed Facebook ads increased voter turnout by up to 10% for targeted Republicans.
1.2.4.2.1.1.3. Pro: Political advertising increases engagement with voters in rural areas. \([Hogan, p.853](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264486715_Campaign_Spending_and_Voter_Participation_in_State_Legislative_Elections)\)
1.2.4.2.1.1.4. Con: There is [growing evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/campaigns-direct-mail-zero-effect/541485/) that suggests that political advertising has little to no effect on voter turnout.
1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: [Research](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/24/facebook_political_ads/) on the 2016 US Presidential elections found that Facebook ads had a significant effect in persuading certain undecided voters to vote for Donald Trump.
1.2.4.2.1.3. Pro: Given the highly [partisan](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/05/takeaways-on-americans-growing-partisan-divide-over-political-values/) political environment, people are less likely to vote for someone on the basis of simply liking their ad.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1. Con: Many voters don't identify strongly with any one political party, and so can be convinced by political advertisements.
1.2.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Undecided voters swung the [US elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/upshot/undecided-voters-2018-midterms.html) in favor of Trump in 2016.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Presidential candidates in the US spend billions of dollars on their campaigns.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: In the 2016 US Presidential and Congressional Elections, over $6.5 billion dollars were [raised in campaign funding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/14/somebody-just-put-a-price-tag-on-the-2016-election-its-a-doozy/).
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: In the US 2012 Presidential Election, both candidates raised over half a billion dollars, spending the [majority of the funding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2012/09/26/how-the-presidential-campaigns-are-spending-money-in-one-chart/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.df07ff9fc1ed) on advertising.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: In 2012, ads made up more than 70% of President Obama’s [campaign expenses](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) and 55% of Mitt Romney’s.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Presidential Campaigns in the US are outliers compared to the vast majority of elections.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: There is a culture of campaigning for the US Presidential Elections which begins [around two years](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/opinion/campaign-stops/yes-it-does-feel-like-this-election-is-never-ending.html) before the actual election.
1.2.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Since 1872, the longest federal election campaign in Canada lased for [78 days](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/two-down-76-to-go-the-longest-election-campaign-since-we-first-re-elected-john-a).
1.2.4.3.3.2. Pro: The United States is one of the most populous and largest countries in the world; reaching out to voters across the country requires significant expenditure.
1.2.4.3.3.3. Pro: In Britain, each party is limited to spending [$29.5 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/world/europe/britains-campaign-finance-laws-leave-parties-with-idle-money.html?_r=3&gwh=F08CD65FAF54160E590CC078F49B323A&gwt=pay) in the year before the election.
1.2.4.3.3.4. Pro: In Germany, political parties release just [one 90-second television ad](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/germany-elections-one-tv-ad-per-candidate-096770).
1.2.4.4. Con: Negative political advertising is [more effective](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180604124913.htm) than positive political advertising. Therefore, if candidates have less money to spend, then they will likely focus more on negative advertising.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: In the 2012 US Presidential election campaign [only 14.3%](http://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-51) of political ads aired were classified as positive.
1.2.5. Con: A [study](https://430327f0-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/millerpolsci/docs/extremismweb.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7co0crxBuDm32g0ypPMzeDb67T9Y4t-ueNPFhzVnHOEBbImoJYBfXfYx7M704zCG6bAYrgMPlsrmCR5DzXikzPBJW4LlIhG504mNy3zpbqmGH2CSM4ZOXgIDHl6ToWVOgor1CzuVXpNmiUIqoZ68X6yxk4627kOWJiBcXyrjVYfkQl5XxR47NIvN8KDoy7plpLCSOWpwl39sp_kX4WhMfidipAf_zZME5lqvHgdYXXLK_1gZtFk%3D&attredirects=0) of public funding in Arizona and Maine found that legislators who are fully publicly funded are no more ideologically extreme than their colleagues.
1.2.6. Pro: Corporations and industry groups are [more likely to donate to the ideological center](http://bostonreview.net/bonica-small-donors-polarization), leading to a politics which is more accepting of compromise and negotiation.
1.2.6.1. Con: This is misleading because the political "center" moved to the [right](http://bostonreview.net/politics/lawrence-glickman-ronald-reagan-edmund-muskie-here-from-government) around the time of the Reagan Administration.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Moderate Democratic politicians are more modest about their ability to use public policy to help at risk populations like the urban poor, than they were during the New Deal.
1.3. Con: Citizens have the right to donate to the election campaigns of political parties, which they are deprived of if only governments fund election campaigns.
1.3.1. Pro: The right to freedom of association allows for freely expressing allegiance with any religious, social, or political ideology. Banning donations restricts the extent to which supporters can associate with parties they find common ground with.
1.3.1.1. Con: There are already [caps on campaign contributions](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Donating to a charity or religious institution is akin to donating to a political party.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Politics is competitive, whereas charities and religions are not. Donating to a political party negatively affected competing political parties by making them less likely to win the election. Thus, charities are not analogous to political parties in an important way.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Donating money to both allows them to expand their influence.
1.3.1.3. Con: Governments can restrict the freedom of association when such association results in harmful consequences.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Many governments](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/queen-nazi-salute-countries-where-gesture-is-illegal-10401630.html) limit people's ability to associate with Nazi symbols since this support leads to undesirable consequences.
1.3.1.4. Con: People can exercise their right to association with these parties by voting for them.
1.3.2. Pro: Donating to a campaign is a form of speech which expresses someone's support for that party and its policies. This speech should therefore be protected by the government.
1.3.2.1. Con: Donations are not the same as free speech.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: There is no meaningful distinction between handing out leaflets supporting a political party and paying for those leaflets to be handed out.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: There is a meaningful distinction between the costs associated with volunteering to distribute leaflets and paying to have leaflets printed and distributed. Without money one could accomplish the former and not the latter.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Donations allow a person to publicly express their views. Speech should not be limited to what a person can achieve just through their own personal interactions.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Donations directly express support for political parties' ideological and policy positions.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: If any action that supports a political party is protected as speech, this degrades the meaning of speech and forces the government to protect a range of activities.
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: Freedom of speech should be accorded equally to people. People who spend more money should not have a greater right to freedom of speech.
1.3.2.2. Con: The government is justified in limiting speech when it violates other rights. Campaign donations only give free speech to those with money and drown out the speech of the everyday person.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: In the United States, only a [tiny fraction](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/donordemographics.php) of Americans actually give campaign contributions to political candidates, parties, or PACs.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Only 0.47% of those who donate provide [substantial contributions](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/donordemographics.php) of over $200; overall these make up 70% of all donations.
1.3.2.3. Pro: By granting an exception to individuals, governments could protect free speech while preventing larger entities or organizations to influence politics.
1.3.3. Con: This right is not expressly stated in any constitutions or codes of law.
1.3.3.1. Pro: This right is not present in the US Constitution, and is therefore not meaningfully a right.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: In Citizens United, the Supreme Court held that the free speech clause of the US Constitution's First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations.
1.4. Pro: When corporations and wealthy elites are no longer allowed to donate to election campaigns, politicians will not be beholden to their interests.
1.4.1. Con: Notwithstanding political donations, the strong historic link between the economic and political elite will continue to exist.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Privileged people tend to run in social circles that include [other privileged people](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/jun/27/people-like-us-why-narrowing-social-circles-create-more-unequal-world). More privileged political candidates, therefore, have more connections to people with the resources to make larger donations to their campaigns.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Eton, an exclusive all-boys schools based in the UK is [renowned for producing political leaders.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8622933.stm)
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: 19 former Etonians have gone on to become [Prime Minister](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8622933.stm) of the United Kingdom.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Three-quarters of Britain's Prime Ministers have attended [Oxford or Cambridge](https://qz.com/811121/three-quarters-of-britains-prime-ministers-went-to-oxford-or-cambridge-but-mostly-oxford/).
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Oxford and Cambridge are both exclusive universities that accept [17.5%](https://www.crimsoneducation.org/za/admission-support/oxford-university) and [21%](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics) of applicants respectively, while more than [60% of Oxford's students come from elite private schools](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxford-university-cambridge-state-school-socially-inclusive-ethnicity-sunday-times-guide-david-lammy-a8551036.html).
1.4.1.2. Con: It does not matter if a link between the economic and political elite will continue to exist. If that link is strengthened by political donations then that is a sufficient reason to ban them.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Even without campaign donations, corporations and wealthy individuals can pay [lobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying#Lobbying_by_country) to influence politicians on particular issues.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Corporations in the US donate money to think tanks, academic research, op-eds, and panel discussions to ["shape the intellectual environment of Washington."](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-corporations-turned-into-political-beasts-2015-4?r=US&IR=T)
1.4.1.5. Pro: The [revolving door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_\(politics\)) between money and politics is well established and is unlikely to change with the reform of campaign financing.
1.4.2. Pro: This would make politicians more accountable to the electorate and benefit the public.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If politicians were seen to be interested in benefitting the public, [political interest and engagement would increase](https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/how-to-encourage-better-and-more-meaningful-political-participation-in-the-us/) amongst people.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: People are more interested in politics when they see that their involvement has [tangible results.](https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/how-to-encourage-better-and-more-meaningful-political-participation-in-the-us/)
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Political engagement is [important](https://rightforeducation.org/2017/10/political-participation/) because it holds the government accountable as people are made aware of the actions of their politicians.
1.4.2.2. Con: Politicians would likely not become more accountable to the public because there are long-standing policies and practices in place that preserve the power of elected and appointed officials.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: People rarely vote or participate in the political process in part because of the policies and traditions of voter suppression and disenfranchisement.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Voter disenfranchisement and suppression would likely be outlawed or phased out in a system with more moderate elected officials.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Voter turnout is low in the [USA](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/10/voter-turnout-disenfranchisement-suppression-alexander-keyssar) because of a history of active voter suppression on the part of the government.
1.4.3. Pro: Corporations fund election campaigns because their donations buy them political access and favorable consideration in policy development and legislation.
1.4.3.1. Con: Corporations may donate significantly to political campaigns due to other factors such as [pre-existing personal relationships](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/do-corporate-campaign-contributions-buy-influence) or a shared political ideology.
1.4.3.2. Con: If a company has donated to a candidate that ends up winning the election, there is a [minimal effect](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/do-corporate-campaign-contributions-buy-influence), if any, on its stock price. This indicates that the shareholders themselves do not predict a return on the political donation, otherwise they would have put more money into the company.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: The minimal effect of a 0.05 percent bump in stock price amounts to [$500,000](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/do-corporate-campaign-contributions-buy-influence) for the company. The median firm spends only $3,750 on campaign donations in a given election cycle. Therefore, this investment is still profitable.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Corporate and wealthy entities punish political parties who pursue public interest when it is opposed to corporate interests by shifting their financial support.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Surveys showed that a large majority \([70-75%](https://www.smh.com.au/national/gambling-limits-popular-survey-says-20110728-1i26q.html)\) of Australian voters supported poker machine reform in Australia. As soon as Labor started talking seriously about reform, the donations from the gaming lobby began to [dramatically favor](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political-donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise) the opposing Liberal party.
1.4.3.4. Pro: [Corporate donations influence a party's agenda](http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=4060) and cause politicians to take actions such as keeping certain bills out of debate, adding [earmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_\(politics\)) or changing key language in legislation.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Corporate donors often hedge their bets by donating to multiple major parties in an attempt to influence the eventual winner. This tilts policy-making in favour of corporations across the political spectrum.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: In the lead up to the 2013 federal elections in Australia, many companies gave money to [both sides](https://reconstructingeconomics.com/2015/01/22/political-donations-and-the-destruction-of-democratic-scrutiny/) of the political divide.
1.4.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Inghams gave the opposing Labor and Liberal parties each $250,000, Westfield gave them each $150,000 and ANZ gave them each $80,000.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Pro: Both the [Democratic and Republican Party](https://www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2018/11/01/the-party-for-oil-and-gas/#6fb012ed2f7f) have favoured the interests of the oil and gas sectors during their administrations.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: The US political system can be characterized as an oligarchy, in part due to the effect of private money in politics [\(Winters and Page, pp. 742-743\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231898807_Oligarchy_in_the_United_States).
1.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: Economic elites and corporate interest groups have substantial influence on US government policy [\(Gilens and Page, p. 1\)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf).
1.4.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: Tax rates have changed in favour of the wealthy since money started to have a bigger influence on politics. In 1960, the top marginal tax rate was [91%](https://taxfoundation.org/some-historical-tax-stats/), while today it is [39.6%](https://www.irs.com/articles/2017-federal-tax-rates-personal-exemptions-and-standard-deductions).
1.4.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: The changing of economic distributions is evidence of the rich's growing influence on policy through the use of campaign finance contributions. Since 1980, the wealthiest 1% of households have seen their [incomes rise](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/inequality/winner-take-all-politics-public-policy-political-organization-top-incomes/) 2.3 times, the top 0.1% of household a rise of more than 4 times, and the top 0.01% of households a rise of more than 6 times.
1.4.3.4.2.1.3. Pro: Between 1998 and 2017, the amount of money spent on lobbying in the US has [more than doubled](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/).
1.4.3.4.2.1.4. Pro: In 2017, Republican Representative Chris Collins [admitted](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/359110-gop-lawmaker-donors-are-pushing-me-to-get-tax-reform-done) that donors had placed pressure on him to protect tax provisions favorable to their interests.
1.4.3.4.2.1.5. Con: Elected officials have a [greater impact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2019/10/24/why-we-should-blame-elected-officials-not-interest-groups-for-spiraling-state-government-spending-and-debts/) on US governmental policy than special interest groups.
1.4.3.4.2.2. Pro: Regular citizens and mass-based interest groups have little to no influence on government policy [\(Gilens and Page, p. 564\)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf).
1.4.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Even if average citizens have little influence compared to wealthy citizens, Gilens and Page's data set shows that the views of wealthy citizens highly correlate with those of the average citizens [\(Bashir, 1\)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015608896).
1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The top 1% of US wealth-holders are "much more conservative" than the wider American public regarding policies concerning taxation, economic regulation, and social welfare programs [\(Page et al, p. 51\)](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf).
1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Within this group, the top one-tenth of the one percent tend to hold even more conservative views on these issues [\(Page et al. p. 51\)](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf).
1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1.2. Con: There are billionaires that support views that are more liberal than the American public.
1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: "Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, \[and\] Bill Gates have all taken [left-of-center](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/billionaire-stealth-politics-america-100-richest-what-they-want) stands on various issues, and Buffett and Gates are paragons of philanthropy."
1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: The former New York mayor [Michael Bloomberg](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/billionaire-stealth-politics-america-100-richest-what-they-want) is seeking the democratic nomination for President of the United States. He advocates for gun control, gay rights, and environmental protection.
1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1.2.3. Con: While there are left-leaning billionaires in US politics, there are much more silent conservative donors that directly fund [radical views](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/billionaire-stealth-politics-america-100-richest-what-they-want) without adopting them publicly.
1.4.3.4.2.2.2. Pro: Polling shows that the majority of Americans [support greater government activism](https://prospect.org/article/most-americans-are-liberal-even-if-they-don%E2%80%99t-know-it) to address widening inequality, the political influence of big business, declining living standards, climate change and health care. However, government policy in recent times has not reflected this.
1.4.3.4.2.2.3. Pro: Congress has a very faulty understanding of what policies Americans support. The senior staffers who are critical in helping members of Congress decide which policies to support have ["wildly inaccurate"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/congress-midterms-public-opinion.html#click=https://t.co/qWBRu7C5hw) perceptions of their constituents’ opinions and preferences.
1.4.3.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: [92%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/congress-midterms-public-opinion.html#click=https://t.co/qWBRu7C5hw) of Congressional staffers surveyed underestimated the support in their district or state for background checks.
1.4.3.4.2.3. Con: The characterization of the US political system as an oligarchy is an exaggeration. If the American people wanted to get revised voting or campaign finance laws, they could vote for politicians who seek to change them.
1.4.3.4.3. Pro: This allows corporations to suppress small parties that try to break the silence on policy issues that elites have purchased.
1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: In Australia, the [Greens](https://blogs.utas.edu.au/isc/2018/01/08/political-obstacles-to-poker-machine-reform/) are strong advocates of poker machine reform so donations that advantage the major parties over the Greens are worth making for those who want this issue out of the spotlight.
1.4.3.4.3.2. Con: In many democracies like the United States and the United Kingdom, at least one major political party \(the Democrats in the USA and the Labour Party in the UK\) espouses an anti-elite platform that promotes the interests of the working class.
1.4.3.4.4. Pro: [A study](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/FiftyShadesofGreen_0517.pdf) \(pg 3\) conducted in the U.S. showed a clear link between donations from the financial sector and the odds that Democratic representatives would vote against reform to financial regulations.
1.4.3.4.5. Con: Corporations have a right to influence politicians in order to prevent their interests from being ignored in favor of the interests of individuals or political organizations.
1.4.3.4.5.1. Con: The majority of lobbying money comes from corporations: for every dollar spent on lobbying by labor unions and public-interest groups, large corporations spend [$34](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/how-corporate-lobbyists-conquered-american-democracy/390822/).
1.4.3.5. Pro: The [top 20 recipients of donations from the oil and gas sector](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++) have all voted or spoken against regulating the fossil fuel industry.
1.4.4. Con: It is not necessary to ban private donations. Legislation can be used to reduce the likelihood of corporate influence.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Governments can place limits on the amount that an individual can donate to a candidate or a party. This reduces the ability of a select few individuals to have a disproportionate influence over politicians [\(International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, p. 19\)](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/political-finance-regulations-around-the-world.pdf).
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: In Belgium, individuals are only permitted to donate €500 to a single party. [\(European Parliament AFCO Committee Report pg 32\)](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/519217/IPOL_STU\(2015\)519217_EN.pdf).
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: In Finland, a donation to a political party must not be more than €30,000. [\(European Parliament AFCO Committee Report pg 32\).](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/519217/IPOL_STU\(2015\)519217_EN.pdf)
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: In Poland, total contributions by an individual to a political party may not exceed 15 times the monthly minimum wage. [\(European Parliament AFCO Committee Report pg 30\).](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/519217/IPOL_STU\(2015\)519217_EN.pdf)
1.4.4.2. Pro: Governments can implement laws which limit how much a political party can spend during an election campaign or annually. This reduces the impact and importance of donations for politicians. [\(International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance pg 35 - 37\)](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/political-finance-regulations-around-the-world.pdf)
1.4.4.2.1. Con: These laws are often hard to implement and have loopholes that can be easily exploited.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: For example, the creation of [Super PACs](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-super-pac-3367928) has allowed candidates and parties to circumvent restrictions on spending and donations.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Laws which require [disclosure of campaign finance](https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/municipal_campaign_finance/) contributions can discourage politicians from acting solely in the interests of corporations.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Even where these laws exist, politicians often fail to meet their disclosure obligations.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: In 2018, all three of Australia's major political parties [were found](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/26/major-parties-failed-to-declare-corporate-donations-electoral-commission-finds) to have failed to declare significant donations.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: Obama's 2012 presidential campaign was [fined by the FEC](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/07/obama-campaign-fined-big-for-hiding-donors-keeping-illegal-donations) for failing to disclose significant campaign contributions.
1.4.4.3.1.3. Con: Failure to properly disclose information could be the result of clerical errors and accounting mistakes, rather than evidence of willful misrepresentation.
1.4.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Political campaigns are staffed by many unpaid volunteers, staff, and agencies often working together without efficient means of communication.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Politicians are unlikely to act transparently in the interests of corporate donors when this fact is made visible to the public.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: This sort of transparent corporate servitude would cause people to lose faith in the politicians in question.
1.4.4.4. Con: Such legislation will only serve to reduce the amount of funding available to candidates, rather than dealing with the core issue of private donations skewing public incentives.
1.4.4.5. Con: Private donations are not only pernicious if they come from corporations. Small donations from individuals can serve to further polarize politics.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.4.4.5.2. Pro: On average, US political candidates receive the majority of their campaign funding from individual donors and non-party organizations, and just 9% from political parties. This means that [more ideological, less pragmatic donors, are deciding who gets funding](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/ump/13855466.0001.001/1:7/--campaign-finance-and-political-polarization-when-purists?rgn=div1;view=fulltext), which leads to more ideological, partisan candidates getting into office.
1.4.4.5.2.1. Con: This is a [misleading](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/ump/13855466.0001.001/1:7/--campaign-finance-and-political-polarization-when-purists?rgn=div1;view=fulltext) interpretation of the data and how it relates to small donations from individuals. "Candidates receive on average 25 percent of their funding from individual donors and 32 percent from nonparty organizations," meaning that nonparty organizations, and not individual donors, have the greatest impact.
1.4.4.5.3. Con: Donations which intend to further corporate interests can frequently be concealed in the guise of individual donations or other forms which do not directly reflect the corporation involved.
1.4.4.5.4. Con: The polarisation of politics caused by small donors who are presumably reflective of the existing polarisation of society is not a bad thing.
1.4.5. Con: The effect of corporate donations is often over-stated; politicians have an inherent self-interest to listen to people in order to remain popular.
1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.
1.4.5.2. Pro: When average Americans and elites disagree, both groups are equally likely to get their preferred policy outcome [\(Bashir, p. 1\)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015608896).
1.4.5.3. Pro: Having to raise money to fund a campaign forces politicians to [connect](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/public-funding-of-elections-unfair-expensive-and-probably-unconstitutional-20140602-zruyf.html) with voters.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Not all voters have equal capacity to donate significantly to the campaign due to income and wealth disparities; so politicians are more likely to direct their campaigns toward affluent voters who are most likely to donate significantly to them.
1.4.6. Pro: Industry leaders gain political power through donations which lead to favorable appointments to government positions.
1.4.6.1. Pro: As part of the ['revolving door' phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_\(politics\)) in politics, experts from financial industries and economic interest groups are often brought on board as policy-makers and advisers to the government, influencing the way in which the government views policy.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Of the 538 lobbyists registered in the United Kingdom, [191 are former government representatives](https://theconversation.com/the-revolving-door-why-politicians-become-lobbyists-and-lobbyists-become-politicians-64237).
1.5. Con: Public funding is unlikely to be allocated fairly across political parties.
1.5.1. Pro: Public funding models are more likely to give funding priority to established political parties and provide little to no funding to new candidates or political parties.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In most EU countries where there is partial public funding, funding is allocated in proportion to the number of seats or votes a party received in the previous election. [\(European Parliament AFCO Committee Report pg 25\)](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/519217/IPOL_STU\(2015\)519217_EN.pdf).
1.5.1.1.1. Con: These funding models also allow for private donations. If public funding was the only available funding, it would likely be allocated on a different model.
1.5.1.2. Pro: [Opposition](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2019-01-10-political-parties-set-to-be-banned-from-using-public-funds-for-election-campaigns/) political parties have accused the governing African National Congress in South Africa of abusing state resources and tax funds to disproportionately drive its election campaigns.
1.5.2. Con: It may be justified to provide funding unevenly across political parties.
1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Public campaign funding can be used to support the inclusion of marginalised groups in politics.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: In many countries, political parties are allocated more funds if they meet certain thresholds for gender participation [\(Ohman, pg 7\)](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/gender-targeted-public-funding-for-political-parties.pdf).
1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: In France, a party's public funding is restricted if women do not make up [at least 49% of the party's candidates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-women/france-elects-record-number-of-women-to-parliament-idUSKBN19911E). Female representation in France's Parliament has risen from 12.3% in 2002 to 38.6% in 2017.
1.5.2.3. Pro: In many countries there are [very few or no barriers](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2006/08/how-do-i-start-my-own-political-party.html?via=gdpr-consent) to forming a political party. It does not seem fair that anyone could form a party on a whim and get the same election funding as an established political party.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Most countries have at least one "[joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_frivolous_political_parties)" party.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: Parties formed to support potentially transformative ideas \(e.g. on-line direct democracy\) often struggle to self-fund their election bids. It would seem unfair to penalise a transformative party as though it was a joke party.
1.5.2.3.1.2. Con: Joke parties typically do not have real campaigning or advertising, and are thus unlikely to fall under the scope of this discussion.
1.5.2.3.2. Con: There is nothing about an established political party which makes it more deserving of funding.
1.5.2.3.3. Con: It is highly unlikely that someone would form a party and launch an election campaign on a whim, as both tasks would require a lot of effort.
1.5.3. Pro: Corruption can influence the way governments allocate funding for election campaigns.
1.5.3.1. Pro: A significant number of democracies were ranked unfavorably by the [Transparency International Corruption Perception](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/cpi_2018_global_analysis) Index this year.
1.5.3.2. Con: The visibility of these finances to the public increases the likelihood of corruption being exposed.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Governments which have a greater degree of control over the public purse are likely to be [more](http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/anticorrupt/deccorr3.pdf) corrupt. This suggests that if these governments now also control the allocation of election campaign funding, they will be corrupt in its disbursement.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: Due to the [media hype and increased public attention around elections](https://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/1-campaign-engagement-and-interest/), there is likely to be a high degree of scrutiny around the allocation of this election fund.
1.5.3.4. Pro: In corrupt regimes, incumbent governments have a strong influence on how this funding is dispensed.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: In [some countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government), the incumbent government itself serves as the caretaker government during election time.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: In many countries, interim governments are decided by [majoritarian consensus](http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Caretaker_Government), which gives them an advantage as they hold the current plurality or absolute majority.
1.5.3.5. Con: Countries with strong democratic systems are less likely to be corrupt, as [evidenced](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/cpi_2018_global_analysis) by Denmark and New Zealand who achieve consistently high scores on democratic and transparency indicators.
1.5.3.6. Con: Corruption is more of a problem for private funding than it would be for public fundraising because the public funds would be under the control of the people rather than in the hands of corporations or organizations.
1.5.4. Con: This is dependent on the system of allocation, and countries such as [Norway](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/4c66c850-cd67-4d00-a44b-af9a43c2edb3.pdf) have developed systems to allocate money based on popularity and membership.
1.5.4.1. Con: Allocation based on popularity could favor incumbents.
1.5.4.2. Con: Mechanisms to determine popularity and membership could be hard to keep neutral in larger and more corrupt countries.
1.5.4.3. Pro: [In Quebec](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-party-100-donation-limit-comes-into-effect-1.1381157), political parties are funded through the amounts of votes, and donations are limited to $100 and $200 on election years.
1.6. Pro: If each political party gets the same amount of money to spend on elections, smaller parties will be in a position to compete with larger and more entrenched parties.
1.6.1. Pro: The introduction of partial public funding systems in the United States has [encouraged more new candidates](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/06/11/451787/small-donor-antidote-big-donor-politics/) to run for public office.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.3.
1.6.3. Con: Equal public funding for political parties encourages parties to split and form multiple parties in order to gain more funding. This makes them less effective at countering larger, more entrenched parties.
1.6.3.1. Con: Breaking down into smaller parties will lead to scattered support for each one, thereby disincentivizing splits in the party.
1.6.3.2. Con: Having more political parties in an electoral system [facilitates discourse on a broader range of issues](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17457280903074052) including those which effect minority groups.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Smaller parties may find it difficult to get media coverage for their candidates and policies.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: In the 2017 UK election, the Conservative and Labour parties combined took up [70% of television election coverage and 84% of stories in the press](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/survey-finds-smaller-parties-squeezed-out-of-election-media-coverage-as-tories-dominate-newspapers/).
1.6.3.3.2. Con: Many countries have laws which require the media to [provide equal or minimum levels of coverage to all political parties](http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/me/introduction/me10/me10a).
1.6.3.4. Pro: Electoral laws such as [restricted ballot access laws, single-member congressional districts and first-past-the-post election rules](https://www.forbes.com/2010/05/13/third-parties-fusion-voting-elections-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html#295c1f485f7a) tends to make it difficult for small parties to win electoral seats.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Even in proportionally representative electoral systems there is generally a [minimum vote threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold) required before a party is allocated any electoral seats.
1.6.3.5. Con: Smaller parties can act to galvanise political opinion and activity that may be focused on a more [precise set of political concerns](https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/62/1/4/1486753) than those in mainstream politics. This makes them more effective at highlighting issues to the mainstream parties.
1.6.3.6. Con: Large and historically important parties are unlikely to split into smaller organizations because of the legacies and importance associated with the party's name.
1.6.4. Pro: The need to secure private donations [filters out](https://scholars.org/how-money-corrupts-american-politics) politicians and political parties with certain political viewpoints and approaches from being elected.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Since the majority of money that politicians can raise comes from corporations or wealthier elites, politicians with economically left-wing views \(who are in favour of higher taxes and more regulation\) tend to [struggle to fundraise](https://scholars.org/how-money-corrupts-american-politics) as compared to other candidates. This hurts them in elections.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Politicians can [crowdfund](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39732104) their election campaigns.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: The average donation for Obama's Presidential campaign was [only $68](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/barackobama.uselections2008), showing that he was able to gain most of his financial support from small donations.
1.6.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the first three months of 2007, Obama raised [$5.77 million from campaign contributions under $200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots_fundraising#2008_presidential_primaries).
1.6.4.1.1.2. Pro: Through the end of 2015, the Bernie Sanders campaign had raised [$54 million](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-fundraising-219112) in crowdfunded donations, accounting for 72 percent of its total fundraising.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: On February 10th 2016, the Bernie Sanders campaign raised $6.5 million in 24 hours with an [average contribution of $34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneybomb).
1.6.4.1.1.3. Con: Requiring politicians to crowdfund places an extra burden on those people who do not have means of their own, creating an uneven playing field.
1.6.4.2. Con: Regular citizens and non-corporate interest groups also fund election campaigns.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Interest groups which seek to protect underprivileged groups often field private donations to members of these groups to vie for political office.
1.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez, a prominent new entrant into the US Congress, was able to succeed in her election campaign by [raising money](https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/180416/alexandria-ocasio-cortez#.XIJuByj7SUk) from a host of interest groups which seek to protect marginalised members of society.
1.6.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Ocasio-Cortez actually struggled to raise money during the Democratic congressional primary. She won despite a lack of funds, with her campaign being outspent [more than 16 times](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-beats-high-ranking-house-democrat-joe-crowley.html) by the campaign of her opponent.
1.6.4.2.1.2. Con: Candidates of color raised [47% less money](https://www.demos.org/publication/stacked-deck-how-racial-bias-our-big-money-political-system-undermines-our-democracy-a-0) than white candidates in US state legislature races in 2006.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: The [majority of donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.php) from interest groups come from corporate interest groups in the United States.
1.6.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.1.
1.6.4.3. Pro: In the US, the campaign finance system disadvantages candidates with bipartisan approaches, in favour of more partisan candidates.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.5.2.
1.6.5. Pro: In places without public election financing, politicians from major parties are at a massive electoral advantage compared to those from smaller parties because of their capacity to spend more money on their campaign.
1.6.5.1. Pro: In US elections, the political candidate who spends the most money on their campaign [usually wins](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/).
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Large amounts of campaign spending [do not guarantee](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/super-pacs-2016/470697/) electoral success.
1.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Election despite Hillary having raised [almost $1.2 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2016-presidential-campaign-fundraising/) and Trump having only raised around $650 million - the lowest amount raised by any presidential nominee since 2008.
1.6.5.1.1.2. Pro: [American Crossroads](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/super-pacs-2016/470697/), a powerful Republican PAC founded by Karl Rove \(a top figure in the Bush Administration\), spent $325 million on eight candidates in the 2012 election cycle. Six were defeated.
1.6.5.1.1.3. Con: The effectiveness of corporate money is not always in guaranteeing who wins but in impacting whose voices are drowned out.
1.6.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: In the 2012 Republican Primary, Newt Gingrich remained in the running for months after he was no longer a viable candidate and effectively stifled the time and opportunities for others to be heard. He was kept in that race the whole time by a [single billionaire](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/265243-mega-donor-adelson-keeps-cruz-and-rubio-guessing).
1.6.5.1.1.4. Pro: In 2014, billionaire Tom Snyder's $50 million investment resulted in success in [less than half](http://fortune.com/2017/12/14/political-campaign-donations/) of the campaigns he donated to.
1.6.5.1.2. Pro: [90% of candidates](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) who outspent their opponents when campaigning for a seat in the House of Representatives ended up winning.
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: There is a ["strong, direct link"](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/stark-new-evidence-on-how-money-shapes-americas-elections) between the spending of the major political parties in a congressional seat and the percentage of the vote they win.
1.6.5.1.3.1. Con: Being likely to win may [attract more donations](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) and therefore more money for the candidate to spend. Rather than money causing a candidate to win, the likelihood of winning attracts money.
1.6.5.1.3.1.1. Con: The effect of money on a candidate's likeliness to win [is stronger than](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/stark-new-evidence-on-how-money-shapes-americas-elections) the effect that their likeliness to win and popularity may have on them gaining money.
1.6.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: Big donors can study polls, find that one candidate is more likely to win, and then back the ["winning horse"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_race_journalism) by [giving that candidate](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) all their money.
1.7. Pro: If elections are not publicly financed, elected politicians have to spend [significant amounts of time](https://scholars.org/how-money-corrupts-american-politics) raising money from donors in order to get re-elected.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.
1.7.2. Pro: The time and concentration politicians spend on fundraising takes away from their ability to represent their constituents and make public policy.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The less time allocated towards fundraising equates to more time spent engaging with constituents. Face-to-face interactions with constituents grants candidates the opportunity to gather an understanding of issues prevalent within their district.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: A comprehensive understanding of these issues can then be relayed towards proposed policies, as well as influence legislation they approve or disapprove of.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: Even if less time is allocated to fundraising efforts, politicians would likely not spend much more time face-to-face with their constituents.
1.7.2.1.2.1. Pro: Politicians are beholden to [special interest groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States) and would likely spend a disproportionate amount of time working with them.
1.7.2.2. Pro: In the US, members of Congress spend [more than half their working hours](https://www.termlimits.com/congress-fundraising-priority/) calling potential donors in order to fundraise.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: In 2013, new Democrat members of Congress [were told](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-are-members-of-congress-becoming-telemarketers/) during their orientation that they should spend four hours a day making fundraising calls and just two hours a day on congressional business.
1.7.2.3. Con: Politicians would likely not spend much more time writing and enacting public policy because the policy making process is largely outsourced to special interest groups and staff.
1.7.3. Pro: The time politicians spend around wealthier individuals trying to garner donations [affects their political priorities](https://scholars.org/how-money-corrupts-american-politics) and their perception of their constituents' political preferences and needs.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.2.3.
1.7.3.2. Con: If they lose the accurate perception of their electorate, they won’t be voted in.
1.8. Pro: Privately funded elections make it harder for people from less privileged backgrounds to become politicians.
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.2.1.
1.8.2. Pro: A lack of diversity in the political field is harmful.
1.8.2.1. Pro: When less privileged individuals are under-represented in politics, politics will privilege certain viewpoints and ignore others.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: In the US, members of Congress from working-class backgrounds exhibit more left-wing economic preferences than other legislators [\(Carnes, p. 5\)](https://www.opensecrets.org/downloads/Carnes_LSQ_Revised_Submission.pdf). The lack of working-class legislators thus minimizes the number of members of Congress with this political viewpoint.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: The social status of Democratic politicians in the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives) – measured in terms of average wealth, race, or gender – is a significant predictor of [support for policies which increases economic inequality](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085293).
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: In the US, members of Congress tend to be wealthy. Wealthier members of Congress have more politically conservative voting records [\(Eggers and Klasnja, p. 1\)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cfi0v6kjwiouh1v/wealth_in_congress_v2.pdf?dl=0).
1.8.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.2.2.1.1.
1.8.2.1.2.2. Con: It is to be expected that some members of the US congress will be wealthier and more politically conservative than others, but this does not depend on the tendency for congressmen to be wealthy in comparison with average Americans.
1.8.2.1.3. Con: Politicians in [representative democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) pledge to represent the best interests of the majority of the population regardless of their social or economic privilege.
1.8.3. Pro: In the US, white men hold a majority of positions at all levels of government even though racial minorities and women are big voter demographics.
1.8.3.1. Pro: For every woman in political office in the US, there are [3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/women-running-for-office/) men. Removing the requirement for private fundraising is likely to improve the number of women in public office.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Despite white men comprising only [31 percen](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-10-24/despite-diverse-demographics-most-politicians-are-still-white-men)t of the population, 97 percent of all Republican elected officials and 79 percent of all Democrat elected officials are white men.
1.8.4. Con: Despite the prevalence of private donations, the recently elected US Congress is [the most diverse](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/slideshows/116th-congress-by-party-race-gender-and-religion) in history - in terms of race, gender and sexual orientation.
1.8.4.1. Con: More diverse representation does not mean a better or more fair representation of the public.
1.8.4.2. Con: Claiming that Congress is "the most diverse in history" is misleading. Congress has historically not been diverse at all, so the bar is too low to be recognized as an achievement.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.1.
1.8.6. Pro: In electoral systems where funds are raised from private donors, people from more privileged backgrounds are at an advantage when it comes to winning an election.
1.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.8.7. Pro: By making it harder for less privileged people to become politicians, privately funded elections undermine the equality of opportunity for citizens to run for office.
1.8.7.1. Pro: Having fewer politicians from marginalized communities leads to [fewer voters turning out](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2014/11/06/100627/why-young-minority-and-low-income-citizens-dont-vote/) from these communities.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: Members of marginalized groups are unable to relate to privileged politicians.
1.8.7.1.1.1. Pro: Marginalized groups believe that politicians lack the [empathy](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/why-it-matters-that-politicians-have-no-experience-of-poverty/371857/) to understand their problems since privileged politicians have not faced the same problems as they have.
1.8.7.1.2. Con: Lower voter turnout among minority groups exists for reasons other than the demographics of politicians.
1.8.7.1.2.1. Pro: Voter repression policies often target minorities, making it harder for them to vote.
1.8.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: Black voters are more likely than white voters to cite [obstacles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/american-non-voters-election-donald-trump) to voting, such as “inconvenient polling place” or “transportation problems”.
1.8.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Poll closures and limited voting hours](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2016/11/11/292322/voter-suppression-laws-cost-americans-their-voices-at-the-polls/) disproportionately affect black voters.
1.8.7.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Black people do not want to spend more time trying to cast their vote since the [opportunity cost](https://voxeu.org/article/what-s-vote-worth) of their time is earning money.
1.8.7.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It is the responsibility of every citizen to decide for themselves whether or not to spend the time and energy to vote.
1.8.7.1.2.1.3. Con: The ruling in [Shelby County v. Holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder) upholds the rights of states to change or limit voting policies for any reason without seeking approval from the federal government.
1.8.7.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The Supreme Court in the US maintained [Section 2](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12369778/voter-restrictions-id-laws-supreme-court) in Shelby County v. Holder ruling, which “prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in one of the language minority groups.”
1.8.7.1.2.2. Con: Voter identification laws [disincentivize](https://ballotpedia.org/Arguments_for_and_against_voter_identification_laws#Support_arguments_in_detail) attempting to vote illegally, which reduces the number of people attempting to vote.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Those who hold elected office are disproportionately from [economically privileged](https://qz.com/1190595/the-typical-us-congress-member-is-12-times-richer-than-the-typical-american-household/) backgrounds. This illustrates the fact that few people from more [economically disadvantaged](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/) backgrounds run for office.
1.8.7.3. Pro: Public financing of election campaigns makes it easier for women to run for election.
1.8.7.3.1. Pro: The perception of a gendered difficulty in raising private campaign funds deters women from seeking political office \([Moyer, p.185](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=bjur)\).
1.8.7.3.1.1. Pro: When private financing exists, many women have to compete against male incumbents who are better positioned to receive funding \([Moyer, p.185](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=bjur)\).
1.8.7.3.1.2. Pro: In order for a woman to be competitive, she needs to cultivate a larger base of individual donors compared to men which requires more time and may prove to be too burdensome \([Moyer, p.185](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=bjur)\).
1.8.7.3.1.3. Con: A [record number](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/16/politics/house-women-update-september/index.html) of women ran for political office in the US in 2018, indicating that raising private funds is not a significant deterrent.
1.8.7.3.2. Con: Sexist bias in [media coverage](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/pink-wave-candidates.php) directs public attention away from female candidates, and would likely negatively impact public fundraising.
1.8.7.4. Pro: Having to engage in private fundraising to be taken seriously makes it less likely that working class citizens will run for office.
1.8.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.8.7.4.2. Pro: [Working-class](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/24/18009856/working-class-income-inequality-randy-bryce-alexandria-ocasio-cortez) people are under-represented in many political systems where election campaign financing relies on raising private donations.
1.8.7.4.2.1. Pro: In the UK, [only 8%](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2018/jul/decline-working-class-politicians-shifted-labour-towards-right-wing-policy) of [MPs](https://www.google.com/search?q=MP&oq=MP+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j69i59j35i39.1799j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) in the Labour Party - [traditionally](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/22/cities-are-now-labour-heartland-as-traditional-working-class-desert) the party of the working class - come from working class backgrounds.
1.8.7.4.2.2. Pro: In the US, politicians tend to be wealthy. Working class people are greatly underrepresented when it comes to the number of working class elected officials.
1.8.7.4.2.2.1. Pro: 52% of US citizens are classified as working class, but [less than 1/10th](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/24/18009856/working-class-income-inequality-randy-bryce-alexandria-ocasio-cortez) of elected officials are working class.
1.8.7.4.2.2.2. Pro: At least since World War II, no working class person has gone on to become a governor or the president [\("Government by the Privileged, p. 6\)](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s13227.pdf).
1.8.7.4.2.2.3. Pro: In the US, at least two thirds of the members of Congress are millionaires [\(Eggers and Klasnja, p. 3\)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cfi0v6kjwiouh1v/wealth_in_congress_v2.pdf?dl=0).
1.8.7.4.2.2.4. Con: The [US population](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/08/27/yes-the-rich-are-different/) believes that wealthy people are more intelligent and hardworking than working-class people, which likely influences voting habits.
1.8.7.4.2.3. Con: [Wealth and education](https://www.qs.com/what-effect-does-education-level-have-on-wealth/) and strongly positively correlated, meaning that well-educated people are more likely to seek political office and succeed than working-class people.
1.8.7.4.3. Pro: Working class citizens do not have the resources to [take the time out of work](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/24/18009856/working-class-income-inequality-randy-bryce-alexandria-ocasio-cortez) to run for office in the same way that wealthier citizens do.
1.8.7.4.4. Con: Engaging in private fundraising is a cost for running for office that candidates from all economic backgrounds have to undergo.
1.8.7.5. Con: Private funding practices are a symptom, but not a cause, of the troubles less privileged people face in politics.
1.8.8. Pro: Privately funded elections reinforce and are reinforced by partisan gerrymandering, and [many congressional districts](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-11-17/midterm-elections-reveal-effects-of-gerrymandered-districts) are [gerrymandered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States) in such a way that the nominee of one party is likely to win.
