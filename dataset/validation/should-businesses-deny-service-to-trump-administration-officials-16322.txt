Discussion Name: Should Businesses Deny Service to Trump Administration Officials?

1. Businesses Should Not Deny Service to Trump Administration Officials.
1.1. Con: Administration officials should be subject to the same faith or conscience-based denial of service that the administration itself supports.
1.1.1. Pro: It is hypocritical and dishonest to insist on a particular policy but also insist it not apply to you, especially when you can change it yourself, while those targeted by that policy cannot.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is similarly hypocritical to oppose the ability of businesses to discriminate against customers, whilst using discrimination as a form of retaliation against those who do support that.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The GOP, having control of Congress and the White House, has the constitutional powers necessary to override the Supreme Court ruling they pushed through in the first place \(which allows discrimination\). If they are unwilling to do so then they are passively supporting and accepting the discrimination they are publicly complaining about.
1.1.2. Con: The administration doesn't support specific denials of service. They support the laws that gives businesses the free right to do so, regardless of political motive.
1.1.3. Con: Administration officials are not employed to promote the president's opinions, they are performing a national service because they are deemed to be the best person for the job.
1.1.3.1. Con: Administration officials are largely selected by the president. While they may not necessarily be employed "to promote the president's opinions," they are employed to execute the president's mission, even if they're not the absolute best person for the job.
1.2. Pro: Denying service to Trump officials only reinforces the administration's narrative that they \(and their supporters\) are victims.
1.2.1. Pro: Trump and his administration officials repeatedly insist that they are the [victims](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/06/01/trumps-twisted-view-of-who-qualifies-as-a-victim/?utm_term=.0240d16678ae) of unfair treatment.
1.2.2. Con: People in the Trump administration are all part of the dominant group. They are not oppressed otherwise and it is good for them to see how the discrimination they support is affecting people.
1.2.3. Con: This narrative exists already. Whether businesses can deny service won’t make any major change to the narrative or how many people buy in as it’s only one small part of this narrative.
1.2.3.1. Con: While denying service does not change the narrative, it provides easy and obvious evidence to support it.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Being able to point to concrete examples such as this makes it harder for people to call out Trump for lying about the victim narrative.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.3. Con: It is generally accepted that business owners should be allowed to reject anyone.
1.3.1. Pro: As the provider of services in a free market, a business owner should have the power to withhold their services to those they don’t want to serve, unless it can be demonstrated that there is no other way for the patronage to receive those services and those services are necessary for sustaining life \(i.e., physical needs\).
1.3.2. Pro: In a free market, if business owners reject certain patronage, this creates new opportunities for other business owners to serve those patrons. Thus, in most cases the problem of discrimination would eventually solves itself \(though special action may still have to be taken in special cases\).
1.4. Pro: Allowing people to refuse service on the basis of political views equals that of people refusing services on religious views. If you allow one, you should allow the other. Or if you suggest that no one should be discriminated, it should be equal across the board.
1.5. Con: The presence of Trump administration officials, especially those in the public eye or able to make their own statements, can be disruptive both to customers and a business's employees.
1.5.1. Pro: The Red Hen owner asked Sarah Sanders to leave in part because [several of her employees](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-huckabee-sanders-got-kicked-out-of-a-restaurant-because-of-trump_us_5b2e6ee4e4b0040e27434bdc) were gay and felt uncomfortable having Sanders in the restaurant as a result of the administration's stance on LGBT issues.
1.5.2. Con: Sanders was a patron and had no political agenda to push on the employees.
1.5.2.1. Con: As an administration member who makes public statements, she inherently possesses a political agenda that gets pushed on employees, even if she doesn't directly do it there.
1.5.3. Pro: Trump officials, like other celebrities, attract paparazzi and large groups of people who want to meet them or heckle them. This can be disruptive to the day to day operations of a business.
1.6. Pro: Denying services to citizens you disagree with \(Trump administration officials\) could lead to escolating tensions and polarisation which would be harmful to American society.
1.6.1. Pro: This behaviour will likely lead to Republican businesses feeling that they are free to deny service to Democrats, which is harmful to Democrats in majority-Republican areas and worsens political polarisation.
1.6.2. Con: Denying services to people who refuse to adhere democratic norms is not un-democratic.
1.6.3. Con: Denying service to members of the Trump administration is categorically different from denying service to all people with whom you disagree. It targets a very small, easily identifiable subset of the population, so it would not generalise to discriminating against lots of other people.
1.6.3.1. Con: Whether or not it generalises in principle is irrelevant; what matters is whether Trump supporters are likely to observe this behaviour and retaliate.
1.6.3.2. Con: The only categorical difference between denying service altogether to members of the Trump administration and to all people you disagree with \(on a moral, ethical or political basis\) is that Trump administration members are publicly known to hold those beliefs as opposed to those who hold those beliefs but are less easily identifiable.
1.6.4. Pro: The rift between the American people will widen if businesses start denying services to customers that don't share business owner's political beliefs. This will benefit America's enemies.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The unwillingness to interact with individuals who hold different political views is one reason why America has become so polarized today.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: One [study](https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/04/a-10-minute-face-to-face-conversation-can-reduce-prejudice/477507/) has found that just a 10-minute face-to-face conversation can make people more open to different views and reduce prejudice.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: One is in their right to fear ideological viewpoints that advocate to harm, disadvantage or discriminate against one's self or one's loved ones.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: In America, attitudes towards the opposition party have become [increasingly negative](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) over the past few decades.
1.6.4.1.4. Pro: Only by engaging in meaningful dialogue can we hope to change the minds of those whose views we find repugnant.
1.6.4.1.4.1. Con: It is rare for people with strong views to change those views, and rarer still for such a change to happen as a result of dialogue as opposed to life experience. The point of such dialogue is rather to influence other people whose views are unformed or weakly held.
1.6.4.1.4.2. Con: Engagement on views does not come in the interaction one has with their waiter and is not going to change due to a short conversation.
1.6.4.1.4.3. Pro: Refusing service legitimises the narrative that the left shouldn't engage with Trump supporters. Trump supporters both feel victimised and are less likely to want to engage as they now view the other side as more adversarial. This lack of engagement builds political polarisation.
1.6.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: When people are defensive, it is impossible for them to be reflective and evaluate their beliefs.
1.6.4.1.4.4. Con: Engaging in a dialogue with members of the opposite side can sometimes [increase polarization of ideologies](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4ygux) and lead to greater prejudice [if the experience isn't optimal](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.891.4986&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
1.6.4.1.5. Con: The polarization of American politics long [predates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/polarization-is-an-old-american-story-1517613751) the recent lack of bipartisan communication.
1.6.4.1.5.1. Con: This does not change the fact that refusing service to Trump administration officials will only exacerbate this polarization.
1.6.4.1.5.2. Con: There are indicators that polarization is getting stronger and stronger in recent times.
1.6.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: During the Clinton era, [up to 40%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/116584/presidential-approval-ratings-bill-clinton.aspx) of Republican voters approved of his work; during Bush's first term, a [similar share](https://news.gallup.com/poll/116500/presidential-approval-ratings-george-bush.aspx) of Democrats approved of his work at times. Under Trump, [no more than 13%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) of Democrats ever approved of his work.
1.6.4.1.6. Pro: Perceptions of the Trump administration [differ radically](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx): while about 90% of Republicans approve of how the President does his job, only about 5% of Democrats do.
1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.1.4.
1.6.4.3. Con: Denying service to customers based on social or political belief is already accepted practice \(e.g. bakers being allowed to refuse service to same-sex couples\), irrespective of the consequences, so it would be inconsistent to prohibit it in this case.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: The SCOTUS decision did not actually side with the baker. It simply stated that the state of Colorado did not take the bakers strongly held religious beliefs into consideration when it found against the baker. It was [the process used by the Colorado commission the SCOTUS said was the problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-baker-who-turned-away-gay-couple.html). They did not rule on the right of the baker to refuse to create a wedding cake for the couple. They did note that the commissions comments were also prejudicial regarding the bakers beliefs.
1.6.4.3.2. Con: Regardless of whether businesses have a right to deny service to people, this does not mean that it is morally acceptable to refuse to serve individuals solely on the basis of them having opposing political views.
1.6.5. Pro: This policy will also discourage people from running for office in the first place, leaving more open positions for more extreme supporters from both the left and the right.
1.6.5.1. Pro: People who are on the fence about running will now have to weigh the fact that they will be shunned publicly for pursuing policies they believe in.
1.6.6. Pro: Shortly after the incident with Sarah Sanders, Trump [threatened](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44608999) retaliation along similar lines on Twitter.
1.6.6.1. Con: Trump's statement was not a threat; it was a warning that actions have consequences. The statement did not directly indicate whether the consequences would be retaliation or actual violence from Democrat supporters.
1.7. Pro: Strictly as a business decision, it’s most likely a costly mistake as it results in a loss of significant patronage.
1.7.1. Pro: No matter what side of the aisle they are on, most businesses will suffer by alienating half of the population.
1.7.1.1. Con: Businesses that promote themselves by these acts of resistance may attract more customers who share their views than they lose due to the policy, and may thus become more competitive in certain niches.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Many people may be willing to increase the amount of times they go to a business because they refuse the service of Trump administration officials. It is an easy way to go viral and gain the support of the general public.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Many people support Trump and will not want to pay businesses who refuse to serve someone who they believe is helping America.
1.7.1.3. Con: Most political divides aren't a 50-50 split, so businesses who take stands on the more popular side may benefit more than they lose.
1.7.1.4. Pro: Businesses are free to deny service to any customer based on the customer's socio-political belief. However, the business will be at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors who do not discriminate based on socio-political beliefs.
1.7.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.1.4.2. Pro: Market forces will naturally produce negative consequences when a business sets itself against a political organization and, by extension, its supporters.
1.7.1.4.2.1. Con: This is true only when those political supporters maintain economic power for a long enough period of time. The staying power of Trump's popularity is unclear.
1.7.2. Pro: Even those who do not support Trump may believe this action is too extreme and consequently consume elsewhere. Liberals for example may see it as contradictory, given the recent news of the LGBT couple being refused service in a bakery.
1.7.3. Con: Left-wing people \(generally\) tend to live in [urban areas](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/red-state-blue-city-how-the-urban-rural-divide-is-splitting-america/265686/), and be working professionals with large amounts of [spending power](https://budgetandthebees.com/who-is-richer-democrats-or-republicans/). Many may lend support to businesses who do this as they are also opposed to Trump.
1.7.3.1. Con: This is an unsupported generalization lacking a credible source. Census data shows approximately [80%](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-210.html) of all Americans live in urban areas, yet Clinton won the total popular vote by [2.86 million out of nearly 130 million votes](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/1222/Clinton-wins-US-popular-vote-by-widest-margin-of-any-losing-presidential-candidate), less than a 3% difference. Therefore cities must also have right-wing populations.
1.8. Con: The Trump Administration's actions and policies are so anathema to American ideals that members of the administration deserve to be shunned from public life.
1.8.1. Con: Not all employees in the Trump administration are directly responsible for his policies.
1.8.1.1. Con: No matter how small their contribution is, every official's work helps solidify Trump's positions and policies.
1.8.2. Pro: The Trump administration has been involved in a large amount of [criminality](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/10/30/top-six-trump-admin-crimes-ought-bring-indictments) and unethical behaviour.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The Mueller investigation has [resulted](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-mueller-investigation-one-year/) in 5 guilty pleas and 17 indictments.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: The criminal actions of a few during the campaign does not tar everyone who works in the administration now.
1.8.2.2. Pro: The Trump administration is [separating](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents) families of immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S.
1.8.2.3. Pro: [Trump has regularly praised autocrats.](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/02/526520042/6-strongmen-trumps-praised-and-the-conflicts-it-presents)
1.8.2.3.1. Pro: Trump praises autocrats while being very [harsh](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-uk-visit-nato-allies-comments-insults-germany-london-protest-a8444996.html) on allies like Canada, the UK, Germany, and NATO as a whole.
1.8.2.4. Pro: The Trump Administration is deporting parents without their children, effectively [stealing children](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-immigration-family-reunifications-20180712-story.html) from people.
1.8.2.5. Pro: National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have [strong ties](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-overlook-john-bolton-and-mike-pompeos-anti-muslim-ties/2018/04/12/6a4ce456-3dc3-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html?utm_term=.c46bae120270) to anti-Islam groups.
1.8.2.6. Con: Due to the large number of people involved, previous administrations have also been known to engage in a [large amount of criminality and unethical behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_scandals_in_the_United_States#Barack_Obama_administration_\(2009%E2%80%932017\)). The difference is how much it is publicized in the case of one party as opposed to the other party.
1.8.2.6.1. Pro: CNN constantly harps on Republican legal and ethical allegations and either [fails to report](https://www.dailywire.com/news/23910/democrat-news-network-cnn-fails-report-these-24-ryan-saavedra) or down-plays the significance of Democrat infractions.
1.8.2.6.1.1. Con: Media coverage during the 2016 election focused more on [Hillary's emails](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/08/25/studies-agree-media-gorged-on-hillary-clinton-email-coverage/?utm_term=.76e3bd97bc65) than on literally anything else.
1.8.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Hillary's emails were kept in the [news](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-email-story-is-out-of-control/2016/09/08/692947d0-75fc-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html?utm_term=.d4c058b5729f) by the GOP but [main stream media](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/) outlets primarily [focused](https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/the-2016-blast/2015/09/an-insiders-account-of-hillarys-email-210069) on [disputing](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-email-controversy-explained-2016/index.html) [its](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-state-department-say-no-quid-pro-quo-clinton-email-n667926) [illegality](https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/comey-tells-congress-fbi-has-not-changed-conclusions/index.html) and Hilary's [culpability](https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/politics/hillary-clinton-email-justice-department/index.html).
1.8.2.6.2. Con: No administration has had this level of ethical and criminal lapses, especially from such high level officials and this early in the term.
1.8.2.6.3. Con: Despite tens of millions of dollars and more than a decade of investigating President Clinton and members of Obama's cabinet, exactly [one person](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/1/11/1619079/-Comparing-Presidential-Administrations-by-Arrests-and-Convictions-A-Warning-for-Trump-Appointees) combined was convicted of a crime. This implies that the accusations thrown out failed to meet minimum burdens of proof.
1.8.2.6.3.1. Con: This imbalance could also imply there is a bias in the Justice Department that excuses Democrats while proactively pursuing Republicans.
1.8.2.6.3.1.1. Con: People who work in law-enforcement are typically white men who really believe in law-and-order policies, generally a Republican-leaning constituency.
1.8.2.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The Department of Justice, who investigates and prosecutes most violations of federal law by politicians and government workers [lean heavily left](https://freebeacon.com/issues/doj-employee-donations-overwhelmingly-favor-democrats/). The 2012 GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, received 14 percent of donations from the same group of agencies surveyed for Trump. Trump received just [5 percent.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/302817-government-workers-shun-trump-give-big-money-to-clinton-campaign)
1.8.2.7. Pro: The Trump Admin missed a court ordered deadline to reunite families, some of whom may be [American citizens](https://theslot.jezebel.com/trump-administration-has-missed-deadline-to-reunite-chi-1827573627).
1.8.2.8. Pro: Chief of Staff John Kelly covered up and lied about Rob Porter's history of [domestic abuse](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/john-kelly-rob-porter-abuse/index.html).
1.8.2.9. Pro: Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was an unregistered foreign agent for [Turkey](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/3/9/14868680/trump-adviser-michael-flynn-foreign-agent-turkey-lobby), who tried to orchestrate the illegal kidnapping of a Turkish cleric from US soil.
1.8.2.10. Pro: Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about [multiple contacts](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/3/9/14868680/trump-adviser-michael-flynn-foreign-agent-turkey-lobby) with Russia.
1.8.2.11. Pro: Trump campaign chairman [Paul Manafort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort) has a decades long history of illegal and ethically heinous acts: from supporting murderous dictators to facilitating illegal weapons transfers to Pakistan.
1.8.2.12. Pro: We don't know what [financial holdings](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/16/world/ethics-be-damned-more-half-trumps-20-person-cabinet-has-engaged-questionable-or) most members of the Trump Cabinet have, leading to questions of conflicts of interest.
1.8.2.13. Pro: Because Trump still hasn't divested from his properties, interest groups and foreign governments [host events](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/16/world/ethics-be-damned-more-half-trumps-20-person-cabinet-has-engaged-questionable-or) at Trump properties, directly funneling money to the president.
1.8.2.14. Pro: Nearly every member of Trump's cabinet has faced ethics investigations.
1.8.2.14.1. Pro: Scott Pruitt is facing fifteen investigations into his behavior, [even after resigning.](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/epas-pruitt-finds-himself-facing-yet-another-federal-investigation)
1.8.2.14.2. Pro: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has been [funneling money](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/transportation-secretary-elaine-chao-gets-an-ethics-scandal.html) to her father's shipping company.
1.8.2.14.2.1. Con: The linked article references appearances in videos that were being claimed to be promoting her father's business. Sec. Chao asserted the videos were motivational videos to show how high persons of asian descent could rise in America.
1.8.2.14.3. Pro: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has faced accusations of [insider trading](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/20/politics/commerce-secretary-denies-insider-trading/index.html).
1.8.2.14.3.1. Con: Ross has [denied](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/20/politics/commerce-secretary-denies-insider-trading/index.html) participating in insider trading.
1.8.2.14.4. Pro: Secretary of HUD Ben Carson is [funneling money](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/3/16967628/ben-carson-ethics-hud-son-baltimore) to his family and spending exorbitant amounts on office furniture.
1.8.2.14.5. Pro: Former HHS Secretary [Tom Price](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/13/628849448/hhs-all-but-one-of-tom-prices-plane-trips-broke-federal-rules) was forced to resign after wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money on travel.
1.8.2.14.6. Pro: Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke faced [ethics inquiries](https://www.desmogblog.com/2018/06/20/scott-pruitt-ethics-nightmare-so-ryan-zinke) on his spending and travel, as well as land deals he stands to personally benefit from.
1.8.2.15. Pro: Because Trump has spent more than [30% of days](https://twitter.com/StevenErlanger/status/1018204127711629317) of his presidency at Trump properties, the government has [spent hundreds of thousands of dollars](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/05/18/bill-mandates-disclosure-government-spending-trump-properties/622999002/), at least, at properties Trump owns.
1.8.2.16. Pro: [Sarah Sanders](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a21923917/sarah-huckabee-sanders-tweet-violates-ethics-law/) and Counselor to the President [Kellyanne Conway](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/591184395/kellyanne-conway-violated-federal-ethics-rules-watchdog-says) have both been cited by ethics investigators for misusing their roles to attack or support private businesses.
1.8.2.17. Pro: Senior Advisor Jared Kushner attempted to set up a [secret backchannel](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/06/how-to-understand-kushners-back-channel-215232) with Russia at the Russian embassy, so that Russia could have records of their conversations but the US couldn't.
1.8.3. Pro: The Trump Administration has used white-supremacist talking points and some of its members have associations with white supremacy.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Advisor [Stephen Miller](https://rewire.news/article/2018/03/14/time-honest-stephen-miller-whose-radical-vision-u-s-immigration-spreading/) is known to use white supremacist rhetoric.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Campaign chairman and former advisor Steve Bannon is known for associating with [white supremacists.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-white-supremacist_us_59ece454e4b00f08619f846b)
1.8.3.3. Pro: Attorney General Jeff Sessions was considered too racist to be a judge in [1980's](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/09/509001314/jeff-sessions-previously-denied-federal-judgeship-amid-racism-controversy) Alabama.
1.8.3.3.1. Con: Even accepting that in the '80's Jeff Sessions was blocked by concerns of racism, it is possible and even likely that a person's views and opinions will change over the course of 30 years.
1.8.3.3.1.1. Pro: For example, 30 years ago, a plurality of the U.S. would have been [completely against gay marriage](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) whereas now many support that choice.
1.8.3.3.1.2. Con: There is absolutely no evidence of Jeff Sessions' moderating.
1.8.3.3.1.2.1. Con: In the summer of 2017 Jeff Sessions [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/18/that-time-the-senate-denied-jeff-sessions-a-federal-judgeship-over-accusations-of-racism/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2784e4c9c97a) Isaac Stanley-Becker “Racism is totally unacceptable in America. Everybody needs to be treated fairly and objectively.”
1.8.3.4. Pro: Trump has used the [exact language](https://twitter.com/Mikel_Jollett/status/1017762386428608515) used by white supremacists when talking about immigration.
1.8.4. Pro: It is a form of natural justice. Members of the administration are complicit in policies which negatively affect the lives immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and other groups. The fact that administration members now face an inconvenience is fair play.
1.8.5. Con: Since Trump won the election, the assertion that his administration's policies are anti-American is not shared by a large number of voters.
1.8.5.1. Con: [Trump lost the popular vote](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clintons-popular-vote-win-came-entirely-from-california/)- his presidency as a whole is against the desires of most of the American people. Therefore, if election results are a criteria for determining whether or not something is anti-American, his administration is anti-American.
1.8.6. Con: Exclusion of Trump supporters will create bad legal precedent.
1.8.6.1. Con: Business owners have a legal right to refuse service to unwanted customers, as long as it is not on the [basis](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/restaurants-right-to-refuse-service.html) of race, color, religion, or national origin.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: In a small number of places in the US, discrimination based on where you work and what your beliefs are is [illegal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/11/25/can-businesses-refuse-to-serve-or-employ-trump-supporters/?utm_term=.7595e80c8cd2).
1.8.6.1.1.1. Pro: Businesses should not disobey laws simply because they disagree with them; this would break down the norms which allow legal systems to function.
1.8.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Resistance often involves breaking the law, as the law upholds a social norm that one wants to change.
1.8.6.1.2. Pro: The private person who runs the business has the right to exclude and therefore, has the right to determine who shall be allowed or denied access.
1.8.6.1.2.1. Con: A restaurant is a Public Accommodation, whether privately or publicly owned, to which the public have access by right or by invitation, expressed or implied, whether by payment of money or not. All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation. - [U.S. Code › Title 42 › Chapter 126 › Subchapter III › § 12181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12181) & [42 U.S. Code § 2000a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000a)
1.8.6.1.2.2. Pro: Nightclub operators are usually allowed to decide autonomously who is allowed to enter and who is not.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1. Con: Unlike Restaurants, Private Clubs \(Clubs that require an entry fee, membership fee, or where members must pay dues\) are not considered Public Accommodations. [¹](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000a) Additionally, the type of Federal/State/Local Business & Liquor Licenses' differ for Nightclubs & Restaurants \(due to the age/sales related restrictions & guidelines established by the DoT - TTB\) [²](https://www.ttb.gov/regulation_guidance/index.shtml) which also exclude the vast majority Nightclubs from being considered Public Accommodations.
1.8.6.1.3. Pro: Being a liar, unlike race or sex, is [not a protected class of citizens](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/opinion-signorile-sarah-huckabee-sanders-restaurant_n_5b3060ebe4b0321a01d2ae9d). The government has never sought to carve out specific protections for those known to habitually flout truth. There are many other ways liars aren't protected, for example you can fire someone just for being a liar, or even deny employment for no other reason than the person is a liar.
1.8.6.2. Pro: While political beliefs are not protected on a federal level, many state governments current prohibit retaliatory action based on them. If courts uphold the legality of this action, those state level protections will be weakened.
1.8.6.3. Pro: Anti-discrimination laws currently protect minority groups from being discriminated against in public settings. If political identity is a legal justification for discrimination, business owners can cite that when they are actually discriminating against protected classes.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: This kind of policy in law would be incredibly ambiguous as denying service on the basis of ‘political views’ could be interpreted many ways e.g. arguing being Islam is a different ‘political view’ and therefore service need not be given.
1.8.6.3.1.1. Pro: Nearly every issue or belief carries some political implication.
1.8.7. Con: It is highly subjective what American ideals are and what actions live up to them.
1.8.8. Pro: Because citizens do not have the power to strongly censure people, societal shame is their only mechanism for expressing disapproval of a person's conduct.
1.8.9. Pro: The Trump administration has eroded and attacked important social norms, and therefore other norms of behaviour should not be extended to protect them.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Donald Trump violated the norms of [releasing tax returns](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2017-04-18/trumps-excuse-for-not-releasing-his-tax-returns-is-ludicrous). This means we don't know what financial conflicts of interest he has.
1.8.9.2. Con: Slavery, segregation and the idea that marriage should only be between a man and a woman are past social norms. The people who eroded these norms should be protected.
1.8.9.3. Pro: The [Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/leave-the-dark-twisted-fantasies-to-trump/2018/07/13/d63f3352-86c6-11e8-9e80-403a221946a7_story.html?utm_term=.89b1406bf4b4) Administration [lies](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a22145043/sarah-sanders-john-kelly-breakfast-lie/) constantly and for [sport](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/then-trump-new-york-times-fake-tips-maggie-haberman-news-lies-a7749821.html).
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: An analysis of Trump's words as president show that he has [lied more frequently](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/analysis/2018/07/14/trump-has-said-1340330-words-as-president-theyre-getting-more-dishonest-a-star-study-shows.html) as time has gone on.
1.8.9.3.2. Pro: Trump has [bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/03/14/in-fundraising-speech-trump-says-he-made-up-facts-in-meeting-with-justin-trudeau/?utm_term=.76e1c53e55c9) about lying to other world leaders.
1.8.9.3.3. Pro: Trump has falsely claimed [millions of people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38126438) voted illegally in the 2016 election.
1.8.9.3.3.1. Con: The number may be an exaggeration but it has been shown that a large number of [non-citizens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379414000973?via%3Dihub) have voted in U. S. elections.
1.8.9.3.3.1.1. Con: Richman's study has been [discredited and widely critiqued.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/illegal-immigrants-2008-election/)
1.8.9.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Whereas the extrapolation has been contested, there has been no dispute that some of the noncitizen respondents did indicate that they had voted in the national election, to include their precise noncitizen status and who they voted for.
1.8.9.4. Pro: Donald Trump has personally attacked prisoners of war for [getting captured](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317) and the families of [fallen soldiers](http://time.com/collection-post/5016312/gold-star-father-khizr-khan-talks-about-his-love-for-america-and-family/) for opposing him.
1.8.9.5. Pro: Donald Trump has attacked and undermined the idea of an independent [judiciary](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/his-own-words-presidents-attacks-courts).
1.8.9.6. Pro: Trump has used his platform to insult, as of now, nearly [500](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html) different people and things.
1.8.9.7. Pro: Trump has personally spread [unfounded](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-theories-spygate.html) conspiracy theories.
1.8.9.7.1. Pro: Trump is [still pushing](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/29/16713664/trump-obama-birth-certificate) the discredited falsehood that Obama was not born in the US.
1.8.9.7.2. Pro: Trump [falsely accused](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/388101-trump-report-that-obama-fbi-spied-on-campaign-could-be-bigger-than) Obama of "spying on his campaign."
1.8.9.7.3. Pro: Trump is using his unfounded [Deep State](https://www.npr.org/2018/05/17/611922875/how-trump-s-war-on-the-deep-state-is-leading-to-the-dismantling-of-government) rhetoric to push people deemed insufficiently loyal out of the government.
1.8.9.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.3.3.
1.8.9.8. Pro: The Trump administration has [attacked social norms](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-oppressor-press-freedom_us_5a54bc75e4b003133ecc3439) concerning the freedom and impartiality of the press.
1.8.9.8.1. Con: No laws have been put in place curbing the press. If they attack pointlessly, they should expect push back.
1.8.9.8.1.1. Con: The press has the role of questioning those in government- but it is not the government or its officials' job, nor is it mature, to relentlessly attack the press in return.
1.8.9.8.2. Pro: Trump has called the media the "[enemy of the people.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html)"
1.8.9.8.3. Pro: Trump has [admitted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/9/17335306/trump-tweet-twitter-latest-fake-news-credentials) that he calls any story he doesn't like "fake."
1.8.9.9. Con: The correct way to respond to attacks on social norms is to uphold other norms even more strongly, rather than abandoning norms altogether.
1.9. Pro: Businesses open to the public should not deny service to anyone for any reason other than for immediate health or safety reasons.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.
1.9.2. Pro: We generally don't accept the discrimination of people based on their jobs.
1.9.3. Pro: Denying service based on political beliefs is discriminatory.
1.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.3.
1.9.4. Con: Trump administration officials arguably present inherent health and safety concerns.
1.9.4.1. Pro: The Trump administration is widely recognized as actively and manifestly bigoted. Having people who literally think of you as lesser or undeserving of having all of your rights recognized is emotionally and psychologically damaging.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.9.4.2. Con: Administration officials should not be assumed to be a health or safety concern simply because of their political beliefs or job. Such judgement should only arise if the individual is acting in an unhealthy or unsafe manner.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: It is the combination of those "political" beliefs and the holders' jobs that creates such concerns.
1.9.4.2.2. Con: There are "political" beliefs that inherently present health or safety concerns \(e.g. Nazism, racial supremacy, extremism, etc.\)
1.9.5. Pro: Denying services to people who do not share one's political beliefs creates a dangerous precedent which can easily be extended to include discrimination based on non-political beliefs, like gender, sexual orientation or the stance on abortion.
1.9.5.1. Con: Some "political" beliefs are already based on negative biases concerning gender and orientation. Denying service because of those beliefs, especially if those denied service are vocal and adamant in them, is arguably defensive and thus different from denying service based on gender and orientation.
1.9.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.
1.9.6. Pro: Businesses exist solely to provide a service or sell a product, it is not their place to have political beliefs.
1.9.6.1. Con: Business fills many roles within society, the most important being picking up the slack where government stops.
1.9.6.1.1. Con: It is the other way around- the government must/should provide goods and services that the market can't reliably and efficiently provide \(e.g. military\).
1.9.6.2. Pro: While business has become a "force for good" with a transformational role to play in society, it is still ultimately intended to create profit for its owner[\(Gilbert, Houlahan, & Kassoy, 2015, n.p.\)](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/what-role-business-society/). Government inaction requires action from representatives or constituents. Mandating financially capable entities to influence norms in place of government reduces the value of financially unsound people's input.
1.9.7. Pro: In the case of Sanders, the restaurant said it had standards to uphold such as ‘honesty’. There’s no mechanism for restaurants or other businesses to be able to enforce such standards with all its customers \(i.e. those who are not publicly known\).
1.9.8. Con: Private businesses should have the right to deny service to anyone for any reason.
1.9.8.1. Pro: The selective discrimination of business and social dealings is one way we sanction each other in community. Otherwise, the only form of social order is the state. That is, by definition, a totalitarian outcome.
1.9.8.1.1. Pro: A free person should be able to work or not work for anyone that they choose. This includes business owners. Anything else is essentially involuntary servitude for the worker.
1.9.8.1.1.1. Con: There are consequences for such choices when one opens their business to the general public. Exclusion of groups of people may lead to lawsuits, loss of business from people objecting to the exclusion and other consequences which may lead to the bankruptcy and/or closure of the business.
1.9.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Other patrons who see administration officials frequenting the business may leave en masse if they presuppose the owner is sympathetic to the administration's positions. The right of eviction must be preserved to protect an owner's brand reputation \(and by proxy, revenue\) with his or her customers.
1.9.8.1.1.2. Con: No one is forced to own a business, so it's not involuntary, and a business owner is working for herself, so it's not servitude.
1.9.8.1.1.2.1. Con: The business owner only consents to the act of creating a business, and consenting to that should not require consenting to serve absolutely anyone.
1.9.8.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.
1.9.8.1.1.3. Pro: In the same way that individuals should be perfectly free to express their political beliefs, they should also be free to refrain from helping someone with whose political beliefs they disagree.
1.9.8.1.2. Pro: A seller should be able to decide what they will sell. Being forced to sell a specific product impedes the seller from their creative and productive choice.
1.9.8.2. Con: This would enable the return of widespread segregation and discrimination based on race, gender, and nationality.
1.9.8.2.1. Con: It is inherently different to discriminate against people for things outside their control, such as race or orientation, than for malleable things such as political alignment.
1.9.8.2.1.1. Pro: Discriminating against people with harmful political views can incentivize them to change those views. Race and sexuality cannot be affected in this way.
1.9.8.2.1.2. Con: For many people, political alignment is caused by the environment they were raised in, which they did not choose. The idea that people freely choose political values is false.
1.9.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.
1.10. Pro: Denying service based on political views is undemocratic because it punishes people for having different views, and different views are necessary for a democracy to function.
1.10.1. Pro: It is often though that a successful democracy requires there to be [strong opposition parties](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/11/democracy-without-opposition/) to contest the ruling goverment and act as a check on its power. Denigrating certain viewpoints has the potential to weaken the strength of the opposition to future \(democratic\) governments, giving them too much unchecked power.
1.10.2. Con: Current financial laws, as interpreted by US supreme court, allow businesses to contribute to political causes with the same rules and regulations as a person. This effectively gives the right to business to express political opinions. Since providing/withholding a service holds a monetary value and the choice to do so is based on a desire to reaching a political outcome than I would claim this action can and should be interpreted no different than a financial contribution to politicians
1.10.3. Con: People also need to be able to respond to those different opinions, which they can do by refusing service to those who hold those opinions.
1.10.4. Con: People are not denying officials for their political views, but their direct effect on our nation. Denying someone service based on a political outlook is different than denying someone who is actively working in the government.
1.10.5. Pro: When you discriminate against someones political beliefs you show fear of something that you disagree with, not an action of that individual. The same is true when you shut down opposing views. You cease to learn and expand your own views and outlook. You do so for fear you may be proved wrong.
1.10.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.2.
1.10.6. Con: Not all viewpoints are relevant or helpful to democracy, anarchism is an example of this.
1.10.6.1. Con: The skepticism of unjustified hierarchy central to anarchist thought could be useful in improving the democratic process by making it more representative of the public and by proxy more responsive to the needs of society.
1.11. Con: It is important to signal that the actions of the Trump administration are outside of the realm of acceptable civilized behaviour. This can be done by excluding them from normal civil society.
1.11.1. Con: Being uncivil in the face of incivility is wrong.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Being uncivil towards the Trump administration makes it difficult to call out the administration's incivility without appearing hypocritical.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: It is unreasonable to allow the Trump administration to remain uncivil while holding their opponents to a different standard.
1.11.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Trump administration has a [history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories#Donald_Trump) of [responding](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44608999) [uncivilly](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/703974892237135873%3Flang%3Den&ved=2ahUKEwjMtKbD1fPbAhXD1hQKHZW9Ai4QFjABegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2aPkBlVg11daYAc28HJs2r) to civil opposition.
1.11.1.2. Pro: In a truly Civil Society, we must confer upon those with whom we disagree "the right to be wrong." In other words, if we aspire to civilized behavior, then we must tolerate those with whom we disagree.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: Some viewpoints do not deserve the benefit of "the right to be wrong."
1.11.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many continue to hold certain viewpoints despite being shown either a lack of evidence to support it or even large amounts of evidence to contradict that viewpoint.
1.11.1.2.1.2. Pro: Some viewpoints, such as racial supremacy and homophobia, are largely illogical and harmful to the point of being inarguable.
1.11.1.2.2. Con: This presumes that our society is "civil", and ignores the institutional barriers in place that silence whole segments of our society. Those who are silenced never get their say within the "civil discourse" so they have to protest in other ways.
1.11.1.2.2.1. Pro: Nonviolent civil disobedience \(like denying service at a restaurant or kneeling at the national anthem\) is historically the best and most effective way that the silenced can push back on the powerful.
1.11.1.3. Con: Upholding unequal standards for civility -- e.g., equating harmful policies with refusing to serve those who promote them -- may do more harm to the long-term civility of the culture than minor acts of resistance to incivility would do.
1.11.1.3.1. Pro: Refusing to serve a person who promotes policies that are discriminatory and that cause harm to groups of people and/or deny them their rights is not a question of civility. Calling this "incivility" trivializes the depth of the moral objection to these officials' actions.
1.11.1.3.1.1. Pro: The incivility of denying service is on a different, much less severe level than the incivility of the Trump administration and can therefore not be judged by the same standards.
1.11.1.4. Pro: Someone doing something wrong is not license to do the same.
1.11.1.4.1. Con: This assumes that the responding action, in this case the denial of service to a member of a particular presidential administration, was "wrong" which is the discussion at hand.
1.11.1.4.2. Pro: Treating someone unfairly due to a past allegiance is hardly just. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but it should be the duty of citizens to support equity in treatment to uphold the image of American morals and ideals.
1.11.1.4.3. Con: Retaliating in kind can often be a good way to prevent the exercise of immoral actions in the future.
1.11.1.5. Pro: Sarah Huckabee Sanders was merely eating dinner with her family, not behaving in an uncivil manner.
1.11.1.6. Con: The Trump Administration is not just being uncivil, it is actively and intentionally harming people. Being uncivil in the face of evil is not wrong.
1.11.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.11.1.4.
1.11.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.
1.11.1.7. Con: Civility in the face of incivility isn't the moral high ground; it's passive acceptance.
1.11.1.7.1. Pro: Neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim, and silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented. The same applies to fighting incivility: remaining civil only encourages the opposing side.
1.11.1.7.1.1. Pro: Jews were advised to be [civil to Nazis](https://www.jta.org/2018/07/02/news-opinion/in-1934-an-american-professor-urged-that-jews-be-civil-to-the-nazis), but this civility failed and did not prevent [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust).
1.11.1.7.1.2. Con: Civility should not be confounded with neutrality or silence. Civility does not imply apathy or a lack of a stance. It also does not imply that dissenting opinions should be silenced. Civility implies making one's claim\(s\) in a respectful and polite way.
1.11.1.7.2. Con: The success of groups like [Life After Hate](https://www.lifeafterhate.org/) show that civility and compassion can be effective ways to counter incivility and even the views of radical white supremacists.
1.11.1.8. Pro: The American political system works better when people are treated with civility and respect.
1.11.1.8.1. Pro: The American political system often requires cooperation between Republicans and Democrats in government. The parties will be more willing to cooperate if there is an environment of mutual respect and civility.
1.11.1.8.1.1. Con: It is difficult to move forward on a basis of mutual respect and civility when [many of those on one side](https://www.theroot.com/how-the-republican-party-became-the-party-of-racism-1827779221) hold beliefs that, based on orientation, race, ethnicity, gender, etc., others are lesser than them.
1.11.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Civility does not require respect.
1.11.1.8.1.2. Con: Republicans were unwilling to cooperate with Democrats long before these perceived acts of incivility, like when they blocked [Obama's Supreme Court nominee](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/23/obama-supreme-court-nominee-senate-hearing-vote) or claimed their main goal was to make Obama a ['single-term president"](https://www.politico.com/story/2010/10/the-gops-no-compromise-pledge-044311).
1.11.1.8.1.3. Pro: As political polarization has increased, [Congress](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/23/congress-still-on-track-to-be-among-least-productive-in-recent-history/) has passed fewer [laws per session](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Vital-Statistics-Chapter-6-Legislative-Productivity-in-Congress-and-Workload_UPDATE.pdf).
1.11.1.8.2. Con: Trump has repeatedly disparaged and insulted people with whom he disagrees. Treating him and his officials with respect only legitimizes their tactics and emboldens them to continue.
1.11.1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.6.
1.11.1.9. Pro: Condoning the denial of service encourages unscrupulous persons to take it a step further and commit [assault](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/28/politics/chicago-lori-lightfoot-eric-trump-spitting-incident/) or other offenses targeting Trump associates.
1.11.2. Pro: Denying service to Trump officials is an effective form of [non-violent resistance](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/passive-resistance).
1.11.2.1. Pro: Non-violent resistance is required as trying to act civil in the face of extreme intolerance is destined to fail.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.7.1.1.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Non-violent resistance has been successful in the past.
1.11.2.2.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2014-06-16/drop-your-weapons) which examined hundreds of 20th century resistance movements came to the conclusion that passive and nonviolent movements were twice as likely to succeed as violent movements.
1.11.2.2.2. Con: Passive resistance alone was not enough to overthrow the [apartheid](https://www.apartheidmuseum.org/sites/default/files/files/downloads/Learners%20book%20Chapter4.pdf) system in South Africa.
1.11.2.2.2.1. Con: Apartheid withstood violent resistance for decades, [and global economic and diplomatic sanctions](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~shafi20k/fall.html) were necessary to overthrow the system.
1.11.2.3. Pro: Under capitalism, our most powerful democratic tool is our dollar, whether that be spending it ethically or sacrificing it commercially.
1.11.2.3.1. Pro: Economic boycotts are a [historic part of civil rights movements.](https://libguides.marymede.vic.edu.au/americancivilrights/economicboycotts)
1.11.2.3.1.1. Con: That may be, but denying service is not an economic boycott; it is refusing to serve those one disagrees with.
1.11.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.
1.11.2.3.3. Con: An individual's most powerful democratic tool should be their vote, since votes are distributed equally, unlike money.
1.11.2.3.3.1. Con: Citizens should use all powers of persuasion afforded to them, including organized economic boycotts, since voting only occurs every two years.
1.11.2.3.3.2. Con: Money has a big influence on politics, regardless of whether we want it to, and therefore people should be able to use money, or in this case sacrifice it, to support their beliefs.
1.11.2.3.3.3. Con: Unfortunately votes are not counted equally.  More [Americans voted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/22/13708648/democrats-won-popular-vote) to have a Democratic President, Democratic Senator, and Democratic Representative than a Republican President, Senator and Representative. Yet the White House, Senate and House are in Republican hands.
1.11.2.3.4. Pro: Americans - going all the way back to the [daughters of liberty](https://historyofmassachusetts.org/who-were-the-daughters-of-liberty/) - have used the power of consumption in an attempt to change policy at the highest levels. It also proves to be incredibly effective and a tactic used on all sides of the aisle.
1.11.2.3.4.1. Pro: Anti-apartheid activism and boycots in the US [put pressure](https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-anti-apartheid-movement-helped-bring-change-south-africa") on the US government to change its stance towards South Africa.
1.11.2.3.4.2. Con: This claim addresses the consumers, not suppliers.
1.11.2.4. Pro: Expressing disapproval of Trump's policies by denying service to his officials is better than violent opposition.
1.11.2.4.1. Pro: When people don't get to express themselves one way, they often find another, such as violence. Allowing a little of this is good if it prevents greater acts of resistance.
1.11.2.4.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that the average business owner will violently attack the Trump administration if they are unable to refuse service to some of its officials.
1.11.2.4.1.2. Con: This necessarily assumes that only some resistance is legitimate and some is not. By policing one's ability to resist, it necessarily limits the policies or institutions to which they can resist.
1.11.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Social justice movements often require radical action, not sanctioned by the mainstream, in order to achieve their goals.
1.11.2.4.1.3. Pro: Individuals may want to resist but cannot due to their job, lack of spare time, money etc. This provides an avenue for people to be able to engage in some resistance, and feel they are making some progress. This feeling of progress reduces their general level of anger at the Trump administration as they feel it's a comparatively better world.
1.11.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: If they cannot resist, then frustration grows as people feel powerless and that the world is getting worse. Thus, in desperation, they will engage in more radical action.
1.11.2.4.2. Con: This is a false dichotomy. It assumes that people can only choose between violence or denying service, which is not the case.
1.11.2.5. Con: Not being able to buy a sandwich from a restaurant is not going to change the opinions or actions of the Trump administration staff. All this does is make restaurant owners feel like they’re doing something.
1.11.2.5.1. Con: The fact that [Trump himself commented](https://qz.com/1313673/trump-tweets-about-red-hen-sending-a-chilling-message-to-small-businesses-in-the-us/) on the Red Hen case shows that even one individual's actions can have an impact.
1.11.2.5.2. Pro: Organized resistance is more effective than localized, random acts.
1.11.2.5.2.1. Pro: Organized [events](https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/history/info-2018/civil-rights-events-fd.html#quest1) and [groups](https://www.thoughtco.com/organizations-of-the-civil-rights-movement-45363) were most effective in bringing change during the Civil Rights Movement.
1.11.2.5.3. Con: Feeling effective has its own positive impact on a person.
1.11.2.5.3.1. Pro: If a person feels like they can make a difference, this might encourage them to engage in other types of activism.
1.11.2.5.4. Con: Any movement of social resistance necessarily consists of a collection of small, personal actions of conviction. The fact that a single individual's action will not itself cause change is not a persuasive reason to refrain from participating in resistance.
1.11.2.5.4.1. Pro: While the [civil rights era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement#Rosa_Parks_and_the_Montgomery_Bus_Boycott,_1955%E2%80%931956) often gets painted in light of big events, it was largely driven by small acts of resistance such as sit-ins.
1.11.3. Pro: If the Trump administration is treated as just another Republican administration, its abnormalities will become normalized.
1.11.3.1. Con: A substantial number of Trump Administration officials were employed in previous Republican-run governments.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.4.
1.11.5. Con: "Acceptable civilized behaviour" is an overly subjective concept that is in the eye of the beholder.
1.11.6. Con: The actions of the Trump administration are not outside of the realm of acceptable civilized behavior.
1.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.5.
1.11.6.2. Pro: When dealing with a person face-to-face it would be unfair to pre-judge them based on opposition rhetorical, sound bites, and possible media bias.
1.11.6.3. Pro: There is no proof that the government officials have done anything "wrong."
1.11.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.2.
1.11.6.3.2. Pro: "Wrongness" is relative. To some, the Trump administration upholds their rights and the rights of the citizens who voted them into power. Without a metric for assessing inherent "wrongness" denial of service becomes an arbitrary punishment people dole out when they feel like it.
1.11.6.3.3. Pro: Even though they may work for the Trump administration, representatives may not agree with all of his problematic viewpoints.
1.11.6.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.
1.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.11.9. Pro: Donald Trump has bragged about committing [sexual assault](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-04/billy-bush-says-infamous-access-hollywood-trump-tape-is-real/9224358).
1.11.9.1. Con: This was "locker room talk" and was not intended to be taken seriously. Trump was not really admitting to committing sexual assault.
1.11.9.1.1. Con: It would be very weird for a person to brag about committing assault if they have never actually assaulted someone.
1.11.9.1.1.1. Con: [Braggadocio means not only bragging, but bragging about something that’s not true](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/braggadocio). It happens all the time.
1.11.9.1.2. Con: Bragging about committing sexual assault, regardless of whether one has actually committed said assault, means the person bragging believes assaulting women is an "accomplishment," or something to be proud of.
1.11.9.1.2.1. Pro: People brag about things they believe to be accomplishments or impressive, and that they are proud of.
1.11.10. Con: President Trump's [predecessors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=SeJmmQ5y9eQ) also [engaged in behavior](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/measuring-presidents-misdeeds) that could be defined as "outside of the realm of acceptable civilized behavior."
1.11.10.1. Con: The severity of President Trump's offenses surpasses that of those engaged in by his predecessors.
1.11.10.2. Con: The parent claim's [citation](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/measuring-presidents-misdeeds) still makes the point of the top-level claim by explicitly and implicitly stating that Trump's actions are much farther out such that they are "outside the realm of acceptable civilized behavior."
1.11.10.2.1. Pro: From the [source](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/measuring-presidents-misdeeds): "These days, even Nixon’s underhandedness begins to look upstanding. William McFeely, now eighty-seven, and retired from the University of Georgia, covered Andrew Johnson and Grant. “I think Nixon was pretty bad, but I think that even he had a respect for the Constitution, and for a constitutional sense of the value of the Presidency,” McFeely says. “Trump trounces on those."
1.11.10.2.2. Pro: From the [source](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/measuring-presidents-misdeeds): "Those never-befores ought to have become never-agains. But they haven’t. Trump has already done some of them—not secretly but publicly, gleefully, and without consequence—and is under investigation for more. William Leuchtenburg, ninety-five, supervised the work from T.R. to L.B.J. “However much Richard Nixon deserved impeachment and the end of his Presidency... what he did does not match the Trump Presidency in its malfeasance, and in the depth of his failure as President."
1.11.11. Con: Just because such policies "can" be adopted doesn't mean that they ought to be. There are other ways to signal one's political opinions, including speaking, public demonstrations, and filing petitions.
1.11.11.1. Pro: Excluding anybody associated with the Trump organization from normal society is an extreme response to policy differences. People are already able to show Trump that his behavior is unacceptable through elections.
1.11.11.2. Con: When one party in a bipartisan system controls the presidency, the Senate, and Congress, affecting the private lives of officials may be the only way to influence them to fall outside of party lines and change their voting practices.
1.11.11.2.1. Con: There are a variety of other, much more legitimate and civil ways of influencing those in power available. First of those are the national elections that take place every two years.
1.11.12. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.
