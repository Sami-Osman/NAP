Discussion Name: Should bilingualism be mandatory in Canada?

1. Bilingualism should be mandatory for Canadian citizens.
1.1. Pro: Mandatory bilingualism prevents English from becoming the de facto national language, and therefore protects other minority languages apart from French from being marginalised.
1.1.1. Con: Forcing everyone to learn multiple languages does not guarantee that all of those languages will see equal use on a meaningful level.
1.2. Pro: Bilingualism is a huge international advantage. Not having it places Canada at a disadvantage to its European counterparts.
1.2.1. Con: European countries do not have mandatory bilingualism.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The education system in Belgium - a linguistically divided country - teaches Dutch to French speakers and vice versa only as a second language, not enforcing full bilingualism.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The teaching \(of the other main national language\) as a second language in schools is mandatory though.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Belgium has three official languages \(the third being German\). Learning German is optional \(and not very widespread\)
1.2.2. Pro: Being polyglot is a great advantage in the era of globalization, thus bilinguism should be encouraged.
1.3. Con: Already in government positions people are chosen on bilingualism over merit, leading to less competent candidates and an overrepresentation of Quebec in bureaucracy.
1.3.1. Con: Bilingualism is a skill and having skills is what should determine if a person merits a position or not.
1.3.2. Pro: That position is purely supposition. Bilingualism is a skill that anyone can acquire. Bilinguals in government positions are just as competent as their unilingual counterparts. People aspiring to hold positions that require bilingualism will learn both French and English if they know it's a requirement. Having bilinguals in government allows more citizens to see themselves reflected in their representatives.
1.4. Con: Canada is a large country, and forcing bilingualism in the provinces further from the French hubs will be difficult.
1.4.1. Con: Difficulty in implementing a measure should not be a reason not to do so if the measure is considered beneficial.
1.4.1.1. Con: Benefit should always be measured in tandem with other factors. Economic cost may outweigh bilingualism benefit; one cannot argue that just because bilingualism has benefits, it should be unilaterally implemented.
1.4.2. Pro: Education is a provincial jurisdiction and each province teaches languages differently.
1.4.3. Pro: Why would it only be English areas that reject forced bilingualism? Would this also not be a hard sell in areas with people who only speak French? Canadian bilingualism is meant to be a choice.
1.5. Pro: Countries where everyone understands the same language\(s\) have been shown to be more [prosperous](https://www.businessinsider.com/paper-says-linguistically-homogeneous-countries-do-better-economically-2015-6) and efficient in general. So assuming mandatory bilingualism is implemented well, it should improve the prosperity of Canada.
1.6. Con: No citizen of a free nation should be forced to adopt any language they don't wish to learn.
1.6.1. Con: As long as Canada maintains the official status of multiple languages, its citizens have an obligation to learn them both.
1.6.2. Con: Not communicating in the national language\(s\) undermines the ability of other citizens to debate with you, which goes against the point of free speech.
1.6.3. Con: Being a citizen means accepting civic responsibilities in exchange for the benefits of a well-ordered society. People who refuse those responsibilities should not enjoy the privileges of citizenship.
1.6.4. Pro: Depending on a Canadian's place of residence, career, and social group, learning a second language may be rationally beneficial choice, or it may be a wasteful use of time and resources. 

In the case of the latter, time and resources could be used for other purposes which are more beneficial to the individual and society.
1.6.4.1. Con: Anything learned at school could be equally conscidered as a waste of time since not everything learned will be used by the students. It's impossible to predict if a second langage will be useful or not in the futur.
1.6.5. Pro: Bilingualism in Canada is about respecting its citizenry and giving people a choice as to which official language they want to be served in when dealing with the federal government. It is not intended to force a second language on monolingual citizens.
1.6.6. Con: There are examples of monolingual countries which value freedom as a fundamental virtue, including the United States. Even Canada requires immigrants who seek citizenship to pass a test [in a recognized national language](https://settlement.org/ontario/immigration-citizenship/citizenship/apply-for-canadian-citizenship/how-do-i-apply-for-canadian-citizenship/).
1.7. Con: Mandatory bilingualism would severely increase the difficulty of attaining citizenship.
1.7.1. Con: Bilingualism as a citizenship requirement would allow new immigrants to be more informed about Canada, and permit them to integrate much easier.
1.7.2. Con: More than three quarters of immigrants to Canada speak more than one language, [compared](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016017/98-200-x2016017-eng.cfm) to just a quarter of Canadians.
1.7.3. Con: In 2016, more than half of immigrant families spoke English or French at home [already](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016017/98-200-x2016017-eng.cfm).
1.7.4. Con: Migrants may be given a grace or adaptive period, so they are not required to learn one or two languages right away.
1.7.4.1. Con: The parent claim focuses on citizenship. Granting migrants citizenship, but placing probationary conditions on it \(such as learning a language\) creates second-class citizens; those who are only in name but are not truly full citizens yet.

This may be undesirable.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: Learning the language is already compulsory for those acquiring citizenship in many countries around the world, e.g. Hungary, Estonia.
1.7.5. Pro: Some people would see that as a plus, since it is too easy to get citizenship under the current regulations.
1.8. Pro: Mandatory bilingualism would broaden the cultural knowledge of all citizens; they would feel more a part of a unified Canada.
1.8.1. Con: Multicultural and multilingual states can still have a unified national identity, e.g. mainland Tanzania.
1.8.2. Pro: Mandatory bilingualism would distinguish Canada from other Anglophone or British-descended countries.
1.8.2.1. Con: Having French as an official language already distinguishes Canada from virtually every other former British colony.
1.8.3. Pro: By [learning](https://perspectives-edu.com/why-it-is-important-to-learn-french-in-canada) a second language such as French, English-speaking Canadians would have a better understanding of and respect for others and other cultural diversities in their country.
1.8.4. Con: Canada is well served by having discrete, unique cultures in all its provinces. It does not need cultural homogeneity.
1.8.4.1. Con: The growing inability of BC, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec to cooperate with each other on a political level indicates otherwise.
1.9. Con: Bilingualism in Canada isn't about imposition; it's about personal choice. Canadians enjoy freedom of expression and can use any language they want. Official bilingualism allows people to choose which official language they want to use when dealing with the government; it wasn't intended to impose bilingualism on individuals outside the public service.
