Discussion Name: Is the United Kingdom the rightful owner of the Falkland Islands/Malvinas?

1. Is the United Kingdom the rightful owner of the Falkland Islands/Malvinas?
1.1. Pro: Britain respects the island's democracy even if it votes against British rule, whereas Argentina refuses to recognise the islanders while exploiting the issue as a distraction from domestic problems like the economy.
1.1.1. Pro: In the post-WW2 era, Britain has respected the wishes of multiple former-colonies; granting them independence rather than fighting over them.
1.1.1.1. Pro: This has certainly been the British position since the mid 1960s [hansard.millbanksystems.com](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1966/dec/15/dependent-territories-independence)
1.1.2. Pro: Argentina does not seem to be afraid of accusations that it is colonialist; possibly due to the fact that it is a former colony and thus sees itself as being above accusations of imperialism or colonialism.
1.1.3. Pro: During a UN meeting, Argentina's president at the time \(Cristina Kirchner\) refused a hand-delivered invitation for dialogue from the islanders.
1.2. Con: The UK does not possess the military capabilities to defend the Falkland Islands.
1.2.1. Pro: The UK doesn't posses functional aircraft carriers.
1.2.2. Pro: The ability to project military capabilities was key in defining the borders of empires or the behaviour of client, such as [Ancient Rome](http://www.liquisearch.com/military_of_ancient_rome/capabilities/power_projection) or [Imperial Spain](https://books.google.de/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=power+projection+and+ownership+of+land&source=bl&ots=FnhJsJlwtd&sig=U4wLRuIJMcre3itDEqPWFGQoQWI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6itm13_fWAhVhJcAKHd4QCSwQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=power%20projection%20and%20ownership%20of%20land&f=false).
1.2.2.1. Con: Which is ancient history, not modern politics. In ancient times competition between powers was for territory while today it is embedded in a legal context that changes the equation.
1.2.3. Con: Argentina does not have the capabilities to challenge the UK as its air force is virtually [non-existent](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/argentina-has-just-3-years-invade-the-falklands-18964).
1.2.4. Pro: If the UK cannot protect the population of the Falkland Islands, every country could just take and de facto own a strip of land.
1.2.5. Con: Although not being combat-ready until 2020, the Royal Navy has two 70,000 tonne fleet carriers.
1.2.6. Con: The UK supported the islands [stationary defence](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2017/03/07/britain-beefs-up-defenses-in-the-falkland-islands/) with extensive ground-to-air defence capabilities.
1.2.7. Con: Even if no aircraft carriers are availible, the Royal Navy could still use its submarines to impliment an 'area denial' strategy.
1.2.8. Con: A military intervention by Argentina without a UN resolution would be diplomatically damaging to them and might damage their relations with the UK's allies.
1.2.9. Con: A military intervention by Argentina would be an expensive use of public funds, and probably cost lives and is therefore unlikely to happen under their current democratic political structure.
1.2.10. Con: The UK is part of the NATO. Under article 5 of its treaty, an attack on the Falklands would trigger a casus foederis \(latin: "for the alliance"\). Part of NATO are the most military capable countries in the world â€“ with access to aircraft carriers.
1.2.11. Con: The UK is capable of defending the islands as it did in the past.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Argentine military forces are significantly weaker than they were during the war, and they no longer have a [large, up-to-date airforce](https://www.zona-militar.com/2021/07/09/la-degradacion-de-los-medios-y-actividad-operacional-de-la-fuerza-aerea-argentina-en-las-ultimas-dos-decadas/), while the Argentine submarine fleet is no longer active whatsoever, with a refit to their last active submarine being [cancelled, and their last submarine judged to not be seaworthy.](https://www.nuestromar.org/defensa-y-seguridad/estiman-que-la-llegada-del-proximo-submarino-operativo-para-argentina-demoraria-de-cinco-a-seis-anos/)
1.3. Con: Argentina continues to claim the Falklands as their territory.
1.3.1. Con: Denmark, Canada or any other country could also claim the Falklands as their territory, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the claims are justified.
1.3.2. Pro: Only Argentina asserts legitimacy over the Malvinas in its [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute#Constitution_of_Argentina).
1.3.2.1. Con: Any country could change its constitution to include claims over a territory, that does not mean they legally own it.
1.3.3. Pro: Only Argentina was willing to go to war over the Falkland Islands. Canada and Denmark, in contrast, settled with exchanging a bottle of whiskey in their dispute over the [Hans Islands](http://www.businessinsider.de/canada-and-denmark-whiskey-war-over-hans-island-2016-1?r=US&IR=T).
1.3.3.1. Con: There have been [multiple attempts at reaching a resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute#Sovereignty_dispute), and several times Argentina accepted British sovereignty over the islands, while at times they declined to have the matter settled by the Hague.
1.3.3.2. Con: Going to war for a cause does not make said cause justified. This argument implies Nazi Germany was in the right to go to war over Danzig simply because they decided to go to war over it.
1.3.3.3. Con: Argentina's war was [against the wishes of those living on the islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_referendum).
1.3.3.4. Con: Over the course of the conflict, [the Argentines irresponsibly littered the islands with minefields](https://www.fiassociation.com/article/513/progress_in_removing_argentine_mines_from_the_falkland_islands_), which to this day have not been entirely removed.
1.4. Pro: The islanders have consistently voted to stay British, exercising their right to self-determination.
1.4.1. Pro: 1,513 votes were in favour, compared to just 3 votes against.[bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21750909)
1.5. Con: International bodies judge the Falklands to be part of Argentina.
1.5.1. Pro: A [UN commission](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/29/falkland-islands-argentina-waters-rules-un-commission) decided that the Falkland Islands lie within Argentinian waters.
1.5.1.1. Con: An island being within a country's waters does not mean they own it; [the Hague court found that Colombia's San Andres archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_of_Nicaragua#Colombia), alongside several other islands were legally within Nicaragua's waters, and the waters were handed to Nicaragua, but the islands remain in firm Colombian possession.
1.5.1.2. Con: The same UN commission accepted that there is still a question over the islands.
1.5.2. Con: The UN Special Committee on Decolonization has merely asked for dialogue between the two sides, rather than making any explicit ruling on who owns the islands.  [un.org](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/gacol3298.doc.htm)
1.6. Pro: Made in [1690](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute), Britain's claim of ownership pre-dates any Argentine claim.
1.6.1. Pro: Argentina did not exist until the 1800's, and neither did its pre-independence ancestors make any known claims before the British one.
1.6.2. Con: Argentina did not exist until the 1800's and therefore could not make a claim at this time
1.6.2.1. Con: The pre-independence Argentines were native to Latin America or Spain, not the Falklands.
1.7. Con: The islands are close to Argentina, whereas London is thousands of miles away.
1.7.1. Con: Proximity is not and has never been a basis for ownership. Ask the British with the Faeroe islands, Canada with Greenland and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, and Alaska, and countless other examples around the globe.
1.7.2. Con: The Falkland islanders and their semi-independent government are literally touching the islands, whereas Argentina is 300 miles away.
1.7.3. Con: Proximity alone is not a basis for ownership.
1.7.4. Con: That logic can work both ways; the Falkland Islands/Stanley could rule over Argentina because it's "close".
