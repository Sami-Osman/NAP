Discussion Name: Should Constitutions protect linguistic minorities?

1. Constitutions should protect linguistic minorities.
1.1. Con: Constitutions must cover only general principles and not specific topics.
1.1.1. Pro: Principles of free speech, such as the [1st Amendment of the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), allow people to speak whatever language they want to speak. Therefore, a constitution need only protect freedom of speech generally and does not need specific provisions to protect linguistic minorities.
1.1.2. Con: Constitutions protect specific topics that fit into their general topics, like freedom of speech.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Freedom of speech can be broken down into types of speech. In the same was, linguistic minorities can be protected by constitutions.
1.1.3. Pro: A constitution should not be altered, ideally. As such, is it necessary to establish broad fundamentals rather than addressing specifics.
1.1.3.1. Con: Protecting linguistic minorities could serve as a broad fundamental principle in a constitution.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The Indian Constitution provides for the protection of minority languages [without defining](http://file:///C:/Users/aistu/Downloads/_journals_ymio_8_1_article-p453_18-preview.pdf) what exactly a minority language is or when the rights can be claimed. \(p. 453\)
1.1.4. Pro: Protections for linguistic minorities can be more flexibly and effectively implemented through typical legislative processes rather than in a constitution.
1.1.5. Con: Constitutions enshrines fundamental principles of a state. The protection of minority languages is important enough to warrant this status in many countries around the world. As such constitutions \(such as [India's](https://blog.ipleaders.in/indian-constitution-protect-minority-rights/)\) regularly specify protections for specific minority rights.
1.2. Pro: Without proper protection, languages are increasingly [becoming extinct](https://www.communicaid.com/business-language-courses/blog/why-are-languages-dying/).
1.2.1. Pro: Cultural traditions may be lost if languages become extinct.
1.2.1.1. Pro: In 1999, there were only [300 Asa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_people) people. Their traditions and language are being dissolved by the Massai people.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The [Asa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_people) people of Tanzania spoke Aasax, a language now extinct after they were assimilated into the Massai tribe.
1.2.2. Pro: There are 7000 living languages. UNESCO [predicts](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/15-languages-around-the-world-that-are-going-extinct) that half of these will be extinct by the end of the century.
1.2.3. Pro: A language dies every [two weeks](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/saving-dying-disappearing-languages-wikitongues-culture/).
1.2.4. Pro: Valuable knowledge and information may be lost with languages.
1.2.4.1. Pro: [Cherokee words](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140606-why-we-must-save-dying-languages) exist for every last berry, stem, frond and toadstool in the region, and those names also convey what kind of properties that object might have – whether it’s edible, poisonous or has some medicinal value.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: There are only about [16,000](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/24/674509385/to-save-their-endangered-language-2-cherokee-brothers-learn-as-they-teach) native fluent speakers left.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Linguists study and research minority languages.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Different languages provide distinct pathways of thought and frameworks for thinking and solving problems.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Cherokee is an [incredibly complex language](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140606-why-we-must-save-dying-languages). It is verb rather than noun-based, and those verbs can be conjugated in a multitude of ways based on who they are acting upon.
1.2.5. Pro: Linguistic minorities have words for things/phenomenons that do not exist in the national language.
1.2.5.1. Pro: In Cherokee, the word "[oo-kah-huh-sdee](https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/51658/preserve-dying-languages/)" represents the mouth-watering, cheek-pinching delight experienced when seeing an adorable baby or a kitten.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: ['Aww'](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=aww) is a word in English slang used similarly.
1.2.5.2. Pro: In the Tuvan language, [khoj özeeri](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2012/07/vanishing-languages/) defines the slaughter of a sheep. It implies kindness, humaneness, and a relationship to animals that is also a measure of one's character.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Words such as this have no value for the majority of humanity.
1.2.5.3. Con: The same is true for national languages, yet many people adapt.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: There are many words in [English](https://www.discovery.com/about-us/a-message-from-curiosity), for example, that do not exist in other languages.
1.2.5.4. Pro: There are [13 words](https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/israel/articles/13-words-exist-hebrew-language/) in that do not exist outside the Jewish language.
1.2.5.5. Pro: The mix could enrich other languages.
1.2.6. Con: Languages will not cease existing just because there exist no law explicitly protecting them.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Even when languages are not officially recognized, they are still widely spoken \(e.g. dialects\).
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: For example, [Neapolitan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_language) is widely spoken in the region of Naples in Italy even if the [Italian Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Italy#Legal_status_of_Italian) does not consider it as a minority language.
1.3. Pro: Linguistic minorities are part of society and constitutions must protect society as a whole.
1.3.1. Pro: Political will can help save or even resurrect a language. Constitutional protection can help generate such political will.
1.3.1.1. Pro: [In 2001](http://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/index.html), more than 40 years after the last native speaker died, the language of Oklahoma’s Miami tribe started being learned by students at Miami University in Ohio.
1.3.2. Pro: A state that only represents a small group of people doesn't seek the public good, what in latin is called "salus communis". Thus, it cannot be considered as a democratic state \(a state which tries to satisfy all the people, the "demos"\).
1.3.3. Con: Linguistic majorities, such as English, are part of society and are not protected by constitutions.
1.3.3.1. Pro: In the [US](https://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_lang.html), for example, laws that would make English the official language of the US have been unsuccessful due to violating terms of equal rights.
1.3.4. Pro: By including linguistic minority protection in constitutions, the state is recognising those minorities as an integral part of that society.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Protection of minority communities allows for their participation in the [electoral, judical and education system of a country](https://minorityrights.org/wp-content/uploads/old-site-downloads/download-174-Minority-Rights-The-Key-to-Conflict-Prevention.pdf). This is necessary for them to function as an integral part of society. \(p. 2\)
1.3.4.2. Pro: The state can influence norms about society by sending a message on their stance on certain things through policy decisions. If people see that the state protects linguistic minorities through the constitution, then they're more likely to opt into the narrative that linguistic minorities deserve protection.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: This results in [greater integration of minorities](https://minorityrights.org/wp-content/uploads/old-site-downloads/download-174-Minority-Rights-The-Key-to-Conflict-Prevention.pdf) into mainstream politics and less alienation. \(p. 2\)
1.3.5. Pro: Most constitutions \(or the way they are understood\) have evolved over time in recognition of the ways the original constitution did not serve all of the citizens \(e.g. racial/ gender biases in the rights of citizens\). To move away from protecting the different linguistic groupings within a society would be a regressive step rather than a progressive one.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Many countries have added recognition of additional languages to their constitutions/ legislation in recognition of the need for recognizing and protecting these languages as well as the country's national/ most spoken language. There are ~200 countries of the world, yet ~6,000 recognized [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_language) in 2019, making the vast majority minority languages.
1.4. Con: Linguistic minorities are limits to national cohesion.
1.4.1. Pro: Many African languages are [not well adapted](https://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/406#tocto3n1) for the technological advances of modern society, and therefore communication between nations are limited.
1.4.2. Con: Linguistic minorities limit national cohesion only if the national majority does not respect or accept them. There is therefore a responsibility to protect them.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Disallowing linguistic minorities will cause tension between the national majority and the minority group.
1.4.2.2. Con: Protecting a linguistic minority does not make it a respected language.
1.4.3. Con: National cohesion is akin to colonialism; it strips a group of people of important parts of their culture in order to promote a dominate culture. This is not ideal.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Without protection, languages may only be the first step in breaking down certain cultures.
1.4.4. Con: Linguistic minorities do not generate less or more cohesion. E.g. according to the EU and Eurostat, cohesion indicators are [others](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cohesion-policy-indicators), different from the number of linguistic minorities
1.4.5. Con: Those who identify with linguistic minorities are more likely to get defensive or antagonistic against the rest of the country if they do not feel protected.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Protecting linguistic minorities is important in [supporting peace initiatives](https://minorityrights.org/wp-content/uploads/old-site-downloads/download-174-Minority-Rights-The-Key-to-Conflict-Prevention.pdf) where there is conflict over racial or linguistic differences. \(p. 2\)
1.4.6. Pro: A national citizen may not behave as a single unit if those within the nation do not speak a majority language.
1.4.6.1. Con: In [Kenya](https://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/406#tocto1n7), where the use of English is promoted, it is argued that high level thinking cannot take place in a language one cannot speak well.
1.4.6.2. Con: [Many nations](https://oklahoman.com/article/5234521/language-debate-one-of-many-issues-dividing-americans), such as Switzerland and Canada have citizens that speak more than one language and they prosper without the constraints of one single language.
1.5. Con: Communicability can be seen as a fundamental requirement to live in society and minority languages are an obstacle to proper communication.
1.5.1. Pro: A miscommunication due to majority not speaking the minority language can be dangerous for the speaker and the public in general.
1.5.2. Pro: Linguistic minorities will have fewer economic opportunities if they don't speak the dominant language.
1.5.3. Con: A nation can promote communicability but still protect linguistic minorities.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Countries can promote multilingualism among citizens: encouraging the teaching of multiple languages in schools and the use of multiple languages in civic and everyday life.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Just because minority languages are protected does not mean that the country's lingua franca will cease to exist.
1.6. Pro: Lack of protection for linguistic minorities translates into less future linguistic heterogeneity.
1.6.1. Pro: Language is tied up with cultural heritage, meaning that the culture of a particular place also becomes more homogeneous with the loss of minority languages.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Language is often the only way to convey a community’s songs, stories and poems.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The Aboriginal people [pass down](https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/about/k-12-policies/aboriginal-torres-strait-islander-perspectives/resources/storytelling) stories and concepts solely through speaking. With the [extinction](https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/language/loss-of-aboriginal-languages) of many and the endangerment of the remaining, their stories will be lost.
1.6.2. Con: That's not necessarily a bad thing - homogeneity can make communication and legislation easier, amongst other things.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Having a singular global language can help unite nations that are otherwise different from each other.
1.6.2.2. Con: There are many phrases [and](https://geographical.co.uk/people/cultures/item/2860-get-talking-are-we-losing-indigenous-languages) ideas lost in translation, as some meanings do not translate well into more mainstream languages.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: This can lead to miscommunications between groups.
1.6.2.3. Con: Lack of diversity in culture prevents people in society to think in different ways, as they have fewer things to draw from when trying to think creatively and provide innovative changes for society.
1.7. Pro: People must be free to speak the language they prefer and constitutions should defend this freedom.
1.7.1. Con: There is nothing stopping people from having the freedom to choose which language the want to speak, even if the Constitution doesn't officially protect the language.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Languages die out as elders die [or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language) people shift to using another language.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Languages [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language) dying at an unnaturally rapid rate due to globalization, imperialism, neocolonialism, and linguicide. The pace warrants having protection.
1.7.1.2. Con: As languages die off, there are less people to engage in this language with. This essentially discourages one from continuing to speak it.
1.7.1.3. Con: The state controls essential services which people interact with every day. If these services cannot be accessed through a minority language, minority language speakers are forced to learn and speak majority languages every single time they access state services.
1.7.2. Pro: Historically, the suppression of language has been linked with colonization and domination by other cultures. There is thus a responsibility on part of governments to rectify this harm.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Many of the Indigenous languages once spoken in the land now called Canada have [disappeared](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/06/21/indigenous-languages_a_23465069/) through a mixture of nation extinction, forced language suppression, and official policies of cultural eradication.
1.7.2.2. Pro: By the [18th in 19th centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas#Background), colonization in North America critically endangered most indigenous languages, forcing natives to accept European languages as their own.
1.7.3. Con: People can still [learn](https://www.mezzoguild.com/endangered-languages/) minority or endangered languages in conjunction with the major language spoken.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Although English is the main language accepted and spoken in [Nigeria](https://www.legit.ng/1111665-how-languages-nigeria.html), there are over 500 other minority languages spoken.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: In Nigeria, most people [speak](https://www.legit.ng/1111665-how-languages-nigeria.html) a mix of English and other minor languages. This dilutes the language and may lead to many words being forgotten.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Pidgin is a recognised form of [language](https://unitedlanguagegroup.com/blog/evolution-pidgin-languages/) in its own right, as are bilingualism or multilingualism. While these are often viewed pejoratively by the media, this is in spite of contrary scientific [opinion](http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/JLC/article-full-text-pdf/1DF90CB2103).
1.7.3.2. Pro: Language experts have written extensively to point out that [multilingualism](https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/mag/20454788.html) \(using more than one language in daily life\) is the norm in large parts of the world and is completely normal, even cognitively beneficial.
1.7.3.3. Con: Without proper protections, doing so is considered a hobby rather than a necessary language for native speakers to continue speaking.
1.7.4. Con: The freedom to speak one's language is [already protected](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/minorities.aspx) by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.
1.7.4.1. Pro: [Article 2:1](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/minorities.aspx) declares: 'Persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities \(hereinafter referred to as persons belonging to minorities\) have the right to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, and to use their own language, in private and in public, freely and without interference or any form of discrimination.'
1.7.4.2. Pro: According to [Article 1:1](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/minorities.aspx), states are responsible for protecting linguistic minorities.
1.7.5. Pro: Language is a question of self-expression and communication, both of which are crucial in a functioning democracy. As such, everyone should be free to exercise those rights in the most accessible form available to them.
1.7.5.1. Pro: The [English-only](https://theconversation.com/the-english-only-nt-parliament-is-undermining-healthy-democracy-by-excluding-aboriginal-languages-105048) speaking Northern Territory parliament does not acknowledge aboriginal languages, which is essentially undermining democracy.
1.7.5.2. Con: Communication is dependent upon most people in a given community speaking the same language, which minority languages do not help to achieve.
1.7.6. Pro: It is often a privilege of upper classes to be able to speak multiple languages. By not protecting the regional/ minority languages, vulnerable sections of society can get left behind.
1.7.6.1. Pro: The ability to speak multiple languages is something that is taught. Being able to access the best education a country has to offer is not always a universal right/ opportunity and that in turn affects the access to language learning and communication abilities of people from different socioeconomic \(and/or regional\) backgrounds.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Being unable to speak all the languages of a country can make it harder to access further education and training. It also limits the pool of jobs that a person can apply for, the places they can live, the networks they can create. This makes it particularly important that linguistic minorities are protected by their state.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Without state protection, the already outlined impacts of limited access to jobs/ mobility/ education are compounded by issues accessing the state itself. Linguistic protections include translating road signs, voting documentation, access to interpreters in healthcare, access to education and services through the minority language. Failing to protect language rights of citizens can have serious impacts for the citizen.
1.7.6.2.2. Pro: It is also in the state's best interest to promote linguistic access of linguistic minorities. With a higher rate of employment and education among citizens, the country will likely have increased economic growth compared to a situation where that linguistic access is not provided.
