Discussion Name: Should employees be banned from discussing politics at work?

1. Employees should be banned from discussing politics at work.
1.1. Pro: Discussing politics at work creates a hostile work environment.
1.1.1. Pro: Many employees would leave their work if they found out that their colleagues had different political opinions than them.
1.1.1.1. Pro: According to research, [1 in 5](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/app/uploads/sites/2/20-02-03-Politics-at-Work-Fact-Sheet-Glassdoor.pdf) US employees have expressed interest to not work with a colleague who would vote for a presidential candidate they oppose.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Politics can be discussed at work without disclosing personal preferences for specific candidates.
1.1.1.2. Con: According to research, [67%](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/the-dos-donts-of-politics-at-work/) of US employees would actually want to be employed at an organization which supports a different political party than they do.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Research shows that [1 in 4](https://library.glassdoor.com/c/politics-at-work-survey?x=1fbpBp) US employees might think about leaving an organization if the majority of their colleagues supported different political parties than they do.
1.1.1.4. Con: This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it allows employees to make more informed moral choices about the people they associate with.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: For many people in the pro-life camp on abortion, the views of the pro-choice camp are [repugnant](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dr-kent-ingle-pro-abortion-bills-across-country-are-inhumane-repugnant-and-vile), and they would probably prefer to not have to be in constant contact with such people.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: This is harmful for the company as it will possibly lose valuable employees.
1.1.1.5. Con: In a survey of 500 employees across the USA, only [24%](https://clutch.co/consulting/legal/resources/political-expression-impact-workplace-culture) believed that it was important to work for a company whose political opinions were similar to theirs.
1.1.2. Con: Whether discussions about politics create a hostile work environment depends heavily on the context and the way in which they happen. Per se, they do not create a hostile environment.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In companies where employees largely share the same political opinions, discussing them will hardly result in a hostile environment.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: There is a significant lack of [political diversity](https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/political-diversity-in-workplace/) in many companies, particularly in the tech industry. In these circumstances, people are not likely to meet others with different opinions.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Even if employees broadly agree on most political issues, they might have different opinions on single contentious issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights, or foreign policy which could easily blow up into hostile discussions.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Given that employees expect to see their coworkers daily and consequently expect the relationship to be one which lasts for some time, they are unlikely to have political conversations in a manner which unnecessarily antagonizes their coworkers.
1.1.2.3. Con: The political landscape is extremely [polarized](https://people.howstuffworks.com/what-happens-polarized-us-political-system-now.htm). Therefore, the chances of disagreements and hostility are significantly high.
1.1.3. Pro: Since many people have different political leanings, employees are likely to have disagreements in the workplace which would create animosity among them.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Many employees feel that they are coerced into changing their political leanings.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: According to research, over [1 in 4](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/politics-in-the-workplace-do-you-need-a-policy/) US employees have said that their colleagues want them to stop supporting the political parties they currently support.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: This is no different than having your political opinion changed by a group of friends who think differently than you do. There is nothing unique about co-workers being compelled to change their political leanings because of peer pressure.
1.1.3.2. Pro: A [survey](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/42percent-of-american-workers-say-they-have-fought-about-politics-at-work.html) of US employees from 2019 indicates that one third consider their workplace not inclusive of different political perspectives.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Politics is very personal and people tend to hold their beliefs extremely strongly. Therefore, people tend to take political attacks [personally](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/28/14088992/brain-study-change-minds).
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: A [survey](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/work-politics/516120/) found that nearly 50% of workers reported seeing a political conversation transform into an argument during work.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: In a survey, [26%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191211005024/en/Reflektive-Survey-Employees-Talking-Politics-Work) of respondents have said that they are unable to have political conversations with their colleagues without the conversation getting intense.
1.1.3.3.3. Con: Many people are [disillusioned](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/apr/01/david-blunkett-involving-people-politics-policymaking) from the political system to the point where they may come across as apathetic. They might take part in political conversations but are unlikely to get into heated arguments about politics.
1.1.3.3.4. Pro: Certain people cannot discuss politics with anyone having a different opinion without taking it personally.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Politics does not make for good work conversation since people are unlikely to change their [opinions](https://medium.com/\@BrianBeckcom/why-people-dont-can-t-change-their-minds-about-politics-even-when-they-know-they-are-wrong-af80dffa1c15) after having a discussion about it.
1.1.3.5. Con: Employees can learn how to have conversations around politics in a productive manner.
1.1.3.5.1. Pro: People often become familiar, and even good friends with many of their coworkers. Therefore, they are likely to try to have these discussions in productive fashions.
1.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: A [survey](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/why-having-friends-at-work-is-so-crucial-for-your-success.html) of 33,000 workers in the tech industry found that over half of them had made a best friend at work.
1.1.3.5.1.2. Pro: People would not want to run the risk of ruining their friendships by getting into a heated argument with coworkers.
1.1.3.5.1.3. Con: Many people find it challenging to set [personal boundaries](https://humanparts.medium.com/the-honest-truth-about-why-some-people-cant-set-boundaries-aac273c456fa) in interpersonal relationships. It is possible that a coworker will be unable to communicate to their colleague that a political conversation is offending them. Therefore, the discussion is unlikely to be productive.
1.1.3.5.1.3.1. Con: There are many [ways](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/7-totally-normal-ways-to-set-boundaries-with-your-work-friends) by which friends at work can learn to establish boundaries with one another.
1.1.3.5.2. Con: There is no guarantee that employees will attempt to have these productive conversations.
1.1.3.5.2.1. Con: Many companies already conduct communication training [programs](https://simplifytraining.com/course/effective-communication-for-employees-training/) with their staff. Teaching employees how to manage political conversations can be a part of these programs.
1.1.3.5.2.2. Con: Many people are averse to [conflict](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2019/03/12/why-are-we-so-averse-to-conflict-the-good-fight-explains-why/#208922465fd7). Hence, they will try to avoid unnecessarily heated arguments.
1.1.3.5.2.3. Pro: Having these conversations in a productive fashion requires employees to be actively interested in being empathetic, respectful, and open-minded, all of which takes a great deal of mental and emotional effort. There is no reason to suspect that the majority of employees will be interested in making this effort.
1.1.3.5.2.4. Pro: Employees who feel that their political beliefs are in a majority in the workplace will feel secure and will not feel the need to bother with being delicate in their political discussions with the few employees who disagree.
1.1.3.5.3. Pro: Employees can assess if another employee is [open](https://hbr.org/2016/09/should-you-talk-about-politics-at-work) to conversation about politics. Therefore, they can choose to initiate conversations surrounding politics with those who are comfortable with it.
1.1.3.5.4. Pro: While having a conversation about politics, employees can make an effort to understand where other employees are [coming from](https://hbr.org/2016/09/should-you-talk-about-politics-at-work). This makes the conversation more welcoming.
1.1.3.6. Con: People are likely to have political conversations with colleagues who share [similar political opinions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/close-encounters/201812/why-do-we-people-who-are-similar-us). They are likely to avoid such conversations with other coworkers.
1.1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.1.3.8. Con: Many companies have come to identify with certain [political positions](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/17/18139699/companies-nike-patagonia-dicks-politics-kaepernick-trump-ads). It is highly likely that the people they employ will be at least tolerant of these positions. This would in turn create a circumstance in which most people have similar political opinions in such companies, leading to a reduced chance of disagreement.
1.1.3.8.1. Pro: Conservatives are unlikely to seek employment at an openly liberal company, and vice versa.
1.1.3.8.1.1. Pro: When people were asked in a survey if they would work for a company after being told it was conservative, they became [43.9%](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-do-consumers-feel-when-companies-get-political) less likely to apply there.
1.1.3.8.1.1.1. Con: However, the same trend did not apply when a company was identified as [liberal](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-do-consumers-feel-when-companies-get-political), implying that there is some other logic at work here than simple partisanship.
1.1.4. Con: Most people do not discuss politics with people they are not familiar with. Colleagues are likely to discuss politics with those they're comfortable with. It is therefore unlikely that the freedom to talk politics at work would create a hostile environment.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Surveys [indicate](https://www.people-press.org/2019/06/19/the-publics-level-of-comfort-talking-politics-and-trump/) that Americans are cautious of and not very comfortable with talking about politics with people they do not know well.
1.1.4.2. Pro: If employees have controversial political conversations with coworkers they are comfortable with, it is unlikely those coworkers will get offended.
1.1.4.3. Con: Many people have political conversations and arguments with people on online forums or social media. If they can have discussions about politics with complete strangers, they can have these discussions with their acquaintances at work.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: It has been proven that people are more [comfortable](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/05/13/more-people-are-comfortable-discussing-politics-in-person-than-on-their-phones-or-via-social-media/) discussing politics in person that online. Therefore, employees are capable of discussing politics with colleagues whom they may not know very well.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: People are more afraid of having their opinions rejected by someone they know as opposed to a stranger [online](https://theconversation.com/why-do-people-talk-politics-online-because-they-dont-care-what-you-think-101700). Because of that, employees are more comfortable discussing politics with people online than with a coworker.
1.1.5. Con: Open disagreements and conflict are [not always bad](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238993) - they can help to clear out negative dynamics and create resolution, allowing coworkers to move forward.
1.1.5.1. Con: A negative team dynamic in the workplace is likely to exist because of reasons other than employees' political opinions. Having disagreements over politics is unlikely to improve team dynamics.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely employees are aware of each other's political opinions unless the opinions are discussed at work. Therefore, employees' political opinions cannot be the cause of a negative dynamic at the workplace.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Colleagues might be able to view each other's political opinions on social media. That way, they would be aware of their coworkers' opinions even without them being discussed at work.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Most employees are unlikely to have ever met their coworkers before they start the job, and are therefore unlikely to have any prior knowledge of them.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: It is entirely possible for a team's dynamics to have initially been positive, but to have soured after political opinions were first introduced into the mix.
1.1.5.2. Con: Many people's political opinions are [rigid](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190829081401.htm), which means coworkers might never see eye to eye on them. Hence, a resolution to the conflict would be unlikely.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Various studies suggest that interactions with people who have different political attitudes leads to bonding through more [political tolerance](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088064?seq=1), more [empathy and perspective-taking](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.504), and less [prejudice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16737372).
1.1.5.3.1. Con: It is by no means clear whether political discussions at work actually confront employees with colleagues they disagree with - or whether they rather discuss politics only with those they are already in agreement with.
1.1.6. Con: Only uncivil discourse creates a hostile work environment. Civil discourse of disagreement promotes civil behavior and eliminates hostility.
1.1.7. Con: If disagreements can create a hostile environment, there will be other issues being discussed which could create disagreement. Therefore, discussing politics does not create a hostile environment but intolerant people do.
1.1.7.1. Con: Few issues are as divisive and get as personal as politics since it is tied up with [personal and group identities](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/11/cover-politics). This isn't the case for many other issues.
1.1.7.2. Pro: People could disagree on issues that are work-specific. Yet, it would be unreasonable to ban discussions related to work.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Disagreements on work could lead to [innovative](http://bwpeople.businessworld.in/article/Encouraging-Disagreements-at-Your-Workplace-could-Lead-to-More-Innovations/08-05-2018-148574/) new strategies to reduce efficiency and make better policy. Discussions on politics would have no comparable benefit.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: Issues such as dress codes, their interpretation, and disputes about their enforcement can be a [source of disagreement](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/tough-questions-about-implementing-your-dress-code-1917932).
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: People often disagree on issues of which [approach to work](https://www.atlasstaffing.net/blog/6-common-workplace-conflicts-and-how-to-deal-with-them) is the most effective.
1.1.7.2.4. Con: Politics is seen as something [personal](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/11/cover-politics) as opposed to work.
1.1.7.3. Con: If there are already a set number of issues people will disagree on, it is unreasonable to add another issue to the mix that makes the problem worse.
1.2. Pro: Discussing politics at work lowers productivity.
1.2.1. Con: Productivity should not be seen as a supreme value, and especially so in a democracy.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Democracy relies on a lively political discourse through which citizens can form and exchange opinions. Banning discussions of politics at work goes against that.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: People spend most of their waking hours at work. Excluding this space from the political discourse is therefore highly problematic.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Political discussions at home are becoming more and more difficult as the share of people living alone is rising. In both the [US](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/one-person-households.html) and [Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20180706-1?inheritRedirect=true), about one-third of households are single-person.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Americans work an average of [8.5 hours a day](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-average-hours-per-week-worked-in-the-us-2060631#average-hours-per-day-worked-us). To be denied access to political discussion at work is therefore meaningfully equivalent to being unable to discuss politics for a third of their working lives.
1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: There are currently over [20 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/08/april-2020-jobs-report/) people unemployed in the United States, in a situation that is expected to continue and worsen into the future. This would not apply to them.
1.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Part time jobs, which have far less intensive hours, make up somewhere between [15-35% of total employment](https://data.oecd.org/emp/part-time-employment-rate.htm) across western economies.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Discussions about politics at work present one of the few opportunities to encounter and engage with different political opinions. This opportunity should not be banned.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Outside work, people generally spend time with others who share the same or similar political attitudes.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Surveys from the United States [illustrate](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/05/politics/friends-political-party/index.html) that most people have barely any friends who associate with the opposing one of the two major parties.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Political disagreements are highly important, as they create voters who are less likely to blindly toe a [party line](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2019/07/26/people-who-experience-political-disagreement-with-those-who-are-close-to-them-are-less-likely-to-follow-the-party-line/).
1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Voters who have experienced political disagreement are likelier to make their decisions on the basis of [facts and reasoning](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2019/07/26/people-who-experience-political-disagreement-with-those-who-are-close-to-them-are-less-likely-to-follow-the-party-line/), rather than bursts of partisan emotion.
1.2.1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.6.
1.2.1.1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.1.2.6. Con: There is [ample evidence](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/533b5z/how-hard-is-to-change-a-mind) suggesting that people are not willing to believe in political opinions that oppose their own. Therefore, there is no meaningful benefit to engaging with different political opinions.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Democracy does not rely on the exchange of opinions as much as it does on [intelligent and informed voting](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2018/mar/15/daniels-informed-voters-are-key-democracy/465956/). Given that people can still choose to learn about policies and parties, a ban would not harm people's capacity to make good democratic decisions.
1.2.1.2. Pro: From the standpoint of pure productivity, all conversations that are not related to work should be banned. This is a stance hardly anyone would support.
1.2.1.3. Con: Productivity is essential for companies since it is directly tied to their profits.
1.2.1.4. Con: Productivity helps increase economic growth, which is ultimately beneficial to everyone.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: The benefits of growth are often spread in a highly [unequal](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/14/the-benefits-of-americas-hot-economy-have-been-unevenly-spread) fashion throughout society.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Increased economic growth leads to more [jobs and higher tax revenue](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/economic-growth/benefits-growth/) which can be used to benefit people.
1.2.1.5. Con: Considering productivity to be important and worthy of consideration is not the same as considering it to be a supreme and over-riding value.
1.2.2. Con: [55%](https://facilityexecutive.com/2019/08/do-political-discussions-affect-productivity/) of employees do not believe that discussing politics has any negative impact on productivity.
1.2.3. Pro: People are likely to be distracted from their work if they discuss politics at the office.
1.2.3.1. Con: Politics at work can be discussed during downtime and without distracting from work, for example during lunch and coffee breaks, or during the wait times inevitable in most jobs.
1.2.3.2. Con: Many jobs don't require all of an employee's attention. For example, manual labor and routine tasks oftentimes allow for conversations without interfering with work.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Political discussions are usually interesting and topical, and therefore very likely to draw most people's attention away from work which they perceive as a boring obligation.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: A survey found that the majority of employees experience at least [five hours of boredom](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/bored-at-work-survey-says-you-re-not-alone-1.666424) a week in the workplace.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Many people find their work incredibly [satisfying](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/12/job-satisfaction) and rewarding. Even if people discuss politics at work, it is unlikely that they will be distracted from something they find meaningful.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Researchers at Challenger, Grey & Christmas calculated that the nomination testimony of Brett Kavanaugh cost U.S. employers [$1.76 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/29/work-productivity-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-nomination) in lost productivity. If employees had not wasted time discussing the nomination, this cost would not have been incurred.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: This estimate refers to workers who watched or otherwise paid attention to the nomination testimony of Kavanaugh. This does not necessarily include discussions of politics at work. Even where they don't happen, workers might have paid attention to the testimony instead of their work.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: Hardly any political events draw attention and distract from work like the nomination testimony did. The [cited article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/29/work-productivity-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-nomination), thus, compares it to other extraordinary events, for example the Super Bowl. Events of this kind are not representative of how distracting discussion about politics usually are.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: It is estimated that over [69 million employees](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/29/work-productivity-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-nomination) were paying attention to the drama, rather than their jobs, over the course of the testimony.
1.2.3.5. Con: People are likely to be distracted from their work no matter the subject matter.
1.2.4. Pro: During the 2016 Presidential election campaign season, a survey of the U.S. workforce found that [one in four employees](https://hbr.org/2017/03/navigating-political-talk-at-work) were negatively impacted by political conversations at work.
1.2.4.1. Con: It is questionable whether the situation during the election campaign in 2016 is representative of the effects that political discussions ordinarily have at work.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Presidential election campaigns happen every four years in the United States and draw attention like few other political events. That makes them and their effects outliers.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: The election campaign in 2016 was especially controversial and might have led to political discussions that were more stressful than in other years. Half the respondents in the [cited survey](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/09/employees-political-talk), therefore, indicated that they were more likely to discuss politics during that election season than in the past.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Even if it was not entirely representative, it demonstrates the capacity for political discussions to be disruptive to the work environment.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The survey found that employees believed[stress and increased negativity](https://hbr.org/2017/03/navigating-political-talk-at-work) were caused by political discussions at work.
1.2.4.3. Con: Having a majority \(75%\) of people pander to a minority \(25%\) because they are “stressed” is antithetical to core values of free speech.
1.2.5. Con: Many people are [stressed](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/02/stressed-nation) by the political climate of their country. Discussing these issues at work allows employees to vent and share their concerns. This is likely to reduce [stress](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/study-confirms-sharing-shared-feelings-reduces-stress-0204141) and, consequently, increase productivity.
1.2.5.1. Con: This only holds true in those workplaces where employees are sympathetic to each others' politics. Where there is disagreement, they are likelier to find their attempts to vent frustrating rather than helpful, consequently increasing overall stress.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Disagreeing with a colleague does not mean productivity decreases. When the situation becomes stressful or toxic because of the disagreement it’s a personality \(poor emotion control\) or a social problem \(bullying\) first and a topical problem later.
1.2.5.2. Pro: 56% of men and 43% of women in a [survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191211005024/en/Reflektive-Survey-Employees-Talking-Politics-Work) have said that the volatile nature of US politics affects their work performance. Thus, discussing politics at work is likely to aggravate that problem.
1.2.6. Con: Through political discussions, employees could navigate how political parties or future policies could affect the business they work for.
1.2.7. Con: Discussing sports, restaurants, or what everyone did over the weekend might lower productivity. However, no one would suggest banning those discussions.
1.3. Con: A ban on discussing politics contradicts how a democracy should function.
1.3.1. Pro: Democratic countries generally guarantee their citizens the right to freely express themselves. The workplace is no exception to that.
1.3.1.1. Pro: In the United States, the freedom of speech is enshrined [in the First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States) to the constitution.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: In the United States, the protection of free speech as laid out in the First Amendment [does not](https://www.govdocs.com/talking-politics-at-work-protected-free-speech/) necessarily cover work places. It merely prevents the government from implementing laws that restrict free speech.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Accordingly, the National Labor Relations Act [only protects](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/demonstrators-midst-handling-political-activity-workplace) political speech at work that has a clear link to work, for example discussions about unionization.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Countries are either signatories to or have ratified treaties that empower their citizens to freely express themselves.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), which all democracies have adopted, declares in Article 19 that everyone "has the right to freedom of opinion and expression".
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx), which most countries have signed, includes "the right to hold opinions without interference" as well as "the right to freedom of expression".
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: It is common and generally accepted that countries will implement provisions of treaties [with reservations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_\(law\)). For example, if such provisions interfere with other legal frameworks or national law, they will not be implemented.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: The [European Convention on Human Rights \(p. 12\)](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf) in Article 10 guarantees "the right to freedom of expression".
1.3.1.2.4. Con: States tend to violate international law when it suits their [interests](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2016/10/12/how-us-violates-international-law-plain-sight). If allowing their citizens to freely express themselves is detrimental to their interests, there is no reason why countries should be bound to the provisions of those treaties.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Politics is an important part of many people's lives. Therefore, they should be allowed to discuss it at work.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: There are many things important to people's lives - like engaging in hobbies. Yet, they aren't allowed in the workplace because of their detrimental impacts.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: There is a clear difference between discussing politics, which can be done while working and without necessarily impacting productivity, and hobbies that fully occupy one's attention.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.2.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: Political discourse can always occur outside the workplace.
1.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: If politics is an important part of employees' lives, they can still discuss it with family, friends and on multiple platforms online.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: Reports concluded that [87%](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/the-impact-of-politics-on-workplace-productivity/) of employees viewed social media posts of a political nature at work.
1.3.1.4. Con: Companies do not owe the same level of freedom to their employees that democratic governments do to their citizens. Consequently, workplaces can choose to limit their employees' freedom of expression.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Companies are answerable to their shareholders whose main objective is to maximize profits for themselves. However, governments are elected by people to safeguard and promote their own interests.
1.3.1.5. Con: About [43% of all countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/14/more-than-half-of-countries-are-democratic/) - near half - are not democracies, and should not have to be beholden to the norms of democratic countries.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.3.3. Con: Since employees generally support the ban, a ban on discussing politics at work would be democratic.
1.3.3.1. Con: According to a [2017 survey](https://clutch.co/hr/resources/policies-regarding-politics-workplace) of 1000 employees in the US, only a third of them believe their company should have any policy regarding political expression at work at all.
1.3.3.2. Pro: About 60% of Americans agree with the statement that free speech should be limited in places where it could cause offense according to a [2019 survey \(p. 17\)](https://campaignforfreespeech.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Free-Speech-Survey-Standard-Banners.pdf).
1.3.3.2.1. Con: The survey asked this question with reference to universities and social media. To generalize from the answers to attitudes about workplace policies is therefore problematic.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: The survey implies to respondents through the wording of other questions that it focuses on acts of free speech such as "racism, radicalism, climate change denial and Holocaust denial". These issues are more severe than political discussions in general.
1.3.3.3. Con: Democracy is a system that fails to secure individual rights. Individual rights are a [basic tenet](https://www.founderoftheday.com/founder-of-the-day/federalist-51) of the American system of government. Therefore, a "democratic" ban would violate individual rights.
1.3.3.4. Con: According to research, [52%](https://www.reed.co.uk/recruiter-advice/is-it-ok-to-talk-about-politics-in-the-workplace/) of employees in the UK said that they would happily have a conversation with their colleagues about whom they voted for.
1.3.3.5. Con: Research shows [60%](https://www.reed.co.uk/recruiter-advice/is-it-ok-to-talk-about-politics-in-the-workplace/) of UK workers believe that having political conversations at work is acceptable.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Most US employees believe that political discussions are unacceptable at work.
1.3.3.6.1. Con: The fact that a form of behavior is deemed unacceptable does not necessarily translate into support for an outright ban. It might merely describe expectations about behavior.
1.3.3.6.1.1. Pro: Some [84%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/15/whats-morally-acceptable-it-depends-on-where-in-the-world-you-live/) of Americans consider extramarital affairs as morally unacceptable, yet hardly anyone calls for a legal ban and, accordingly, for legal punishment of adultery.
1.3.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: Vote in the Parliament on a law banning extramarital affairs was [delayed](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/09/20/indonesias-president-delays-a-law-banning-extramarital-sex) by Indonesia's President after a [public outcry](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-politics-rights/thousands-rally-against-indonesian-bill-to-ban-extra-marital-sex-idUSKBN1W819X) against it.
1.3.3.6.1.2. Pro: The [majority of Americans](https://www.statista.com/statistics/539660/acceptable-and-unacceptable-behavior/) consider speech acts such as jokes and comments about race and sexuality, both in public and in private, as unacceptable, yet there are no calls for a general ban.
1.3.3.6.1.3. Con: Incest is deemed morally unacceptable by people and that has translated into the [criminalization](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/white-collar-crime/incest-laws-criminal-charges.htm) of relationships based on incest.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: [3 in 5](https://library.glassdoor.com/c/politics-at-work-survey?x=1fbpBp) employees are against discussing politics at work.
1.3.3.6.3. Con: Even though many US employees believe political discussions are unacceptable at work, [57%](https://library.glassdoor.com/c/politics-at-work-survey?x=1fbpBp) tend to discuss politics at work. This proves that the majority of people actually want to have political conversations at work.
1.3.3.6.3.1. Con: It could be the case that employees were roped into political conversations even when they did not want to have them.
1.3.4. Con: If the ban is imposed by employers and explicitly stipulated in the contract before hiring, then it is not undemocratic as the employees voluntarily enter the agreement.
1.3.4.1. Pro: There are precedents within democracies for people being able to voluntarily sign away certain rights within private agreements.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: It is possible for people to sign away their right to pursue [lawsuits](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/rights-after-signing-legal-contract-69546.html).
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: It is possible to sign away rights to [free trade](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/rights-after-signing-legal-contract-69546.html) by entering into exclusive contracts with certain suppliers or buyers.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: History is full of dangerous and unjustified precedents. On its own, something having precedence in the past does not justify it on moral grounds.
1.3.4.2. Con: De-facto, many employees have little choice about whether to enter this agreement since they need a job and don't have the freedom to be picky or to negotiate details.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: If this policy is applied across the board, there will be no company left who allows politics to be discussed at work. As a result, people will not have the choice to work for a company that doesn't have this policy.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: If employees don't think being allowed to discuss politics at work is a big enough issue for them to negotiate, that means they are not losing out on much.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Most people are not in a position in which they can negotiate with a prospective employer over whether they are allowed to discuss politics at work, since they need a job.
1.3.5. Con: Even in a democracy, people's freedom of expression is often limited when it negatively impacts others.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The Canadian Supreme Court held that threats of physical violence fell outside the realm of protected speech since they have the capacity to escalate violence and be injurious to others \([p. 14](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/freedom-expression/limits-expression.pdf)\).
1.3.5.2. Pro: In France, the right to free speech does not include the right to deny the Holocaust or other crimes against humanity \([p. 24](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/freedom-expression/limits-expression.pdf)\). The denial of these crimes can cause feelings of suffering and trauma for survivors \(and their descendants\) of these crimes.
1.3.5.3. Con: None of the examples of the limits on free speech in a democracy are comparable to this case: there is no universal harm in the civil discussion of politics.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Almost every country has laws that restrict the spread of [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech).
1.3.5.5. Con: Limitations on the freedom of speech usually cover very specific speech acts - whereas a ban on discussing politics at work would ban speech on a whole topic.
1.3.5.5.1. Pro: It is impossible to define what constitutes 'politics' and what does not. Therefore, it is better to err on the side of caution and not implement a ban.
1.3.5.5.1.1. Pro: Every aspect of modern life relates to and is influenced by politics. Discussions of just about every topic can therefore have a political dimension.
1.3.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: One of the largest problems in the modern world is that of inequality, which is a deeply [political](https://www.thebrokeronline.eu/inequality-a-political-problem-requiring-a-political-solution/) issue.
1.3.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: For [sexual minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_movement), their very identity and rights are a hotly debated political issue.
1.3.5.5.1.1.3. Con: Even if all topics are somewhat political, it is possible to engage in discussions about them without direct references to political institutions such as parties, government, and policy.
1.3.5.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Here, for example, is a purely moral discussion on [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/philosophical/introduction.shtml).
1.3.5.5.1.1.3.2. Con: In a face to face conversation about a controversial topic, the discussion is likely to be [heated](https://hbr.org/2017/06/how-to-de-escalate-an-argument-with-a-coworker). People will use whichever arguments they can to support their position. This includes arguments in the realm of politics.
1.3.5.5.1.2. Pro: Many discussions can be interpreted as both political and non-political; this categorization is therefore oftentimes subjective.
1.3.5.5.1.2.1. Pro: For example, if an employee discusses with colleagues that they would like to be addressed with a specific gender pronoun, this could be interpreted as a personal matter or as an expression of a larger political issue.
1.3.5.5.1.2.2. Pro: For example, if employees make fun of a politician's looks, this can be interpreted as a discussion of unpolitical superficialities or as an expression of political stances.
1.3.5.5.1.3. Con: While difficult to define, people can be assumed to recognize discussions of politics when they see them, similar to how this has [famously been argued](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/392/jacobellis-v-ohio) for obscenity.
1.3.5.5.1.4. Pro: Many issues that directly relate to work are inherently political, such as the political context of labor regulations, unionization and safety standards.
1.3.5.5.1.5. Con: The ban could be expansive enough that it precludes even partially political content.
1.3.5.5.2. Con: Hate speech laws cover a [wide](https://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hate-speech) variety of speech acts - yet, governments legislate to restrict them.
1.4. Con: A ban on discussing politics is impossible to implement in a way that does not create new problems.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.5.1.
1.4.2. Pro: It is difficult to define where 'at work' begins and ends, for example with an eye on lunch breaks, training, business trips, but also larger issues such as freelancing.
1.4.2.1. Pro: This issue is becoming [increasingly relevant](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n23/katrina-forrester/what-counts-as-work) as employment in a traditional sense is becoming less prevalent, for example through the rise of the [gig economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker).
1.4.2.2. Con: Although loopholes are likely to exist, companies mitigate them by mandating that no conversation involving politics can take place inside the premises of the workplace, on work-mandated communication channels or on work-related events and trips.
1.4.3. Pro: In order to implement this ban consistently and fairly, the interactions and conversations of workers would have to be monitored. This is not feasible or ethical.
1.4.3.1. Pro: If the ban is enforced through punishments, it has to rely on evidence. Acquiring reliable evidence in such instances is difficult.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Without monitoring, the implementation of the ban would rely on complaints by workers. This is bound to result in an inconsistent and unfair implementation.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Workers might register false complaints against colleagues they dislike so that they may be punished.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that false complaints, which will be contested by the accused and not verified by other workers, will lead to any punishment.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Since there is no physical evidence of a face to face conversation, legitimate evidence could very well be the word of one person.
1.4.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: One [survey](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/beware-the-backstabbing-coworkers-hot-jobs) of the advertising industry found that almost one third of respondents felt that colleagues have tried to make them look bad on the job. Consequently, it seems highly likely that workers will attempt to abuse this policy.
1.4.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: Many employees attempt to put down their coworkers so that they can improve their own chances at getting [promotions](https://mscategorymanagement.com/backstabbing-coworkers/).
1.4.3.1.1.1.5. Con: Employers are likely to try to take into account the complainant's relationships and motivations before they randomly pass judgement on an employee.
1.4.3.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Even in such a case, each fake complaint would still require looking into and being handled, resulting in wasted time and red tape.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: The implementation would be consistent in that enforcement would happen whenever an employee sees sufficient reason to complain.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: The legal system, to a large degree, relies on the reports of citizens. Yet, abandoning the legal system would be preposterous.
1.4.3.1.1.4. Pro: This would be particularly problematic in larger companies with hundreds of employees, where it is extremely difficult to track the many thousands of interactions and discussions which take place on a daily basis.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Just because something is hard to enforce, does not mean that it ought not to be enforced.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: It may not always be possible to catch employees slacking on the job, but there should still be rules and punishments regarding said situation.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: It might be difficult to prove cases of workplace harassment or discrimination. However, that does not mean laws should not be implemented to limit those cases.
1.4.3.1.2.3. Pro: If a law bans the discussion of politics at work, that means some employees, if not all, are likely to be deterred from discussing politics out of the fear of punishment if they get caught.
1.4.3.1.2.4. Con: This is only true when defending extremely important principles or preventing highly dangerous harms. In this case, the need to ban political discussion at work is not overpoweringly important, and does not merit the problems which arise from banning it.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Monitoring the conversations of employees is invasive of their privacy.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: This is likely to make workers extremely uncomfortable and heighten existing mental health problems employees might have, such as anxiety.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Excessive workplace surveillance has been shown to lead to increased stress and general health problems \([p. 60](http://docs.manupatra.in/newsline/articles/Upload/56434654-F42C-433A-9506-C243B5A8EE73.pdf)\).
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Stress and health may lead to lower workplace performance.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Even if it is invasive of their privacy, it is justified on the basis that employers currently use tools which are legal, such as [keyloggers](https://blog.flexispy.com/keyloggers-in-the-workplace/), to monitor their employees' conversations. Since it is legal, it is legitimate.
1.4.3.3. Con: Currently, employers are legally allowed to monitor a significant proportion of employee's communication at work. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume employers can monitor employees' private communication at work as well.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Employers can only [legally](https://www.govdocs.com/do-employees-have-any-privacy-at-work/) monitor a "worker’s e-mail, text messages and website visits that take place on a company-owned device or network".
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Legally, employers are [barred](https://www.govdocs.com/do-employees-have-any-privacy-at-work/) from either listening to or recording their employees' conversations without their consent.
1.4.3.3.3. Pro: Employers, especially in the [USA](https://www.govdocs.com/do-employees-have-any-privacy-at-work/), have the right to monitor their employees to a very large degree.
1.4.4. Con: The difficulties of implementing the ban and the new problems it creates might be outweighed by the positive consequences of the ban.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Other forms of behavior that are notoriously hard to define and prove, for example gender discrimimination and unfair dismissals, are banned because this ban is seen as worth it no matter what.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Political discussion and its attendant harms do not compare to the injustice of gender discrimination or unfair dismissal, and should not be held to the same standard.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Discrimination and unfair dismissals are always offensive and violate laws. The same cannot be said about political discussions. This comparison is therefore flawed.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Many major forms of gender discrimination such as stereotyping, pregnancy discrimination, and gender-identity discrimination are considered very [hard to prove](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/labor-employment-law/employment-discrimination/how-to-prove-gender-discrimination-in-the-workplace.html).
1.4.4.2. Con: This position is ultimately speculative - there is no way to know for sure without implementing the ban.
1.5. Con: Discussing politics at work strengthens relationships among employees.
1.5.1. Con: Many employees would not be comfortable discussing politics with people in more senior positions than them since it could harm their career opportunities.
1.5.1.1. Pro: According to research, [60%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/60percent-of-workers-say-political-talk-at-work-is-unacceptable-but-57percent-do.html) of employees believe that political conversations at work could harm their career prospects.
1.5.2. Pro: It is likely that many employees share the same political opinions. Discussing politics allows employees to find [like-minded people](https://news.ku.edu/2016/02/19/new-study-finds-our-desire-minded-others-hard-wired-controls-friend-and-partner) and strengthen their relationship with them.
1.5.2.1. Con: If there are employees who share the same political opinions, there will be many employees who don't. This is likely to lead to multiple groupings and echo chambers in the workplace.
1.5.2.2. Con: It is extremely difficult for people to have completely similar opinions on all political issues.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Opening up to colleagues who share your viewpoints makes it easy for you to be your [truest self](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelcyvjoseph/2019/06/27/should-you-discuss-politics-at-work/#58f14fa1135c) at work.
1.5.2.4. Pro: After work, like-minded employees can attend the same rallies or protests which is likely to strengthen their relationship.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.
1.5.4. Con: Employees can have a negative view of coworkers and feel more [isolated](https://smallbusiness.co.uk/politics-affect-employees-2535604/) from them.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Certain organizations may have a pronounced political leaning, due to the nature of the work that they do. In such companies, employees with minority political views may be alienated.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: In the US, [gender and marriage equality](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-07-28/same-sex-marriage-divides-elected-republicans-from-their-supporters)(In the end, just 22% of 211 House Republicans voted in favor of the bill, despite the fact that a record-high 71% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, according to the most recent Gallup poll, including 55% of Republicans.) are more strongly supported by left-leaning parties. Organizations focused on such issues would likely have higher numbers of left-leaning individuals.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: Organizations focused on issues with strong political underpinnings would likely be very cautious to hire only those with similar beliefs or those who are not vocal about their contrary beliefs.
1.5.5. Con: When employees with [uninformed](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-8-new-golden-rules-of-discussing-politics-at-work-without-getting-into-fights) political opinions take part in conversations, that is likely to annoy politically informed employees.
1.5.5.1. Con: This is less an issue of a company's stance on discussing politics at work and more an issue of individual employees making the questionable choice to participate in discussions they should rather stay out of.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Employees might find it difficult to stay out of political conversations as they might be peer pressured into them.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: It is not the fault of the company that employees are not self aware enough to disengage from political conversations they have little knowledge about.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Politically uninformed employees are likely to feel unintelligent, which could harm their self-esteem.
1.5.5.3. Con: If employees are allowed to discuss politics at work, it acts as an incentive for them to become politically aware. This reduces the chances of their coworkers being annoyed at them.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: Expressing educated political opinions allow employees to bond with others, making it easier to make work friends.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: If politically unaware employees are dragged in political conversations at work, they are likely to come off as unintelligent. To prevent themselves from feeling ashamed, they are likely to make efforts to become more politically aware.
1.5.5.3.3. Con: Employees already have limited time on their hands after work. It is unlikely they will use their free time to read up on politics.
1.5.5.3.3.1. Pro: Many employees have families which they need to spend time with.
1.5.5.3.3.2. Pro: Working hours are already fairly [long](https://www.nber.org/digest/jul06/w11895.html) and take up most of employees' time during the day.
1.5.5.3.3.3. Con: Reading up on politics can be a fun exercise and not burdensome.
1.5.6. Con: Many people are not prepared to [listen](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-8-new-golden-rules-of-discussing-politics-at-work-without-getting-into-fights) to other opinions and might simply want to convince others that their point is correct. This is likely to irritate other employees.
1.6. Con: Banning people from exercising their right to the [first amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) is unconstitutional.
1.6.1. Con: Private companies are not subject to the constitution, and thus, prohibiting employees from engaging in political discussion would not be unconstitutional.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In Community Access Corp. v. Halleck, the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of speech did not apply to private companies, so companies can create their own speech policies.
