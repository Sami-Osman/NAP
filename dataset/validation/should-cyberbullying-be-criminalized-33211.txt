Discussion Name: Should cyberbullying be criminalized?

1. Cyberbullying should be criminalized.
1.1. Pro: Perpetrators of cyberbullying should be punished as their behaviour has detrimental effects.
1.1.1. Con: Cyberbullies already face social repercussions for their behaviour, which is deemed morally wrong. This is sufficient punishment.
1.1.1.1. Con: Laws can encourage social judgements and encourage them to remain consistent. As such, making cyberbullying illegal ensures these judgements persist.
1.1.1.2. Con: Due to the potential anonymity cyberbullies, individuals may not face any social repercussions.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Those who bully often experience [negative effects](https://bullyingepidemic.com/how-does-bullying-affect-the-bully/)(Bullies had some additional and different risks, demonstrating a 4-5 times increased risk for anti-social personality disorder \(described as a lack of empathy, lying, and criminal behavior\). Earlier studies have shown that as bullies grow up, they tend to have more problems holding down jobs, more problems in relationships, more issues with drugs and alcohol, and are more likely to have police records. Bully-targets suffer the most severe and widest-ranging consequences. They run a 5-fold risk of depression and a 10-25 fold risk of various panic disorders.) in later life, as such, they do not need to be punished externally.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Bullies may face [social ostracisation](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/20/health/adult-bully-survivor-tips-wellness/index.html) when found out. As such, they need not be punished further.
1.1.2. Pro: Cyberbullying can harm the mental health of victims. Perpetrators should be punished for causing such harm.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Victims of cyberbullying, people are likely to develop [problems](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/bullying-and-cyberbullying.htm)(As well as being deeply hurtful, bullying can leave you feeling angry, afraid, helpless, isolated, ashamed, and even guilty that the bullying is somehow your fault. You may even feel suicidal.\n\nYour physical health is likely to suffer, and you are at a greater risk of developing mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, or post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\).) such as depression, low self-esteem, anxiety, or adult-onset PTSD.
1.1.2.2. Con: Negative mental health impacts are highly subjective and variable, and as such are insufficient grounds for criminal punishment.
1.1.2.3. Con: Poor treatment and hostility are a natural part of life. Individuals should be supported through these experiences, rather than sheltered from them.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Cyberbullying makes people twice as likely to [self-harm or attempt suicide](https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20180426/cyberbullying-increases-risk-for-selfharm-suicidal-behavior).
1.1.3. Con: Cyberbullying is often carried out by minors who may not understand the [ramifications of their actions](https://www.irishlegal.com/articles/child-protection-rapporteur-in-call-to-criminalise-cyberbullying)(Dr Parkes told Irish Legal News: “I don’t necessarily believe that the criminalisation of cyber-bullying is appropriate given that the young people involved may not understand the impact their actions and words may have in the online world.\n\n“Unless time, funding and resources are dedicated towards educating young people about cyber-bullying then essentially what we are doing is criminalising young children for something they don’t necessarily understand.). Punishing them would be unjust.
1.1.3.1. Con: More leniant and non-criminal punishments can be given out to minors as exceptions to a generic rule.
1.1.3.2. Con: By making cyberbullying illegal it may make individuals, including minors, more aware of the potential consequences of their actions.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Children commonly engage in [unwise online behaviours](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/childrensonlinebehaviourinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2020), suggesting they are ill informed about appropriate online behaviour.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Cyberbullying can often appear minor, while having unintended consequences. Minors lack the reasoning ability to [foresee the consequences](https://judyarnall.com/2019/02/18/when-do-children-understand-consequences/)(School-aged children are still operational in their thinking which means they understand what is tangible and what is in their immediate environment – things they can readily see, hear, touch, smell and taste. They can’t think conceptually until the teen years, so they don’t understand the “gray” areas of decisions, or theory or ideology. Consequences demand that the chooser understands all aspects of the decision in order to make an informed choice.) of their actions.
1.1.4. Pro: Criminalising cyberbullying will enable widespread acknowledgement and prevention of its harms.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Criminalising cyberbullying may encourage more mindful behaviour online, by increasing awareness of its harms.
1.1.4.2. Con: Children are already commonly taught about bullying in school and online, yet the problem persists. This suggests that increased awareness is not sufficient to change behaviour.
1.1.4.3. Con: Those intent on bullying someone online are likely to find methods and means by which to avoid punishment, as is commonly done with other criminalised behaviours such as underage drinking.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Criminalising cyberbullying ensures those who are victims of online bullying have procedures and policy available to protect them.
1.2. Pro: Criminalisation could improve user experience of online platforms, by decreasing hostility and negativity.
1.2.1. Pro: Criminalisation would encourage the use of a range of software to encourage positive user behaviour.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Artificial Intelligence programs made solely for the correct identification and discipline of harmful behavior can be developed in the future to solve this problem.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Artifical Intellifence can be used to analyse behaviour patterns and tag those engaging in problematic user behaviour.
1.2.1.3. Con: Algorithms can be built into social media to manage cyberbullying at the source, making criminalization unnecessary.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Algorithms and methods used by online platforms [can be biased](https://hbr.org/2019/11/when-algorithms-decide-whose-voice-will-be-heard), leading to de-platforming and limiting the online presence of members of certain groups.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Online platforms can not be impartial adjudicators of claims of cyberbullying as they may be biased by factors such as profit and user retention.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Social media platforms may unfairly silence unfavourable opinions under the guise of censoring cyberbullying.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Companies have a vested interest in improving the user experience, as it will allow them to increase their profits. As such, they are likely to be diligent.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Social media sites managing cyberbullying is preferable as it combats state overreach.
1.2.1.3.4. Pro: Social media sites can more immediately manage cyberbullying, by using these algorithms to recognise and hide harmful content immediately. Authorities do not have this power.
1.2.1.4. Con: The fact that data and software can be used to identify and penalise cyber bullying does not justify doing so.
1.2.2. Con: Social media sites have sufficient technological means built into their platforms that empower users against cyberbullying, without criminalisation.
1.2.2.1. Con: Some supports are insufficient. For example, [Twitter's guidance](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/cyber-bullying-and-online-abuse) on online abuse makes it clear that only if victims have exhausted all other options should they report cyberbullying to Twitter.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If a victim is not willing to take initial responsibility and initiate action against a bully, via the functionality existing in the platform, it is not the platform's responsibility to intervene.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Most online platforms offer multiple features for users to manage cyberbullying themselves - such as blocking or restricting another user.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: A user can make a new account to continue bullying the victim.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Creating new accounts is an extensive process, while blocking an account is very simple. As such, a bully is likely to tire quickly and leave the victim alone.
1.2.2.3. Con: Social media sites have greater capacity to provide technological protections against cyberbullying, yet do not do so. Criminalisation may incentivise such sites to improve these protections.
1.2.2.4. Pro: If cyberbullying can be managed at the source rather than the authorities, there is little to no need for criminalisation in minor cases.
1.2.3. Pro: Poor online behaviour can force users to [limit or halt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2019/11/15/does-negativity-drive-users-off-social-media/?sh=d31eb26dfbfe)(Our data reveals that 28% of internet users have quit Facebook to escape negativity, 32% have deactivated Twitter, and 42% have left Snapchat. Of those not quitting altogether, many more choose to unfollow friends, and one in five employees admit to blocking co-workers on social media.) their online activity. Criminalisation of cyber bullying may reduce this.
1.2.3.1. Pro: People often share a lot of personal information online in order to connect with others. Cyberbullies may use this information to intimidate, troll and dox other users. This threat to security may lead individuals to be more private online.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Exposure to [hostility and negativity](https://www.harmoniamentis.com/society/doomscrolling-the-social-media-trend-eroding-your-mental-health/)(Unsurprisingly, as well as spoiling your mood, doomscrolling can also take a physical and psychological toll. Studies have long shown the links between excessive social media use - being “too online” - and increased feelings of depression and loneliness. At its most basic, the flood of negativity produced by doomscrolling can cause an increase in heart rate, breathing and blood pressure and constant low-level panic, with short term effects ranging from problems sleeping to overeating. In the long term, it may increase stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, chronic levels of which are associated with heart disease, diabetes, ulcers and obesity. The risks for mental health can include panic attacks, cognitive distortions, an increase in ruminative thinking and depression, creating the feedback loop that keeps doomscrollers scrolling.) online may lead to a decrease in the mental health of users.
1.2.3.3. Con: Heavy surveillance and the threat of punishment associated with criminalisation may greater reduce user presence and free speech.
1.2.3.4. Con: Criminalisation will only deal with immediate cases of online engagement, without encouraging positive behaviour. As such, it will likely be unsuccessful in the long term.
1.2.4. Con: Cyberbullying should be left in the hands of parents, not social media administrators or law enforcement.
1.2.4.1. Con: It is unreasonable to expect parents to constantly and effectively monitor their children's social media activity.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Parents may not want to intrude into their child's personal space and monitor their activity online.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: If parents are uncomfortable with invading their child's privacy they are likely to be far less comfortable with the state doing so.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Parents can easily restrict social media activity to periods where children can be supervised.
1.2.4.2. Con: Cyberbullying does not occur exclusively amongst children. As such, it is must be tackled by a universal authority - such as the government.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Children are often sensitive and emotional. Dealing with the authorities may be intimidating and overwhelming for them.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Cyberbullying is most common between [11 and 12 years](https://parents.au.reachout.com/common-concerns/everyday-issues/cyberbullying-and-teenagers)(Research undertaken by Kids Helpline found that the most common age for cyberbullying is the transition period between primary and high school when young people are around 11 or 12, but it happens throughout the teenage years so it’s important to be aware.) of age. Therefore, parents are likely to be more influential in educating their children and preventing cyberbullying.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: In many countries, children [cannot be held criminally responsible](https://archive.crin.org/en/home/ages/europe.html) at 11 or 12 years old. As such, it is best to leave punishment to parents.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: This mistakenly assumes that parents are capable of or willing to [properly educate](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/25/parents-must-teach-children-internet-security/)(A recent NSPCC survey of more than 2,000 parents of children between eight and 13, carried out by YouGov, found that parents are avoiding conversations with their children about the need to stay safe online.\n\nThe poll reported that while 91 percent of eight-year-olds use the internet at least once a week, parents, on average, think that nine is a suitable age for children to be informed of the issues around online safety.\n\nEven then, many are reluctant to take on this responsibility. For example, nearly a third \(31 percent\) of all surveyed parents admitted they would refer their child to another adult or sibling if they asked them questions about an issue they had experienced online.) their children about internet safety.
1.3. Con: Criminalization of cyberbullying could violate free speech online.
1.3.1. Con: The right to free speech is not absolute and is commonly restricted in cases where it is considered to do harm.
1.3.1.1. Pro: [Libel and defamation](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/civil-litigation/defamation-character-free-speech.html) are considered criminal conduct as it is considered harmful speech.
1.3.1.2. Con: Many limitations placed on free speech, [such as defamation](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-summary-timeline-rcna26136), are rigorously assessed by a jury to ensure that they have caused objective harm. Assessing objective harm in the form of emotional damage would be a near impossibility.
1.3.2. Con: Freedom of speech is less important than the safety of other individuals. As such, these rights are often weighted to preserve stability in society.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Freedom of speech should not be used as an excuse for people to justify their destructive words and behaviours, as it delays justice.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The reduced risk of mental health issues in the population would outweigh the increased risks associated with limits on free speech.
1.3.2.3. Con: Truth can often cause harm, yet should never be prohibited as lies pose significant harm to individuals.
1.3.3. Pro: It would be difficult to define cyberbullying in a way in which restrictions to online activity do not become extensive and unreasonable.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Offence is highly subjective. Therefore, legitimising it through criminalisation may lead to widespread reports and accusations.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Criminalizing cyberbullying may result in people facing charges for activities such as [creating memes](https://medium.com/the-isthmus/is-it-a-joke-or-cyberbullying-d65cf03ff2af).
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: The extent to which people [take offensive content seriously](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2140342-online-harassment-on-the-rise-but-no-one-can-agree-what-it-is/)(That may be related to the finding that different groups experience online harassment in different ways. For example, men experience it slightly more often than women and are twice as likely to be targeted for their political views, but women are more likely to report abuse that targets them for their gender alone. One in five young women reported being sexually harassed. Black people reported far more incidents of being harassed online simply for being black, rather than in response to any particular view or comment.) varies across different demographics.
1.3.3.2. Con: Difficulty in implementing rules should not determine whether a rule is worth implementing or not in the first instance.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Cyberbullying is [difficult to define](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093051) because it often lacks the key characteristics associated with in-person bullying.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Experts in the field of behavioral analysis can help define this and help administrators correctly identify cyberbullies.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: Cyberbullying is [well established](https://lawstuff.org.uk/online-safety/cyber-bullying/)(Cyber-Bullying is a type of bullying which can involve the victim being harassed, humiliated, embarrassed or otherwise targeted via the internet, social media or by mobile phone.) and understood, it purely needs to be enshrined in law.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Three key characteristics of in-person bullying are [intent, repetition, and power imbalance](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/Supplement_2/S148)(The study of traditional bullying benefits significantly from a useful and operational definition that describes 3 core characteristics of bullying behaviors \(intention, repetition, and power imbalance\). Assessing these 3 characteristics of an aggressor helps predict greater negative impact upon the target.). However, these are often lacking in cases of cyberbullying.
1.3.4. Con: Free speech is a crutch often used as to not deal with problem. If a criminal is not disciplined for whatever he commits, he will just continue to commit that crime over and over again. In turn, those affected by his crimes will continue to suffer.
1.3.5. Pro: Websites should have the freedom to create their own policies on cyberbullying.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Websites have their own philosophy regarding censorship of content and should be allowed to enforce these principles on their own platform.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Giving this freedom can also unwittingly grant abusive users the license to do as they please, taking advantage of every other individual that they can.
1.3.5.2. Con: Not all websites share the same view on cyberbullying which may lead to varied and unequal action taken against it. Cyberbullying needs equal resolution across all sites, so must be addressed at the governmental level.
1.4. Con: Normal bullying is not punishable under the law. Thus it does not make sense to make cyberbullying illegal.
1.4.1. Con: In person bullies are commonly held accountable for their behaviour. Given that cyberbullying often lacks accountability, criminalisation is justified.
1.4.1.1. Con: Criminalisation is not necessary to create a system of accountability for cyberbullies. Social media platforms can enforce restrictions and sanctions for users who cyberbully.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The ability for a community to identify and punish a cyberbully is compromised by the anonymity online. Therefore, social consequences are far less, and individuals must be held accountable by authorities.
1.4.2. Pro: Conflict and ill-treatment are a natural part of the real world and cannot be universally criminalised.
1.4.2.1. Pro: It is not possible to remove all discomfort from people's lives. It is preferable to teach people to be kind and stand up for themselves and others.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Exposure to poor treatment in a virtual environment may better prepare people for these occurrences in the real world.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: The potential that someone who has been mistreated may gain from the experience in the long run does not justify the behaviour.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Exposure to poor online behaviour may make individuals stronger and better equip them to deal with such behaviour in person.
1.4.2.3. Con: There is a distinct difference between poor treatment, and cyberbullying. Not all poor online behaviour would meet the threshold of illegality.
1.4.3. Con: Cyberbullying is already considered a crime in some countries. Due to the global nature of the internet, it must be made criminal everywhere.
1.4.3.1. Con: Fighting cyberbullying would take valuable resources and police time away from combatting more serious crimes.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: If legalised, enforcing the law would be impractical and costly due to the ways in which cyberbullies can hide their identities behind a screen.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Artificial intelligence systems can be utilised to identify cyberbullying patterns and enable police to catch perpetrators.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Police should be trained in methods of identifying and investigating cyberbullying, such as [how to obtain information from an ISP.](http://stopcyberbullying.org/whats_the_law/law_enforcement_purpose.html)
1.4.3.1.1.3. Pro: VPNs, anonymity and a lack of traceability online can complicate tracking down individuals effectively. This would be exhaustive work for already overwhelmed police systems globally.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Cyberbullying increases the [risk of victims violently retaliating](https://www.police1.com/investigations/articles/how-cops-can-combat-cyberbullying-oyMyilUKtrFLepdU/)(One of the most significant of these is cyberbullying, a widespread problem that can have all the same effects as “traditional” bullying: depression, anxiety, loneliness, insomnia, lack of interest in daily life, physical health issues, decreased academic engagement and achievement. It also creates the risk of more extreme outcomes like violent retaliation and suicide.) against their bullies. Therefore, the police should use resources to intervene before this occurs.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: In the U.S. some incidents of cyberbyllying can be addressed under [federal law,](https://www.police1.com/investigations/articles/how-cops-can-combat-cyberbullying-oyMyilUKtrFLepdU/)(The first step in countering cyberbullying is to get a thorough understanding of the scope and nature of the problem. Crucially, you also need to be aware of your own obligations and authority on the issue, which vary from state to state. While some incidents may be an infraction of policy, others may be addressable by federal law, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Civil Rights Act of 1964; or Education Amendments of 1972.) such as the Americans with Disabilities Act; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Civil Rights Act of 1964; or Education Amendments of 1972.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Laws against internet bullying are not a luxury, but a must in today's technology dominated environment. It is vital to protect victims quickly and effectively by legislating specifically against cyber bullying.
1.4.3.2. Con: Rather than criminalising cyberbullying, governments should invest in educating people on the harms and pitfalls of negative online behaviour.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Education can help to prevent future cases of cyberbullying but cannot prevent harms from current and ongoing cyberbullying.
1.4.3.3. Pro: There are [criminal sanctions](https://cyberbullying.org/bullying-laws)(All states have various criminal laws that might apply to bullying behaviors, depending on the nature of the act. For example, if someone is physically hurting another, assault statutes might apply. All states also have criminal harassment and/or stalking statutes, and most include explicit reference to electronic forms. States with a “YES” in this column are the ones that expressly include electronic forms of harassment.) in most US states for bullying. If all states adopted these sanctions, it would send a unified message of intolerance.
1.4.4. Pro: Bullying in person can physically harm an individual while cyberbullying cannot. Criminalizing the latter and not the former is nonsensical.
1.4.4.1. Con: [In America](http://cyberbullying.org/bullying-laws), all states have various criminal laws that might apply to bullying behaviors, depending on the nature of the act.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Threatening others in person can [result in prosecution](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Criminal-Threats.htm)(Individuals who communicate a threat to injure another can face federal felony charges if they use a form of interstate commerce, such as email, mail, phone calls, texts, or online messaging, to send the threat. This federal offense carries up to 5 years in federal prison. \(18 U.S.C. § 875.\) Sending such threats repeatedly can lead to federal criminal stalking charges and up to 10 years in prison. \(18 U.S.C. §§ 2261, 2261A.\) Depending on the circumstances of the threats or the intended recipient, other federal penalties may apply.). The same should apply to threats made online.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Cyberbullying can constitute harassment which is illegal in person.
1.4.4.2. Con: Cyberbullying is distinctly harmful as it extends into people's homes and personal time. Thus, it warrants special legal restrictions.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Cyberbullying is commonly more consistent than bullying in person, as people cannot escape from the perpetrator.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Unlike most face-to-face bullying, cyberbullying takes place [in the victim's home](https://www.cybersmile.org/blog/how-is-cyberbullying-different-from-traditional-bullying)(Unlike victims of traditional forms of bullying who are able to escape from the torments of the face-to-face bully once they are at home, cyberbullying victims do not have that option. Cyberbullies take advantage of the fact that the majority of young people use technology on a regular basis which provides them with the opportunity to harass their victim at any time and in any place, hence they are likely to feel imprisoned in their own homes, with no ‘safe place’ to go.), thereby depriving them of a safe refuge.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: Cyberbullies can [share videos and images](https://www.cybersmile.org/blog/how-is-cyberbullying-different-from-traditional-bullying)(Some forms of cyberbullying such as incidents involving the use and circulation of videos and images are said to have a greater impact on victims’ psychological health than traditional forms of bullying because of the permanency of the internet and the speed in which the video/image can spread to a large audience, humiliating the victim in the process.) of the victim, which intensifies the harm to the victim, due to the permanence and speed with which these are shared online.
1.4.4.2.1.3. Con: Intimidating face-to-face encounters are more likely to make the victim feel that they are in imminent danger due to the physical proximity to their bully.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: Cyberbullying is highly prevalent in online gaming, which is commonly a recreational activity.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Most cyberbullying takes place through [social media platforms and apps](https://www.comparitech.com/internet-providers/cyberbullying-statistics/) rather than through online video games.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Physical harm is easily quantifiable, and thus easy to enforce regulations about. Emotional harm is not yet measurable and therefore impossible to regulate.
1.4.5. Con: Self defense is legal in person, therefore there are inherent limitations to bullying in person.
