1. Is The European Union losing its influence in the world ?
1.1. Con: The UE has a strong social sytem
1.1.1. Pro: The EU is the ideological birthplace of the [welfare state](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-welfare-state-in-europe/)(The welfare state is European in character, because the wide-ranging, interconnected social policies that make up the welfare state reflect the historical European experience of social misery, turmoil, protest, political conflict and war, on the one hand, and reconciliation, cooperation, stability, order, harmony and peace, on the other. The welfare state came to embody a unique answer to the question of how to build and maintain a relatively cohesive economic, social, political and cultural order. \[...\] In terms of identity, the welfare state has established itself as an idea and an ideal that Europeans share, a political and social accomplishment highly valued by European publics and an institution to which people attach their \(national\) identity.).
1.1.2. Con: COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated economic inequality within and between EU states. This indicates that its social system is inadequate.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Workers from lower educational backgrounds](https://www.bruegel.org/2020/12/covid-19-has-widened-the-income-gap-in-europe/) suffered significantly more as a result of the pandemic than those with university degrees or higher.
1.2. Con: France and Germany are members of the security council of the UN.
1.2.1. Pro: Other countries go to [great lengths to gain a seat](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52973244)(Member states get three things in return for a seat, says Adam Chapnick, a professor of defence studies at the Royal Military College of Canada.\n\nThose are access, relevance and influence.\n\n"For two years, day in and day out, a country that is not a great power will have direct access to the five permanent members in addition to whomever else might be on the council at that time," he says.) on the UN Security Council because of the access, relevance, and influence it brings for their respective nations, alliances, and unions.
1.2.2. Con: The UN Security Council is largely [ineffective](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20201117-un-general-assembly-president-reprimands-security-council-for-failing-to-do-its-job) and, as such, membership to it is redundant.
1.2.3. Con: Following Brexit, the EU has [only one permanent member state](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/time-for-the-european-union-to-reassert-itself-in-the-un-security-council/)(Brexit has not only cost the European Union \(EU\) one of its members, but also a coveted permanent seat at the UN Security Council \(UNSC\). The UK and France often provided a reliable tandem for the European Union at the UNSC, but now London and Paris may start to diverge more prominently, since the UK is no longer obliged to coordinate its positions with EU member states through Article 34 of the Treaty on the European Union. To retain its influence and maintain its global geopolitical ambitions, the EU should look for another permanent seat on the UNSC.) on the UN Security Council: France.
1.3. Con: The UE can rely on its indoor market to keep growing
1.3.1. Con: Since EU membership is [in part conditional on a country's economic development](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/conditions-membership_en)(Countries wishing to join need to have:\n\n stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;\n a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU;\n the ability to take on and implement effectively the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.), the EU's growth potential will likely be more limited than developing powers like China and India.
1.3.2. Pro: The single market stimulates [competition and improved efficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893819300882)(It has stimulated trade and competition in the EU, and improved efficiency, fuelling economic growth and making everyday life of European businesses and consumers easier.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThere is also a general recognition that the Single Market is incomplete and the European Commision has published its assessment on how the Single Market can be deepened \(European Commission, 2018\).), thereby fuelling economic growth, and there is still considerably more that can be done to strengthen the single market. This suggests there is considerably more growth potential.
1.3.2.1. Con: It does not necessarily follow that because the single market has supported growth thus far, it will continue to do so the more it is strengthened. It is plausible that the single market's stimulating effect on growth will plateau at a certain point.
1.3.2.2. Con: Although the single market can be credited with economic growth until now, the global economy is complicated and ever-changing. It is not, therefore, a given that the single market will be as effective in any future economic climate.
1.4. Pro: The European Union does not have a standing military which greatly reduces its ability to influence world events.
1.4.1. Con: Although there is no EU military, there is a [common EU defence policy](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/security/20190612STO54310/eu-army-myth-what-is-europe-really-doing-to-boost-defence). Therefore, in practice, the EU has military strength.
1.4.2. Pro: Following its [expansion into the east](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-russia-eu-europe-enlargement-european-union-a8896986.html) in 2004, the EU has made an enemy of Russia who are not afraid of exercising their military might.
1.5. Con: A number of [geo-economic groupings in Asia](https://theconversation.com/as-the-european-union-celebrates-60-years-can-asia-use-it-as-a-model-for-economic-integration-74542)(Asia has numerous geo-economic groupings that may lead to EU-like integration including the East Asia Free Trade Agreement \(EAFTA\), the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia \(CEPEA\) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \(ASEAN\). These already make it the world’s second-most integrated region after the EU. \[...\] Countries in the area are also working towards the establishment of a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \(RCEP\) as an alternative to Trans Pacific Partnership, which has been rejected by US President Donald Trump.) appear to be modelled on the EU. This is an example of the EU's soft power.
1.5.1. Con: If geo-economic groupings in Asia are able to work together to protect their interests like the EU, then this may lessen the EU's ability to influence them in the long-run.
1.5.1.1. Con: The [ASEAN Economic Community \(AEC\)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/asean-economic-community-what-you-need-to-know/)(Established in late 2015 by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \(itself founded in 1967\), the AEC has been seen as a way to promote economic, political, social and cultural cooperation across the region.) was only founded in 2015 and as such is in its infancy, unable to properly compete with the EU.
1.5.2. Pro: The ASEAN Economic Community \(AEC\) is founded on [similar principles](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/asean-economic-community-what-you-need-to-know/)(The idea was to move South-East Asia towards a globally competitive single market and production base, with a free flow of goods, services, labour, investments and capital across the 10 member states. \[...\] \n\nThe AEC’s vision for the next nine years, laid out in the AEC Blueprint 2025, includes the following:\n\n1. A highly integrated and cohesive economy\n\n2. A competitive, innovative, and dynamic ASEAN\n\n3. Enhanced connectivity and sectoral cooperation\n\n4. A resilient, inclusive, people-oriented and people-centred region\n\n5. A global ASEAN.) to the EU: a single market and freedom of movement, goods, and services.
1.6. Pro: The internal conflicts among EU member states are rising. This is likely to weaken the EU's influence in the world.
1.6.1. Pro: The EU failed to achieve a collective response to the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03246-9).
1.6.1.1. Con: The[EU's inadequate response to the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-europe.html?) through a EU-level policy is likely undermine its influence as a site of effective policy making"?
1.6.1.2. Con: A robust collective response to the Covid-19 pandemic was not possible anyway, so the EU's lack of such a response is not a failure.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: While new variants are predictable, the location of those variants is less so. This makes resource allocation difficult to plan.
1.7. Pro: UK decided to leave the union
1.7.1. Pro: The UK leaving the EU may trigger a wave of European countries leaving the EU.
1.7.1.1. Con: On the contrary, the difficultly the UK has had in leaving the single-market may provide an incentive to other European countries to remain in the EU.
1.7.2. Pro: The UK is an important [trading partner](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/160/the-european-union-and-its-trade-partners) with the EU. Now that the UK is not beholden to EU laws, the EU's ability to influence that trading relationship may decrease.
1.7.3. Con: Negotiating the UK's departure from the EU was hard-fought on both sides, evidencing that the EU had substantial leverage.
1.7.3.1. Pro: It took [3.5 years](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887) for the UK to leave the EU on mutually agreed terms.
1.7.4. Con: Following Brexit, the UK experienced a ['brain drain'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/02/brexit-fuels-brain-drain-as-skilled-britons-head-to-the-eu) with the highly skilled flocking to the EU. This will likely benefit the EU's academic and scientific influence.
1.8. Con: The EU is likely to have a strong influence on the world as a leader in efforts against [climate change](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/02/10/three-ways-eu-china-us-deepen-cooperation-climate-2021/).
1.8.1. Pro: Through its environmental policies, the EU can emerge as a global [regulator](https://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/the-eu-as-a-global-regulator-for-environmental-protection-9781509925605/) for environmental protection.
1.8.2. Pro: The EU has [invested the most in fighting climate change](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/climate-change/)(Together with its member states, the EU is the largest provider of climate financing in the world.) of any other state or group of states in the world.
1.8.3. Con: Other countries have set bigger targets in the fight against climate change.
1.8.3.1. Pro: In 2020, the EU set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by [55% by 2030](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55273004)(EU leaders have agreed on a more ambitious goal for cutting greenhouse gases - reducing them by 55% by 2030, rather than 40%.). By comparison, the UK set a target of [68%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-55179008)(The PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels.) over the same period.
1.8.4. Con: Many climate change activists have criticised the EU's efforts against climate change for [falling short](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55273004)(Many green groups and the European Parliament argue that the EU should have gone much further to 65-70% \[reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030\] if they really are serious about keeping the rise in temperatures under 1.5C this century.) of what is required.
1.9. Pro: The european union has a very weak birth rate
1.9.1. Pro: The EU has an [ageing population](https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/12/a-low-birth-rate-and-a-rapidly-ageing-population-europe-s-demographic-crisis-explained) as a result of a weak birth rate, which poses a host of problems for the EU's position on the world stage.
1.9.1.1. Pro: The EU's ageing population is likely to slow down [economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2017/03/lee.htm).
1.9.1.2. Con: While an ageing population may impact the internal composition and dynamics of the EU population, it is unlikely to have a bearing on its well-established status in global politics.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Key EU figureheads like Germany's [Angela Merkel](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/02/confidence-in-merkel-is-at-all-time-high-in-several-countries-during-her-last-full-year-in-office/) enjoy record high approval ratings across the world.
1.10. Pro: The UE has a [massive unemployment rate](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/portlet_file_entry/2995521/3-04032021-AP-EN.pdf/cb6e5dd6-56c2-2196-16b7-baf811b84a4f) compared to the [US](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/jobs-report-january-2021.html) and [China.](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/unemployment-rate)
1.10.1. Con: Unemployment has nothing to do with influence. When an economy is highly efficient, less employees are needed for more production, thus increasing export and consequently a higher monetary income. And more money means more influence on international level.\(With as a side effect of less employees needed a higher unemployment rate.\)
1.10.2. Con: Unemployment rates are numbers and numbers can be [manipulated](https://sites.psu.edu/gershcivicissue/2017/03/15/unemployment-and-how-to-manipulate-with-statistics/).
1.10.2.1. Pro: Taken in isolation, unemployment rates may obscure the real lived difference between being unemployed in the EU versus the US or China as they say nothing about state support for the unemployed.
1.10.3. Pro: Over the last decade, youth unemployment in the EU has fluctuated between [15-25%](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Unemployment_statistics#Youth_unemployment). By contrast, China's youth unemployment has been around [9-11%](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3110193/china-unemployment-rate-how-it-measured-and-why-it-important).
1.10.4. Con: During the [pandemic](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/06/US-unemployment-EU-uk-furlough-coronavirus-relief)(In the United States, the unemployment rate jumped from 3.6 per cent in April 2019 to 14.7 per cent a year later. But in European countries — even those hard hit by the virus — it has nudged rather than broken the dial.\n\nIn Germany, for example, the unemployment rate in April was 3.5 per cent, up from 3.1 per cent in April last year. France saw a year-on-year bump of 0.2 percentage points in April; Spain was up by 0.6 points.\n\nOverall, unemployment in the EU and the eurozone are both lower in April 2020 than they were in April 2019. Both have registered only a small uptick from March to April this year.), unemployment rates in the EU remained steady - and in some cases dropped - compared to the US.
