Discussion Name: Is the UN a force for good?

1. The UN is a force for good.
1.1. Con: The UN has often put its effort in the wrong places.
1.1.1. Con: Its an impossible feat to get every mission correct with so many moving parts involved.
1.1.2. Con: The UN can learn from these mistakes to better assist countries in the future.
1.1.3. Pro: The UN is failing regarding the Israel/Palestinian conflict.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The UN [created the state of Israel](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel) on November 29, 1947 with "The Partition Resolution". Problems in this resolution have been a source of conflict for over 60 years.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The resolution did not partition Palestine or offer any legal basis for doing so. It merely recommended that the partition plan be implemented and requested the Security Council to take up the matter from there. It [called upon the inhabitants of Palestine to accept the plan](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/10/26/the-myth-of-the-u-n-creation-of-israel/), but they were certainly under no obligation to do so.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: The UNs partition plan [assigned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#Arabs_in_Palestine) the majority of the land \(56%\) to the Jewish state \(Israel\), when Jews at that stage legally owned only 6-7% of it and remained a minority of the population \(33% in 1946\).
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: If we do not consider the Negev desert which is worthless, Palestine was allocated 4500 and Israel 800-1000 square miles. \([1](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/map-of-the-u-n-partition-plan)\). 5500 square miles were allocated to Israel; 4700 square miles is the Negev desert; leaving 800 square miles as fertile for Israel. Palestine was 4500 square miles of cities and fertile farmland.
1.1.3.2. Con: The British created the modern problem, and [passed it off to the UN afterwards](https://youtu.be/1wo2TLlMhiw?t=4m58s).
1.1.3.3. Pro: The UNHRC has condemned Israel [more than the rest of the world’s countries combined](https://www.unwatch.org/report-in-9-years-existence-unhrc-condemned-israel-more-times-than-rest-of-world-combined/), [despite](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2016_ITF_Human_Rights_Index_2016-01.pdf) [most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices) [indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World) not listing Israel as a top Human Rights offender.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: [Israel deserves condemnation](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/), and as one of the longest running and most prominent conflicts in the world, the Israel/Palestine conflict deserves the extra attention.
1.1.3.4. Con: The UN's continuous actions prevented the threat of a world war in 1967; it has also helped mediate all ceasefires in the Arab-Israeli wars.
1.1.3.5. Pro: The UN removed its peacekeeping force [at the demand of Nasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War#Background) in 1967, allowing him to move his army to the border which lead to the Six-Day War and the worsening of the conflict.
1.1.3.6. Con: The USA would [veto](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/43-times-us-has-used-veto-power-against-un-resolutions-israel) any resolution which attempted to meaningfully solve the Israel/Palestine conflict. It is unfair to blame the U.N for this.
1.1.4. Con: The UN is a good platform; however, there are a few negatives that are being shown in Mr.Kofi Annan's \(RIP\) Report on UN reform and the same should come into force, which can solve many management and coordination incapability, as well as human rights promotion and peacekeeping operations too. [www.globalpolicy.org](https://www.globalpolicy.org/un-reform/un-reform-initiatives/secretary-general-kofi-annans-reform-agenda-1997-to-2006.html)
1.1.5. Pro: The UN will not call out deliberate evil actions of some member nations.
1.1.5.1. Pro: The UN [did not call out the 1979 Bangladeshi genocide](https://www.quora.com/Which-atrocities-were-%E2%80%9Cignored%E2%80%9D-by-the-United-Nations), an atrocity which killed between 300 and 500 thousand.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: During the 1971 Bangladesh genocide committed by the Pakistan Army on Bangladeshis, the [UN was completely ineffective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations#cite_note-Ball-31) in preventing the genocide.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The Pakistani army [launched their infamous ''Operation Searchlight' on March 25](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-wants-un-to-recognise-1971-genocide/articleshow/57795422.cms) to suppress Bengali people's calls for self determination, killing over 20,000 people alone in Dhaka. Officially 3 million people were killed in the subsequent none-month Liberation war.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The United States made a [Security Council resolution for "immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of troops"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Bangladesh#United_Nations) to stop the [1979 Bangladeshi Genocide](https://www.kialo.com/the-un-is-a-good-thing-15052/15052.0=15052.1-15052.15+15052.17), which was supported by the majority. However, the USSR vetoed the resolution twice and the United Kingdom and France abstained on the resolution.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: The UN successfully got 149 countries to agree on the [1948 Genocide Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention), which internationally condemns and provides the legal means to prevent or respond to genocide.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: The United Nations [condemned the human rights violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Bangladesh#United_Nations) during and following Operation Searchlight.
1.1.5.2. Pro: UN so far has [not passed a single resolution](http://balochwarna.com/2017/03/23/when-will-un-take-notice-of-baloch-genocide/) against Pakistan for committing [atrocities against Baloch people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_Balochistan).
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The Genocide in Balochistan has been raised at the UN by [the Baloch Republican Party \(BRP\) in 2016](https://www.dawn.com/news/1268562/brp-sets-up-camp-in-geneva-to-highlight-state-atrocities-against-baloch) and also by [India in 2017](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/india-raises-balochistan-issue-unhcr-pakistan-human-rights-981545-2017-06-08).
1.1.5.2.2. Con: The UN has however condemned other higher profile actions by Pakistan \([Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_622), [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_38), [Nuclear Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1172)\), showing that Pakistan does not have a free pass on evil actions.
1.1.6. Pro: The UN needs to rethink how its budget is allocated. A lot of money is allocated towards programs which [do not deliver](https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus/nobel-laureates-guide-smarter-global-targets-2030) much in return.
1.1.6.1. Pro: A report by the [Copenhagen Consensus](https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/expert_outcome_one_pages_combined.pdf) which was written by Nobel prize winning economists concluded that the U.N could significantly increase its effectiveness if reduced the number of programs that it funded and instead allocated its resources only towards its 19 most effective programs.
1.1.7. Pro: The UN fails to help in the Kashmir situation.
1.1.7.1. Pro: There are [human right abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir) in Kashimir, and so far the [UN has only gotten 'concerned' over it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7k8mM9zKsM)
1.1.7.1.1. Con: This claim was made when the issue was less than a month old. International Diplomacy doesn't act that fast so the claim was premature and the support is out of date.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: The UN OHCHR investigated in a 2018 [report](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/IN/DevelopmentsInKashmirJune2016ToApril2018.pdf) detailing what it could, but was unable to investigate from the ground as both sides rejected numerous requests for access.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: Since 2009 various parts of the UN have [called for the AFSPA to be repealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_\(Special_Powers\)_Act#United_Nations_view), an Indian law that "obstructs the normal course of law, impedes accountability and jeopardizes the right to remedy for victims of human rights violations". This is a nessecary step to legally prosecute human rights abuse by armed forces in the kashimir conflict.
1.1.7.2. Con: The UN mediated the Kashimir dispute between India and Pakistan after independence in 1947.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: The UN established the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan \(UNCIP\) to [investigate and mediate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_mediation_of_the_Kashmir_dispute) between India annd Pakistan.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: The UN [imposed a cease-fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_47) and established the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan \(UNMOGIP\) [to monitor the cease-fire line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_mediation_of_the_Kashmir_dispute#United_Nations_Military_Observer_Group_in_India_and_Pakistan).
1.2. Pro: The UN leads in battling climate change.
1.2.1. Pro: The UN achieved the [Paris Agreement](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35073297), achieving consensus among nearly 200 countries for the first time in history.
1.2.1.1. Con: The UN is due to lose a key polluter from the agreement, [the USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement), in November 2020.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Donald Trumps America is increasingly isolationist.  It's decision to leave UN bodies is less a meaningful condemnation of the UN, and more consistent with their current nationalistic foreign policy of leaving international agreements/bodies.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: America has left [Climate change Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement), [trade partnerships](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/why-trump-killed-tpp-why-it-matters-you-n710781), and even [questioned](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/trump-s-first-foreign-trip/donald-trump-nato-why-his-silence-article-5-big-deal-n765011) their NATO membership.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: The [international response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement#International_response) to the US withdrawal was a strong reaffirmation of their commitment to the agreement.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: As the US is one of the main contributors to pollution, their withdrawal from the agreement means that the reaffirmation to the commitment of other countries will have little significance in preventing climate change as it is insufficient without the US taking steps to reduce emissions as well.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The US is the 2nd largest contributor to [CO2](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html) emissions globally.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The USA makes around a [15%](https://www.treehugger.com/climate-change/all-worlds-greenhouse-gas-emissions-one-awesome-interactive-pie-chart.html) of total emissions, and china 25%. The paris agreement will be on track if emissions are reduced by [50%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/we-must-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-net-zero-or-face-more-floods) by 2030. Therefore the paris agreement can still be met even if the USA, China, or both dropped out.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: If a single country lags behind, they could be boycotted causing economic slowdown and decreased emissions.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The USA's GDP is [over 10% exports](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258779/us-exports-as-a-percentage-of-gdp/), which could be heavily reduced if worldwide public opinion and international sanctions turn against the sole polluter.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The [Economic slowdown in 2008 was the main reason](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/recession-real-reason-reduced-emissions/) for the decreased CO₂ emissions in the USA around the same time.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3. Con: The US has reduced emissions [more than any other country](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2017/10/24/yes-the-u-s-leads-all-countries-in-reducing-carbon-emissions/).
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The US Energy Information Administration estimated that emissions will actually rise over the next two years.[In 2018, the agency forecasts a 1.1 percent increase, and in 2019, it projects a 0.2 percent increase](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/). This is may be due to Donald Trump removing environmental protections introduced by Barack Obama.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: US emission reductions are [mainly due](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_of_the_United_States#/media/File:US_Electrical_Generation_1950-2016.png) to Natural Gas replacing coal. Whilst natural gas emits [50%](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/is-natural-gas-clean/) less emissions than coal, it is not Renewable or fully clean, and so is not sustainable in the long term.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Even a small accidental lekage in the process of extracting and utilizing natural gas can negate it's benefits compared to coal. Even if the optimistic 1.6% national leak rate claimed by the gas industry is true, it’s enough to [erode nearly half](https://energypost.eu/wind-solars-achilles-heel-methane-meltdown-porter-ranch-means-energy-transition/) of the climate-saving advantages.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: With more than [100 years of natural gas supply](https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2017/09/24/why-u-s-natural-gas-prices-will-remain-low/#51d6570e3783) in the US, there is plenty of time to transition to renewables.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: Natural gas still emits [0.572 kg](https://www.wingas.com/fileadmin/Wingas/WINGAS-Studien/Energieversorgung_und_Energiewende_en.pdf) CO2 per kWh. With US electricity consumption around [12MWh/capita](https://www.alternative-energies.net/how-to-power-a-city-of-100-000-people-using-only-renewable-energy/), that's 7t/capita. 7t already exceeds the EU average of [6.8t/capita](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29239194) and is not far from Chinas 7.2t/capita. And we haven't even mentioned transport, agriculture or industry yet.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: -> See discussion #7587: Fracking should be banned.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The [United States Climate Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Climate_Alliance) \(covering 50% of the U.S. population and over 50% of GDP\) are effectively continuing with Paris Agreement at the state level.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Despite this there has been some strong support at [State and other local levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Climate_Alliance).
1.2.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.3.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The Paris Agreement is the only global pact stipulating action on temperature rises. [If scientists are right](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229), this could save planet earth and therefore be the most important agreement ever made.
1.2.2. Pro: Since 1992, the [UNFCCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) has helped get nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
1.2.2.1. Pro: UNFCCC created the legally binding [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol).
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Out of the 38 countries that signed up, [36 succeeded](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2093579-was-kyoto-climate-deal-a-success-figures-reveal-mixed-results/) in meeting the target: reducing their mean annual greenhouse gas emissions from 2008-2012 by an average of 5% relative to the levels seen in 1990.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Overall, [they surpassed their commitment](http://www.alphr.com/environment/1003699/climate-change-figures-show-kyoto-protocol-was-a-success-or-do-they) by 2.4 gigatonnes of CO2 per year.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: [The US and Canada failed](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2093579-was-kyoto-climate-deal-a-success-figures-reveal-mixed-results/).
1.2.2.1.4. Con: Ten countries achieved their targets only by buying carbon credits. This means that [0.3 GtCO2 per year of the claimed reductions were not true cuts.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2093579-was-kyoto-climate-deal-a-success-figures-reveal-mixed-results/)
1.2.2.1.5. Con: The success may have actually been due to the financial crisis slowing industry, or the Soviets 2.2 GtCO2/year reduction before the treaty was signed.
1.2.2.1.6. Pro: This success set the stage for the Paris Agreement.
1.2.3. Pro: Through the UNFCCC \([unfccc.int](http://unfccc.int)\), the UN has called on nations and stakeholders to utilize adaptation to climate change impacts such as storms or floods as an opportunity to build a better world for all.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The UNFCCC \(United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\), is "[the main international treaty on climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change)".
1.2.4. Pro: The [Montreal Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) stopped the ozone hole growing over Antarctica, and was the first [unanimiously ratified international agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol#cite_note-12).
1.2.4.1. Pro: The Montreal Protocol is [considered the most successful](http://www.igsd.org/worlds-most-successful-environmental-treaty-turns-25/) international environmental agreement to date.
1.2.4.2. Pro: This treaty was signed very quickly for an international treaty, with only 14 years lapsing between a basic scientific research discovery \(1973\) and the international agreement signed \(1985 & 1987\).
1.2.5. Pro: IPCC creates scientific [reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/) on climate change that have more authority through their international cooperation and by being generated with a consensus through a UN-organisation.
1.2.6. Con: This battle has been largely ineffective, as recent [studies](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/ipcc-report-climate-change-impacts-forests-emissions/) illustrate that climate change impacts are worse than we previously expected.
1.2.7. Con: The UN is unable to force powerful member states to implement the drastic changes which would be required to prevent climate change.
1.2.7.1. Con: The UN was created to maintain peace through cooperation between states. The goal is not to use force to implement climate policy but to enable, encourage and support it.
1.2.7.2. Pro: The result of this is that the U.N is little more than a talking shop. Lots of words are said, but nothing which is meaningful is achieved.
1.2.7.3. Con: The talks on climate change have focused the world attention on the problem and the populations of the powerful democratic member states are now more aware of the problem and this is the major step toward policy change for these countries.
1.2.7.4. Pro: Precisely because the U.N is unable to force member states to do anything, the wording adopted by UN resolutions is often vague, and doesn't actually force member states to make meaningful changes.
1.2.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.7.4.2. Con: The major climate agreement, the Paris Accord, is not vague, but is [specific](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en) and [measureable](https://unfccc.int/resource/bigpicture/index.html#content-indcs-and-ndcs).
1.2.7.5. Con: The UN security council can force powerful members states to implement those drastic change.
1.2.7.5.1. Pro: Any decision of the Security Council [is legally binding](https://www.ejiltalk.org/legal-bindingness-of-security-council-resolutions-generally-and-resolution-2334-on-the-israeli-settlements-in-particular/) upon all U.N. member states, according to the Professor of Law at the University of Alabama School of Law.
1.2.7.5.2. Pro: The UN says the nature of the resolution determines if it is considered binding on States. In general, [resolutions adopted by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, are considered binding](http://ask.un.org/faq/15010), in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter.
1.2.7.6. Pro: The structure of the U.N means that developing world states which will be most effected by climate change are unable to force powerful member states to reduce their carbon emissions.
1.2.8. Pro: -> See discussion #27811: The United Nations is the best forum to tackle climate change.
1.3. Pro: The UN has not reached its prime. Whilst it may fall short of our hopes, we have more cause for hope with, than without, it.
1.3.1. Pro: The UN is [open and self-critical](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sg2235.doc.htm) of it's shortcomings, and regularly takes steps to improve.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The UN gives the independent NGO "[UNWatch](https://www.unwatch.org/about-us/mission-history/)" Special Consultative Status.  This includes access to proceedings and allotted time to talk.  UNWatch's mission statement is to to "monitor the performance of the United Nations by the yardstick of its own Charter".
1.3.1.2. Pro: The Office of Internal Oversight Services  \(OIOS\) [issued 204 oversight reports](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/72/330\(PARTII\)&referer=/english/&Lang=E) relating to peace operations in 2017. They included 552 recommendations, 13 of which were classified as "critical" and 407 "important".
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: In the [2017 Internal Oversight audit](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/72/330\(PARTII\)&referer=/english/&Lang=E), the highest number of reports were related to sexual exploitation and abuse, with 69 reports issued, constituting 55 percent of all reports issued in 2017. Of those, sufficient evidence of misconduct was found in 45 reports.
1.3.2. Pro: The UN may not be at its best shape to do its job \(protect international peace\), but it is the only one at the present moment to do the job. The UN needs to be vested with more powers of mediation and peacekeeping forces.
1.3.2.1. Con: Vesting an arguably corrupt organisation with even more power will just increase their potential for more corruption.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The UN is corrupt.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The Oil-for-Food Programme suffered from widespread corruption and abuse, including [$1.5 billion from kickbacks](https://www.ft.com/content/3ea6c5a4-46fc-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8).
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The independent [report](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_09_05_volume1.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj2ifvFuZfcAhWEUhQKHYmmBOAQFjADegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw1gT8HssnihYL8lCkvyhNQJ) on the oil-for-food scandal [criticised the UN from top to bottom](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations), saying: “The inescapable conclusion from the committee’s work” is that the UN “needs thorough reform—and it needs it urgently.”
1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many countries were [receiving Iraqi oil at discount prices](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) through this program, including some of the same countries that opposed the war on Iraq so vehemently.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Any organisation the size of the UN will eventually encounter corruption.  If it is well handled, it is not a problem.
1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: The global cost of corruption is at least [$2.6 trillion, or 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product \(GDP\)](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sc13493.doc.htm). Some corruption is unavoidable, and the UN has lower corruption than the global average.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: UN internal audits found lower fraud rate than other public and private sector bodies [\(p.21\)](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Investigation-into-the-Departments-approach-to-tackling-fraud.pdf), 0.03% in UN compared to 1% - 5%.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The rate of 1% to 5% for other public and private sector bodies is misleading. If we compare UN 0.03% fraud rate to institutions of the similar budget, similar nature and with European and governmental standard such as government department responsible for administering overseas aid, UN does more poorly.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: USAID had a fraud rate of [0.0055%](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Investigation-into-the-Departments-approach-to-tackling-fraud.pdf) in 2015. UN has a fraud rate of 0.03% which is 5 times more fraud than USAID \([p. 29 4.12](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Investigation-into-the-Departments-approach-to-tackling-fraud.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: US AID had a budget of 12 billions USD for 2015 \([p. 29](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/USAIDFY2015AFR_508a.pdf)\) , UN had a budget of 5.6 billions USD for 2015 \([A_72_5-EN-p. 214](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1301222)\) . Their budget are similar, they should have the same amount of fraud.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The UNs remit is broad, covering peacekeeping, international finance regulation, foreign aid, lawmaking, environment, etc... When comparing the UN to an aid program, we should compared to the UN's aid programs only \(WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR etc..\).
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: World Bank investigations into foreign aid fraud and corruption between 2007 and 2012 found sanctionable fraud or corruption in 157 contracts worth $245 million, suggesting about[0.1 percent involved discovered and sanctionable corruption](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-much-aid-really-lost-corruption).
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: The Center for global development says measuring aid lost to fraud is difficult, but suggests that ["a few percentage points" is a possible underestimate](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sc13493.doc.htm), and "less than 0.1 percent" is an almost-certain underestimate.
1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: This is likely to be an indication of failed fraud reporting, not a lack of fraud.
1.3.2.1.1.2.3. Con: Independent Watchdog JIU found that “more than half \[of UN staff\] indicated that they believe that [fraudulent behavior goes unpunished in their organization](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/12/fraud-what-fraud-watchdogs-find-un-in-state-near-denial-about-internal-corruption.html)”.
1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: The UN has delivered a major international [Anti-Corruption treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Corruption)
1.3.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Transparency international reviewed the treaty after 3 years, and called it "[one of the most outstanding achievements in the field of anti-corruption](https://issuu.com/transparencyinternational/docs/2013_uncacprogressreport_en?e=2496456/5750980), providing a global response to a global problem".
1.3.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: This treaty is [the only legally binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Corruption) international anti-corruption multilateral treaty.
1.3.2.1.1.4. Pro: Former UN procurement official Alexander Yakovlev had received in [excess of $950,000 in bribes](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) from companies that were responsible for more than $79 million in UN contracts and purchase orders.
1.3.2.1.1.5. Pro: The UN appointing Saudi Arabia head of the Human Rights Panel was due to corruption.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1. Con: The application process involves a [vote in the general assembly](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/), so the elected members are democratically selected by all.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: To be elected to one of the 47 seats, a country must receive [at least an absolute majority](https://www.heritage.org/report/un-human-rights-council-flawed-body-should-be-replaced) in a General Assembly secret ballot.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Voting countries are urged to “take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto."
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: The UN has the [Universal periodic review \(UPR\)](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BasicFacts.aspx), a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States to help measure and reveal any countries failing to meet human rights standards.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: To date, the UPR process has garnered a remarkable [100 percent participation rate](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/) with more and more states accepting recommendations on everything from women’s rights to torture. These assessments attract much-needed media attention in countries under review, give some room \(but not enough\) to civil society participation, and elevate human rights on the agenda of government ministries across the board.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.3.2. Pro: Nearly half of the recommendations made by the UPR were [partially or fully implemented](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/) just two-and-a-half years after the first round of reviews.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.4. Con: The vote could be achieved democratically but without inappropriate states being selected, by removing the "five regional groups" system, which causes ‘closed slates’ \(where the number of candidates matches the number of available seats\).
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.5. Pro: The UN cannot be blamed for the results of a democratic election.  The blame lies with every country who voted for the inappropriate members.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1.6. Pro: [Several particularly inappropriate candidates](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/01/how-not-to-fix-the-un-human-rights-council-trump-haley-israel-palestine/amp/) were either rejected through the vote \(Belarus, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka\) or withdrew their candidacy rather than face a humiliating defeat \(Syria, Iraq\).
1.3.2.1.1.5.2. Con: This was not corruption, but a result of other states in the region not applying to be members.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: Saudi Arabia is the [leader](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/anger-after-saudi-arabia-chosen-to-head-key-un-human-rights-panel-10509716.html?) of the human rights panel. Saudi Arabia is a significant human right violator.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: [Saudi Arabia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/28/why-one-of-the-worlds-worst-human-rights-offenders-is-leading-a-un-human-rights-panel/?utm_term=.0632df46eb39) killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its embassy, sentenced a blogger to 1000 lashes for writing about free speech and has sentenced a 17 year old Arab Spring protester to beheading and crucifixion.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Saudi Arabia has terrible [human rights for women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia).
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.3. Con: The UNs independant Universal Periodic Review \(UPR\) [report on Saudi Arabias progress](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/446/49/PDF/G1844649.pdf?OpenElement) commended Saudi Arabia on steps taken towards improved Human Rights.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia had made efforts to address any criminal activities that could hinder the enjoyment of human rights, including extremism, terrorism and corruption.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia establishment of the Global Centre for Combating Extremist Ideology \(Etidal\), which [tracked and analysed](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/446/49/PDF/G1844649.pdf?OpenElement) extremist activities to confront and prevent extremism, in cooperation with the relevant States and organizations.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.3.1.2. Pro: The National Centre for Performance Measurement \(Adaa\) [has been established](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/446/49/PDF/G1844649.pdf?OpenElement) to develop indicators to measure the performance of public bodies.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.3.2. Pro: Women are [no longer](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/446/49/PDF/G1844649.pdf?OpenElement) required to obtain the approval of another person to access government services or conclude their business. 30 women have been appointed to the Consultative Council, and women had been granted the right to vote and to stand as candidates for membership of municipal councils. Six women have been appointed to the board of the Human Rights Commission.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.3.3. Con: Many countries [noted](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/446/49/PDF/G1844649.pdf?OpenElement) the improvements, but registered concern and highlighted the many remaining human rights issues.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.4. Pro: Saudi Arabia has “[arguably the worst \[human rights\] record in the world](http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.1955/scandalous-saudi-arabia-chosen-to-head-key-un-human-rights-panel.html)”.
1.3.2.1.1.5.3.5. Pro: Saudi Arabia hires a major PR firm, accused of ["whitewashing serious human rights abuses"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/pr-firm-accused-of-helping-saudi-arabia-whitewash-its-human-rights-record-a6937271.html).
1.3.2.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.3.2.1.1.7. Pro: [Independent JIC report](https://www.unjiu.org/sites/www.unjiu.org/files/jiu_document_files/products/en/reports-notes/JIU%20Products/JIU_REP_2016_4_English.pdf) says "Much more needs to be done to combat fraud in the United Nations system".
1.3.2.1.1.8. Pro: Even the UN's own internal Office of Internal Oversight Services’ \(OIOS\) [gave only a “partially satisfactory”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-corruption-exclusive/exclusive-u-n-audit-identifies-serious-lapses-linked-to-alleged-bribery-idUSKCN0X00VD) rating.
1.3.2.1.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.3.2.1.1.9. Pro: Former UN General Assembly president John Ashe \(alongside Ambassador Lorenzo and [four others](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/former-un-general-assembly-president-and-five-others-charged-in-1.3-million-bribery-scheme)\) took [$1.3million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-corruption-exclusive/exclusive-u-n-audit-identifies-serious-lapses-linked-to-alleged-bribery-idUSKCN0X00VD) from a bribery scheme.
1.3.2.1.1.9.1. Pro: United States prosecutors said he was part of a bribery scheme that involved more than [$1 million in payments](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/world/americas/john-ashe-ex-diplomat-accused-in-un-corruption-case-dies-at-61.html) from sources in China for assistance in real estate deals and other business interests.
1.3.2.1.1.9.2. Con: John Ashe was never convicted - he died awaiting trial.
1.3.2.1.1.9.2.1. Con: Fellow ambassador "Lorenzo" pleaded guilty to the bribery and money laundering, and the bribers were also convicted.  Therefore, John Ashe would certainly have been convicted if the trial had continued in absentia.
1.3.2.1.1.9.3. Pro: David Ng was [convicted after a four-week trial](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/chairman-macau-based-real-estate-development-company-convicted-trial-all-counts) on six counts in connection with his multi-year scheme to pay more than $1.3 million in bribes to ambassadors of the UN.
1.3.3. Con: Although the UN can rightly claim many successes in its history, from a political perspective it has not appeared able to solve the world’s most pressing issues of the last 1-2 decades, suggesting it has indeed passed its prime.
1.3.3.1. Con: The issues facing the world in recent decades are harder to solve than previous world issues.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In a 2015 internal report \([HIPPO](http://www.un.org/sg/pdf/HIPPO_Report_1_June_2015.pdf)\), officials warned peace operations today are deployed in an environment where there is little or no peace to keep, the current generation of conflicts is proving difficult to resolve, and that there is a widening gap between what is being asked of United Nations peace operations today and what they are able to deliver.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: It may not be they are harder to solve, per se, but that the UN has ossified and is structurally unable to solve them. For example, Trump appears to have made more progress with North Korea in a few months than the UN has in decades.
1.3.4. Pro: The UN stands for an ideal. While it might not always live up to the ideal \(for multiple reasons\) it still symbolises that ideal and we are better with than without it.
1.3.5. Con: If the UN was abolished it is plausible that a superior organisation may replace it. This would give us more hope.
1.3.5.1. Pro: A [League for Democracies](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2008/03/19/league-of-democracies) would be a better alternative to the U.N.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: A League for Democracies would not constantly be stopped from acting by China and Russia's use of the veto.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Other nations might be motivated to become democracies in order to join the newly established League.
1.3.5.1.3. Con: If requiring members to be full democracies, the number of states which could join will be limited.
1.3.5.1.3.1. Pro: Only 20 countries are ranked as "Full democracies" by the [EIU democracy index](https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index). Key world powers missing due to being "flawed democracies" are France, the [USA](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/america-democracy-rated-donald-trump-not-fully-democratic-us-president-report-the-economist-a8195121.html), Japan and India.
1.3.5.1.3.2. Con: Limiting membership is a worthwhile in this instance because it means that those who are members are able to achieve far more.
1.3.5.1.4. Con: An organisation which enables communication and working relationships between democracies and non-democracies is important.
1.3.5.1.4.1. Pro: The UN creates a forum — and an expectation for — dialogue between nations, furthering cooperation between independent nations.
1.3.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: The UN's strongest asset is its promotion of multilateralism, thus adding dynamic discussion to geopolitics and helping to prevent unilateral decision making.
1.3.5.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Engagement with the UN encourages countries to rationally analyze what they have in common and what separates them from every country, rather than to irrationally focus on a minimal number of differences.
1.3.5.1.4.1.1.2. Con: This structure can be bypassed by certain nations, such as it was during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
1.3.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: The UN serves as a place where oppressed groups can voice their grievances to the world.
1.3.5.1.4.1.3. Con: China, Russia and the United States do not feel bound by the 'expectation for dialogue between nations' and frequently act unilaterally.
1.3.5.1.4.2. Pro: The [lack of global representation in the League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations#Global_representation) was one of it's weaknesses which led to it's failure and dissolution. Encouraging non-democratic states to be part of international discourse, and allowing misbehaving states to remain part of the club are key lessons learnt by the UN.
1.3.5.1.5. Con: Other forms of governance may be as good as a democracy, for example [republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) and [meritocracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy). The UN does not preclude these systems, but a league for democracies would.
1.3.5.1.5.1. Con: Democracy is the best form of governance.
1.3.5.1.6. Pro: The League for Democracies would not face charges of hypocrisy when it formed policies which aimed to promote human rights and democracy around the world.
1.3.5.2. Pro: A new organisation would represent a fresh start. The new organisation would not be tarnished by the U.N's failures.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: The UN was a fresh start from the League of Nations, and the UN is not regularly attacked due to the failures of the League of Nations.
1.4. Con: The UN organisation is undemocratic.
1.4.1. Pro: The UN Security Council gives the unfair power of Veto to it's 5 permanent members:  China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States \(commonly called the P5\)
1.4.1.1. Con: Supporters of the veto power regard it as a [promoter of international stability](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html), a [check against military interventions](http://losangeles.china-consulate.org/eng/topnews/t1277592.htm), and a critical [safeguard against U.S. domination](https://www.rt.com/news/362914-us-russia-tensions-churkin-veto/).
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The United States has a veto, which it uses to ensure the UN does not pass policy contrary to its national interests.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Members of the P5 frequently use their veto power to single-handedly thwart otherwise popular proposals.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: But member states can bypass the veto by handing it down to the general assembly. While only being non binding this can still legally lead to the [Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force) and [Extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_377) of peacekeeping missions that have been successful such as the Korean War and suez crisis.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: In the Syria Conflict, Russian Veto [successfully paralysed the Security Council](https://news.sky.com/story/united-nations-frozen-in-place-by-russias-veto-power-on-syria-response-11324217) [multiple times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetoed_United_Nations_Security_Council_resolutions_on_Syria?wprov=sfla1). Without passing all 5 security council vetos, the UN can do nothing to help a conflict.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.2.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The security council reflects who the most powerful nations were after World War 2. It is unfair that membership of the U.N security council does not reflect current realities.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: It is unfair that small and largely unimportant nations like the U.K have a disproportionate say in how the U.N is run because they are a member of the security council and have a veto.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: India, Japan, and South Korea have more powerful militaries than the UK, according to the [global firepower index](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp).
1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: There are many nations which are more deserving of a place on the U.N security council than the U.K.
1.4.1.4. Con: The ability to Veto is important, as otherwise such a broad selection of world superpowers would be more likely to break their own resolutions if they did not vote for it themselves.  While not perfect, it is a way to ensure that resolutions are realistically followed.
1.4.2. Pro: Observer states don't have Security Council voting rights.
1.4.2.1. Con: [Any state can be elected as one of 10 temporary members of the Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council) \(1-2 year terms\).
As a Security Council would not function well with all states voting \(as in the General Assembly\), having permanent and temporary members is the most democratic solution which still functions.
1.4.2.2. Pro: If you're not the member of the Security Council, and the Security Council passes a resolution to the effect of sending military forces to your country and intervene in your disputes, you cannot even vote against it.
1.4.3. Con: The UN enables democracy in [67 countries](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) by assisting with their elections.
1.4.3.1. Con: The UN doesn't seem to be doing anything about DRCongo, it is over a year overdue to hold an election.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Elections [due in December 2017 at the latest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/drc-violence-shows-kabila-determined-stay-power-180101102949537.html) have still not happened, and incumbent Joseph Kabila has turned to violence.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: The MONUSCO force will facilitate a transfer of power in January 2019, by registering voters, observe and report human rights abuses, and help train train Congolese police to secure the polls.
This mandatory assistance could [scuttle Kabila's attempts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/joseph-kabila-drc-elections-monusco) to pass off a potentially flawed election as a legitimate affair.
1.4.4. Pro: Only about 41% of the U.N. member states are free democracies. Each country gets an equal vote in the General Assembly, so any decision can be considered largely undemocratic. - [src](http://qr.ae/TUTU7T)
1.4.5. Pro: The UN is made of nation-states who will ultimately pursue their own agenda. So little collective good is to be expected.
1.4.5.1. Con: The [General Assembly](http://www.un.org/en/ga/) decides on all resolutions by vote, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass.
Nation-state agendas will not succeed unless supported by most of the world.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: By each nation in the UN following their own agenda, the outcome of their discussions is most likely a resolution that shares common ground among most members. Collective good might be little, but is an equally shared win for almost everyone altogether.
1.4.5.2. Con: Nation-states considered to be democracies are often similar as [political representatives](http://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-46) also end up pursuing their own agenda.
1.4.5.3. Con: Nations are forced to pursue collective action when the scale of problems which they face are insurmountable unless they act collectively.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Influential countries \(for example US, China\) in the UN have their own agendas disadvantaging the underdeveloped countries \(mostly in Africa\).
1.4.5.4.1. Con: The bulk of the UN's $8bn per year spent on global peacekeeping, [goes to missions in Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38372614).
1.4.5.4.2. Con: The General Assembly recently approved a [$54 billion dollar budget](https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/12/640451-general-assembly-approves-54-billion-un-budget-next-two-years) for UN efforts in Africa over the biennium 2018-2019.
1.4.5.4.2.1. Con: This budget is $286 million below the budget for 2016-2017 and $193 million below a proposal made by the Secretary-General.
1.4.5.4.3. Con: The UN's IMF \(International Monetary Fund\) worked with the World Bank, AfDB and G8 to [write off $40 to $55 billion in debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals) owed by members of the heavily indebted poor countries \(HIPC\), [85% of which are in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavily_indebted_poor_countries).
1.4.5.4.4. Con: The UN keeps a list of its 8 highest priority high-level areas of work.  [Africa is the only region earning its own spot in the list](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/71/6%20\(Part%20One\)), amongst maintenance of international peace and security, promotion of human rights, etc..
This indicates that at a high level, support to African countries is high on the overall UN agenda.
1.4.5.4.5. Pro: The UN's mission in South Sudan \(UNMISS\) was accused of [lacking neutrality by giving arms to rebels](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38372614) in the town of Bentiu in 2013.
1.4.5.4.5.1. Pro: [The report](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/sudan-hsba.html) accused UNMISS of underreporting arms confiscated from fleeing soldiers and handing over the weapons to soldiers of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition \(SPLM-IO\) on more than one occasion.
Shortly after this transfer of arms, the rebels went on to carry out a massacre of civilians.
1.5. Pro: The UN has pioneered [Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights).
1.5.1. Pro: The UN's hiring policy has achieved high levels diversity.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The UN has [achieved gender parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations#cite_note-16) in its employees at the P-1 and P-2 levels of responsibility.
1.5.1.2. Con: UN Senior leadership as of 2015 was [made up of 78% men](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/uncoordination/documents/overview/unsystem/unsystem-infographic.pdf), and all grades above P3 have a male majority.
1.5.1.3. Pro: The UN [recently elected](https://www.facebook.com/unitednations/videos/10156576454165820/) their 4th female General Assembly president.
1.5.2. Pro: [UN Women](http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women) and [UNIFEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Fund_for_Women) work for global empowerment of women.
1.5.3. Con: The United States [left the UN's human rights council](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/44537372), calling it 'a cesspool of political bias'.
1.5.3.1. Con: The United States is arguably, itself, "a cesspool of political bias".
1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.5.4. Con: The United Nations Human Rights Council \(UNHRC\) membership is full of inappropriate members.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.5.1.
1.5.4.2. Pro: China, Russia, Cuba and Venezuela manage to get elected repeatedly, despite human rights violations.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Sudan, perpetrator of the world’s most recent genocide, [is a member](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations).
1.5.4.4. Pro: Zimbabwe, home to land grabs, internationally condemned elections, and a state-controlled press, [is a member](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations).
1.5.4.5. Con: From 2007-2015, a large majority of its membership has been composed of states that meet the free and partly free standards of Freedom House \([between 74 and 85 percent](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/)\).  Not-free states have never won more than about a quarter of the seats.
1.5.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.5.3.
1.5.4.7. Con: It is better that all nations belong to the UNHCR, this ensures that all nations are part of the conversation concerning how to improve human rights.
1.5.4.8. Con: It is important that all citizens, regardless of who their political leaders are, are represented by the UNHCR.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.5.1.3.
1.5.6. Pro: [80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_treaties_by_number_of_parties#List_of_treaties_by_number_of_parties) treaties/declarations in total have been achieved by the UN.
1.5.6.1. Con: Most, if not all, the treaties contain reservation systems which allow nations to ignore critical components of a treaty.
1.5.6.2. Con: UN treaties are frequently ignored, unimplemented, or ineffective.
1.5.7. Pro: Migrants have their basic human rights preserved through the UN's [Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/world/europe/united-nations-migration-agreement.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FUnited%20Nations&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection).
1.5.8. Pro: The UN has [secured rights for LGBT individuals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_at_the_United_Nations) even if they are limited in some areas. Via vote, it has a majority of states supporting at least basic rights for LGBT individuals.
1.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.1.2.
1.5.10. Con: Pioneering in itself is void of accolades if the rights of many groups and humans are still in violation without resolve.
1.5.10.1. Con: [It is better to do something imperfectly than nothing perfectly.](https://www.brainyquote.com/photos_tr/en/r/roberthschuller/155997/roberthschuller1-2x.jpg)
1.5.11. Con: Human rights in the abstract mean very little unless there is a body which has a duty \(and capacity\) to enforce them. The U.N despite its historic role in pioneering human rights lacks the capacity to prevent human rights violations.
1.6. Con: The world doesn't need an organisation like the UN.
1.6.1. Con: -> See discussion #5515: States should aim for more and stronger international institutions.
1.6.2. Pro: The Security Council is not needed, as Security is already upheld by NATO, the EU, and nation states cooperating.
1.6.2.1. Con: The UN is not only the Security Council. Without the UN and its different sub-organizations such as UNESCO a lot of historical places would have been destroyed, and WHO is participating in promoting healthcare. The HRCs contribution to Human rights is also needed.
1.6.2.2. Con: NATO and EU excludes many countries which would see their self-determination further jeopardized without an organization like the UN.
1.6.2.3. Pro: -> See discussion #17915: The UN Security Council should be dissolved.
1.6.3. Pro: The Bible warns against an organisation such as the UN.
1.6.3.1. Con: The Christian God and texts are [not universally accepted](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629) as truth.
1.6.3.2. Pro: [Christian Futurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism_\(Christianity\)) says [the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_\(Revelation\)) \(numbered 666 and signifying the Apocalypse\) in Revelation is a [symbol of a future worldwide political system](https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/what-does-666-mean/#?insight\[search_id\]=2434bb4d-ef98-42ea-a911-5959a2b2edd6&insight\[search_result_index\]=2) with "authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation" \([Chapter 13 : Verse 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A1-10&version=KJV)\).
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Throughout Revelation the number 7 is used to represent completeness or perfection. The number 6 is "a man's number," symbolism imperfection. History shows and the discussion corroborates that the UN is far from perfect.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: Not every Christian adheres to this interpretation.
1.6.3.2.3. Pro: This fits the UN, as it has authority over every country and therefore all people and tongues.
1.6.4. Con: In a world with almost [200](http://www.worldometers.info/geography/how-many-countries-are-there-in-the-world/) nations, an organization that gathers nations is needed.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Without the UN as a place for nations to discuss the issues with their allies and enemies, more chaos is likely to ensue.
1.6.5. Con: Global threats like climate change ask for more globally united responses then challenges of the past. Creating this unity from all countries to all countries would require 200^2 / 2 interactions, while the UN requires just 200 interactions \(if 200 is the number of nations\). The total of 200^2/2 interactions all coming out positively is not achievable, therefore an organisation like the UN is necessary.
1.6.6. Con: A lot of wars have been solved by nations discussing around a table to enforce peaceful resolution of conflicts.
1.6.6.1. Pro: The [Congress of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin) solved the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and granted independence to a lot of countries in the Balkans.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: The Congress of Berlin was held after a Russian victory in the war, meaning that the congress in no way solved the war.
1.6.7. Pro: Nation states should have the right to pursue what is in their own best interests. Organisations like the U.N which undermine state sovereignty are not needed.
1.7. Pro: No other organisation has provided more global health benefits than the UN, through the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and other branches \(UNICEF, WFP\).
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.7.2. Pro: The UN's [ODA set a target of 0.7% of GNI](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/ODA-history-of-the-0-7-target.pdf) for developed nations foreign aid spending.
1.7.2.1. Con: Fourty years in, the average contribution was only [0.4%](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/ODA-history-of-the-0-7-target.pdf).
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The 2018 [OECD average](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5260997/UK-one-seven-nations-hit-foreign-0-7-aid-target.html) was only 0.32%.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Regardless if met fully or not, promoting such an international target is hugely beneficial for encouraging aid spending and formalising commitment to assisting developing countries.
1.7.2.3. Con: In 2015, [only 6 countries are meeting the target](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/04/uk-among-six-countries-hit-un-aid-spending-target-oecd) \(UK, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden\).
1.7.3. Pro: The UN's [World Food Programme](http://www1.wfp.org/overview) \(WFP\) provides food assistance to [80 million people in 80 countries](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) each year.
1.7.4. Pro: The UN is the only organisation to get 128 countries legally bound to take a range of measures to protect human health and the environment by addressing mercury throughout its lifecycle. All mercury mining has stopped and mercury recycling is being implemented globally.
1.7.5. Con: Although some branches of the UN may be good and effective, this does not mean that overall the UN is fit for purpose. If the UN was to be radically overhauled, parts that work relatively well like the WHO could be maintained.
1.7.6. Pro: The [WHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) is the [predominant agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health) associated with global health.
1.7.7. Pro: UNICEF manages over [$5,000,000,000](https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/2018-2021_Integrated_Budget_EB_Informal_23_June_FINAL.pdf) of aid for humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries.
1.7.8. Pro: The Global Humanitarian Overview \(GHO\) is appealing for and coordinates [$25.3 billion of humanitarian aid for 95.3 million people](http://interactive.unocha.org/publication/globalhumanitarianoverview/) in 2018.
1.7.9. Pro: [45%](https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/un-card-10-facts/index.html) of all children in the world are vaccinated by the UN, saving 3 million lives a year.
1.8. Con: The UN's [cost](https://fts.unocha.org/appeals/overview/2018) is too high for its output.
1.8.1. Con: The IMF and the World Bank secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, and enable sustainable economic growth. These global financial benefits offset much of the UN's budget costs.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.8.3. Pro: Private sector organisations could do many tasks which are currently conducted by the U.N at a much lower cost.
1.8.4. Pro: Many who formerly worked with the UN have [reported on how inefficient](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/becky-tinsley-the-un-is-inefficient-wasteful-self-serving-and-plain-corrupt-313407.html) it can be when compared to "Small, lean Non-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\)".
1.8.5. Con: US studies show that UN peacekeeping missions are an estimated [8 times more cost-effective](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/articles/2017-05-30/peacekeeping-cost-effective-must-adapt-new-reality) than when the US acts alone.
1.9. Con: The UN is slow, bureaucratic, and full of red tape.
1.9.1. Con: The first car was slow and unreliable but that does not mean a car is not, in principle, a good thing.
1.9.2. Pro: The UN is inefficient as it is run mostly by the USA.
1.9.2.1. Pro: If the UN voted to put sanctions against an ally of the USA that was breaking the Universal declaration of human rights, it would most likely not go through and the same goes for other countries that the USA favours. This allows for the cherry picking of issues due to the dominance of the United states in funding the UN.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: For it to pass, a sanctions resolution must obtain a majority vote from the 15-member Security Council, and it must [not be vetoed by any of the five permanent members of the Security Council](https://globalinvestigationsreview.com/guide/the-guide-sanctions/first-edition/article/un-sanctions#:~:text=For%20it%20to%20pass%2C%20a%20sanctions%20resolution%20must%20obtain%20a%20majority%20vote%20from%20the%2015%2Dmember%20Security%20Council%2C%20and%20it%20must%20not%20be%20vetoed%20by%20any%20of%20the%20five%20permanent%20members%20of%20the%20Security%20Council%20\(China%2C%20France%2C%20Russia%2C%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20and%20the%20United%20States\).) \(China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States\). This gives the USA no more chance to cherry-pick sanctions than the other major world powers.
1.9.2.2. Con: The USA's [strongest ally](https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-the-strongest-American-ally-in-the-Middle-East) in the middle east is Israel, and they have a [close and supportive relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations), but Israel still received more UN Human Rights condemnations than the rest of the world combined. This shows that the US is unable to cherry pick Human Rights issues.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.9.2.3. Con: The UN sets a [22%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#Funding) limit on contributions to the Regular Budget, based on the relative capacity of each country to pay, measured by its gross national income \(GNI\). This is designed so that countries with more money pay more, but the UN is not dependent on any one member to finance its operations.
1.9.2.4. Pro: The US contributes [$10 billion USD \(22%\)](https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs) of the UN's regular budget, and is the biggest contributor \([$1.6 billion USD / 9.3%](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-countries-contributing-to-the-united-nations.html)\) to the Voluntary Budget.
1.9.2.5. Con: The US is not able to use it's majority funding to influence the main decision making body of the UN: the General Assembly.
1.9.2.5.1. Pro: The [General Assembly votes to approve the regular budget](https://research.un.org/en/docs/budget/bodies), which means that the US cannot direct it's contributions based on it's own political interests.
1.9.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.9.2.5.2. Pro: The [Fifth Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Fifth_Committee) and the [Audit Board](http://www.un.org/en/auditors/board/membership.shtml) are central in creating the budget, but the US is not a member of either and so is unable to directly influence the proposed budget.
1.9.2.6. Con: The UN has been quite unsuccessful in sanctioning every country that has broken the UN's declaration of human rights e.g. Israel which is committing many war crimes and illegally occupying Palestinian territory. Israel continues to enjoy support from UN countries and thus has been allowed to continue relatively unscathed from the UN. It receives a lot of support from the US which is a major country in the UN which shows how ineffective the UN is at implementing it's policies on US allies.
1.9.3. Con: Bureaucrats should not be stigmatized. Large organisations like the U.N require them in order to function.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.1.
1.11. Con: Many UN operations have ended in scandal or disaster.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.11.2. Con: Many have not. Many political careers end in scandal and disaster but we aren't phasing out politicians.
1.11.3. Pro: UN aid workers were the cause of a [cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_Haiti_cholera_outbreak) which killed over 10,000 Haitians and sickened hundreds of thousands more.  Yet the UN claimed diplomatic immunity and refused to provide compensation.
1.11.3.1. Con: We can only take reasonable precautions to prevent the spread of diseases. It would be impractical to screen every aid worker for every disease before travel. Therefore it is not reasonable to blame the UN for the outbreak, only for the cover-up. It seems Cholera arrived with UN troops, but it was not caused by them. They are as much victims of the disease as everyone else.
1.11.3.2. Pro: The UN [admitted responsibility](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/dec/01/haiti-cholera-outbreak-stain-on-reputation-un-says) only after 6 years.
1.11.3.3. Pro: The $400 million promised to repair damage was [only 2.2% funded](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-cholera-rights/un-criticized-for-failing-on-promise-to-help-haiti-cholera-victims-idUSKBN1I105G) \($8.7 million\) halfway through the fund’s expected three-year term.
1.11.3.4. Con: The UN did more good than bad in Haiti, with [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_Haiti) [peacekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Stabilisation_Mission_in_Haiti) [missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_for_Justice_Support_in_Haiti) over 17 years and counting.
1.11.4. Con: This is partly the case because the UN is relatively open to critique and can get critique from any organisation in the world as it meddles with the entire world.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.11.5. Con: The UN also receives more critique because they are supposed to be a neutral organisation. As of late any military intervention of Russia is aimed at its own gain rather than helping locals or peace. They get critiqued for this, but it doesn't cause there efforts to be recognized as a scandal or disaster.
1.11.6. Con: It is inevitable that any organisation which has existed for as long as the U.N has will have some scandals and disasters. What matters more is how the organisation has learned from these mistakes, and what reforms have been implemented.
1.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.11.7. Pro: There have been numerous incidents of sexual abuse.
1.11.7.1. Con: The UN is taking [several good steps](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/02/1003321) to prevent sexual abuse.
1.11.7.1.1. Con: Only [one](https://www.justsecurity.org/59682/unchanging-reality-sex-abuse-scandal/) civilian peacekeeper has been prosecuted for sexual abuse.
1.11.7.2. Pro: Ruud Lubbers resigned as UN High Commissioner for Refugees after a confidential internal investigation by the OIOS [substantiated an allegation of sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_Lubbers#Sexual_harassment_complaint).
1.11.7.2.1. Pro: A copy of the report was [leaked a year later](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/harassment-intimidation-and-secrecy-un-chief-engulfed-in-sex-scandal-483851.html), revealing that further allegations surfaced, a pattern of sexual harassment was indicated, and that the verdict was "that Lubbers abused his authority to influence the outcome of the Investigation."
1.11.7.2.2. Pro: The U.N. Staff Union complained about the [lack of transparency](http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/12/corruption-un-failing-to-practise-good-governance/) in this investigation.
1.11.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.
1.11.7.4. Pro: The UN is [powerless](https://www.justsecurity.org/59682/unchanging-reality-sex-abuse-scandal/) to prosecute individuals who commit sexual abuse.
1.11.7.4.1. Con: It is up to member states to hold their soldiers accountable for crimes which they have committed. So far member states have not done enough to prosecute peacekeepers and stop sexual abuse occurring.
1.11.7.5. Con: Over 95,000 civilians and 90,000 uniformed personnel work for the UN. The majority of these individuals do not participate in sexual abuse or exploitation. The incidents of sexual abuse which have been documented [do not reflect](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/02/1003321) the overall character of the UN and those who work for it.
1.11.7.5.1. Pro: Private companies with large number of employees also have sexual scandals from a few of those employees. We do not question those companies usefulness to society. \([1](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/walmart-not-liable-for-employee%E2%80%99s-off-duty-sexual-assault.aspx)\) \([2](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17017814/amazon-transparent-jeffrey-tambor-sexual-harassment-investigation)\) \([3](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/technology/amazon-sexual-harassment.html)\)
1.11.7.5.1.1. Con: That does not mean that we shouldn't question those companies or that we shouldn't question the UN.
1.11.7.5.2. Pro: Sexual problems in armies are rife. The problem does not come from UN but from military personnel provided by national armies and UN can only put controls in place to try and prevent that.
1.11.7.5.2.1. Pro: There has been numerous documented cases of sexual assault done by modern armies. Nobody says those armies are evil and should be dismantled because of that. \([1](https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/defence-secretary-gavin-williamson-appalled-six-soldiers-arrested-sexual-assault/)\) \([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault_in_the_United_States_military#Individual_incidents_towards_civilians)\) \([3](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/french-troops-accused-of-forcing-girls-to-have-sex-with-dog-in-car-as-rape-claims-against-un-a6961711.html)\) \([4](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/27/sexual-harassment-increases-german-armed-forces-80-2017-reports-say/1071886001/)\)
1.11.7.5.3. Pro: The UN as an organisation is not responsible for punishing uniformed personnel, it’s [up to UN member states to hold their own soldiers accountable](https://www.justsecurity.org/59682/unchanging-reality-sex-abuse-scandal/).
1.11.7.6. Con: Sexual abuse has been committed by the french military who were working for the UN. However no one says that the French army is bad and should be dismantled. \([1](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/french-troops-accused-of-forcing-girls-to-have-sex-with-dog-in-car-as-rape-claims-against-un-a6961711.html)\)
1.11.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.5.3.
1.11.7.7. Pro: European, U.N. troops accused of sexual abuse in Central African Republic - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-un-crime-idUSKCN0V70XU)
1.11.7.8. Pro: UN reports in DRC \(Democratic Republic of Congo\)  found allegations of [217 instances of peacekeepers who paid girls, aged 18 and under, for sexual relations with money, food or clothing](http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/166198/A_61_841-EN.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y).
1.11.7.8.1. Pro: The Congo sex scandal, first uncovered in February 2004, [continued for over a year](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) even after UN officials had knowledge of allegations that their peacekeepers had raped children as young as 12 and committed numerous other sex crimes.
1.11.7.8.2. Pro: Hundreds of images of child pornography involving Congolese children were [found on the laptop](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) of a French UN civilian working in Goma.
1.11.7.8.3. Con: Only [six](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/investigation-oios-allegations-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-un) cases were fully substantiated.
1.11.7.8.3.1. Con: The UN [did not charge](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) any of the six.
1.11.7.8.4. Pro: The UN also [received reports](http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/166198/A_61_841-EN.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) of 10 girls who had given birth to or were pregnant with children allegedly fathered by peacekeepers. In all, 75 peacekeepers were alleged to have engaged in sexual relations with Congolese girls.
1.11.7.9. Pro: Between 2004 and 2016, the United Nations [received almost 2,000 allegations](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/peacekeepers-harm-good-170730091925152.html) of sexual exploitation and abuse against its peacekeepers, according to an investigation by the Associated Press \(AP\).
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.4.5.
1.12. Con: The UN is unable to be a force for good because member states continually fail to adequately support the organisation.
1.12.1. Pro: The United States regularly [refuses to pay](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/weekinreview/the-world-why-does-the-united-states-refuse-to-pay-its-un-bill.html?pagewanted=1) the U.N what it owes the organisation because it claims that the U.N acts contrary to American interests.
1.12.1.1. Con: The United States funds [22%](https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-funding-united-nations-more-anybody-realizes) of the U.N's total budget. It is not fair to criticize the United States for not paying the U.N.
1.12.1.2. Con: The primary obligation of the United States is to its own citizens. Thus, the United States should not fund UN activities which may harm US citizens.
1.12.2. Pro: Developed nations often refuse to contribute large numbers of [troops](https://www.un.org/press/en/2000/20001108.gaspd199.doc.html) to peacekeeping operations.
1.12.3. Pro: The United States frequently [undermines](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/23/un-resolution-passes-trump-us-veto-threat-abortion-language-removed) attempts by the U.N to improve access to abortion globally.
1.12.4. Pro: There is a [historic pattern](https://www.pambazuka.org/arts/review-we-did-nothing-linda-polman) which occurs. Members states fail to provide the U.N with the support, or mandate that it requires to respond to a crisis. Member states will then blame the UN instead of reflecting on how their conduct contributed to the U.N being unable to do its job.
1.12.5. Pro: The USA either [vetos](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/43-times-us-has-used-veto-power-against-un-resolutions-israel) or fails to provide funding for programs which are [designed to help](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/25/donald-trump-cuts-more-than-200m-in-aid-to-palestinians) Palestinians.
1.13. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.14. Pro: The UN has moved us closer to world peace.
1.14.1. Pro: The UN has been [beneficial in preventing](https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2015/09/11/how-the-un-contributes-to-conflict-prevention/) armed combat between nations, which is a step in a positive direction.
1.14.2. Con: The problem with the UN is that it is very difficult to arbitrate a dispute when one side or the other is not committed to peace and unwilling to compromise.
1.14.2.1. Con: Trying something difficult \(but positive\) should be considered a good thing.
1.14.2.1.1. Pro: Trying to tackle the hardest challenges could be considered better than only tackling easy challenges.
1.14.2.1.1.1. Pro: Tackling the hardest challenges can help the UN better learn how to make a bigger impact in the world.
1.14.2.2. Pro: World peace is an unreachable dream, as the majority seldom wants real peace.
1.14.2.3. Pro: This is an age-old problem. Even worse now when people are “not open to any agreement.“ \([2 Timothy 3:3](http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm)\)
1.14.2.3.1. Con: Many argue that we are in the [most peaceful](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/steven-pinker-this-is-historys-most-peaceful-time-new-study-not-so-fast/) period of human history, and human rights have [greatly improved](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/history-human-rights) in recent history.

This would suggest we are not in the [last days](http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm), and may in-fact be in the best position in history to move towards world peace.
1.14.2.3.2. Con: Even if it is difficult or harder than ever, we [should all make every effort to live in peace](https://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/12-14.html) with everyone.
1.14.2.4. Con: Difficult does not mean impossible. It is possible to still bring about some positive change without complete and full cooperation.
1.14.2.5. Con: -> See 1.5.10.1.
1.14.3. Pro: The UN's [International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/en) \(also known as the World Court\) is the worlds highest court, settling disputes between nations.
1.14.3.1. Con: The World Court has no automatic jurisdiction forcing the 193 member states to submit to decisions, unless both parties have agreed to submit to its decision.
1.14.3.1.1. Con: The Security Council is used as enforcement for any disputes involving aggression.
1.14.3.1.1.1. Con: The permanent members of the Security Council are able to veto enforcement of cases, even those to which they are the defendant, or which they consented to be bound.
1.14.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.14.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Republic of Nicaragua [successfully won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States) a ICJ court case against the USA, who had supported a rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and mined Nicaragua's harbors.

However, the USA used it's Security Council power to block enforcement and prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any compensation.
1.14.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [Court found that](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qu7QCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA381&lpg=PA381&dq="breach+of+its+obligations+under+customary+international+law+not+to+use+force+against+another+State"&source=bl&ots=TTdg-nCxwB&sig=0PNimCg9rT2dE0jH6T0IEfKxvAk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA6b2G3pfcAhVlJ8AKHTPYBC8Q6AEwAXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q="breach%20of%20its%20obligations%20under%20customary%20international%20law%20not%20to%20use%20force%20against%20another%20State"&f=false) the United States was
"in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State",
"not to intervene in its affairs",
"not to violate its sovereignty",
"not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce", and
"in breach of its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956."
1.14.3.2. Con: Organizations, private enterprises, and individuals cannot have their cases taken to the International Court or appeal a national supreme court's ruling.
This means that the potential victims of crimes against humanity, such as minor ethnic groups or indigenous peoples, may not have appropriate backing by a state.
1.14.4. Pro: The UN [keeps peace](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) with 117,000 peacekeepers in 15 operations in 4 continents.
1.14.5. Pro: The UN has earned the [Nobel Peace Prize eleven times](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/united-nations-and-nobel-peace-prize/), more than any other entity.
1.14.5.1. Pro: "In 70 years, the United Nations, its specialised agencies, related agencies, funds, programmes and staff were awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize eleven times. One agency, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) received the famous prize in both 1954 and 1981."
1.14.5.2. Con: The Nobel Peace Prize is often used as a political tool, granting authority and legitimacy rather than recognizing actual achievement.
1.14.5.2.1. Pro: The Nobel Peace Prize was inappropriately given to Palestinian leader [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat) and Israeli leaders [Shimon Peres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres) and [Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin) for the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords).
1.14.5.2.1.1. Pro: Yasser Arafat wore his [holstered pistol](https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/6_memorable_props_used_by_spea.html) before addressing the General Assembly.
1.14.5.2.1.2. Pro: Shimon Peres was [involved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres#1956_Suez_Crisis) \(as Director-General of the Ministry of Defence, alongside the UK and France\) with planning the 1956 [Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis).
1.14.5.2.1.3. Pro: Yasser Afarat is often accused of being the "[Father of Modern Terrorism](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Father+of+Modern+Terrorism)" for [acts including](https://www.quora.com/Was-Yasser-Arafat-a-terrorist) founding [Fatah](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/the-father-of-modern-terrorism-the-true-legacy-of-yasser-arafat/), and the [PLO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization#Political_status).
1.14.5.2.1.4. Pro: James Phillips [wrote](https://www.heritage.org/homeland-security/report/detoxifying-yasser-arafats-disastrous-legacy) for The Heritage Foundation \(a US conservative public policy think tank\) that "Yasser Arafat, who died on November 11, has left the Middle East a more brutal, nasty, and toxic place. Arafat's disastrous leadership exploded the once promising Arab-Israeli peace process and left the Palestinians mired in growing violence, anarchy, and misery."
1.14.5.2.1.5. Con: The Oslo Accords were a huge step forward for peace, and established a timetable for the Middle East peace process.

Even if both sides had committed many wrongs, rewarding major progress in one of the longest running modern disputes helps encourage future cooperation, and reward the work so far.
1.14.5.2.2. Pro: Barack Obama [received](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize) the Nobel Prize once, suggesting that recipients are not necessarily deserving.
1.14.5.2.2.1. Pro: Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute for 25 years until stepping down last year, [indicated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/18/former-top-nobel-official-says-maybe-obamas-peace-prize-was-not-such-a-good-idea/72396794/) the prize was in anticipation of and intended to help Obama rid the world of nuclear weapons. This of course did not happen, suggesting the award was not, in the end, deserved.
1.14.5.2.3. Pro: The Nobel Peace Prize 2013 was awarded to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons "for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons", and yet there were subsequent chemical weapons attacks in [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douma_chemical_attack) and the [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/novichok-attack-russian-spies-airport-security-how-smuggled-chemical-weapon-russia-uk-a8534511.html)
1.14.5.2.3.1. Con: Working to eliminate chemical weapons is still laudable, even if the goal hasn't been achieved.
1.14.5.2.4. Pro: The [2007 Nobel Peace prize](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/intergovernmental-panel-climate-change-ipcc-and-albert-arnold-al-gore-jr/index.html) was awarded for climate change, but 11 years on very little progress has been made that could be attributed to UN actions.
1.14.5.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.14.5.2.5. Pro: The 2005 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\), and yet the UN clearly failed to address nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Iran, and a lack of clarity on Iraq’s nuclear programme helped lead to the Iraq war.
1.14.5.2.5.1. Con: The UN has moved the world towards Nuclear Disarmament.
1.14.5.2.5.1.1. Pro: [Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Prohibition_of_Nuclear_Weapons) - the UN Achieved the first legally binding international agreement on nuclear weapons.
1.14.5.2.5.1.1.1. Con: No nuclear powers or members of NATO have signed.
1.14.5.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: The vast majority of the world [agreed](https://www.un.org/disarmament/tpnw/index.html) on this treaty. [122 were in favour,](https://s3.amazonaws.com/unoda-web/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/A.Conf_.229.2017.L.3.Rev_.1.pdf) 1 voted against \(Netherlands\), and 1 abstained \(Singapore\). Others abstained.
1.14.5.2.5.1.1.3. Con: History shows that similar treaties like [the NPT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) have been used to apply political pressure \(e.g. [War against Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War) and [sanctions against Iran](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/17/in-exiting-the-iran-deal-trump-left-u-n-sanctions-relief-intact-why-that-could-pose-problems-down-the-road/)\).
1.14.5.2.5.1.2. Con: It is still debated whether nuclear weapons are positive or negative.
1.14.5.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #1125: An intended first use of strategic nuclear weapons is morally wrong.
1.14.5.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: -> See discussion #1108: The U.S. had to use nuclear weapons to achieve its goal of Japan unconditionally surrendering.
1.14.5.2.5.1.2.3. Pro: -> See discussion #2853: The US should not try to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
1.14.5.2.5.1.2.4. Pro: The presence of nuclear weapons in the world reduces the likelihood of major global powers going to war against each other.
1.14.5.2.5.1.3. Pro: [Non-Proliferation Treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) \(NPT\) - The UN achieved the first international agreement to pursue nuclear disarmament.
1.14.5.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: More countries have adhered to the NPT [than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/) \(191 states, [as of August 2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons)\).
1.14.5.2.5.1.4. Con: When North Korea broke the UN's nuclear rules, the UN failed to prevent them from continuing nuclear development.
1.14.5.2.5.1.4.1. Con: The UN was able to apply [universal sanctions since 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea#United_Nations_Security_Council_sanctions), which no other entity is able to do. The sanctions were obligatory for all states around the world.
1.14.5.2.5.1.4.1.1. Con: Multiple UN member states have repeatedly [violated](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-nations-report-says-member-states-help-north-korea-evade-sanctions/) these sanctions and/or do not report violations by North Korea.
1.14.5.2.5.1.4.1.2. Con: Anecdotal evidence from visitors, on-the-ground reportage and official sources [suggest](https://www.38north.org/2018/10/aabrahamian101918/) the consumer economy overall has been minimally affected. While some sectors \(coal, seafood\) of the economy have suffered, the price of food, clothes and daily-use items has remained stable, so most people have been able to live normally.
1.14.5.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.5.2.5.1.4.
1.14.5.2.6. Pro: The [2001 Nobel Peace prize](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/united-nations-and-kofi-annan/index.html) went to Kofi Annan for his work “for a better organized and more peaceful world” and to “revitalise the UN”. This woolly reasoning acknowledges that the UN was underperforming beforehand, and 20 years later the UN appears to still be underperforming.
1.14.5.2.7. Con: The [1988 Nobel Prize](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/united-nations-peacekeeping-forces/index.html) to UN Peacekeeping forces appears well justified, although this was now 30 years ago.
1.14.6. Con: Although true in the past, this does not appear to be true in recent years.
1.14.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.14.7. Pro: -> See 1.14.5.2.5.1.
1.14.8. Pro: UN is one of the biggest platform to establish peace in the world.
1.14.8.1. Pro: The UN has 193 member states, and including observer states/states with non-member access it brings together every country in the world.
1.14.9. Con: The UN has failed to maintain consistency in peace among countries.
1.14.9.1. Pro: The UN has an inability to prevent conflicts.
1.14.9.1.1. Pro: There are no legal consequences for violating a Security Council resolution.
1.14.9.1.1.1. Pro: There couldn't possibly be, as [international politics is based on anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_\(international_relations\)).
1.14.9.1.1.1.1. Con: International politics can be anarchic \(ie have no supreme authority or sovereign\) but still collaboratively enforce the legal consequences of breaking international law.
1.14.9.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The world [enforces international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law#Courts_and_enforcement) upon UN members that violate its charter through the Security Council.
1.14.9.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The UN/US's sanctions against Iran successfully and legally created consequences for breaking Nuclear Profileration laws.
1.14.9.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran#Effects) damaged Iranian oil exports, nuclear programs, and had other social and economic effects.
1.14.9.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.
1.14.9.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.2.
1.14.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.14.9.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.14.9.1.4. Pro: Srebrenica had been declared a UN "safe area" and was even protected by 400 armed Dutch peace keepers, but the UN forces [did nothing to prevent the largest case of mass murder](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/05/watched-massacre-unfold-croatia-160520085629629.html) on the European continent since WWII.
1.14.9.1.4.1. Con: The entire Dutch cabinet resigned in the aftermath of a [report blaming the Dutch Government and senior military officials](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1933144.stm) for the massacre.
1.14.9.1.4.1.1. Con: The report also criticised the UN, which it said should share responsibility with the Dutch Government.
1.14.9.1.4.1.2. Con: After going through the court of appeals the dutch liability was reduced to 30%, and after going through the supreme court it was [reduced to 10%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49042372).
1.14.9.1.5. Pro: The UN failed it's intervention with the Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\), previously the Republic of the Congo.
1.14.9.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.14.9.1.5.2. Con: The Congo was the UN's first peacekeeping mission with a significant military force, so some juvenile problems are to be expected.
1.14.9.1.5.3. Pro: [At least 1.7 million people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/drc-violence-shows-kabila-determined-stay-power-180101102949537.html) were newly displaced in the Congo as the political situation deteriorated across the country this year \(2017\), according to ACAPS, a Geneva-based think-tank that monitors humanitarian developments.
1.14.9.1.5.4. Con: In March 2018, the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \(MONUSCO\) [authorised 16,215 military personnel](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1006121), 660 military observers and staff officers, 391 police personnel, and 1,050 personnel of formed police units, until 31 March 2019.
1.14.9.1.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.2.
1.14.9.1.5.4.2. Con: Renewed presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not equate to a success.
1.14.9.1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.8.
1.14.9.1.6. Pro: The UN did not prevent the Rwandan Genocide.
1.14.9.1.6.1. Pro: UN is chief Ban Ki-moon said the UN is still[ashamed over its failure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26917419) to prevent the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, saying "we could have done much more. We should have done much more".
1.14.9.1.6.2. Pro: The UN knew their Rwandan policy was a failure, but did nothing to change it.
1.14.9.1.6.2.1. Pro: Once the killings started there was [a lack of political will](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/201-rwanda/39240.html) from member states and in particular Security Council members to authorize the use of a robust peacekeeping force.
1.14.9.1.6.2.2. Pro: 'We were perfectly aware of what was about to happen. Our mission was a tragic failure. Everyone considered it a form of desertion. Pulling out under such circumstances was an act of total cowardice,' - [Colonel Luc Marchal, UN commanding officer in rwanda.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/19/theobserver3)  The first few thousand died within hours of the start of the UN withdrawal.
1.14.9.1.6.3. Pro: The UN ignored multiple sources of evidence which suggested that a genocide would occur.
1.14.9.1.6.3.1. Pro: The Secretary General of the UN received a cable from Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire on Jan. 11, 1994 which warned of the risk of genocide. The secretary general [did not share](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/201-rwanda/39240.html) this cable with the Security Council.
1.14.9.1.6.3.2. Pro: In [August 1993](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/201-rwanda/39240.html), the United Nations and Security Council ignored a report by the UN human rights investigator for Rwanda who warned that a genocide might occur.
1.14.9.1.6.4. Pro: The outbreak of genocide can [partly](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/on-22nd-anniversary-rwandan-genocide-bill-clinton_b_9677440) be attributed to the UN's decision to significantly reduce the size and scope of its peacekeeping force in Rwanda.
1.14.9.1.6.5. Pro: When the genocide occurred the UN showed [more concern](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/19/theobserver3) for evacuating white foreigners rather than stopping the genocide.
1.14.9.1.6.6. Con: The US used it's power to [block UN attempts to bolster troops](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1998/12/29/the-rwanda-failure/df77dcd5-111e-4f32-835e-6569b3a88d58/?utm_term=.431facc29ced) in response to the brewing genocide.
1.14.9.1.6.6.1. Pro: A declassified Department of State [telegram](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/rw041594.pdf) shows the US \(with SC veto power\) "opposed any effort at this time to preserve a UNAMIR presence in Rwanda". They instead supported a full withdrawal.
1.14.9.1.6.6.2. Pro: Once the genocide was underway, US officials [argued against a UN plan to protect surviving Rwandans, rescue others, and deliver assistance](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB53/rw051394.pdf).
1.14.9.1.7. Pro: The UN fails the Rohinga people in Myanmar.
1.14.9.1.7.1. Con: The UN has [reached a deal](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/31/asia/rohingya-resettlement-united-nations-intl/index.html) with Myanmar to work together to repatriate hundreds of thousands from refugee camps.
1.14.9.1.7.2. Con: The [UN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/16/asia/myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh-un-intl/index.html) and Bangladesh have both expressed concern for the Rohingya people's premature return, even with Myanmar's claim of repatriation of the first refugees.
1.14.9.1.7.3. Pro: -> See discussion #18355: The UN should send peacekeepers to protect the Rohingyas.
1.14.9.1.8. Con: A [World Bank study \(p19\)](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01241/WEB/IMAGES/PCP3779S.PDF&ved=2ahUKEwiBvpCXuMvcAhUTVsAKHa5LAyMQFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw1s0uSHJoJa7vgBUJ-bF89s) finds that UN intervention reduces the risk of peace failure by about 50%.
1.14.9.1.9. Con: UN peacekeeping forces have [drastically increased](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/02/un-peacekeeping-at-new-highs-after-post-cold-war-surge-and-decline/) in the last 1-2 decades, and are currently around 10 times higher than pre 1995 levels. Previous inabilities to prevent conflict may have been derived from this smaller peacekeeping force, and not a useful comparison to the UN's current ability.
1.14.9.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.2.
1.14.9.1.11. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.4.1.
1.14.9.1.12. Pro: When Cuban Ambassador Che Guevara [admitted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18RnJlDoxw) Cuba executed population because of ideological disagreement in an UN Assembly, no one there took any action against it.
1.14.9.1.12.1. Pro: Che Guevara was jailer and [executioner-in-chief of Castro's dictatorship](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/4077397/It-is-a-sad-reflection-of-our-time-that-Che-Guevara-is-seen-as-a-hero.html). As boss of the notorious La Cabaña prison in Havana, he supervised the detention, interrogation, summary trials and execution of hundreds of "class enemies".
1.14.9.1.12.1.1. Con: Whislt there is "[some verbal evidence](https://www.quora.com/What-evidence-is-there-that-Che-Guevara-personally-executed-innocent-people/answer/Cass-Dean)" that castro personally executed innocent people, Jon Lee Anderson did not find sufficent evidence to support it in his Biography.
1.14.9.1.12.2. Con: Che Guevara [spoke at the UN](https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1964/12/11.htm) against Colonialism, criticized the United Nations' inability to confront the "brutal policy of apartheid" in South Africa, and denounced the United States policy towards their black population.
1.14.9.1.13. Con: Since the UN exists there has been no war between major powers.
1.14.9.1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.
1.14.9.1.13.2. Con: [Proxy wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars#Cold_War_proxy_wars) should also count \(Vietnam, Korea, Syria, Cuba invasion\).
1.14.9.1.13.3. Con: There has been no war between major powers since WWII due to the horrifying death and destruction it brought. It has nothing to do with the UN.
1.14.9.1.13.4. Con: Major power wars have been avoided due to the threat of nuclear weapons.
1.14.9.1.13.4.1. Pro: The UN is [against](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/) nuclear weapons.
1.14.9.1.13.5. Con: There was a League of Nations in place before and there was a major power war.
1.14.9.1.13.5.1. Con: The League of Nations broke down at the onset of WW2 in the 1930's, as it couldn't deal with the rise of Germany or Italy.
1.14.9.1.13.5.2. Con: The previous league of nations did not include the majority of the world's countries, in fact, it only had a third of them.
1.14.9.1.14. Con: The number of deaths from war globally has [declined](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace) since the creation of the UN.
1.14.9.1.15. Pro: [In 1995](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/no-man-left-behind/articles/behind-the-battle-of-mogadishu/) the UN's mission to Somalia ended in failure, after thousands of Somali and US casualties. Somalia remains a severely impoverished and troubled country.
1.14.9.1.16. Pro: The UN has little power in changing the international governmental systems which result in power struggles between states, and it therefore has limited influence.
1.14.9.1.17. Pro: The UN has more [failures](http://www.idppcenter.com/UN_Peacekeeping_Failures.pdf) recorded than successes.
1.14.9.1.17.1. Pro: A [study \(pg5\)](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01241/WEB/IMAGES/PCP3779S.PDF) identifies 84 failures and 37 successes of peace, using a strict definition of peace which counts ongoing UN intervention as a failure to achieve peace yet.
1.14.10. Pro: The UN actively encourages diplomatic talks between countries instead of war.
1.15. Pro: The UN does humanitarian work in countries with conflicts or natural disasters.
