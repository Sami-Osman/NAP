Discussion Name: Should citizens be able to crowdsource laws?

1. Citizens should be able to crowdsource laws.
1.1. Pro: Crowdsourcing has the potential to improve law-making by utilizing collective potential that currently remains untapped.
1.1.1. Pro: Places with more data are better for making complex decisions, than places that have less access to data.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The "big data" revolutions are allowing us to figure a lot of things out.
1.1.2. Pro: Places with more perspectives are better for making complex decisions, than places that have fewer perspectives.
1.1.3. Pro: Things done online are more transparent than things done in the halls of congress, away from microphones and television screens, and transparency usually leads to quality.
1.1.4. Pro: Crowd Sourcing, collaboration, and debating laws online will allow everyone to participate in the same linked debate instead of having millions of separate debates scattered across every types of media in forums elected officials don't usually see.
1.1.5. Pro: Crowdsourcing allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the likely consequences a law will have.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Especially unintended consequences may be pointed out by the participants in a crowdsourcing effort since they bring many more perspectives to the table than is the case in ordinary law-making procedures.
1.2. Pro: Democracy selects for characteristics in decision makers that are not necessarily beneficial, for example the ability to agitate people. Crowdsourcing provides a mechanism that doesn't suffer from this flaw.
1.2.1. Pro: Elected officials must be highly motivated in order to run for office. Usually, people who are motivated politically are on a crusade to win for their side. This is not helpful for the collaboration and respect that is required in order to solve problems.
1.2.2. Pro: The election process selects for individuals that are highly motivated towards political parties. Political parties oversimplify the issues, demonize the other side, and use revenge for past wrongs and confirmation bias to construct echo chambers.
1.2.3. Pro: People having a [unnecessarily massive](https://www.quora.com/In-Australia-what-are-the-benefits-of-being-a-politician) monetary incentive to become a politician, which could attract selfish people rather than those who inn it for the country.
1.3. Con: Citizens lack the knowledge and skills to draft good laws.
1.3.1. Con: No crowdsourced effort uses a simple majority of "citizens" to resolve conflict, and so the characteristics of the average citizen has nothing to do with the likely success or failure of a crowdsourced effort.
1.3.2. Pro: The Dunning Kruger effect says that not only do citizens lack the knowledge and skill, but they don't even know that they lack those thing. Lack of experience in crafting laws gives them a false confidence to move forward on ill conceived laws.
1.3.2.1. Con: The effect does not mention citizens it applies to all people including politicians.
1.3.3. Con: This could significantly enhance the civics education of the national population.
1.3.3.1. Pro: It would force the state to assure the good education of its populace, since its stability would depend on the civic intelligence of its people.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Popular well funded crowdsourcing projects \(like a government-funded crowd-sourced legal analysis debate and editing forum would be\) don't require the average education of participants to be high in order to promote intelligent results.
1.3.3.2. Con: Such a new system would not necessarily affect education levels, nor would it provide an incentive to teach civics to a larger portion of the population than is already the case.
1.3.4. Pro: Ordinary citizens lack the legal knowledge necessary for formulating laws.
1.3.4.1. Con: The citizens debating laws would most likely include lawyers who would be able to overcome this hurdle.
1.3.4.2. Con: The success of crowd-sourced efforts is determined by the knowledge and skills of highest ranked editor and the most active users, and not the average contributor or citizen. Additionally the conflict resolution techniques, appeals processes, and moderator selection and removal processes are more important than the knowledge and skill of the average users.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Crowd sourced efforts assign menial tasks to low skilled or uneducated users.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: The average knowledge and skill of of the average Wikipedia users, does not hamper the quality of Wikipedia.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: The average knowledge and skill of of the average Linux users, does not hamper the quality of Linux.
1.3.4.3. Con: Citizens with legal knowledge are most likely to be most convincing why their particular take is correct.
1.3.4.4. Con: This can be of advantage: if citizens write laws, this ensures that laws are understandable for the majority of them.
1.3.4.5. Con: For the purpose of crafting the precise language of a proposal, legal experts could take over after the foundations of a legal proposal have been agreed on.
1.3.4.6. Pro: Especially where not only national law has to be taken into consideration, but also the restrictions imposed by international law and supranational regulations \(e.g. by the European Union\), the legal proposals of citizens are likely to clash with what is actually possible.
1.3.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.5. Con: Knowledgable citizens do not have more rights than less knowledgeable ones.
1.3.5.1. Con: This is not a question of who has more "rights" than others. No one is proposing giving "knowledgeable citizens" more rights than those with less knowledge. This is a question of competence. At present, most political systems allow for the political representation of all through their elected officials, who significantly more competent and capable than their constituents. Giving direct control over policy to the ignorant would be a disaster for all.
1.3.6. Pro: Citizens lack information on many of the subject matters that are relevant to policy-making.
1.3.6.1. Con: The total amount of knowledge and expertise on political matters outside of parliament and government is larger than that inside, simply due to the number of people on the outside versus the inside.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Their are [1,338,678](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer_population_15_higher_than_10_years_ago_new_aba_data_shows) active lawyers in the USA not to mention all the retired lawyers, students studying laws, and people with particular interest and expertise in specific laws. Big data, algorithms, and information technology are making each lawyer, paralegal, and legal assistants more powerful.
1.3.6.2. Con: There is little reason to assume that politicians' opinions are necessarily more informed than those of average voters.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: As of last year, [a third](https://thinkprogress.org/most-americans-disagree-with-their-congressional-representative-on-climate-change-95dc0eee7b8f#.ghff9qph6) of the members of the US congress were denying the man-made nature of climate change, against the overwhelming scientific evidence.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: A reason for many US politicians' denial of man-made climate change is very [effective lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial#Lobbying) and not the general lack information and knowledge.
1.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: Parts of the Republican Party regard the protection of fossil energy as an [ideological goal](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/why-republicans-still-reject-the-science-of-global-warming-w448023). Therefore, they reject the scientific evidence of man-made global warming.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: Politicians have access to research and information services that ordinary citizens do not have.
1.3.6.2.2.1. Con: The knowledge and skill of the "average voter" is meaningless to this debate, because it is a different population of people that will be active participants in a legal analysis and debate crowd-sourcing effort.
1.3.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: "Frequent contributors to a legal analysis forum" would be more knowledgeable in law, especially in particular laws of interest, than "the average voter".
1.3.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: How a forum chooses high ranking editors will determine it's success more than the knowledge and skill of it's "average participant" or the "average" voter.
1.3.6.2.2.1.3. Pro: “Quantity has a quality all its own.” When you have millions of people debating the pros, cons, costs, benefits, and risks of each law, their average knowledge means nothing when compared the work produced by very small groups to the work produced by very large groups, that can give each participant something useful to do, the way modern crowd-sourced efforts do.
1.3.6.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.
1.3.6.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: There are 14,600 active and working economist in the united states.
1.3.6.2.2.1.4. Pro: How a forum chooses it's moderators and high ranked users, resolves conflict \(votes\), and rewards and punishes users determine it's success more than the knowledge and skill level of it's average users.
1.3.6.2.2.2. Con: The notion that representatives have a significant knowledge gap over the general populace is certainly true for a large majority of the functions of government. However, decisions that could be brought to referendums are the most important issues, ones which we should expect people to know and be informed about.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: Having regular referendums, or at least the knowledge that they might occur, encourages people to be informed on major issues, as they might have to weigh in on them.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Considering that major referendums are relatively rare and unpredictable, it's doubtful that the possibility of a referendum will be sufficient to encourage voters to be informed about a particular topic.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if they are relatively rare, they tend to be scheduled well in advance giving lots of time for citizens to become informed on the required issues.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Although announced [on time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016), large parts of the [British public](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) were not well prepared for the "Brexit" referendum and had a misguided perception of the EU, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted to leave.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2. Con: If referendums become a routine occurrence, their special status will diminish and many citizens will stop preparing for them.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Frequent referendums lead to voter fatigue and make elections seem less important, thereby [harming voter turnout.](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=RESConf2016&paper_id=1009)
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Although Switzerland holds [more referendums](http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2014-09-18/6-things-you-need-to-know-about-referendums/1369335) than any other country, its voter turnout in elections \(at around 50% or less\) is among the lowest in the OECD and has been low for decades \([OECD, p. 97](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/8111041ec029.pdf?expires=1486943091&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=705611406CD6C9EC244F6B9C3BE4B9BB)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Researchers have established a persistently negative correlation between referendums and the participation in elections for the case of Switzerland \([Freitag/ Stadelmann-Steffen, p. 479](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026137941000048X)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Voter fatigue and the perception that individual elections do not matter have been proposed as the link between the high number of referendums and the low voter turnout in Switzerland \([Blais, p. 526](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12116/abstract); [Franklin, p. 98](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=plYRx0sFT-cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Voter+Turnout+and+the+Dynamics+of+Electoral+Competition+in+established+Democracies+Since+1945&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Voter%20Turnout%20and%20the%20Dynamics%20of%20Electoral%20Competition%20in%20established%20Democracies%20Since%201945&f=false)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3. Con: The low voter turnout in Switzerland has not only been linked to issues relating to the country's frequent referendums, but also the "extraordinary complexity of the political system" \([Blais, p. 526](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12116/abstract)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4. Con: A country having a low turnout for elections need not necessarily be a bad thing in the context of a country like Switzerland where voters will maintain the power to influence policy precisely because there are so many referendums.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The number of referendums in European countries has been [steeply rising](https://uweserdult.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/national-level-referendum-frequencies-worldwide-by-continent-with-switzerland-singled-out-1792-2010/) during the past decades. At the same time, voter turnout has seen a steady decline \([IDEA, p. 26](http://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world_0.pdf)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The [median turnout](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21699146-direct-democracy-spreading-across-europe-not-always-good-thing-referendumania) for nationwide referendums in Europe has fallen from 71% in the early 1990s to 41% in the past years.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: This is correlated heavily with the increasing number of referendums. Arguably, then, this simply reflects the fact that once you have more referendums, the marginal referendums are less important and therefore draw lower turnout, meaning that median turnout is lower. So even though median turnout has fallen, turnout could still be high for major referendums, eg [Brexit](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Additionally, public opposition to referendums could simply be opposition to these marginal extra referendums, rather than to the concept in general.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: The existence of a correlation between the two does not prove any causation. The decline in voter participation has been linked to many other potential factors, among them the rise of [negative campaigning](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x/full).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: While the negative correlation between the number of referendums and voter turnout in elections does not point to a causation, it nevertheless shows that there is no reason to assume that referendums encourage voting in elections.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.3. Con: The effect of voter fatigue can be diminished by holding referendums on the same day as elections, thereby ensuring that people who turn up primarily to vote in referendums will probably also end up voting in elections.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: In the United States, research suggests that state-level [ballot initiatives](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_initiative) attached to Presidential and Midterm elections increased voter turnout \([Tolbert/Smith, p. 283](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X04271904)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2. Con: The combination of election and referendum has a higher risk that [protest votes](http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/579640459) against a government have a spillover effect on the referendum, and as a consequence distort the referendum's outcome.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.3. Con: In many countries this would significantly decrease the number of opportunities to hold referendums. In Germany, for example, national elections take place only every four years.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: To mitigate that, Germany could arrange to have decisions worthy of a referendum be held midway between national elections. That way, elections would be infrequent enough to avoid fatigue, but more frequent than four years.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.4. Con: Holding election and referendum campaigns at the same time will result in citizens being less informed about each vote individually as news coverage will be split between the two campaigns.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2. Pro: In addition to becoming informed, referendums also give citizens an incentive to care because they feel that they have a direct say on the outcome.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.2.1.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: When citizens care, they are more likely to criticise their elected representatives when they make poor decisions.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.2.1.1.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5. Con: Referendums provide space for people already interested in politics to become active but do not engage with voters who have little interest in the first place \([Donovan/Karp, p. 684](http://www.jkarp.com/pdf/pp_2006.pdf)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1. Pro: The patterns of those who vote in referendums and those who don't are identical to those seen in general elections.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Older people are generally [more interested](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/political-interest-and-awareness-lower-among-millennials/) in politics and more likely to vote, be it in referendums or elections.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Youth turnout in the Brexit referendum was [higher](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/09/young-people-referendum-turnout-brexit-twice-as-high) [than](http://www.if.org.uk/archives/6576/how-high-was-youth-turnout-at-the-2015-general-election) it was in recent national elections.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.1.2. Con: Surveys [show](http://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-8-voters/did-the-eu-referendum-boost-youth-engagement-with-politics/) that the Brexit referendum of 2016 "stimulated the political interest of Britain’s young people to an extent not seen for some years".
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.1.3. Con: In the case of the Scottish referendum on independence in 2014, [surveys](http://www.democraticauditscotland.com/the-independence-referendum-shows-that-young-people-can-be-mobilized-politically-given-the-right-circumstances/) indicate that it sparked a rise in young peoples' political interest, engagement and activism.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.1.4. Pro: In American elections during the past decades, voter turnout has [reliably correlated](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics) with age \(the older, the more likely to vote\), education \(the more formal education, the more likely to vote\) and race \(Hispanics are less likely to vote\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.1.5. Pro: In the UK's 2015 general election, older people were [much more likely](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx) to vote than younger people and voters of a high social class were much more likely to turn out than voters of a low social class.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2. Con: Referendums tend to mobilize voters who usually do not participate in ordinary elections.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.1. Con: In Switzerland, the difference between voter turnout for referendums and elections is marginal. For example, average turnout for national elections is [48.5%](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik.html), while turnout for national referendums is usually [around 45%](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_eidgen%C3%B6ssischen_Volksabstimmungen).
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Switzerland is a special case: the country has [more than a dozen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_referendums,_2016) referendums in many years, hence not all of them can be expected to be so relevant to large parts of the population that they elicit high turnout.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.2. Con: A direct comparison between the turnout for, or interest in, referendums and elections is not valid. Whereas most elections have no consequences of obvious and immediate impact, referendums usually concern policies of self-evident, high and long-term relevance.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: Additionally, even if the turnout for referendums is higher, that is likely to decrease if more referendums are used.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.2.1.2.1.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.2.2. Con: Even if it is just because the referendum issues are of high and obvious relevance, the very fact that voters now get a say in those issues increases engagement far more than if a non-responsive government were making decisions about them.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.3. Pro: Voter turnout in the Scottish referendum on its membership in the UK was about [70% higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) than in [parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland#Scottish_Parliament) during the past 15 years.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: Furthermore, [the Scottish Independence Referendum](http://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-8-voters/did-the-eu-referendum-boost-youth-engagement-with-politics/) boosted, at least temporarily, the political engagement of the politically apathetic youth \(18-24 years olds\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.4. Con: The rates of voter turnout in the UK's [Brexit referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016) and its [parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_general_elections) of the past decades were not markedly different.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.5. Pro: Research conducted in Switzerland indicates that referendums contribute to a political culture in which young people feel confident to vote, and in which young people therefore participate to a higher degree in politics \([Kunz et al, p. 12](http://www.nccr-democracy.uzh.ch/publications/workingpaper/pdf/wp_56.pdf)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.2. Con: Though this is true of many referendums, campaigns for referendums on particularly emotive issues, [such as Ireland's vote on equal marriage](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/why-young-voters-mobilised-for-same-sex-marriage-1.2223723), can often be extremely successful in engaging with new voters, especially young ones.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: This was also the case for the Brexit vote which had an above average turn [out of the electorate](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/high-turnout-for-eu-referendum-vote-could-break-uk-records/).
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.1.2.4.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2.5.3. Con: This is a feature, not a bug. Those who wish to make their voice heard are amplified by it, and those content to allow themselves to be silenced are provided less of an excuse to be dissatisfied with the result.
1.3.6.2.2.2.3. Con: These important issues are oftentimes of a scope that makes informing oneself and considering the potential consequences next to impossible.
1.3.6.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: At the time of the British decision to leave the European Union in 2016, neither the political details of the Brexit nor its impact on issues like trade, migration and national security were foreseeable for anyone.
1.3.6.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: Italy's constitutional referendum in 2016 had unclear implications and has received [various interpretations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/30/italy-referendum-all-you-need-to-know-about-renzis-crunch-vote) as merely a package of legal revisions, as a plebiscite on the prime minister's future, and by some even as a step towards an Italian exit out of the European Union.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4. Pro: Sometimes, the only information needed by voters is their personal view on the issue and how it affects them directly.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1. Pro: In many cases, there is no obvious right or wrong in political decision making.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: Many decisions are based on values - where politicians are unlikely to have an advantage over the average citizen. Conservatives and liberals put different emphasis on particular moral considerations in their world views \([Graham et al., p. 1029](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GrahamHaidtNosek.2009.Moral%20foundations%20of%20liberals%20and%20conservatives.JPSP.pdf)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: It has been argued that everyone cares about equality as a value, yet it has different meanings to different people.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Amartya Sen [argues](http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Sen-1979_Equality-of-What.pdf) that liberals interpret equality in terms of equality of well-being, resources, or capability, whilst conservatives interpret it in terms of equality of liberty.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Left-leaning voters tend to understand fairness in terms of equality; right-leaning voters in terms of proportionality \([Haidt, p. 138](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ItuzJhbcpMIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Righteous+Mind:+Why+Good+People+Are+Divided+by+Politics+and+Religion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidu7meu47SAhVFi7wKHQ1rAkIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: The consequences of many decisions are next to impossible to predict. The outcome of a Brexit, for example, is dependent on countless decisions inside and outside the UK that could not be known prior to the referendum.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Even if certain outcomes of a choice are unpredictable, it is still possible to make a prediction about whether the consequences of that decision are on aggregate more likely to be good than bad.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.3. Con: The question is not whether the citizens are making the 'right' decision, as there would be no referendum if one choice was obviously correct. Instead, the concern is that citizens vote without understanding the outcome of their choices.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.3.1. Con: Referendums frequently occur over policies that are either deeply flawed, questionably constitutional or obviously beneficial. There is no functional barrier to this in most countries, and so no reason to believe that this would change.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.4. Pro: Many referendums are on fundamental issues such as secession or [peace and justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_peace_agreement_referendum,_2016), which turn more on moral judgements than practical ones. In these cases, the moral priorities of voters principally ought to be what guides political decision-making.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.5. Con: Decisions based on values that are society-oriented with the greater good in mind are better for society than decisions based on individual interests.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.5.1. Con: Democracy requires voters to decide according to their interest. If they value their personal interest over the societal interest, there is nothing wrong with that.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.1.5.2. Con: Society's interests are just the sum of individual interests. What determines the greater good is itself determined by the collection of individual's values.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.2. Con: In many cases, even calculating the impact on oneself is difficult - for example, with the Brexit referendum, a huge number of possibilities would have to be computed and evaluated.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.2.3.1.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.3. Con: People's personal views on other decisions \(like same-sex marriage or abortion\) may be ill-informed or poorly thought out, and politicians may have an advantage in this area as well.
1.3.6.2.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: For example, voters may be more susceptible to [false stories](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/09/carly_fiorina_lied_about_planned_parenthood_video_gop_debate_fact_checking.html) on abortion-related topics.
1.3.6.2.2.3. Pro: The US Congressional Research Service responds to tens of thousands of emails and calls every year and publishes more than a thousand issue-specific reports, many of which aren't publicly accessible \([CRS, p. 2](https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/crs15_annrpt.pdf)\).
1.3.6.2.2.4. Con: In many countries, the analyses and reports by parliamentary research services are mostly available to the public and for free, for example in [Canada](http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/About/Library/VirtualLibrary/ResearchPublications-e.asp), [Germany](https://www.bundestag.de/analysen), [Australia](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs),the [UK](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/) and in the case of the [European Parliament](https://epthinktank.eu/topical-digests/).
1.3.6.2.2.4.1. Con: Due to time constraints or lack of interest, it is unlikely that a substantial percentage of registered voters actually access this information.
1.3.6.2.2.5. Pro: In most countries, the access to classified information [is restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information) by law or regulation. Information classified ‘For Official Use Only’ is not accessible by the wider public.
1.3.6.2.2.6. Con: This is why direct democratic tools are important so that knowledge that is important for the future of a society is not hidden away. In Switzerland where public votes and referendums are common, the authorities are required to create a [Abstimmungsbüchlein](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstimmungsb%C3%BCchlein) \(voter information booklet\) as part of the voting documents to list pros and cons of the coming vote. In addition to this, there is the "Arena" on TV where the political parties discuss the coming vote.
1.3.6.2.3. Pro: Politicians neither pass a special education nor is there a minimal education requirement e.g. in the [USA](http://goingpolitical.com/qualifications-to-be-a-politician/).
1.3.6.2.3.1. Pro: In [New Hampshire](http://www.straighterline.com/blog/should-there-be-a-minimum-education-level-for-politicians/) only 53% of the state legislators have a college-degree.
1.3.6.2.3.1.1. Con: A college degree says little about the competence of a politician, especially if this degree was earned in a field unrelated to political day-to-day activity.
1.3.6.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Various former and current heads of state have degrees that are probably of little use for their work, for example Angela Merkel's [doctorate in physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel#Early_life).
1.3.6.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Irrespective of the field of study, college students learn to deal intensely with complex subject matters and develop a structured working method. This skill set is important for politicians.
1.3.6.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: These skills can also be obtained in many fields of employment; a college education is not necessarily vital.
1.3.6.2.3.1.1.2.2. Con: It is unclear whether these sorts of abstract skillsets are actually substantially beneficial in terms of making judgement about concrete economic and social questions.
1.3.6.2.3.2. Pro: Politicians are mostly elected based on ideological and emotional appeal, not on actual competence. An assessment of their competence only becomes possible once they are in their elected role.
1.3.6.2.3.2.1. Con: A large portion of this competence assessment happens prior to election day. In order to appear on the ballot, they generally need to get the support of a party machine and subsequently win preselection.
1.3.6.2.3.3. Con: A low level of formal education does not preclude politicians from being well-informed about political issues.
1.3.6.2.4. Con: Between job, family life and other concerns, many voters do not have time to read about political events in detail. For politicians, rather than being an added burden, informing themselves is part of the job they do during normal working hours.
1.3.6.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.1.
1.3.6.2.4.2. Con: Members of the American Congress usually spend [their full work day](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/14/the-most-depressing-graphic-for-members-of-congress/?utm_term=.57776cc35f75) on calling donors, meeting constituents, work in committees and on the floor, and strategic outreach. This leaves little time for them to inform themselves.
1.3.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: Candidates who spend more time campaigning or making connections and less time gathering information are more likely to be reelected, so there is a clear incentive for them to do so.
1.3.6.2.4.3. Pro: Studies estimate that citizens spend [only about 15 minutes](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/01/global-newspaper-readership-zenithoptimedia-media-consumption) a day on reading newspapers.
1.3.6.2.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.1.
1.3.6.2.5. Con: Politicians are generally required to adhere to the policy position of their party. Their personal opinions, however well-informed, are more often than not irrelevant.
1.3.6.2.6. Con: It is their job to be better informed than the average.
1.3.6.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.1.
1.3.6.2.6.2. Con: Since there isn't any method to find out, whether someone is well-informed or not, a politician is not motivated to be well-informed, since people can't find out if they aren't.
1.3.6.2.7. Con: Unlike ordinary citizens, politicians have an incentive to educate themselves about policy and politics. If they do not do so, they may lose their election.
1.3.6.3. Pro: The reason we have elected officials in the first place is so that the vast majority of people do not have to spend time becoming experts on every issue of political import.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Citizens in many democracies are largely uninformed about basic matters that concern politics.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.2.1.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: Citizens routinely [over-estimate](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3587/Hearts-and-Minds-misperceptions-and-the-military.aspx) the share of their country's GDP spent on the military, for example in France by a factor of six and in the UK by a factor of two.
1.3.6.4.2.1. Con: One's ability to correctly estimate your countries' military expenditure as a share of GDP is not related to the parent claim that citizens lack the legal knowledge to write good laws.
1.3.6.4.3. Pro: Citizens of Western countries routinely [over-estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2016/dec/13/europeans-massively-overestimate-muslim-population-poll-shows) the share of Muslims among the population, for example by a factor of 17 in the US and a factor of three in the UK.
1.3.6.4.4. Pro: Citizens of many countries over-estimate the share of GDP spent on health services by a factor of two to five \([Ipsos MORI, s. 20](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.3.6.5. Pro: It is only rational for voters to remain ignorant and uninformed; this is not the result of stupidity. As individual votes have no chance of swaying decisions and as the costs of becoming informed can be enormous, there is little incentive to do so \([Rauch/Wittes, p. 5](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf)\).
1.3.7. Pro: Citizens, unlike politicians, would lack the capacity to make deals and compromise with opponents.
1.3.8. Con: Any democracy aims to represent the will of the citizens and, by extension, create laws. If they are fit to be represented by politicians then they are also fit to express their will directly.
1.3.8.1. Con: This does not follow logically. To be empowered to vote for a representative does not imply that one is magically granted legal and technical knowledge in writing laws, nor in interpreting them.
1.3.9. Pro: There are things, such as science, which aren't democratic by their own nature, but have to be accounted during the lawmaking process by experts.
1.3.9.1. Con: We can structure our online forums in ways that: "debates the language of the law", promotes scientific thinking, attempts to remove bias, and dissects each question into it sub-arguments.
1.3.9.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.10. Con: Citizen forums could be given access to aides and law clerks who could help them fashion their preferred laws.
1.3.11. Con: Naturally, the well-written laws tend to gather substantially more attention than propositions authored by unskilled citizens.
1.3.11.1. Con: Text that is written by "good marketers" gathers more attention than well-written, accurate, or helpful text.
1.3.12. Con: While individuals usually lack the knowledge to draft a complete law by themselves, many people have relevant experience and knowledge that contributes helpfully to a crowdsourced law.
1.3.13. Con: The success of modern crowd-sourced efforts is not dependent on the knowledge and skill of the average participant or average citizen.
1.3.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.1.
1.3.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.13.3. Pro: The fact that quality is easier to recognize than construct allows highly skilled people in groups of different skill levels to produce quality work that is acceptable to the group. Modern crowd-sourced forum allow high skilled and knowledgeably users to explain why their work is of a high quality.
1.3.14. Con: Where all citizens are involved in the crafting of laws, this includes experts who bring the necessary knowledge and skills to the table.
1.3.15. Con: The deficiencies of the average citizen could be compensated for by skilled and experienced moderators who guide the crowdsourcing process.
1.3.15.1. Pro: Crowdsourcing efforts are set up in such a way that people won't want to correct the existing product unless it is low quality \(inaccurate, incomplete, illogical, or based on conclusions are unsupported\). People are used to correcting typos or mistakes crowdsourcing culture doesn't like people who make edits that don't improve the overall quality.
1.3.15.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.3.
1.3.15.2. Pro: Crowdsourcing is able to work, even with low skilled participants, because quality is easier to recognize than produce.
1.3.15.3. Pro: Crowdsourcing efforts are able to compete with professional ones, that may work more efficiently, because crowdsourced efforts are able to leverage many more man-hours.
1.4. Con: Participation is inherently and unfairly biased towards those with free time and easy internet access.
1.4.1. Con: An effective design of the crowd-sourcing platform could minimize the effort it takes for an individual citizen to participate.
1.4.2. Con: Getting on the internet at your own time is more accessible to the world's poor than having to run for office and get elected in order to vote yes or no on matters of public policy.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Getting on the internet to edit text directly, or participate in a debate, is much more easy than the things a person must do today in order to participate in public policy decisions that have any impact on society.
1.4.3. Con: This would significantly enhance the push for broader internet access as it would be seen as a necessary tool for political participation.
1.4.3.1. Con: Internet is usually available in most areas. What is under-developed is the access to fast internet. A crowdsourcing platform would hardly promote this as it would most likely not rely on fast connections.
1.4.3.2. Con: Getting internet access to remote areas can be prohibitively expensive and this would not be sufficient to overcome the simple budget needs to fund an extensive rollout.
1.4.3.3. Pro: At least wealthier nations with largely state-funded infrastructure \(e.g. Germany\) would be forced to invest more heavily and efficiently in improving that infrastructure.
1.4.3.4. Con: The federal government is ill-equipped to develop internet access in underserved areas, which are limited by states and municipalities.
1.4.4. Con: Participation is already biased towards organized interests with money and resources. With broader participatory options the concerns of people could be directly represented instead of through parties and politicans that more and more people in western countries have less and less trust in.
1.4.5. Con: "Free time" is relative. It is hard to determine whether someone genuinely has little free time or simply no desire to put in the effort in order to participate in the political process.
1.4.6. Con: Not everyone has to participate. You only participate if you want to suggest something.
1.4.7. Pro: A crowdsourcing system may be difficult to utilize for those who are handicapped.
1.4.7.1. Con: It is easier for people with disabilities to get on the internet than it is for them to drive across town \(or the country\) in order to participate in a live debate.
1.4.7.2. Pro: People with with sight impairments wouldn't be able to participate online.
1.4.7.3. Con: People with disabilities do not participate now.
1.4.8. Con: As long as there is no relative bias between supporters and detractors of any particular law, the total bias in the system will not be manifest in the laws that are created
1.4.9. Con: Almost everyone has internet access through a personal computer, personal phone, or public library.
1.4.9.1. Con: Access is not the definitive issue with this point. Time, which is a key ingredient in forming reasonable opinions, on the scale that would be required is simply not available to your average voter.
1.4.9.1.1. Con: We aren't comparing time available to the average voter, we are comparing time available to the average legal analysis and debate forum participant. Natural logic indicates that a forum participant has the free time, by definition, to participate.
1.4.9.1.1.1. Pro: Our current places of law debate such as Parliament or House of Representatives are limited by the attention spans of the people gathered in the room. However crowd sourced forums are able to bring many more people who have more spare time then elected officials and they are able to go into more depth then elected officials.
1.4.9.1.1.2. Pro: Simple math shows that much larger groups will result in more total analysis of an issue. More total participants equal more total hours & level of analysis. The question remains if the forum design allows for the quantity of analysis to overcome any assumed lack of quality in each individual participant. However, it hasn't been shown that elected officials are "better", on average, than the average online law analysis forum users.
1.4.9.1.2. Con: The time available per "average" user isn't the only consideration. The total amount of analysis and debate is also a consideration. A group of thousands or millions of people is going to do more total analyse, debate, and investigation than a group with dozens of participants.
1.4.9.1.3. Con: It has not been shown that our elected officials, who must continually raise money for re-election and have limited time to devote to each issue, have more "spare" time to devote to honest debate and analysis of each issue than online law analysis forum users.
1.4.9.1.4. Con: Different Goals: Analysis vs Choosing Sides: "Forming opinions" and yes/not votes are not the goal and result of legal analysis and debate forums. A complete analysis, debate, and investigation of the feasibility of different options is the goal and end result of these forums, and action doesn't even have to be implied unless an overwhelming consensus is achieved.Online legal forums would stay in "analysis mode" and continually update and refine the pro/con evidence until a consensus is made.
1.4.9.1.4.1. Pro: Online legal debate and analysis forums can link decisions to the level of supporting evidence in a way that is impossible in our current system with elected officials. Elected officials can debate, but they don't currently have to show their math for their decisions, in ways that are possible with online forums. They listen to debate, and discount and trust different arguments in ways that are not transparent to the public, in the way online decisions would be.
1.4.9.1.5. Con: Crowd sourced forums overcome time commitment problems of individual users by letting them participate on their own time and in their own space. This feature of online collaboration make it so individual participants don't have to carry as much weight, or spend as much time, individually.
1.4.9.1.6. Con: Crowd sourced forums overcome time commitment problems of individual users by breaking the problem into many small parts. This feature of online collaboration make it so individual participants don't have to carry as much weight, or spend as much time, individually.
1.4.10. Con: Those who really care about their country will make the sacrifice of their time to contribute to the legal system.
1.4.11. Pro: Participation would require a level of literacy, both general and technological, that would create an inherent bias against certain demographics such as the elderly or those in low socioeconomic categories.
1.4.11.1. Con: The literacy with these technologies and platforms could be ensured through comprehensive and lifelong education measures that bring all citizens up-to-date.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: The data on functional illiteracy tell us that we do not yet know how to solve the problem of lifelong learning.
1.4.11.2. Con: It might create a negative bias against those who are illiterate.
1.4.11.3. Con: Even the very poor these days have mobile phones and quite a basic phone can be used to engage in online discussion.
1.4.11.4. Con: Crowsourcing is only one option among many in which people should be able to participate. The option of crowdsourcing might have a bias against for example the elderly but their interests can still be represented in other ways.
1.4.11.5. Con: Currently the elderly dominate voting and are a deciding factor in electoral results. This leads to stagnation of government and policy. People who are out of touch with today's technology and progress should not get to decide my future.
1.4.11.6. Con: The argument has not yet been made that participation would require a level of literacy beyond what is expected of citizens now. Crowd sourcing could be done in a way that requires less literacy than our current system.
1.4.11.7. Con: The share of citizens that did not grow up in a digital world and is familiar with the use of computers is steadily shrinking.
1.4.11.7.1. Con: The share of people who came of age before the most recent technologies were introduced is actually growing. In most rich countries, the share of the population aged over 65 is forecast to [increase rapidly by 2050](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/30/chapter-2-aging-in-the-u-s-and-other-countries-2010-to-2050/), oftentimes by more than 10%.
1.4.11.7.1.1. Con: Those who are 65 or older in 2050 came of age in the early 2000s and are supposedly familiar with computers.
1.5. Con: Online systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks.
1.5.1. Con: There are a plethora of online discussion forums that have not experienced cyber attacks. Thus, this vulnerability does not amount to actual infiltration.
1.5.1.1. Con: Most online forums are hardly of interest for anyone who could attack them. A crowdsourcing platform, on the other hand, would be an attractive target since manipulation has the potential to affect government policies.
1.5.2. Con: A breach to a high-security platform would be cause to halt activity but a breach to a crowdsourcing platform is not a threat to national security and thus less likely to cause much interruption.
1.5.3. Con: Just because a risk exists doesn't mean that it is significant.
1.5.4. Pro: Any system based on the internet would be vulnerable to hackers changing language or permissions of draft laws.
1.5.5. Con: The system could easily be limited so that the actual codification of any law would still require offline process \(a confirmation vote in the national legislature for example\).
1.5.5.1. Con: Nevertheless, if the process that leads up to this final decision is vulnerable to illegitimate influences, this can easily sway the outcome, e.g. by determining the language of a proposal that parliament then votes on.
1.5.6. Pro: The system could be taken offline for an extended period of time through something like a DDoS attack.
1.5.7. Con: Any such system could be open source and decentralised so that weak points, deliberate or otherwise, can be scrutinised and fixed.
1.5.8. Pro: A developing nation with fewer capabilities to secure its online voting system may be vulnerable to meddling from more advanced nations.
1.5.8.1. Con: The suggestion that on-line systems are more likely to be meddled with than off-line system is contestable. All systems of governance need checks and balances. This isn't a criticism of social media but of badly run governance.
1.5.9. Con: Modern technologies can ensure the safety of the online systems involved.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Block chain technology can ensure that no one meddles with draft laws, user accounts and other elements.
1.5.9.1.1. Pro: Blockchain technology is based on a powerful system that has been proven [almost impossible hack.](https://www.bitcoinofamerica.org/blog/blockchain-cannot-be-hacked/)
1.5.10. Con: No system is flawless. Any method of government is subject to unwanted interference. For example, offline systems are comparably vulnerable to corruption and cronyism, to the same effect.
1.5.10.1. Pro: Online debate, even if it is hacked, allows more people to participate than only letting elected officials who are in the same room, participate in the discussion.
1.5.10.2. Pro: Text based websites are easy to backup in multiple locations preventing hackers from permanently taking a site down.
1.5.10.3. Pro: Online debate forums do not require sensitive user information that could be lost in a hack.
1.5.11. Pro: The systems one would expect to be the best-protected aren't safe from cyber attacks, as even the NSA's securities [have been breached](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html?_r=0) in the past and some of the agency's cyber weapons have been leaked.
1.5.11.1. Con: The NSA's breach illustrates that cyber-attacks, even where they succeed, don't necessarily lead to lasting damage.
1.5.11.2. Con: It is wrong to compare stealing arguments to stealing cyber weapons.
1.6. Pro: In a democracy, all citizens by definition have a right to participate in their government.
1.6.1. Con: Democracy as a concept does not necessarily imply direct influence on the legislature process.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In a representative democracy participation means as well to elect the representatives as to run for an office and so be elected as representative.
1.6.2. Pro: Anything that extends the reach of democratic discussion is good.
1.6.3. Con: There are plenty of alternatives to allow citizens to participate in their government.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Even if direct participation in governance is sought, this can be achieved through referendums.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Citizens already vote for who they want in their respective government offices.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: Referendums and petitions would be much easier to hold if citizens were able to crowdsource laws, with much more visibility.
1.7. Con: It would be difficult to limit the participation to citizens of the country.
1.7.1. Con: As laws would merely be proposed and debated, not decided upon, the participation of non-citizens would not present a problem and could provide useful inputs.
1.7.1.1. Con: At the same time, foreign influences can be of a malicious nature and aim to sway debates and shape legislative agendas in ways that serve foreign interests.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: If a nation is so easily swayed by bad arguments then it will get the laws that it deserves.
1.7.2. Con: Discussion of these laws would not necessarily need to be limited to citizens so long as part of the process took place in the existing political structure \(a referendum election or review by the existing national legislature\).
1.7.3. Pro: Anyone with internet access could probably fake the documentation needed to create an account and participate in the online-lawmaking process, regardless of actual nationality
1.7.3.1. Con: This could be prevented by using national identification \(passport number, drivers license, voter registration\) as part of the account creation process.
1.7.4. Pro: People could use VPNs to make it seem as though they are located in the country in question.
1.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.
1.7.5. Pro: The system is vulnerable to troll campaigns from hostile nations, which could sway public opinion on key issues.
1.7.6. Pro: Dual citizenship and overseas holidays would mean IP blocking would be impossible.
1.7.7. Con: Participation could require an ID issued by the country. Infrastructures like that are already available in some countries, showing that it is a viable option.
1.7.8. Con: IP address ranges are assigned based on country. A collaborative website could use IP addresses to limit participation to people located within country. Given, this doesn't solve for the foreign visitors or illegal residents.
1.7.8.1. Con: It is relatively easy and cheap to modify one's IP address and the country it is associated with, for example by using a VPN service.
1.8. Con: Online political discussion tends to be toxic, and the quality of online discussion on law-making platforms would be so bad as to be unusable.
1.8.1. Con: There are example for similar systems that work well. The US has a [public comment period](https://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/USA-Public-Notice-and-Comment.pdf) for proposed regulations that has been proven very effective.
1.8.2. Con: Just because discussions tend to turn sour we cannot just reject one communication channel after the other.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Discussions turn sour because discussions tend to focus on back and forth chronological formats that tend to wander off into infinite paths, that never lead to anything. We can have pro/con discussions that are much more effective.With pro/con discussions the topic isn't continually changing in chaotic ways.
1.8.3. Pro: Online discussion combines the worst elements of debate - a lack of context allowing readers to assume the worst interpretation of any statement, along with the ability to react immediately when emotions are highest and points least well thought out.
1.8.3.1. Con: Properly structured, the web applications used to make these platforms could be designed with civil, structured debate online. Kialo is an example.
1.8.4. Con: From Wikipedia to Kialo and Github, there are numerous examples of online communities that manage to get people to work together in a non-toxic way and with great outcomes.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Wikipedia is more functional and less toxic than the places of debate currently used to make laws \(Congress, parliament, etc.\) and covers just as controversial of topics.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution) manages to maintain a constructive discussion climate through mechanism such as those for dispute resolution.
1.8.5. Con: Past experiments of this kind have had a remarkably [more polite and sophisticated](https://youtu.be/7jKIfoa-BvE?t=6m57s) level of discussion than usually found in comment sections and social media.
1.8.6. Con: The strict moderation of these discussions could prevent them from becoming toxic.
1.8.6.1. Con: Interference of any kind with processes that lead to actual laws could easily be interpreted as unfair manipulation.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: The moderators could be politicians that are voted democratically.
1.8.6.1.1.1. Con: Electing moderators would merely replicate whatever problems exist in the current system of elected representatives.
1.9. Con: There are significant examples of direct democracy violating the rights of minorities.
1.9.1. Con: The top post describes Deliberative Democracy, not direct democracy, because collaboration and debate, not mere voting, is the primary source of legitimacy for the law. [Here is the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy.](http://Here is the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy.)
1.9.2. Pro: Between 2004 and 2008, [twenty-six American states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_legislation_in_the_United_States#Efforts_to_prohibit_same-sex_unions) banned marriage equality by [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum).
1.9.2.1. Con: Referendums are different from crowd-sourcing in significant ways. It is therefore problematic to assume that both suffer from the same problems.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Crowd sourcing a law forces people to interact directly with the real wording of the law and with each other instead of letting the media oversimplify or misrepresent each side. This reduces oversimplification and misrepresentation when compared to the commercials supporting or opposing referendums.
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Crowd sourcing laws allows users to fix specific problems with laws rather than just voting yes or no in privacy, as with a referendum.
1.9.3. Pro: [Over 75% of direct votes by citizens](http://www.uky.edu/~jmaver0/Gamble1997.pdf) on proposals to restrict civil rights of minorities have passed in the United States.
1.9.4. Con: Neither indirect nor direct democracy can protect minorities, since an intolerating community will find ways to violate minorities in a much less provable ways.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Indirect democracies, too, can turn a once tolerant public towards hatred. Example are Russia's legislation regarding homosexuals, Hungary's migration campaigns, etc.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: Indirect democracies can turn the public to toleration as well, which was violating the minority rights before.
1.9.4.1.1.1. Pro: A good example here are the black right movements in mid 20th century in South Africa or the USA.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: We can support new forms of crowd-sourced electronic democracy without being big fans of direct democracy. Direct democracy is the mob. Wikipedia is crowd sourced, but it is not like everyone votes on every edit. People that are experts in each issue, bring their knowledge. Wikipedia is a model for what we need to do to politics. We can let reasons for and against the likelihood of each policy's cost, benefits, or risks alter our best guess of their likelihood, and our math for likely impact.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.9.4.1.
1.9.6. Pro: Many countries have the majority of their population living in urban areas. This could easily lead to [a disregard](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2012/11/why-urban-rural-voting-divide-matters/4034/) of the interests of the rural population.
1.9.6.1. Con: This is not a unique disadvantage of crowdsourced laws; basically, each and every democratic form of decision-making may suffer from that inequity.
1.9.7. Con: This seems more like an argument for educating individuals on identity politics rather than attacking direct democracy. There is nothing inherently discriminatory about direct democracy in and of itself
1.9.8. Con: Crowdsource of laws is for collaborating and debating the laws language, not the ratification of the law. Ideally, some representatives will sponsor the bill so that it may be brought to the floor for a vote. Like any proposed legislation, the rights of minorities should be considered by elected representatives \(or by the courts if it passes but still violates rights\).
1.9.9. Con: Crowdsourcing is “direct participation” not like traditional “direct democracy” efforts that use popular votes to follow the will of the majority. Also this forum would operate inside our existing systems and shouldn’t be assumed to be any more anti-minority than our existing systems.
1.9.9.1. Pro: A crowd sourced government policy forum that automatically highlighted the need to remember the rights of minorities within the default debate template could protect the rights of minorities.
1.9.9.2. Pro: A crowd sourced government policy forum that scored laws by how well they protected the rights of everyone could protect the rights of minorities.
1.10. Con: Crowdsourcing laws would disrupt and cause distractions from the normal functioning of the political system.
1.10.1. Con: Many of the systems designed to promote quality within our governments, such as congressional debate, are no longer working.
1.10.1.1. Pro: In America the representatives are supposed to debate the pros and cons of each policy, but they are all to busy getting money for their re-election. The debate does not take place. Many of the laws are thousand of pages long, and are never even read by people who vote for or against them. [Wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_the_Bills_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_the_Bills_Act)
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: The USA keeps passing laws in the middle of the night without letting the other side even read the law. For example, President Obama promised debate for the affordable care act, but it passed in the dead of night with thousand of pages, that no one was allowed to read. Both sides do this when they are in power. Their is very little real debate. Most debate on the Senate floor is made to C-Span, with no one else in the room.
1.10.2. Con: It is a false comparison to contrast representative democracies to a law analysis suggestion and co-creation website. No one is suggesting that we replace representative democracies and destroy any truth promoting filters.
1.10.3. Con: Many of the people involved in that crowd-sourcing effort would also be professionals at drafting implementable legislation. In the same way that open-source software results in more stable, more secure programs, open-source democracy could result in laws that are more implementable than the traditional approach.
1.10.3.1. Pro: The Linux operating system is an example of a high quality and complex open source project that does many of the same things as a well functioning democracy such as: make decisions, resolve conflict, avoid bugs and malicious code from outsiders wanting to do it harm.[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)
1.10.3.2. Pro: Github has tools that could be used to adequately promote quality policy, resolve conflict, and support continual improvement, revision control, and group decision making. Each of their high quality open source projects is a testament of the ability of crowd sourced projects to produce quality.[Democracy Earth is a Github project](https://democracy.earth/)
1.10.3.3. Pro: In a country with hundreds of millions of citizens, like the USA, it seems very unlikely that politicians would happen to be the most knowledgeable citizens on any subjects.
1.10.3.4. Pro: Wikipedia is a complex crowd sourced effort that must do many of the same things as a well functioning government such as: make decisions, resolve conflict, avoid incorrect or improperly sourced or supported claims, and promote quality. [Wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administration)
1.10.4. Con: Professionals have a tendency to write obtusely. Crowdsourcing laws might result in clearer legal language and do away with the need for interpreters of the law.
1.11. Pro: Crowdsourcing laws would bring more citizens into the process of lawmaking as active participants.
1.11.1. Pro: Crowdsourcing would utilize the unused potential and time of millions of citizens for the common good that are currently under-utilized.
1.11.2. Pro: Frustration of not being allowed in deciding procedures is a perfect petri-dish for populist ideologies and the elected personals, who use them.
1.11.3. Con: The possible negative result of not participating in these crowdfunding discussions is so great that it effectively forces people to devote time to this system just to maintain the status quo. This is not a responsibility that citizens who pay taxes should not have to carry.
1.11.4. Con: While it might get more people involved, that's not necessarily a good thing. In the US, the Congress of 535 people is regularly deadlocked, unable to take useful action on pressing issues. Increasing that number to thousands or hundreds of thousands of people could make the situation worse.
1.11.5. Pro: This models allows people from all classes and backgrounds to actively take part in the discussion.
1.11.6. Con: Direct democracy doesn't give the power to the people but rather those who control the information of the people, placing way too much power in the appointed hands of the media instead of elected officials.
1.12. Con: Crowdsourcing would be at an inherent risk of being hijacked by either sides to enact archaic draconian laws - for example the death penalty.
1.12.1. Con: If clubbing to death is the honest result of a democratic process, then the problem may be democracy itself.
1.12.2. Con: The ability to "collaborate" and "debate the wording" \(mentioned in the top post\) will mitigate the risk of one side hijacking the forum, and enacting archaic and draconian laws.
1.12.2.1. Pro: A forum that put reasons to agree and disagree on the same page would encourage moderation.
1.12.2.2. Pro: A web form that evaluated policy by the strength of arguments that cost benefits or risks are more or less likely or are more or less tied to valid interest, could be done in a way to promote moderation and avoid extremism.
1.12.2.3. Pro: A crowdsourced policy forum designed by experts in conflict resolution and mediation could be designs to promote moderation.
1.12.2.4. Pro: A crowdsourced policy forum would use the same crowdsourcing techniques that are used within the greater crowdsourcing community \(like Wikipedia and GitHub\) to promote consensus and avoid the type of thinking \(irrational, biased, and emotional\) that results in draconian policies.
1.12.2.4.1. Pro: Cowd source facilitation tools and techniques \(used by organizations like Wikipedia and GitHub\) are low cost, and easily transferable. Forum moderation and maintenance techniques that promote quality include user account maintenance with IP tracking, points, karma, and up-votes, access levels and moderation seniority, rule enforcement like warning, probation, and banning, and independent peer review.
1.13. Pro: It would help repoliticize citizens who lost faith in politics.
1.13.1. Pro: This could be one of the only areas in a modern democracy that allow people to collaborate in politics instead of picking a side and fighting.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Online collaboration of this kind allows for citizens to engage in [interest-based](http://web.mit.edu/negotiation/www/NBivsp.html) rather than position-based negotiation.
1.13.1.2. Con: Large chunks of the population would probably only participate by choosing from what others propose, thus effectively only picking sides.
1.13.1.2.1. Con: Given two opposing, equally terrible choices would drive people to put their own choice. That is only possible if every person has an easy way to make their opinion known to the public.
1.13.1.2.2. Pro: The small number of citizens that are active in political parties illustrates how few are actually interested in actively participating in politics.
1.13.1.2.2.1. Con: Directly participating in legal processes is, arguably, more attractive than the participation in political parties, much of which is far-removed from actually doing politics.
1.14. Pro: Ordinary political decision-making is prone to the corruption of those who make decisions. As crowdsourcing is decentralized and involves many more people, it is less prone to that.
1.14.1. Con: Many citizens vote for candidates that promise to give them things. Vote for me, and I will give you free stuff is form of bribery.
1.14.2. Con: Key figures within the populace still could be bribed, and there are no suggested constraints to ensure transparency \(our current deterrent to corruption\).
1.14.3. Con: Yet large numbers of people can be swayed through populist promises.
1.14.3.1. Pro: Celebrities and [herd mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality)  can result in large numbers of people aligning to a certain view.
1.14.3.2. Con: A larger number of well meaning, and properly trained actors can counter populist promises.
1.14.4. Con: This is only relevant under the assumption that legislatures are subject to such corruption.
1.15. Pro: Crowdsourcing allows for laws to be created that are difficult in the current structure of government, thanks to special interests or the reelection fears of legislators.
1.15.1. Pro: National legislators are often beholden to special interests that finance their reelection campaigns and who can damage them in the minds of voters for unrelated reasons \(eg. after voting for gun control, gun lobby starts ads targeting a U.S. senator alleging he's lied about his military service\).
1.15.2. Pro: Necessary but unpopular measures \(for example raising taxes\) can be more easily passed by people who are not afraid of losing reelection campaigns.
1.15.2.1. Con: Unpopular measures are unlikely to be voted by those who, in the act of voting, will think about their personal interests, especially if they do not have a long-term or community perspective, as often happens with the common man.
1.15.2.2. Con: Fears of reelection of legislators are based on the will of the public, which would be just as concretely reflected in a new platform.
1.15.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.15.1.
1.15.3. Pro: Crowdsourcing encourages the process of promoting issues directly affecting the general public rather than special interests.
1.15.3.1. Pro: Crowdsourcing is moderated with back and forth words that attempts logic. Even when words without borders, such as time limits, fail the process is better than making decisions by broadcasting to the public propaganda & using Sabermetrics social media manipulation & trusting up/down votes.
1.15.4. Con: In a multi-party system, it might be expected that the parliamentary debate covers the arguments quite well which would have been as well introduced by the not-mandated citizens during an online debate.
1.15.4.1. Con: Parliamentary systems of debate lack many capabilities of online debate forums.
1.15.4.1.1. Pro: Parliamentary systems of debate can only debate one issue at a time, in chronological formats. Online forums can debate hundreds of issues at the same time, and can debate the validity of thousands of sub arguments at a time. The former can have one person talking, and everyone else listening. The latter can have millions of participants all contributing to different parts of the debate at the same time.
1.15.4.1.2. Pro: Parliamentary systems of debate require speaking in chronological back and forth format that doesn't allow for thorough investigation of each claim, when compared to pro/con forums, because the topic is continually changing.
1.15.4.1.2.1. Pro: With pro/con debate forums, the person must put their comment in context of other arguments, and the last person to speak doesn't get the last word.
1.15.4.2. Pro: Representational democracy done well should mean the elected representatives are legitimate. If they are not then the 'patch' of social media discussion is not dealing with the fact that representational democracy is in fact just flawed.
1.15.4.3. Con: Where only one party or a small coalition of parties governs, certain arguments and viewpoints \(e.g. those presented by the opposition\) usually receive little attention.
1.15.4.4. Con: Politicians usually come from particular socio-economic backgrounds which limits the number of interests and arguments that are voiced in parliamentary debates.
1.15.4.4.1. Pro: The members of the American Congress are much wealthier than the vast majority of American citizens.
1.15.4.4.1.1. Pro: As of 2015, more than half of all members of Congress had net worth of [more than one million dollars](http://1,029,505/56,355). That's more than 18 times the net worth of the average American household.
1.15.4.4.1.2. Pro: The median net worth of American families has declined by a third between 2007 and 2013. The average member of Congress, at the same time, saw his/her net worth [increase by 20%](http://1,029,505/56,355) over the same time span.
1.15.4.5. Con: The competence of the legislation is not a strong argument for the exclusion of the public. Just because someone is good at something doesn't mean nobody else can help them.
1.15.5. Con: -> See 1.15.2.2.
