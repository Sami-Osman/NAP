Discussion Name: Should communism be preferred over capitalism?

1. Communism should be preferred over capitalism.
1.1. Pro: A communist government will not be influenced by any religion.
1.1.1. Pro: Karl Marx [claimed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people) that religion is the opium of the people.
1.1.2. Con: A government that rules over religious people should be influenced by religion - at least to the point of not persecuting its religious subjects, as [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antireligious_campaigns_in_China) [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_North_Korea) do.
1.1.3. Con: Religion should not influence governments but nor should many things. The make-up of the people and their views should be taken into consideration and reasoned debate along side free speech should be advocated.
1.1.4. Con: Communism only aims to replace religion with ideology.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Communist ideology considers [religion and religious institutions as powers of reaction and fascism](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12290-007-0003-9) which tie society down.
1.1.5. Pro: The Soviet supported Democratic Republic of Afghanistain emphasized [equality of the sexes and education for women](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/011/1999/en/); while fighting hostile Mujahideen. Many Mujahideen factions, opposed education for women on religious grounds.
1.2. Con: There are cases when communist governments may not provide for their people.
1.2.1. Con: In capitalist states too, there are [a large portion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Absolute_poverty) of people not being provided for.
1.2.1.1. Pro: In the US, the home of [8 of the 10 richest people](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012715/5-richest-people-world.asp), poverty is rampant.
1.2.1.2. Con: In a capitalist system, finding a way out of poverty is possible while a communist system will make all of its subordinates suffer from the same scarcity.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Welfare under capitalist system [does not help](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/gborjas/files/re2016.pdf) people find a way out of poverty. \(p. 143\)
1.2.1.2.2. Con: In communism scarcity affects equally all the people, all will have less but at least all will have some. When there is scarcity in capitalism, only the rich will have access to that commodity, while the poor won't be able to afford it \(as the price will go up\)
1.2.2. Pro: Under communism, those who do not belong to the ruling or upper class end up financially suffering.
1.2.2.1. Pro: In the 20th century, the confiscation of private property and the nationalization of industries caused sufferings to the people.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Under Stalin's Russia, these policies resulted in the [disruption of agricultural productivity and a catastrophic famine](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/coll.html) in 1932–33.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Confiscatory policy may have been a large cause of [the Great Chinese Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine).
1.2.2.2. Con: Under communism there are no upper classes.
1.2.2.3. Con: This is actually a downfall of capitalism, not communism, as wealth disparity is combated in communism.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: No system is free of corruption, particularly a communist one where criticism is usually taken as criticism against the state which leads to disastrous outcomes.
1.2.2.4. Con: The concept of the economic class will be abolished under communism.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: The removal of wealth and class disparities is a goal of communism in theory but not in practice.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Elites belonging to the 'ruling class' in communist societies become their own aristocracy evincing all the worst qualities of elites from any other type of society.
1.2.2.6. Con: Eastern Bloc Communist states, actually had a strong record [for the removal of poverty](https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo-JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA122)(Page 122)
1.2.3. Pro: As demonstrated by Venezuela, Communist economies often lead to [shortages of basic goods and necessities](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/10/medicine-shortages-venezuela-dying-agony), and [breaches of human rights](https://www.hrw.org/americas/venezuela).
1.2.3.1. Con: Any economic system will not work as it is supposed to when the government of a country is corrupt.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Currently, the most corrupt country is [Somalia](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/most-corrupt-countries/) and it is an anarcho-capitalist country.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Somalia is a [parliamentary republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Somalia), whose ruling party is not libertarian or anarcho-capitalist.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Calling a \(country which was at one point a\) failed state anarcho-anything is just a cheap insult towards anti-state ideologies, and specifying "anarcho-capitalist" is nakedly hypocritical so you don't hit the anti-state ideologies you like.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Con: An "anarcho-capitalist country" is self-contradictory, as is saying such a country has a corrupt government.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Communism does not adhered to corruption, unlike capitalism that promotes poverty and inequality.
1.2.3.2. Con: Venezuela has a higher percentage of private industry than the US, and is thus, not a Communist economy by any standard.
1.2.3.3. Con: It is unlikely that the failures of Venezuela are an outcome of Communism, rather [corruption in government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Venezuela).
1.2.4. Pro: Communism is merely a political name for the ideology, yet some communist countries act similarly with other political views.
1.2.4.1. Pro: There are stateless forms of [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism).
1.2.5. Pro: History has shown that communist countries may not always prosper. Many [communist countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/world/study-finds-poverty-deepening-in-former-communist-countries.html) have had high levels of poverty.
1.2.5.1. Con: This is not necessarily an outcome of communism, and more likely an outcome of totalitarianism, which most communist nations have been.
1.2.6. Pro: This is due to the communist government's [unwillingness](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/24/venezuelas-humanitarian-crisis/severe-medical-and-food-shortages-inadequate-and) to alleviate the shortages.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.4. Con: Communism has not been successful in the past.
1.4.1. Pro: The communist experiment has consistently failed, producing [tyrannical governments](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/01/venezuela-shows-disastrously-socialism-always-ends-tyranny/), [mass death](https://www.wsj.com/articles/100-years-of-communismand-100-million-dead-1510011810) and destruction.
1.4.1.1. Con: The competition of capitalism and imperialism between countries always lead to war, and a section of capitalism actually [benefits from it](http://socialistreview.org.uk/394/why-does-capitalism-lead-war).
1.4.1.2. Con: Anarcho-communist communities couldn't succeed because of oppression from powerful governments.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Stateless communist [Korean Anarchist Federation in Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Association_in_Manchuria) was conquered by Japan.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Strandzha Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strandzha_Commune) was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: [Makhnovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovia) was eliminated by White Army and Red Army.
1.4.1.2.4. Pro: [Defence Council of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Defence_Council_of_Aragon) was conquered by the Spanish Republic.
1.4.1.3. Con: The same could be said about first capitalist experiments like the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), the results of which were far from absolute success. However, it resulted in the establishment of a better social system that increased the world's standard of living and prevented many more deaths. We shouldn't stop after a first failed try.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: After the French revolution, the new emperor Napoleon came to power, whose reign was tyrannical.
1.4.1.4. Pro: This tyranny is at the consequence of [human nature](https://merionwest.com/2020/02/12/the-human-impulse-for-tyranny/), not internal or external political factors. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
1.4.2. Pro: Communist U.S.S.R collapsed in [1991](https://www.britannica.com/event/the-collapse-of-the-Soviet-Union).
1.4.2.1. Con: The USSR was not communist. They were socialist and run by the communist party.
1.4.3. Con: Not one of the communist regimes has been left alone to explore its true capabilities. Every one of them has suffered from external interference from capitalist or imperialist regimes, one way or another. We don't know what would have happened otherwise.
1.4.4. Con: It might be that the internal toolset \(be it societal, economical or political\) of trials of the past [did not anticipate](https://www.learning-mind.com/why-did-communism-fail/) enough of the obstacles and potholes, so a more properly thought out system could be worked out.
1.4.4.1. Con: Many of the potholes of communism are intrinsic to its nature - for example, a [command economy is inseparable from communism](http://Command Economy Definition - Investopediahttps://www.investopedia.com › ... › Government & Policy).
1.4.5. Con: In 20th century [Africa, and Asia](https://www.jstor.org/stable/723499), Communism and Communists mobilized forces against imperialism to struggle for and achieve the self determination of many countries and oppressed people.
1.4.5.1. Con: Revolution does not necessarily indicate efficiency. Whether or not a revolution occurred is completely separate from the output of the government.
1.4.6. Con: In Post Communist Eastern Europe a majority of the population contiunes to [to support redistribution of wealth and are also aganist market economies](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.34.2.172)(Journal of Economic Perspectives—Volume 34, Number 2—Spring 2020—Page 184).
1.5. Pro: Capitalism subverts the wellbeing of the collective in favor of the wellbeing of the individual.
1.5.1. Pro: [The wealth of the richest 1% equal to the other 99%](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35339475). This huge social and economic gap would not happen if countries were communist.
1.5.1.1. Con: An unequal distribution of wealth is not in and of itself morally wrong.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: When the massive wealth collection of the top 1% comes from the exploited labor of the bottom 99%, it is. This is the case under capitalism.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: If one has an ideological commitment to viewing certain kinds of transactions as "exploitation" and therefore evil, any percentage of the population being exploiters is morally wrong, and so the wealth distribution is unrelated to this issue.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Capitalism as it first arrived wad a lot of different ideas that what it is now. The ideology isn't toxic but how it is applied, communism when it applied becames toxic too. Real life problems and real life changes one idee of another.
1.5.1.2. Con: The communist leaders actually have more power and resources since they directly control people's work, their land and much more then a trillionaire could.
1.5.2. Con: [Capitalism](https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/indicator/2016/07/capitalism-compassion) does not ask for well-being of the people but only how much does work and resources value.
1.5.3. Con: Actually under current influnce, capitalism is slowly going to what it once represented, equality of chance not of outcomes. Antimonopols lows, equally of education \(internet mostly has become the main learning tool and more peoplethan ever are connected online\) etc.
1.5.3.1. Con: With rising starting wealth inequality, increased cutbacks to schooling and other public services, and the rise of austerity backing governments - 'equality of chance' is an ideal that many capitalist countries are moving further away from.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: [70%](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/22/wealth-gap-widening-for-more-than-70-per-cent-of-global-population-researchers-find) of people live in countries where the wealth gap is growing
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: In England as an example, [School spending per pupil at public schools fell by 9% in real terms between 2009–10 and 2019–20](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/15026)
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Austerity or other forms of budget cuts are [expected in as many as 159 countries next year](http://www.ipsnews.net/2021/04/global-austerity-alert-looming-budget-cuts-2021-25-alternatives/), representing 85% of the global population.
1.5.3.1.4. Con: Mass media and other organizations are trying to increase access to education by different methods, some even include monetary donations thus capitalism shows that people do make a difference even on the're own. In opposition to communist were only the top elite decides how much money will get different sectors of activity.
1.5.4. Con: In most capitalist states, there is some form of collective well being, such as law enforcement, education and healthcare provided by the state and redistribution of wealth through taxation.
1.5.4.1. Con: Healthcare provided by capitalist state is often [insufficient or inadequate for the masses.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK154484/)
1.6. Pro: Communism avoids the private ownership of the means of production and hence inequality is eradicated.
1.6.1. Con: Inequality can manifest itself in different ways. Financial inequality isn't inherently wrong; if someone is willing to work harder and smarter they should be rewarded more than someone who isn't willing to do the same.
1.6.1.1. Pro: People want different things. One might want more time to spend with family, the other might want a new car. This might make them work quite differently.
1.6.2. Con: Communism, via [planned economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy), puts the functional ownership of the means of production in the hands of communist party elites, and hence inequality is vastly magnified.
1.6.3. Pro: In a communism framework, the more important sectors of the economy would be owned by the government. This is beneficial as they will not be incentivized by profit and will focus only on the needs of the people.
1.6.3.1. Con: As a consequence, some important sectors like transport, water, electricity or health may be negatively impacted in the transition process from capitalism to communism.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: With proper preparation and implementation such impacts would be minimised.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: With a gradual transition, with a gradually socialist economy, the shocks of economic change is generally avoided, or at worst minimized.
1.6.3.1.3. Pro: Sectors such as medicine, local retail, small business actually benefit from increased productivity and workflow under capitalism by having multiple companies trying to compete and outperforms each other. The main problem is not having enough firms that actually compete with each other. Under the unified system, salary are not generated by market dynamics but by laws.
1.6.3.1.4. Con: In [most](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/ground-transportation/best-easiest-countries-for-ground-transportation) [developed](https://oxfordmedicine.com/view/10.1093/med/9780199661756.001.0001/med-9780199661756-chapter-22) countries, most of these sectors are already [public](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/best-countries-education/) and they work properly.
1.6.3.2. Con: The problem with the government ownership of important sectors is mainly one of innovation. The lack of competition means almost no incentive to innovate and improve.
1.6.3.3. Con: Profit is an incentive to focus on the needs of the people, and it is nonsense to expect that lacking an incentive to do something will make someone more motivated to focus on that thing.
1.6.4. Con: Inequality under communist regims is higher then under capitalism regims. Position of power get more then rewards then other normal positions.
1.7. Con: Communism has inferior mechanisms for producing and distributing resources efficiently.
1.7.1. Pro: Without a price mechanism, Communist economy planners [would be unable](https://mises.org/library/economic-calculation-socialist-commonwealth) to distinguish more or less valuable uses of social resources.
1.7.1.1. Con: The market mechanism itself [often fails](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/introduction-to-market-failure) to effectively distinguish and distribute resources.
1.7.2. Pro: Communism planners exercising decisions on behalf of the collective [cannot conceivably access the sum of information utilised by individual actors in a capitalist market](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html), which is necessary to make informed value judgements.
1.7.3. Con: A form of automated Communism, similar to [Chile's project Cybersyn](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/project-cybersyn/) might solve problems related to distribution of capital and corruption in planned economies.
1.7.4. Con: Planned Economies in the 20th century had certain advantages and limitations. State mechanisms could be used to create heavy industry and the ['foundations' of an economy but often faltered](https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~mli/Economics%207004/Allen-103.pdf)(The reasons for the rapid growth of the Soviet Union before roughly 1970 and for its subsequent growth slowdown are analysed. The concentration of investment on heavy industry and soft budget constraints explain most of the growth in the 1930s. The growth slowdown was due to disastrous investment decisions following the elimination of surplus labour and the diversion of research and development resources to the military rather than the failure of firms to carry out plans or diminishing returns to capital.) once the country became highly developed. In this sense planned economies were not complete failures but could fall victim to their own achievements.
1.8. Con: Lack of free market and competition in a communist system leads to slower scientific and technical innovations.
1.8.1. Con: Scientific or technical innovations don't usually have a straight return of investment, or at least not an easy measurable one. Therefore, free market will tend to prefer other investments over Science. Lack of free market, if anything, could even benefit scientific breakthroughs.
1.8.2. Pro: Communism precludes the possibility of innovation and advantage.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The numerous brands that currently exist for one type of product will need to be reconstructed into one. This would lead to less variety of products churning out of one industry.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: It is unnecessary to have such a large number of brands for any product.
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: Different brands offer qualities, different attributes and a different price for there products. Having more choices is always good.
1.8.2.1.3. Con: The labor put into building these many brands should be put into solving problems such as famine, global warming and diseases.
1.8.2.1.3.1. Con: Not everything is about famine, global warming and diseases. If everything where about these, it could be said that most industries shouldn't exist. For example, the entertainment industry doesn't help solve these.
1.8.3. Con: Many scientific breakthroughs did not take place in the presence of the free market. All of these were researched and/or developed by individuals, public universities or by the State.
1.8.3.1. Pro: An example of this is the [control of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_of_fire_by_early_humans).
1.8.3.2. Pro: The [wheel](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-invention-of-the-wheel-1992669) was found before the free market.
1.8.3.3. Pro: [Agriculture](https://www.crestcapital.com/tax/history_of_agriculture) was also organised before the free market.
1.8.3.4. Pro: [Antibiotics and vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medicine) were invented before the free market was founded.
1.8.3.5. Pro: [Internal combustion engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine) were developed before the free market.
1.8.3.6. Pro: The [internet](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet) was invented after the free market.
1.8.3.7. Pro: The [space programs](https://aerospace.org/article/brief-history-space-exploration) was invented prior to the free market.
1.8.3.8. Con: Many things, whether scientific-technological inventions or consumerist products, are developed by cooperation. But to make progress, competition is necessary. This is apparent when companies compete to provide better products or services.
1.8.3.8.1. Con: Competition is not the only way to encourage innovation. A desire to help the collective good is also a strong motivator.
1.8.3.8.1.1. Con: The desire to help is not as present as it is the spirit of competition in humans.
1.8.3.9. Pro: The Soviet Union made many scientific and technical innovations, including being the [first nation to achieve orbit around the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1).
1.8.3.9.1. Con: Ideology drove them to prioritize appearances, which resulted in Chernobyl \[[1](http://www.chernobylgallery.com/chernobyl-disaster/cause/)\] \[[2](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/intn.html)\].
1.8.3.10. Con: There will always be some kind of innovation or improvement upon existing innovations occurring somewhere in the world, but the speed at which the innovation can progress and mature is affected by its surrounding economic environment.
1.9. Con: Communism would subvert personal security as a concern subordinate to the State.
1.9.1. Pro: Where there is no personal sovereignty, persons are not regarded with respect for dignity, grace, nor sympathy for basic rights.
1.9.1.1. Con: In a capitalist society where you never earn the equivalent to what you actually produce, we already have no personal sovereignty.
1.9.1.2. Con: Communism does not preclude personal sovereignty, it encourages it.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.10. Con: Communism is not viable for visionaries and inventors.
1.10.1. Pro: Visionaries and people with great innovative ideas might not get as rich as they would in a capitalist country.
1.10.1.1. Con: In communism, there would be no reason to be rich, because all goods and possibilities would be available without payment.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: These goods and possibilities would be available, but scarce. Time and time again citizens of communist countries have found themselves frequently under supplied with many necessities \(food, tools, toiletries, etc.\).
1.10.1.2. Con: When these people get rich in a capitalist country, their individual accumulation of wealth promotes inequality for the rest of society.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: Wealth is not created in a vacuum, every dollar accumulated by the rich is siphoned from those below them.
1.10.1.3. Con: Under capitalism, jobs that don't produce capital such as artistic jobs which are essential for our culture and spirituality are already underpaid, as well as very important, life-saving jobs such as doctors.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: Doctors in the United States earn [very high incomes](https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2019/09/24/international-physician-compensation).
1.10.1.4. Pro: The support for visionaries is often limited in a community because people are reserved when it comes to change so in a communists environment they wouldn't get any recognition. In fact in some cases they could get shot by the communist community.
1.10.1.5. Con: People were developing technology long before the conception of profit and hence even without monetary incentive, will continue doing so. People will hence be motivated to push humanity forward for the sake of pushing humanity forward.
1.10.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.10.2. Pro: Visionary people and inventors whould have quite a hard time in communism, there ideas might go against the spirit of communism.
1.11. Con: The suppression of capitalism is the suppression the rights and liberty of the people.
1.11.1. Con: In a communist system, working class rights are protected.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Once the capital interest are removed, all workers would gain as much as they produce. They will not have to live through a static salary that does not reflect their hard work.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: Communism is [meritocratic](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/2b0ffs/is_communism_meritocratic/), unlike capitalism.
1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: We can say that on paper it is, but [corruption and other real problems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228674114_Corruption_Culture_and_Communism) transform it so it's no longer meritocracy.
1.11.1.1.1.2. Con: There's no real reason to say that capitalism isn't a meritocracy. The people have more freedoms so they are more in charge of their lives. Money is in direct correlation with certain abilities.
1.11.1.1.1.3. Con: Communist can't be a meritocracy because it is based on social equality above all else meaning you be deadbeat an you whould still get support. That support comes from all other people working. So you're taking from people that working to provide to give to someone that doesn't.
1.11.1.1.2. Con: You already don't have to live through a static salary in capitalism, it's called commission. Many companies offer as much as [40-50% commission](https://mapmycustomers.me/blog/average-sales-rep-compensation-by-industry/).
1.11.1.2. Con: Liberal democracies, like Western Europe, have a [far better record](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-rights-violations) on human rights than communist regimes, like China and North Korea.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: By name, China and North Korea are communist, but in reality are much more engaged in capitalist economics.
1.11.1.3. Con: Workers under the current system have many freedoms and rights. Not only this, continuous attempts are being made to improve the conditions, wages and ability to have more options.
1.11.1.4. Con: Working class rights are not limited to communist systems. Labor unions exist and flex their influence within capitalist and other non-communist socialism-based governments. \([p. 14](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2011/04/pdf/unionsmakethemiddleclass.pdf)\)
1.11.1.5. Con: Working class rights are protected so long as the rights are in the interest of the central communist party. If the party needs to suspend rights, then the protections are simply removed.
1.11.1.6. Con: The USSR had [many forced labor camps](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/gulag) while it was ruled by a communist government.
1.11.1.6.1. Con: That is because [the USSR wasn't really communist](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Communists-claim-that-the-USSR-wasnt-real-Communism), it was very corrupt.
1.11.1.6.1.1. Pro: Replacing a Board of Directors with people sent from the government does not change anything. Actual communism means abolishing the system of hierarchy and allowing all workers to participate in the making of decisions.
1.11.1.7. Pro: In a capitalist system, the interests of the few people that own the means of production prevail upon the majority of the working class.
1.11.1.7.1. Pro: Communism is a system in which the workers are the ones who make the decisions and they are the ones who can fire managers \(not vice versa like capitalism\).
1.11.1.7.1.1. Con: The [labor committee](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49631120) that represents the workers does the firing and thus we have just a name change not an actual way that workers run the factory.
1.11.1.7.1.2. Con: The decisions to produce or not and what type of product for factories comes from the top of the communist party.
1.11.1.7.2. Con: Capital ownership of means of production by those who design and implement it assures it is well managed, which maximizes the likelihood the workers stay employed and benefit long term. The arrangement is a win-win and the fact that workers eagerly participate in it is proof of this.
1.11.1.7.2.1. Con: Many corporations, in order to better manage the means of production, cause massive [unemployment](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/jobs/laid-off/).
1.11.1.7.3. Con: Any system where the government has enough power to take the means of production away from those who created it, can dictate to the workers what their interest are allowed to be and murder anyone who disagrees.
1.11.1.7.4. Con: There are [20.27 million millionaires in the US](https://spendmenot.com/blog/what-percentage-of-americans-are-millionaires/), so that's not a few. In communism, the [Castros are billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/keithflamer/2016/11/26/10-surprises-about-castros-extravagant-life/?sh=17d8da326d76), [Chavez's daughter has $4.5 billion in the bank](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3192933/Hugo-Chavez-s-ambassador-daughter-Venezuela-s-richest-woman-according-new-report.html), [Stalin lived a life of unimaginable luxury](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/stalin-hero-for-our-time/) - while their people lived in poverty.
1.11.1.7.5. Con: A capitalist system provides for those with drive, and determination to succeed whereas a communist system provides meager wages equally between hard workers, and slackers. Soon the hard workers lose [incentive](https://www.news24.com/news24/MyNews24/Why-Communism-ALWAYS-fails-kept-simple-for-the-general-reader-20140826), and production suffers.
1.11.2. Pro: Capitalism is the result of private property and free association. Capitalism cannot be suppressed without suppressing either one of these, which would be either impractical or against the rights and liberties of the people.
1.11.2.1. Pro: If one wishes to remove private property, they must collectivize the property. There are reasons why the collectivization of previously private property is less sustainable and against the rights/liberties of the people.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: The en-mass collectivization of property at the hands of the state would require forceful robbery of the property, which is a violation of property rights.
1.11.2.2. Pro: If one wishes to oppose freedom of association, they are opposing a [fundamental right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association), and one that is [foundational to liberty](https://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/558228).
1.11.2.3. Con: Communist systems do not necessarily suppress the right of free association.
1.11.2.3.1. Pro: Jospeh Tito's Yugoslavia is an example of a more Liberal Communist state, with many human rights, including religious freedom and the right to free travel.
1.11.2.4. Con: The rights are a manufactured product of a society and are reflection of a society's values-system, which comprehends the economic "structure". So, the argument is circular.
1.11.3. Pro: Statist communism is economical totalitarianism. Economic totalitarianism strongly suggests a loss of some rights and liberties.
1.11.4. Con: This argument is entirely reversible. If the will of the people was behind the creation of a communist state, then logically the continutation of capitalism would be the 'suppression of communism, thus the suppression of the rights and liberty of the people'.
1.11.4.1. Pro: From a political perspective, a pro-communist supporter forced to live in a capitalist society is just as politically oppressed as a capitalist forced to live in a communist society.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: A communist living in a capitalist country is free to purchase land and attempt to build a community in line with their [political beliefs](https://americancentury.omeka.wlu.edu/exhibits/show/dropping-out--intentional-comm/history-of-the-commune). A capitalist living in a communist society does not have this freedom, and is thus more politically oppressed.
1.11.4.2. Con: This assumes that the right at issue is \(solely\) the right to live under a government or economic regime of one's choosing.
1.11.5. Con: -> See 1.11.2.4.
1.11.6. Con: In the Cold War, [Marxist Leninist nations pressured NATO members](https://www.wallawallapubliclibrary.org/home/showpublisheddocument/2148/636755453275570000)(page 35.) to include economic rights as a part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this proposal was rejected.
1.11.6.1. Con: Economic rights as marxist-leninist countries would define them would obviously be distinct from the individualistic rights and freedoms entailed by a liberal economy, if not profit contradictory.
1.11.7. Con: Large Communist parties exist in countries with democratic political systems. ie: In Japan's local elections the [Communist Party is often the only true opposition party](https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2760924?uid=2134&uid=3739632&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21104392311047). The JCP promotes LGBT, women's rights and the rights of native Ainu People.
1.11.8. Con: Rights are inherently contradictory in nature, thus some are always suppressed in any society. This argument is a [faulty comparision](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Faulty-Comparison) as it compares communism to an unobtainable ideal scenario, rather than the rights given / suppressed under capitalism.
1.11.8.1. Pro: To fund any level of state function, you have to raise taxes and/or have state ownership of resources. This clearly imposes on the right to free enterprise.
1.11.8.2. Pro: An example of contradictory rights would be, that supporting the right to live for some people requires murderers to be put in prison, and have their right to freedom thus restricted.
1.11.8.3. Pro: You can't deliver Universal Healthcare, [a fundamental human right](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), without state owned hospitals or state funded healthcare programs. Pure capitalism is simply unable to deliver this right.
1.11.8.4. Pro: You can't deliver Universal Education, [a fundamental human right](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), without state owned schools or state funded education programs. Pure capitalism is simply unable to deliver this right.
1.11.8.5. Pro: The right to [freedom from exploitation](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/fundamental-rights/), requires obvious restrictions on the right to free enterprise that exploits others.
1.12. Pro: Capitalism is leading us to destruction by causing climate change.
1.12.1. Pro: Industrial capitalism, and its addiction to fossil fuels, is one the major causes of [global warming.](https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/20/04/2021/saving-planet-under-capitalism-really-possible)
1.12.1.1. Con: It is the [manufacturing of goods](http://A Climate of Change: Manufacturing Must Rise to the Riskshttps://www.c2es.org › document › a-climate-of-change-...) that causes global warming, not capitalism. Manufacturing is still necessary in a communistic government.
1.12.2. Con: Capitalism [incentivizes](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/breathe-free-capitalism-helps-protect-the-environment) individuals and businesses to adopt a climate-friendly approach.
1.12.3. Con: The lack of transparency in communist governments makes it more likely to contaminate the enviroment without resposibility or awareness.
1.12.4. Con: The USSR [dried the Aral Sea.](http://www.ciesin.org/docs/006-238/006-238.html)
1.12.5. Con: The USSR tried to [hide](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2201677-chernobyl-disaster-how-the-soviet-unions-cover-story-was-blown/) Chernobyl.
1.12.6. Con: The People's Republic of China is the [largest carbon emitter in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271748/the-largest-emitters-of-co2-in-the-world/).
1.12.6.1. Con: A large proportion of China's carbon emissions are as a result of international trade with Capitalist countries inside of a Globalist-Capitalist system.
1.12.6.1.1. Pro: China produces over half the world's supply of steel and this alone makes up about [10%](https://ethicalunicorn.com/2019/10/19/why-chinas-emissions-are-so-high-how-they-actually-compare-to-other-countries/) of their CO2 emissions, however upwards of [7% of all steel produced in China](https://legacy.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-china.pdf) is exported to other countries.
1.12.7. Con: Communism has equal need for production and output as capitalism. They need the same products, so the same products that cause climate change in capitalism would do so under communism.
1.13. Con: The power centralization under communism makes it easier for authoritarian rulers and undermines democracy.
1.13.1. Pro: Centralization of power will generate resistance of the marginal population and stake holders not included in the decision making process.
1.13.2. Pro: To fully control the economy, the state will need to control the population and the only form of population control is through some sort of authoritarianism, since it will imply unpopular policies.
1.13.3. Con: Most major authoritarian communist regimes became/were authoritarian before they became communist, so communism cannot be blamed here.
1.13.3.1. Pro: The [autocratic governments of Tsarist Russia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z9qnsbk/revision/3) had ruled the country with a strong authoritian grasp, significantly before communism rose to power in the country.
1.13.3.2. Pro: Nationalist China bordered on [authoritarian government](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nationalist-Party-Chinese-political-party) during the Nationalist Party's rule of China in the 1930s, before the CCP had taken over.
1.13.3.3. Con: Prior to the development of [modern democracy](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-projects/the-rise-of-modern-democracy/browse), most countries were ruled in authoritarian manners, such as by divine right via a strict [monarchy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/monarchy/Premodern-monarchies). This does not excuse communism from being authoritarian, as democratic countries have moved away from authoritarianism.
1.14. Con: Communism is impossible since people automatically start building social structures in their absence.
1.14.1. Pro: So far no country managed to cross dictatorship of the proletariat phase to withering away of the state phase of communist \(r\)evolution.
1.14.2. Con: There are cases of communities that follow principles of communism with success
1.14.2.1. Pro: [Twin Oaks](https://moneyless.org/living-without-money-twin-oaks), an eco-village and intentional community in North America
1.14.3. Con: There is no evidence suggesting that people will always start building social structures. It might be true that people tend to do that, but that would make communism improbable, not impossible
1.15. Con: Capitalism in the form of markets and socialism in the form of government spending and regulations are different tools that are best for different things. Socialism is better at things like national defense, health insurance, and roads. Capitalism is better at things like consumer goods.
1.16. Pro: Communist Cuba is the only country to have both a [high Human Development Index and a sustainable Carbon Footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index#/media/File:Human_welfare_and_ecological_footprint.jpg)(Data is from UN Development Programme and Global Footprint Network). Showing countries with socialist values can create sustainable societies
1.17. Pro: The fundamental goal under capitalism is to make profit. Pursuit of profit is the cause of many reprehensible practices
1.17.1. Pro: Profit motivates to exploit workers
1.17.1.1. Pro: There are many examples of [US companies exploiting workers](https://www.greenamerica.org/choose-fair-labor/us-companies-exploiting-workers)
1.17.2. Pro: It is profitable to deliberately shorten the lifespan or usability of products to force people to purchase new products. Practice called [Planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence)
1.17.2.1. Pro: There are many companies that [prevent products from being easily repairable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence#Prevention_of_repairs)
1.17.2.1.1. Pro: Apple made multiple efforts to make their [phones not easily repairable](https://theconversation.com/screwed-over-how-apple-and-others-are-making-it-impossible-to-get-a-cheap-and-easy-phone-repair-156871)
1.18. Con: Communism provides less net upward economic mobility than capitalism. [It also hinders class mobility, failing under the PEACH model.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6067116/)
1.19. Pro: Collective progress is given more importance in a communist system.
1.19.1. Pro: Individual progress is encouraged but it can't take go against collective principles of social justice, equality, sustainability etc. Communism offers the best option for the largest number of people to have individual progress.
1.19.1.1. Con: There's no data to back it up. If we see that many individuals suffer under a certain regime then we could group them and say the general population suffer in that regime.
1.19.1.2. Con: Individual progress is discredited and so most progress is attributed to the community.
1.19.1.3. Con: A mass answer for each individual doesn't provides the best options for most individuals. It just covers up the problem. Individual needs are usually quite different so same approach every time will not cover each individuals needs.
1.19.1.3.1. Con: By definition, the solution that is good for a group is good for most individuals within that group.
1.19.1.4. Pro: A bad solution is usually better then no solution.
1.19.2. Con: Collective progress is unattainable without accountability of the individual.
1.19.3. Con: "Collective progress" is often used to justify the oppression of individuals who suffer the loss of their personal rights and interests.
1.19.3.1. Pro: When everyone must sacrifice for the good of the intangible collective, the result is each individual is worse off and everyone was simply bullied into supporting an illusion. The collective is a fiction used to deny the reality that everyone is actually worse off, except for the ruling elites.
1.19.4. Con: Economies which prioritise individual economic freedom over collective progress [produce greater general standards](https://www.heritage.org/international-economies/commentary/socialism-vs-capitalism-one-clear-winner) for the collective than economies which do the reverse.
1.19.5. Con: There are no incentives for collective progress thus it is usually non-existent.
1.19.6. Con: Due to the lack of private property, prices can't be determined and you can't decide the best manner to allocate resources. Therefore, either there happens to be a waste, or nothing gets done completely.
1.19.7. Con: Not being able to profit individually prevents the progress of the collective.
1.19.7.1. Con: The ability to profit usually involves exploitation, which hinders the progress of the collective. \([p. 20](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---declaration/documents/publication/wcms_243391.pdf)\)
1.19.8. Con: Individual progress of life is less importance in a communist system.
1.19.8.1. Con: In communism, individuals would have much more freedoms and time for self expression since their health and survival needs would be accounted for.
1.19.8.2. Con: Capitalism makes a person's wealth more important than their personality.
1.19.8.2.1. Con: Personality is an equally poor, if not worse, measure of a person's worth to society. In fact, no other metric has proven to be any better.
