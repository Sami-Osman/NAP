1.2.5.1. Pro: These enterprises often commit [visa and immigration fraud](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/09/22/some-birth-tourism-operators-prosecuted-others-still-woo-pregnant-women-to-southern-california/) to bring pregnant women into the US.
1.3. Pro: A child born in the USA to foreign parents who broke the law or visa requirements in any way can be easily taken away from them. According to the statistics, more than 150,000 immigrant families were separated from their children in the last 20 years.

Pro: Under the [current system,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2016/10/05/the-citizenship-and-immigration-problems-of-anchor-babies-and-surrogacy/#43cf52c155b3) a child born of birth tourism is entitled to claim social welfare, be educated at a lower cost and claim certain health benefits for life.
1.5.4. Con: With the opportunities available to the average child in the US, it is unlikely that they will be reliant on state support in adulthood.
1.6. Pro: A downside to allowing birth tourism means taking up space in a hospital that otherwise may be available to someone who lives in the country or territory.
1.6.1. Pro: There are limited resources available for public health programmes.

1.6.2.1. Pro: The constitution of the World Health Organization [envisages "…the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being.”](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health)

1.7.1.1. Pro: A numerical increase in the number of people engaging in birth tourism will compound many of the associated problems.
1.7.1.2. Con: Birth tourism is an expensive endeavour. It is unlikely that too many more people will be able to take advantage of it even if the benefits were more common knowledge.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: The US is the [most expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america) nation in the world to give birth in.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: On average, insurers paid $[10,808](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america) in 2015 to cover the costs of vaginal birth in Spain. This was four times the amount it cost in Spain.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: Although birth tourism is expensive, once aware of the benefits, it is likely that more people would make a conscious attempt at saving money to fund the expense.
1.7.2. Con: Because of how common birth tourism is, it will be impossible to effectively make it illegal.
1.7.2.1. Pro: A "black market" for birth tourism will likely be set up to meet the demand that will continue to exist. This will leave the women in the industry more vulnerable.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The women involved in this industry will likely be forced to pay more to find loopholes in the policies.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: The women will need to take more extreme risks, which could place them and the baby at harm, if they are determined to go forward with this decision.
1.7.3. Con: According to the Center of Disease Control, only about [10,000](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/26/799629241/immigration-news-birth-tourism-border-wall-costs-travel-ban-expansion) babies born in the US are of foreign nationals. This is not a particularly large number.
1.7.4. Pro: [19 people](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/09/22/some-birth-tourism-operators-prosecuted-others-still-woo-pregnant-women-to-southern-california/) were tried for defrauding hospitals and apartment owners in January 2019 while setting up and supporting their birth tourism operations.
1.7.5. Con: While it may be common, it is not the most pressing issue that the US is currently dealing with and should thus not be a priority.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Issues that voters [are concerned about](https://www.isidewith.com/polls) include LGBT rights, abortion, government mandates, and gun control.
1.7.6. Pro: The Center for Immigration Studies [estimates](https://www.ft.com/content/59192c24-3dfa-11ea-a01a-bae547046735) that more than 30,000 women every year enter the US to take advantage of citizenship rights obtained at birth.
1.7.6.1. Con: This is a relatively small number when one considers that there are nearly [4 million babies](https://bumpreveal.com/blogs/statistics/how-many-babies-are-born-in-the-united-states-every-year) born in the US each year.
1.8. Con: Outlawing birth tourism or introducing policies which attempt to restrict birth tourism will negatively impact young women.
1.8.1. Pro: Many women who give birth in the US already [feel](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/28/11284116/birth-tourism) guilt and shame because of the stigma attached to birth tourism. Such a measure would likely increase this stigma.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Stress during pregnancy can cause [complications](https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/stress-and-pregnancy.aspx) for the mother.
1.8.2. Con: The primary responsibility of a government is to its own people, and not solely to young women throughout the globe.
1.8.3. Pro: Women who are suspected of travelling in order to give birth may be subjected to greater scrutiny and invasive queries.
1.8.3.1. Pro: A woman on her way to Saipan was [forced](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/24/21077138/trump-birth-tourism-immigration-pregnant-women-saipan) to take a pregnancy test because it was said her body shape/size resembled that of a pregnant woman.
1.8.4. Pro: According to the [director of advocacy and policy at the International Women’s Health Coalition](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/24/21077138/trump-birth-tourism-immigration-pregnant-women-saipan), laws requiring pregnant women to prove they are not travelling for obtaining US citizenship for their child will make it more difficult for women to travel to the United States for any purpose.
1.8.5. Pro: Policies which attempt to restrict birth tourism [may prevent](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/24/21077138/trump-birth-tourism-immigration-pregnant-women-saipan) women in countries where the infant and maternal mortailty rates are high, from travelling to give birth.

1.9.1.3. Con: These babies, who are now US citizens, are not meaningfully adding to the diversity of the country since, if they are working in the US, they are likely to have been raised in the US to begin with.
1.9.1.4. Con: The likelihood of miscommunication and misunderstanding is greater in a more diverse workplace due to differing social norms.
1.9.1.5. Pro: Increased diversity can [improve productivity in the workplace.](https://www.wonolo.com/blog/6-benefits-of-having-a-diverse-workforce)

1.9.2.1. Con: The world is [increasingly connected](https://www.intechopen.com/books/globalization-approaches-to-diversity/globalization-and-culture-the-three-h-scenarios) today. Cultural diversity is an inevitable consequence of this phenomenon.

1.9.2.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/world/americas/05iht-diversity.1.6986248.html) found that neighbors in diverse communities trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings.
1.9.2.4. Pro: Many birth tourists are citizens of another nation, with different common values than those in the United States.
1.9.2.4.1. Con: The US has a racially and ethnically [diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States) population that birth tourists will be able to find a place in.
1.9.2.4.1.1. Pro: In [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States), the population in the US comprised of 12.7% African Americans and 17.8% Hispanic and Latino Americans.
1.9.2.4.1.2. Pro: The [2018 U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/detailed-estimates.html) estimates that racial minority populations, especially Hispanic, Asian and African Americans, continue to expand in the US.

1.9.2.5.1.1. Pro: Most birth tourists might be strongly attached to their place of birth and its values, which is not the same as their children. This confuses children on which values to follow.
1.9.2.5.1.2. Pro: Children might develop resentment towards their parents if they force them to follow values different than those followed in their surroundings.
1.9.2.6. Pro: Cultural diversity can [create language barriers](https://www.theclassroom.com/the-disadvantages-of-cultural-diversity-12082787.html), resulting in groups who cannot communicate with other groups.
