Discussion Name: Should Felons be Allowed to Vote?

1. Convicted felons in the United States \(that is: sentenced of a crime punishable with at least one year in prison or death\) should permanently lose their voting rights.
1.1. Con: Felony disenfranchisement is an archaic punishment which most other developed countries have abandoned.
1.1.1. Con: Under current law, convicted prisoners serving [custodial sentences](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7461/) in the UK are stripped of their voting rights.
1.1.1.1. Con: That the US is not the only country with some forms of felony disenfranchisement does not change the fact that fewer and fewer countries practice it.
1.1.2. Pro: The United States is one of the [only](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/vote/usvot98o-04.htm) democracies in which a felon can be disenfranchised for life, or even for a long period after their sentence has been served.
1.1.2.1. Con: Any lifetime sentence would entail lifetime disenfranchisement. Thus, lifetime disenfranchisement is a possibility in any country which [disenfranchises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement#Resulting_from_criminal_conviction) felons while they serve their sentence.
1.1.2.2. Con: Where a crime has elicited a sentence of 5 years or more, ex-prisoners in Belgium are disenfranchised permanently \([p. 25](https://ifes.org/sites/default/files/08_18_03_manatt_brandon_rottinghaus.pdf)\).
1.1.2.3. Pro: The [Constitution](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/) of the State of Virginia bars anyone who has been convicted of a felony from voting unless the governor specifically restores their rights.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The [current](https://thefulcrum.us/northam-reinstates-felon-voting-rights) and [previous](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/virginia-clemency-restoration-of-rights-campaigns/549830/) governor of Virginia have both issued executive orders to restore voting rights as a matter of course.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The Virginia Supreme Court has ruled that the governor cannot restore voting rights en masse. The norm is thus the restriction of the vote from felons, even if specific governors go to extraordinary lengths to reverse it \([p. 2](https://www.eji.org/files/howell-v-mcauliffe-virginia-supreme-court-decision-07-22-16.pdf)\).
1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Pardoning by the individual action of a governor depends on the discretion of that governor. A future governor is not bound to do the same.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Arizona [permanently](https://www.acluaz.org/en/felony-disfranchisement-arizona) disenfranchises anyone convicted of multiple felonies. Only a court order or pardon can restore their voting rights.
1.1.2.5. Pro: The [Constitution](https://casetext.com/statute/kentucky-revised-statutes/title-10-elections/chapter-116-voter-registration/section-116025-eligibility-to-vote) of Kentucky permanently bars all felons from voting, unless those rights are restored by the governor.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.1.2.5.2. Con: Governor Andy Bashear has [issued an executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/kentucky-felons-voting-rights.html) that automatically restores voting rights to most felons not convicted of a violent crime.
1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: Bashear’s order only restores voting rights to about [half](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/kentucky-felons-voting-rights.html) of former felons, because it excludes those convicted of violent crimes and those convicted of federal felonies.
1.1.3. Con: The precedent of other nations is irrelevant to the morality of felony disenfranchisement, which stands or fails on its own merits.
1.1.3.1. Con: In establishing the morality or immorality of a practice, the examples of other nations can be regarded as [examples from precedent or analogy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-reas-prec/), which are regarded as defensible forms of argumentation.
1.1.3.2. Pro: If felony disenfranchisement is archaic and outdated, that should be able to be established on the same reasoning that these other nations deployed. But their example adds nothing to the weight of this reasoning either way.
1.1.4. Pro: Many countries have [altered their laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement#Resulting_from_criminal_conviction) in recent times after concluding that disenfranchisement of felons breaches human rights \([p. 1](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Prisoners_vote_ENG.pdf)\).
1.1.4.1. Pro: In 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that felon disenfranchisement [violates](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2005/681.html) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The Republic of Ireland made adjustments in its laws in recent years in order to ensure [greater access](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/33/enacted/en/print#sec1) to voting for those convicted of crimes. It decided that if it did not do so, it would be in breach of its own [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement#Ireland).
1.1.4.3. Con: The conclusion that other countries reach about their conception of rights should not impact the United States, which has its own understanding of rights, rooted in its own constitutional and legal traditions.
1.2. Pro: Removing voting rights for convicted felons reduces crime rates.
1.2.1. Pro: The prospect of permanent exclusion from conventional political participation works as a deterrent for potential criminals.
1.2.1.1. Con: For disenfranchisement to serve as a deterrent, individual criminals would have to be aware that this was a consequence. Individuals do not generally [know](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1388805?seq=1) the specific punishments entailed by specific crimes.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A majority of crimes are committed in [less educated](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=814) parts of society where individuals may not be aware of the loss of voting rights as a possible ramification.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Knowing that any felony would lead to the loss of voting rights is not the same as knowing the exact punishment associated with any specific crime because it deals with the kind of punishment used for a whole class of crimes. In this respect, it is more akin to the knowledge that many crimes lead to imprisonment.
1.2.1.2. Con: A [significant majority](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940586?seq=1) of felons show [no interest](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1) in voting, even when legally permitted to \([p. 786](http://users.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Uggen_ASR_02.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Even the low end of estimates for how many ex-felons will vote would still amount to at least one million people.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Had disenfranchised individuals been allowed to vote in the 2000 US Presidential election, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida against Republican George. W. Bush and, with it, the Presidency \([p. 792](https://images.procon.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/uggen_manza_asr_02.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Disenfranchisement appears to have no discernible effect on state‐level rates of voter turnout, suggesting that although eligible, felons [infrequently](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1) exercise their right to vote.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: Of around 67,000 ex-felons pardoned in 2016, roughly a third [registered](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/) in time to vote, even though registration required manually checking one's right to vote, pardons still being issued right up to the deadline, and that only a third of Virginia’s population voted in the [2014](https://vaperforms.virginia.gov/GovCitizens_voterRegistration.cfm) election.
1.2.1.2.4. Con: Felons are roughly as likely to have been enrolled to vote or have voted prior to incarceration as the broader population, but less likely to register to vote or vote even after they are reenfranchised in states where felon disenfranchisement is temporary \([p. 6](http://www.plagueofprisons.com/research/sentencingproject.pdf)\).
1.2.1.3. Con: The effectiveness of a deterrent depends [more on](http://nij.gov/five-things/pages/deterrence.aspx) the likelihood of being caught than on the severity of the punishment itself.
1.2.1.4. Pro: As disenfranchisement would have lifelong effects, it is a useful and additional deterrent \([p. 236](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1660&context=mlr)\), compared to other punishments which may be viewed as ‘slaps on the wrist’.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Generally, people desire to have influence over their society. Thus, the ability to exercise that influence can be used as leverage to shape behavior.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: Estimated voter turnout for felons and ex-felons ranges between 20% and 39% \([p. 786](https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\). Thus only a minority will feel alienated.
1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: Given that many presidential contests have recently been decided by only a [thin margin](https://publicintegrity.org/education/many-ex-felons-dont-know-they-can-get-their-right-to-vote-restored/), even a minority of votes could make a considerable difference to the outcome of candidate selection.
1.2.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: In the 2016 election, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all voted for Donald Trump by a margin of [well under 1%](https://interactives.ap.org/2016/general-election/?SITE=NEWSHOURELN). Even if just these three states had switched, the election would have gone to Hillary Clinton. It is thus clear that even 1% of the electorate can make a [significant difference](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-a-difference-2-percentage-points-makes/) to the outcome.
1.2.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Assuming that 40% of all currently disenfranchised felons in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would have voted if they could, and if all of them would have voted for Hillary Clinton, based on each state's disenfranchisement rate \([p. 16](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-Level-Estimates-of-Felon-Disenfranchisement-in-the-United-States-2010.pdf)\), she still would not have won any of those states.
1.2.1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.1.5.1.3. Pro: In the two states where felons can vote while in prison, very [few](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/06/prisoners-in-just-two-states-can-vote-heres-why-few-do/) do. This suggests that it is not a source of great consternation for felons.
1.2.1.5.1.4. Con: From a principled perspective, it should not matter how many people constitute the minority. It is still a wrong for the government to remove any person's vote.
1.2.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: The widespread disenfranchisement of felons has created a culture in high-crime communities that [alienates](https://philadelphianeighborhoods.com/2019/07/03/elections-voter-turnout-varies-between-wealthy-and-impoverished-neighborhoods/) voters from civic participation. The results of disenfranchisement should not be used as a justification for disenfranchisement.
1.2.1.5.1.5. Con: The estimates for felon and ex-felon voting rates at 20% to 39% are based on data sets that only go up to the year 2000 \([p. 786](https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\). They thus are not likely to provide a very good picture of present-day voting habits.
1.2.1.5.1.5.1. Con: Given that the data sets calculating turnout track voting patterns over thirty years, it is reasonable to extrapolate those habits to the present \([pp. 787-788, 799](https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\).
1.2.2. Pro: Disenfranchisement acts as a continual reminder for ex-felons that they committed a crime and should not do so again.
1.2.2.1. Con: Exclusion is a constant reminder that society treats ex-felons poorly, which may exacerbate the problems that elicited their offense initially.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Permanent exclusion from the political process creates the impression that the affected individuals, their views, and their interests do not matter.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: [Alienation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/31/alienation-causes-murder-not-gender) is a major factor which [causes](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/nyregion/intense-alienation-can-be-an-incubator-for-violence.html) people to commit crimes.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Permanent exclusion implies that no matter how repentant an individual may be or how hard they work to atone for their actions, they will never regain democratic equality.
1.2.2.2. Pro: During each election, an ex-felon would be reminded of the consequences of their illegal actions as they would be unable to participate as others do.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Compared to other punishments where the felon may more easily forget its impact - and thus be more likely to reoffend - disenfranchisement does not expire after a set period of time.
1.2.2.4. Con: Constant reminders can cause or add to traumas that result from imprisonment.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Constant reminders have the capability to cause ex-felons long-term mental distress, for example like [jail tattoos](https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/06/getting-a-tattoo-in-prison-is-a-really-bad-idea-here-are-a-few-things-you-might-not-know-6611311/) already do.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Incarceration leaves prisoners with long-term [psychological scars](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17595672/), e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder.
1.2.2.4.3. Con: The fear of re-imprisonment can act as a deterrent for potential re-offenders.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Prison has been [shown](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/five-things-about-deterrence) to be an ineffective deterrent.
1.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: The [certainty](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/deterrence-in-criminal-justice-evaluating-certainty-vs-severity-of-punishment/) of punishment has been shown to be a more effective deterrent than the severity of the punishment. The threat of repeated punishment is therefore more likely to be a deterrent than increasing the severity of the initial punishment.
1.2.3. Con: There seems to be no correlation between either the type or extent of a state's felon disenfranchisement laws \([p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\) and its recidivism rate \([p. 10](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2011/pewstateofrecidivismpdf.pdf)\).
1.2.3.1. Pro: Based on the available data, the state with the lowest recidivism rate - Oregon - has one of the most lenient disenfranchisement systems, whereas the state with the highest recidivism rate - Minnesota \([p. 10](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2011/pewstateofrecidivismpdf.pdf)\) - has one of the strictest ones \([p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\).
1.2.3.2. Con: There are a number of other factors which affect the incarceration rate: it is impossible to evaluate the comparative impact of felony disenfranchisement laws across states without also considering enforcement policies, demographics, and sentencing, among other things.
1.2.4. Con: If disenfranchisement lowered crime rates, states would have different [incarceration rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_incarceration_and_correctional_supervision_rate#Incarceration_rate_by_state) relative to their voting laws \([p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\), yet there is no clear correlation.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The state with the lowest incarceration rate - Maine - does not disenfranchise its prisoners, whereas some of the states with the highest imprisonment rates - such as Alabama, Mississippi, and Arizona - are among those that disenfranchise all former and current felons \([p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\)
1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.3. Pro: Having harmed their communities, felons should no longer be entitled to the benefits associated with voting.
1.3.1. Con: A wide range of crimes are [classified](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/what-is-a-felony.html) as felonies, many of which can hardly be seen as having harmed society at large.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Consensual sex between an adult barely over the age of consent and a minor barely under the [age of consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States) would usually be treated as [statutory rape](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/sex-crimes/statutory-rape-charges-punishment-defense) and a felony. However, it would be odd to claim that society at large is harmed.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Confusion over convictions for statutory rape can lead to an individual being permanently placed on the [sex offenders register](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/sex-crimes/statutory-rape-charges-punishment-defense).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Disobeying laws can be an act of political engagement and can protect society from unjust laws. Those committing such 'crimes' should be able to assist in refining the law to make it more just.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: For the political act of downloading thousands of scientific articles with the intent to distribute them freely, Aaron Schwartz was [charged with numerous felonies](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jstor-and-the-case-of-the-over-downloader).
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: One can violate the law for reasons of activism, or as a matter of civil disobedience, or the law may simply be wrong.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: The US uses [felony riot charges](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a54391/how-the-government-is-turning-protesters-into-felons/) to criminalize political protest. This should not become the basis for permanent disenfranchisement.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Most Americans disagree with the US' marijuana laws, yet possession remains a [felony](https://www.drugtreatment.com/expose/marijuana-felony-amounts-by-state/) in many states, and therefore can form the basis for disenfranchisement. These [disenfranchisements](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/marijuana-legalization-cant-erase-decades-of-disenfranchisement-and-incarceration) will not necessarily end, even if America's drug laws change.
1.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Those who served felony sentences in Colorado for past crimes related to [marijuana](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/altered_state/2014/09/colorado_marijuana_convictions_now_that_weed_is_legal_what_happens_to_former.html) possession should be allowed to vote, since marijuana is now legal.
1.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: After the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment and reconstruction, [Black codes](https://www.aclu.org/blog/voting-rights/racist-roots-denying-incarcerated-people-their-right-vote) \(in the form of so-called "[Jim Crow laws](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/black-codes)"\) were enacted to end Black political power. These codes used vaguely constructed and arbitrarily enforced laws such as vagrancy laws to criminalize and disenfranchise Black voters.
1.3.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Under Black Codes, fabricated biological differences between white Americans and Black Americans could be used to legitimize a Black individual's incarceration in a [mental institution](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/1866-texas-black-codes/) by claiming that they suffered from racially specific mental illnesses \([p. 65](https://hshm.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Wingerson%2C%20Mary%20-%20Senior%20Project.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: While they were in effect, the Mississippi Black Codes cited a long list of unspecific misdemeanors under [penal laws](http://web.mit.edu/21h.102/www/Primary%20source%20collections/Reconstruction/Black%20codes.htm) for which, if broken, Black individuals could be fined and/or imprisoned.
1.3.1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: A black individual could be deemed a [vagrant](https://www.britannica.com/topic/black-code) if they were unemployed and without permanent residence, whilst other laws also severely restricted their freedom to practice an [occupation](https://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/southern-black-codes.html) or own [property](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/black-codes).
1.3.1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Under the Mississippi Black Codes, anyone seen to be promoting any form of propaganda for [racial equality](https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/links/misclink/examples.htm) could have been legally punished.
1.3.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Marriage between a white person and a Black person - even to the to the fourth generation \([1/8th](https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/links/misclink/examples.htm) part\) - was prohibited in many states, and individuals could be punished for violating the law. The “crime” was typically classified as a [felony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States).
1.3.1.2.2.3.4. Con: As unjust as Jim Crow laws were, they did not comprise the whole of the criminal legal system even in segregated states. It is possible to grant the appalling unfairness of Jim Crow laws while still maintaining that the enforcement of other aspects of the criminal legal system might warrant disenfranchisement.
1.3.1.2.2.3.5. Con: Jim Crow laws have been unconstitutional for decades. However unjust they may have been historically, it has little relationship to the present practice of felony disengagement.
1.3.1.2.2.4. Con: Repeated acts of civil disobedience are likely to lead to repression and backlash rather than any meaningful change \([p. 124](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&context=respublica)\).
1.3.1.2.2.4.1. Con: Civil disobedience does not need to be effective in order to be morally valuable and worth defending.
1.3.1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: Even if civil disobedience does not enact change, it can be an important tool for allowing citizens to make their [voices](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/civil-disobedience-sanchez-gordillo) heard and for those in authority to be aware of how the public feels in regard to particular issues.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: Committing a felony is hardly an expression of political engagement as it represents a serious crime.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: The cut-off point for a crime to be a felony is that it carries a potential penalty of [more than one year](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-law-basics/what-distinguishes-a-misdemeanor-from-a-felony.html). Many crimes that can be political protest - such as [vandalism](https://wimmercriminaldefense.com/when-does-vandalism-become-a-felony/), in many states - can be felonies.
1.3.1.2.4. Pro: Whistleblowers intentionally break the law in order to achieve transparency and improve society.
1.3.1.2.4.1. Pro: Journalists and bloggers can be prosecuted for publishing classified content or refusing to reveal [their sources](http://people.howstuffworks.com/freedom-of-the-press.htm) \([p. 458](https://www.law.upenn.edu/institutes/cerl/conferences/ethicsofsecrecy/papers/reading/Silver.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2.4.2. Con: Whistleblowers are usually not breaking the law. In fact, most countries have statutes protecting them from the consequences of any contractual breaches involved \([pp. 8-9](https://piskamfauly.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FINAL__-Whistleblower-Protection-Laws-in-G20-Countries-Priorities-for__-Action.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2.5. Con: Most felonies are not motivated by the desire to engage politically.
1.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: Identity fraud is a consitently prevalent [felony](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-identity-theft-and-cybercrime), yet its motives are largely personal and financial \([p. 102](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/210459.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2.5.2. Pro: [Larceny](https://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/what-are-the-most-common-crimes-in-the-united-states/) is the most prevalent crime in many places, yet its motives are not usually political.
1.3.1.2.5.3. Con: [Civil disobedience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-disobedience/) - intentionally breaking a law believed to be unjust - is a valuable and important method of protest.
1.3.1.2.5.3.1. Pro: [Rosa Parks](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/rosa-parks) famously broke the law when she deliberately and publicly disregarded segregation rules. In doing so, she helped initiate the [Civil Rights Movement](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/civil-rights-movement).
1.3.1.2.5.3.2. Con: The way to support the principle of civil disobedience is to refuse to punish acts of civil disobedience at all, not classifying those who practice it as felons in the first place.
1.3.1.2.5.3.3. Pro: [Susan B. Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony), [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.), and [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) all openly broke laws, defied governmental authority, and were imprisoned. Their crimes were in service to society, not against it.
1.3.1.2.5.3.4. Pro: Certain [animal rights activists](http://www.nature.com/news/animal-rights-activists-wreak-havoc-in-milan-laboratory-1.12847) broke the law by breaking into a laboratory in Milan and releasing the animals. This was a political act of civil disobedience, and as such a valuable contribution to democratic debate.
1.3.1.2.5.4. Con: The fact that most felonies are not motivated by political concerns is not a reason to dismiss the concern that some may well be acts of political engagement, and that it is therefore concerning to disenfranchise those engaged in them.
1.3.1.3. Con: It may be that some crimes are improperly classified as felonies, but in that case the proper remedy is to reclassify those specific crimes.
1.3.1.4. Con: Breaking the law shows disrespect to all of society, as opposed to an individual.
1.3.1.5. Con: Laws are how society shapes the behavior that it considers so harmful as to be prohibited. Therefore, violating the law means committing acts society especially condemns.
1.3.1.6. Pro: The elderly individual who consumes cannabis in order to ease the pain of a [medical condition](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pensioner-cannabis-plants-grow-kidney-failure-cbd-oil-cornwall-a9332206.html) may be committing a felony without doing any harm to anyone else.
1.3.2. Pro: Incarceration prevents felons from causing future harm to society by [restricting their liberty](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/crime-prevention-criminal-justice/module-7/key-issues/2--justifying-punishment-in-the-community.html). Restricting voting privileges is a natural extension of this.
1.3.2.1. Con: While restrictions to the liberty of a felon may be necessary to prevent future harm, restricting voting privileges does not serve to prevent any harm.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The state is justified in restricting the liberty of felons as a form of self-defense. By restricting the voting rights of felons, the state preserves its capacity to engage in self-defense.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: A [self-defense argument](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-law-basics/self-defense-overview.html) only works if there is some imminent mortal danger. There is no reason to think that felons voting would pose such a threat.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Restricting voting rights would prevent felons from furthering policies that may be of benefit to them individually, but that may disadvantage other members of society or society at large.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Felons presumably have a vested interest in easing the punitive measures used to fight crime, since they have been harmed by them.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Felons would presumably have an interest in changing [firearm](https://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/chart-1-loss-and-restoration-of-civil-rights-and-firearms-privileges/) laws that affect felons.
1.3.3. Con: Voting is not just a benefit; it is the [political duty](https://www.brookings.edu/research/lift-every-voice-the-urgency-of-universal-civic-duty-voting/) of a citizen in a democracy. Excluding ex-felons from participating in this duty therefore further exacerbates the harm to society caused by the crime.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Many democratic theorists ascribe certain civic virtues to the model citizen. Insofar as it is the mechanism by which the people share the difficulties of governance, voting is [often regarded](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/civic-virtue-and-why-it-matters) as such a civic virtue.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Insofar as democracy depends upon broad political participation, non-voters essentially function as [free riders​](https://medium.com/\@jasonfbell_/voting-the-free-rider-problem-or-the-tragedy-of-the-commons-fdc920ba406b) who derive the benefits of democratic governance without putting in the work to keep democracy functioning.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: The free rider theory of voter participation only works if the benefits of living in a democracy are more or less evenly distributed. In fact, those who participate in voting are more likely to see laws passed that benefit them than those who do not vote.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: States with higher levels of turnout among poorer voters tend to have more generous social benefit programs. This suggests a connection between overall rates of voter participation and the enactment of policies favorable to a particular group \([p. 11](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1096&context=ukcpr_papers)\).
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Historically, the expansion of the franchise has been associated with the enactment of policies that benefit a broader segment of the population. This implies that groups that participate in voting in larger numbers are more likely to have policies favorable to them enacted \([pp. 10-11](http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Why%20Voting%20Matters-%20Large%20disparities%20in%20turnout%20benefit%20the%20donor%20class.pdf)\).
1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: Recent studies have demonstrated dramatically [different policy preferences](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/why-non-voters-matter/405250/) between the general public and the voting public. This is a major barrier to the enactment of policies that favor non-voters.
1.3.3.2.1.4. Con: No one individual’s vote makes much of a difference in most elections. In fact, the likelihood that any one person’s vote will be decisive in a presidential election is one in 60 million \([p. 321](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf)\).
1.3.3.2.1.4.1. Con: To generalize \(from the fact that any one individual vote is highly unlikely to be decisive to the claim that voting in general doesn’t matter\) is to commit the [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition). Individuals' votes are [understood](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/) to belong to blocks of votes, and these blocks are taken seriously by the statisticians who parse the significance of elections.
1.3.3.2.1.5. Con: The influence of donors on policy likely eclipses the influence of even demographic groups with high voter participation \([p. 118](https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1928&context=faculty_publications)\).
1.3.3.3. Con: The idea that voting is a duty depends upon a theory of civic republicanism that is [at odds with](https://prospect.org/culture/from-virtue-signaling-to-politics/) the reality of [transactional politics](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/george_will_590347) in contemporary democracies.
1.3.4. Pro: Crime harms communities, and there needs to be an adequate response to those harms. Felony disenfranchisement can be an important part of that response.
1.3.4.1. Pro: There is a high social [cost](https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/social-costs-alcohol-and-drug-abuse) to drug addiction. Thus, drug-related offense can be regarded as harming society as a whole.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: While it may be true that there is a high cost to drug addiction, the social costs are calculated for society as a whole. To apportion a particular fraction of that to any particular set of crimes is to commit the fallacy of [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_division).
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: In 2007, it is estimated that illicit drug use cost the US economy over $193 billion \([p. 1](https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs44/44849/44849p.pdf)\).
1.3.4.2. Con: To the extent possible, the consequences that felons receive should be [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(law\)) to the harm done. Disenfranchisement is not proportional.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Life-long disenfranchisement would be a disproportional punishment for non-violent felonies such as, for example, [fraud, computer hacking, or perjury](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/what-is-a-felony.html) which, while serious, are not likely to have significant life-long effects on their victims.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: The length of imprisonment for felonies varies from one year to life, yet felony disenfranchisement would impose the same penalty in all cases. Applying the same voting penalty to such a range of sentences demonstrates that the punishment is not [proportionate](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/vote/usvot98o-03.htm).
1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: Permanent disenfranchisement for all ex-felons would apply the same blanket punishment to a very diverse set of crimes, with no regard for mitigating factors.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: The loss of the right to vote involves less suffering than physical harm or confinement. The concern over proportionality in this instance is therefore less pressing.
1.3.4.2.4. Con: Insofar as it involves the loss of only one right, felony disenfranchisement should not be regarded as a disproportionate punishment.
1.3.4.2.5. Pro: The [Eighth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment) of the United States Constitution prohibits excessive punishment that is incommensurate with the offense. A lifelong punishment for one felony fits this description.
1.3.4.2.5.1. Con: Lifelong punishment for one felony is legal and common.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: Convictions for even [minor felonies](https://www.virgalawfirm.com/news/misdemeanor-gun-ban/) can lead to lifetime restrictions on gun ownership.
1.3.4.2.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.4.2.5.2. Con: The Eighth Amendment's [phrasing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment) prohibits excessiveness only in relation to fines; in relation to punishments it only prohibits them from being "cruel and unusual". Excessive punishments are thus not prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.
1.3.4.2.5.2.1. Pro: Given that the United States does not find constitutional fault with the death penalty as a [cruel and unusual punishment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty), it seems implausible that disenfranchisement would be considered excessive.
1.3.4.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Part of what determines whether a punishment is cruel and unusual or not is whether it is [excessive or disproportionate](https://lawshelf.com/coursewarecontentview/protection-from-cruel-and-unusual-punishment/) to the crime. The death penalty is reserved for the most heinous crimes for this reason. In contrast, the proposal here is to include disenfranchisement as part of the punishment for any felony.
1.3.4.2.5.2.2. Pro: The Supreme Court [linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment#United_States) the application of the "cruel and unusual" clause to violations of human dignity. The withdrawal of voting rights does not fit this definition.
1.3.4.2.5.2.2.1. Con: The United Nations [Human Rights Committee](https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2020/06/23/the-right-to-vote-is-a-badge-of-dignity-and-personhood-column/) has labeled felony disenfranchisement to be an affront to human dignity.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The nature of a civilised society ruled by laws is such that when one breaks those laws to harm an individual, one is undermining the principles that society is founded on and thus harming society as a whole.
1.3.4.4. Pro: According to the [broken windows theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/broken-windows-theory), even relatively small crimes like spraying graffiti or vandalism have the potential to cause a self-energizing spiral of crime. In such spirals, whole neighborhoods deteriorate, with negative consequences for all community members.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: There is little [evidence](https://phys.org/news/2019-05-evidence-broken-windows-theory-neighborhood.html) to support the broken windows theory of crime.
1.3.4.5. Pro: Violating the law entails detrimental costs to society.
1.3.4.5.1. Con: There is no connection between the financial cost of crime and the punishment that criminals face. There is thus no reason to make the decision whether or not to disenfranchise ex-felons on the basis of considerations of cost.
1.3.4.5.1.1. Pro: Tax avoidance in the US is legal \([p. 7](https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=honorscollege_accounting)\) yet causes great societal [costs](https://www.taxjustice.net/topics/more/estimates-of-tax-avoidance-and-evasion/).
1.3.4.5.1.2. Pro: Some drug offenses cost society almost nothing. Nonetheless, offenders can be incarcerated for decades. This means that it is far [costlier](https://theconversation.com/history-not-harm-dictates-why-some-drugs-are-legal-and-others-arent-110564) to imprison many drug offenders than to not imprison them. The fact that we imprison them anyway suggests that cost considerations are not policy rationale for our system of punishment.
1.3.4.5.1.3. Con: Even if there is no connection presently between the cost of crime and the punishments that we use, it does not follow that there should be no connection. To assert that there should be is to commit the [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy).
1.3.4.5.2. Pro: In 2007, criminal offenses in the US resulted in approximately $15bn in economic losses to victims and $179bn in government expenditures on police protection, judicial and legal activities, and corrections \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835847/pdf/nihms170575.pdf)\).
1.3.4.5.3. Pro: Between 1987-90, crimes committed against persons and households in the US generated medical and mental health costs of $18bn and property damage and loss - as well as productivity loss - of $87bn \([p. 10](https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/costcrime.pdf)\).
1.3.4.5.4. Pro: Crime in communities depresses house values, resulting in lost property tax revenue \([p. 11](https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/costcrime.pdf)\).
1.4. Con: The practice of felony disenfranchisement has its roots in America’s history of racism, and it continues to disproportionately impact people of color.
1.4.1. Pro: Felony disenfranchisement disproportionately affects minorities. It prevents them from taking part in the political process and from advocating for their interests.
1.4.1.1. Pro: During America's 2012 and 2016 Presidential elections, about [nine out of ten](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/first-exit-polls-2016/) African-American voters opted for the Democrats. But the impact of this overwhelming support is diluted by the fact that African-Americans are disenfranchised at significantly higher rates than other racial groups.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Black Americans are disenfranchised at [four times](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/08/20/jim-crow-s-lasting-legacy-at-the-ballot-box) the rate of all other ethnic minorities combined.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: The fact that felony disenfranchisement laws may impact one political party is only an injustice if that party is entitled to those votes in the first place.
1.4.1.2. Con: The disproportionate effect on minorities is not a problem that stems exclusively from felony laws but also from [racial bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-crime-and-justice-doctor/201811/implicit-bias-within-the-criminal-justice-system) in the justice system.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Even if minorities are convicted of crimes at a higher rate, to the extent that this results in disproportionate minority disenfranchisement, it still creates an unjust outcome that could be solved by universal felon enfranchisement.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Despite comparable rates of drug usage, Black individuals are [almost 4 times](https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers) more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than their white counterparts.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: Racial bias in drug arrests becomes further exposed in certain states. In Iowa, for example, the ratio of marijuana-related arrests of Black people compared to white people jumps to [over 8 to 1](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/iowa-ranks-worst-nation-racial-disparities-marijuana-arrests), despite similar levels of cannabis usage amongst the two groups.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: Regardless of whether the cause is judicial racism or legislative racism - or a combination of the two - the effect is the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities. This is a serious enough consequence to justify abandoning felon disenfranchisement laws, regardless of the cause.
1.4.1.2.4. Pro: As of 2010, about one in three \(33%\) African-Americans in the United States is an ex-felon \([p. 11](https://paa2011.princeton.edu/papers/111687)\). This is compared to the 8.6% share of ex-felons in the American population as a whole.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Disenfranchising minorities who commit crimes may lead to the persistence and creation of unjust laws that lead to more criminal convictions for minorities. [Historically](http://felonvoting.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineID=000016), there has been an expansion of crimes that lead to felon disenfranchisement.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.3.
1.4.1.4. Pro: In [New York](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/muntaqim.html), prisons are generally located in rural, predominantly white, areas. This enhances the voting strength of white communities, as the state calculates inmates as part of the population base, even though they cannot vote.
1.4.2. Pro: Those in power can write unfair laws which deliberately work to disenfranchise any minority groups who might oppose them.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The US is already making it harder for minority communities to [access their vote](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/is-america-a-democracy-if-so-why-does-it-deny-millions-the-vote).
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The North Carolina Republican party branch actually [celebrated](http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/7/13552832/north-carolina-republicans-black-turnout) the disproportionate effects of their voting changes on African-American turnout in the 2016 election.
1.4.2.2. Con: It is unlikely that felon disenfranchisement would affect a sufficient number of individuals to make as significant a difference to voting outcomes as this claim implies.
1.4.2.3. Pro: For example, by implementing mandatory minimums for drug crimes which disproportionately affect African Americans, Republicans could permanently disenfranchise a group which [statistically](https://blackdemographics.com/culture/black-politics/) votes for Democrats \(or vice versa\).
1.4.3. Pro: African-American men are disproportionately affected by disenfranchisement \([p. 85](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381290?seq=1)\).
1.4.3.1. Pro: [38%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/31/felon-voting-rights-impact-on-elections) of all those who already have been stopped from voting by felon restrictions are black, even though African-Americans make up only [13%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans) of the American population.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Only 2.5% of the voting age population were made ineligible to vote by felon voting laws in 2010. That [percentage tripled](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/31/felon-voting-rights-impact-on-elections) to 7.7% among African-Americans.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.4.3.4. Con: The reason why African-American men are disproportionately affected by disenfranchisement is that they are disproportionately impacted by felony convictions. The solution to this is to end racist conviction patterns, not to end felony disenfranchisement.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: African-American men are [arrested](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/) at disproportionately high rates. Once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted, and once convicted they are more likely to serve longer prison sentences.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: Saying that the solution is to end racist conviction patterns, not felony disenfranchisement is a [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma). It is possible \(and most likely desirable\) to end both.
1.4.4. Pro: The [current disenfranchisement practices](https://www.aclu.org/blog/voting-rights/racist-roots-denying-incarcerated-people-their-right-vote) in the Unites States have their origins in the efforts of southern lawmakers to disempower the black electorate.
1.4.4.1. Con: Even if the roots of felony disenfranchisement are racist, it does not follow from this that the current practice of felony disenfranchisement is also racist.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: To infer the current properties of an institution or practice from its historical properties is to commit the [genetic fallacy.​](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy)
1.4.4.2. Pro: When Virginia introduced felon disenfranchisement provisions in its 1902 Constitution, politicians in favour [explicitly campaigned](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/virginia-felon-disenfranchisement/480072/) on its benefits as a means of disenfranchising black voters.
1.4.4.3. Pro: At the time of passing, Alabama's disenfranchisement provision estimtated that “the crime of wife-beating alone would disqualify sixty percent of the Negroes" \([p. 3](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Felony-Disenfranchisement-Primer.pdf)\). The law took the vote away from those convicted of that crime - but not away from those convicted of murder.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Alabama’s disenfranchisement laws are just one example of a pattern followed in several states - of tailoring felony disenfranchisement laws to those crimes believed to be committed more frequently by black people than white people \([p. 3](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Felony-Disenfranchisement-Primer.pdf)\).
1.4.5. Con: Laws that are de facto discriminatory \(i.e. race-neutral on their face, but administered, enforced, or applied prejudicially\) [violate](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html) the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, any laws which are used to target specific racial groups are already unconstitutional.
1.4.5.1. Pro: In [Yick Wo v. Hopkins](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/), San Francisco enacted a law banning laundry facilities in wooden buildings. While race-neutral on face, this law was designed to target Chinese people, who owned most of the wooden laundries in San Francisco. Consequently, the Supreme Court held that it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1.4.5.2. Pro: New York City's stop and frisk tactics \(used as a policing technique in [other](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2015/03/02/stop-and-frisk-in-4-cities-the-importance-of-open-police-data-2/) states and municipalities also\) have been [ruled](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/stop-and-frisk_tactics_by_new_york_cops_violated_fourth_and_14th_amendments) to violate the Fourteeth Amendment because they were applied in racially discriminatory ways even when the wording of the law was race-neutral.
1.4.5.3. Con: While de facto discrimination is technically unconstitutional, that does not appear to have stopped legislatures from continuing to adopt laws with racially-determined effects.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: The United States' [crack cocaine laws](https://mic.com/articles/42871/fair-sentencing-act-are-crack-cocaine-laws-intentionally-racist#.yqCmunFsl) are racially discriminatory in their application, but it took decades to establish this.
1.5. Con: Felony disenfranchisement violates the democratic principle of equality.
1.5.1. Pro: Felony disenfranchisement disrupts electoral processes, thereby undermining their legitimacy.
1.5.1.1. Con: As the US currently faces far [greater threats](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trump-represents-a-bigger-threat-than-ever-to-us-democracy) to the democratic process than disenfranchisement, it seems unreasonable to oppose it on that basis.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Current President, Donald Trump's [attacks](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/16/trumps-attacks-on-the-press-are-illegal-were-suing-221312) on, and threats against, various media sources are in violation of the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_the_United_States).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The American people have a right to assemble and protest peacefully, and to [petition their government](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trump-represents-a-bigger-threat-than-ever-to-us-democracy) to address grievances. Recent attempts by the current administration to silence [Black Lives Matter protests](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/trump-attacks-black-lives-matter-racial-justice-movement.html) violates this.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: The presence of other threats to the democratic process does not detract from the severity of disenfranchisement.
1.5.1.1.4. Pro: The American public is [already highly misinformed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413001522). Taking away felons' voting rights would thus have little to no effect on political realities.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Felony disenfranchisement turns the carceral system into a political tool.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Given that, on average, three out of four felons and ex-felons vote for the Democratic Party \([p. 793](https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\), disenfranchisement would drastically affect voting outcomes.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: In Florida, about a tenth of all potential voters are disenfranchised felons. In six other American states, this share is above 7% \([p. 16](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-Level-Estimates-of-Felon-Disenfranchisement-in-the-United-States-2010.pdf)\).
1.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: In communities where there is a high proportion of ex-felons, non-felons are likely to also be socialised into not voting. This [distorts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00640.x/abstract) electoral outcomes against these communities.
1.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: Studies indicate that parents' [voting turnout](http://prq.sagepub.com/content/69/2/373.abstract) and [political activity](https://www.thecut.com/2017/04/what-shapes-your-political-beliefs-at-18-35-and-50.html) influence children's turnout and political activity. The disenfranchisement of felons would thus socialize their offspring into political inactivity.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: Even if felony disenfranchisement has a political effect, it does not follow from that that it is a political tool. The effect may be incidental to the primary purpose of disenfranchisement.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: Whatever the stated rationale for felony disenfranchisement, it is hard to imagine that it will not be used for political purposes if it has a political effect.
1.5.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Even after Florida passed a law ending permanent felony disenfranchisement, Florida [legislators](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/05/24/federal-judge-strikes-down-restrictions-on-florida-felon-voting-1286097) worked to minimize the law's effects on political grounds.
1.5.1.2.4. Con: There is no scholarly consensus as to whether felony disenfranchisement has a substantial political impact \([p. 45](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/morse/files/iowa.pdf)\).
1.5.1.2.5. Pro: The larger the nominal [selectorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory) needed to maintain power, the more those in power will allocate resources for public - as opposed to private - benefit. Removing felons’ voting rights decreases the size of the electorate, benefitting specialised interest over general public welfare.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Felon disenfranchisement means lower voter participation, less democratic legitimization of political decisions and nominees, and less identification and solidarity with the government among the citizens.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: Like felons, [non-citizen residents](https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote) are not allowed to vote but are a part of society and are affected by electoral outcomes. This does not mean that political decisions are illegitimate, only that a smaller portion of residents \(i.e. citizens\) have the privilege of participating in the political system.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: In most countries, non-citizen residents have pathways to citizenship, if they are willing to take on the obligations of being a citizen. Felons do not have this option when they are denied a right to vote.
1.5.1.3.1.2. Con: Non-citizen residents are often substantially more free to leave and move elsewhere than felons, as they have citizenship in at least one other country and do not have a conviction limiting their ability to get residency visas.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Freedom of movement means that non-citizens can more meaningfully consent to be governed without representation, as they can usually return to their home countries - where they can participate in political processes - if that matters to them.
1.5.1.3.1.3. Pro: It is the norm [globally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_foreigners_to_vote) for non-citizens not to have the right to vote. This is not generally regarded as making the political system illegitimate.
1.5.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.5.1.3.3. Pro: Voter turnout in US elections is already [lower than](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) those of other countries. Disenfranchising felons only exacerbates this problem.
1.5.1.3.3.1. Pro: Whatever the cause, low voter participation means that elections can be decided by only a fraction of the population. This challenges the legitimacy of a legal system that purports to be democratic.
1.5.1.3.4. Pro: As of 2010, about 20 million Americans were either current felons or ex-felons \([p. 12](https://paa2011.princeton.edu/papers/111687)\). As a share of the [235 million](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/00) citizens who were over 18, the population of Americans who are eligible to vote would shrink by 8.5% if all felons lost their right to do so permanently.
1.5.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.5.1.3.5. Pro: The exclusion of convicts makes the electorate less reflective of society overall, which will lead to public policy that does not serve the needs of all citizens equally.
1.5.1.3.5.1. Pro: Felons are uniquely affected by government regulation and are therefore especially in need of a voice in that process.
1.5.1.3.5.1.1. Con: Allowing felons to vote would allow them a voice in all law-making processes, not merely the ones that would benefit their own causes.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Felons understand the prison system and its impact on people better than non-felons. By allowing them to vote, we can encourage better and more realistic laws and policies regarding incarceration.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1. Con: There is little reason to assume that felons would improve the prison system in a way that best serves society's general interests - especially after they have already shown a disregard for society's norms and rules.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.1. Con: The possibility of bias is not a justification for disregarding the opinion of felons entirely. We frequently consider the views of biased individuals when implementing policy.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, we would expect minorities to give input on policies that directly affect them even though those opinions are likely to be biased in some way.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: The most probable assumption is that felons would improve the prison system according to their own interests, better conditions in jail, no cellular imprisonment, etc., in order to mitigate the punishment they received.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1. Con: By participating in the voting process, felons can also provide useful information on the sometimes [degrading conditions](https://www.aclu.org/issues/prisoners-rights/cruel-inhuman-and-degrading-conditions) within those prisons. They can provide a unique perspective that others who do not themselves experience it never could.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Felons have other opportunities to make their voices heard.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Civil society organizations](https://medium.com/\@alyadjunas19/role-of-civil-society-in-promoting-political-change-in-a-democratic-direction-192929ff94a) and advocacy campaigns provide alternative ways for felons to have their voices be heard.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: These organisation and campaigns will be viewed as less important when the government says that the people within them are unworthy of a political voice.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1.1.3. Con: These methods of democratic participation require significantly more time than voting does, making them less accessible - and often less effective.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.3. Con: Better prison conditions improve results, as lower recidivism rates in [Nordic countries](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12) show.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.2. Con: There is little reason to assume that felons know how to improve the prison system better than corrections officers, researchers and police officials. By the same logic, patients would be assumed to know how to reform hospitals.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: In the context of the prison system, the goals of felons are most likely different from the goals of society at large. The former have an interest in making their sentences more bearable and comfortable; the latter not necessarily.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.2.2. Con: The point of including prisoners in the process is not to do it to the exclusion of correction officers and other expert voices. It is to canvas opinions from all who are affected in order to make the prison system function as well as possible.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.2.3. Con: We would and do expect patients to also weigh in on the best way to reform hospitals.
1.5.1.3.5.1.2.3. Pro: The state is taking on responsibility for prisoners, in that the prisoners' lives are in the government's control. Letting felons vote allows better democratic oversight over people whose lives are the responsibility of the government.
1.5.1.3.5.1.3. Pro: Convicts may be in prison because they intentionally broke a law they did not agree with. Allowing them a voice in the political process allows them to attempt to change such laws.
1.5.1.3.5.1.3.1. Pro: One of the components of a crime is [mens rea](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mens_rea) or criminal intent. That is, a convicted criminal is, by definition, found to have knowingly chosen to break the law.
1.5.1.3.5.1.3.2. Con: There is no necessary connection between breaking a law and disagreeing with the justice of that law. In the absence of direct evidence that felons are breaking a law as a way of protesting it’s injustice, there is no reason to assume there is any connection.
1.5.1.3.5.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.5.3.
1.5.1.3.5.1.3.4. Pro: Just because someone does not agree with society's values does not mean he/she should be excluded from the democratic process. After all, that would be undemocratic in its own right.
1.5.1.3.5.1.3.4.1. Pro: The entire premise of democracy is the consideration of all values and voices Those who disagree with those currently codified rules should still have a say.
1.5.1.3.5.2. Con: Public policy can sometimes be motivated by benign [paternalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/#PureVsImpuPate) - that is, the state can enact public policy with the interest of groups who are excluded or incapable of political participation in mind. Thus, it does not necessarily follow that the exclusion of ex-felons from voting necessarily means their needs will not be served.
1.5.1.3.5.3. Pro: Assuming criminal behavior is caused partly by social circumstances, disenfranchising criminals would deny criminals the ability to influence policy that might improve those circumstances and thereby reduce crime.
1.5.1.3.5.3.1. Pro: The decisions made through voting processes affect all American citizens, including felons. They have a right to participate in decisions that affect them.
1.5.1.3.5.3.2. Con: By blaming society for their actions, criminals shirk [accountability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2015/06/12/6-words-for-stopping-blame-and-increasing-accountability/#70e6b21d57c3) for the decisions they have made and actions they have taken.
1.5.1.3.5.3.3. Pro: It is unfair to expect someone to play by the rules, whilst simultaneously taking away their ability to change them.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4. Pro: If a law is unjust, denying convicts the right to engage democratically to change that law will prolong its existence, thus prolonging and compounding the injustice.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4.2. Con: Relying on the firsthand experience of criminals to identify problems with an unjust criminal justice system is by definition after the fact. It would be preferable to identify and remedy those problems in advance of people serving lengthy prison sentences.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4.2.1. Con: While a remedy after the fact is inferior to solving a problem in advance, it is still preferable to not solving it at all.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4.3. Con: Relying on the democratic engagement of convicts to change unjust laws will not reliably distinguish unjust just laws from just laws.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4.3.1. Pro: The experience of punishment is equally onerous to the one punished irrespective of whether the punishment is just or unjust. There is thus no reason to think that the experience of ex-felons will be of much use in identifying which are unjust.
1.5.1.3.5.3.4.4. Pro: People unjustly hurt by laws would also lose the right to vote for candidates that could help change unjust laws.
1.5.1.4. Con: By virtue of having committed a serious crime, felons put themselves into a position where society can no longer trust their judgement. This lack of trust in the judgement of the felon also justifies disenfranchising them, just as the state bars other citizens judged to be incompetent from voting.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: Similar arguments have been used to deny the vote to women, ethnic minorities, and the poor throughout history: decisions later deemed to be unethical.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: As felons lose their vote because of their actions rather than their invariant characteristics, their disenfranchisement is more ethical than that of other groups.
1.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: In the nineteenth century, black people were not deemed [intelligent enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_African_Americans#Intelligence) to be given the vote.
1.5.1.4.1.3. Pro: American women were historically believed to be childlike and incapable of [independent thought](https://www.tolerance.org/sites/default/files/general/women_couldnt_vote\[1\].pdf).
1.5.1.4.2. Con: Felons' votes are not numerous enough to derail the political process as a whole, given they are substantially outnumbered by other voters.
1.5.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.4.
1.5.1.4.2.3. Pro: Only about 2.5% of potential voters are currently disenfranchised due to a felony conviction \([p. 1](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-Level-Estimates-of-Felon-Disenfranchisement-in-the-United-States-2010.pdf)\). Given that their turnout if they could vote is estimated at between 20% and 39%, it is difficult to imagine that those currently disenfranchised would make a significant difference in the vast majority of elections \([p. 786](http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\).
1.5.1.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.1.1.1.
1.5.1.4.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.5.1.4.3. Pro: In the same vein, most felons are [not allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968) to buy guns - since 1968 - and are, for this purpose, put on a level with people found mentally incompetent and immature.
1.5.1.4.3.1. Con: In practice, it is quite [easy](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/felons-finding-it-easy-to-regain-gun-rights.html) for former felons to have their gun rights restored.
1.5.1.4.4. Con: Good judgment is not a requirement we generally impose upon voting.
1.5.1.4.4.1. Con: The assumption underlying a minimum voting age is that citizens beneath it lack the maturity to make good elective decisions.
1.5.1.4.4.1.1. Con: The minimum voting age is meant to ensure that voters are capable of making an informed decision. There is no reason why a felon would not be able to do so.
1.5.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Minimum age requirements are, by definition, not a mechanism of permanent exclusion \(as would be the case with permanent disenfranchisement\).
1.5.1.4.4.2. Con: The mentally ill are affected by laws restricting their voting rights in around 40 states \([p. 1](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/116625/belt_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)\).
1.5.1.4.4.2.1. Con: Laws restricting the voting rights of the mentally ill almost exclusively apply to those declared mentally incompetent and unable to make an informed decision at the ballot box - for example, because of a significantly [impaired ability](https://www.cga.ct.gov/PS98/rpt%5Colr%5Chtm/98-R-1138.htm) to understand their actions or the world around them.
1.5.1.4.4.3. Pro: If felons are considered incompetent to vote, they should also not be trusted with buying alcohol, driving cars, and raising children, yet this is not the case.
1.5.1.4.4.3.1. Con: There are degrees of immaturity. It is entirely possible for someone to lack the maturity for one task, but not another.
1.5.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Whereas an individual vote is highly unlikely to have any significant effect, a poor judgement in dealing with alcohol, cars, and children can have potentially catastrophic consequences for other peoples' lives.
1.5.1.4.4.3.3. Con: There is no equivalence between voting rights and restrictions designed to protect the health and safety of others.
1.5.1.4.4.4. Pro: Citizens are allowed to vote on any basis they choose. Even if they are completely uninformed and flip a coin to decide how to vote, society still allows them to make that democratic choice.
1.5.1.4.4.5. Pro: Plenty of other citizens exercise obviously bad judgment and regret it - for example by blowing their life savings on the lottery - yet retain their right to vote.
1.5.1.4.4.6. Pro: That a person supposedly exhibited poor judgment in one particular instance is not evidence that all of their actions are the result of poor judgment or that they lack a general incapacity to make good decisions.
1.5.1.4.5. Pro: One of the main goals of punishment is to protect society. Just as we incapacitate dangerous individuals, so too we have to protect society from the judgement of criminals that the state deems untrustworthy.
1.5.1.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.5.1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.4.4.6.
1.5.2. Pro: Disenfranchisement is arbitrarily applied \([p. 2](http://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\).
1.5.2.1. Pro: As there is no [federal law](https://www.commoncause.org/page/zero-disenfranchisement/) on felony disenfranchisement, each state has its own version.
1.5.2.2. Pro: As of 2004, only the disenfranchisement of inmates was supported by a majority of Americans \([p. 280](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Uggen2/publication/251451257_Public_Attitudes_Toward_Felon_Disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States/links/004635314b17c81fba000000.pdf)\). That of parolees, probationers, and all former felons was opposed.
1.5.2.3. Con: Only two states - Maine and Vermont \([p. 2](https://law.stanford.edu/index.php?webauth-document=child-page/266901/doc/slspublic/NLeong_06.pdf)\) \(making up only [0.6%](https://www.infoplease.com/us/states/state-population-by-rank) of the American population\) - actually oppose all forms of disenfranchisement of current or ex-felons. The vast majority of states disenfranchise at least some current or ex-felons and thus do not oppose the practice as such.
1.5.2.4. Pro: As the definition of a felony is open to interpretation, permanent felony disenfranchisement is in effect an arbitrary punishment.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: What counts as a crime depends on constantly changing societal views. Indeed, some former crimes are no longer considered crimes. The legal system is fluid, and permanent punishments are incongruous with that.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Sodomy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sodomy) was once widely considered a crime, yet the [majority of states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States) have now repealed its associated laws.
1.5.2.4.1.2. Pro: Adultery was once considered a felony in most [societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery#Adultery_and_the_law), yet is now legal in [more than half](https://www.theweek.co.uk/62723/where-is-adultery-is-still-illegal) of states in the US.
1.5.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Even in the states where it is still illegal, adultery is generally only a [misdemeanor.​](https://www.theweek.co.uk/62723/where-is-adultery-is-still-illegal)
1.5.2.4.1.3. Con: In fact, there is a good deal of continuity with respect to many categories of felony crime. Appealing to the changing nature of some social norms obscures this underlying continuity.
1.5.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: Violent crimes such as assault, rape, and murder are consistently regarded as serious crimes.
1.5.2.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The doctrine of [felony murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule) likely goes back to at least the 12th century.
1.5.2.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Rape is considered one of the "classic" felonies from English common law \([p. 6](https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&context=clevstlrev)\).
1.5.2.4.1.3.2. Pro: Property crimes have consistently been regarded as serious crimes.
1.5.2.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: Burglary, larceny and robbery are considered to be among the "classic" felonies of English common law \([p. 6](https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&context=clevstlrev)\).
1.5.2.4.1.4. Con: If the act that a disenfranchised felon was convicted of is later de-criminalized, the felon's voting rights could be reinstated through an amnesty or act of law.
1.5.2.4.1.4.1. Con: Pardons must be issued [individually](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/) by the Governor or President, restricting their utility as a method of restoring voting rights.
1.5.2.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: As abolished crimes may overlap with still-existing crimes, general pardon laws - such as the recently-passed UK law to issue pardons for those convicted under anti-gay laws - require [individual applications](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/uk-issues-posthumous-pardons-thousands-gay-men-alan-turing-law).
1.5.2.4.1.4.1.2. Con: As [the case](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/05/politics/virginia-felons-voting-rights/) of disenfranchised convicts in Virginia shows, pardons on a large scale, though unlikely, are legally possible with sufficient political determination behind them.
1.5.2.4.1.5. Pro: It is unfair to keep punishing those who in the past violated a law that is now legal.
1.5.2.4.1.5.1. Pro: If disenfranchisement were part of the punishment then under the United States Constitution it could not be applied [ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law), yet new disenfranchisement statutes have been applied to individuals who had already been sentenced [before](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/aug/15/massachusetts-incarcerated-felon-disenfranchisement-constitutional-voting-rights-act-claim-survives/) they became law.
1.5.2.4.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.2.1.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: If a definition being open to interpretation is sufficient to call a punishment arbitrary, then all constitutions and legal frameworks would be void, as they would all contain arbitrary provisions by that standard.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Con: While all legal frameworks are to some extent arbitrary, an individual who is affected by them always has the option to show their displeasure through voting and political engagement. This would not be true if we took away convicted felons' right to vote.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: It is difficult to improve the US prison system when the opinions of those with the greatest insight into it are considered irrelevant.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Since people generally look down on felons, felons might be the only people with political will to try to improve prisons, such as by trying to implement strong [rehabilitation](https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2016/08/04/meet-the-ex-inmate-whose-successful-prison-rehab-program-goes-beyond-drug-treatment/) programs.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The public is not necessarily opposed to programs that prioritize rehabilitation over stricter punishment. As of 2014, for example, [two-thirds of Americans](http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/) saw the move away from mandatory prison sentences for drug offenses as positive and supported a focus on treatment instead of imprisonment.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.5.1.2.2.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.5.1.2.
1.5.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: Individuals who are affected by policies on [maternity](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/health-care/maternity/the-rights-of-childbearing-women.pdf) and reproductive rights are eligible to vote for political candidates who would represent their views and needs.
1.5.2.4.2.1.3. Pro: Those aged 18 and over who are affected by labor laws in the US [have a say](https://iclg.com/practice-areas/employment-and-labour-laws-and-regulations/usa) in elections, and thus in who represents their best interests in the workplace.
1.5.2.4.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.5.2.4.2.2. Pro: Felony disenfranchisement is the result of laws and just as amendable by democratic processes as are constitutions and other legal frameworks.
1.5.2.4.3. Pro: Beyond the definition of what crimes constitute a felony, the degree of punishment and whether the crime thereby [qualifies](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-drug-possession.htm) as a felony is anything but predictable.
1.5.3. Pro: Every act or process that is based on exclusion hurts democratic values and erodes democracy.
1.5.3.1. Con: There are several groups of citizens that are effectively excluded from the voting process \(either [de facto](https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/) or, in some cases, de jure\). Voting, therefore, cannot be an inalienable right or a subversion of democratic principles.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.4.2.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: People without [official identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States) are unable to vote in many states, which essentially prevents them from accessing their right.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: The right to vote does not carry with it an obligation to provide easy access to ID cards.
1.5.3.1.2.2. Con: Citizens can easily apply for an ID card whereas convicted felons lose their voting rights for good; thus, the situation is an inaccurate comparison.
1.5.3.1.2.3. Pro: For a right to be considered respected, it must be reasonably accessible.
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Many [disabled citizens](http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/voting/) are [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) barred from voting because some polling stations are not accessible.
1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: On Election day 2016, nearly two thirds of polling places were found to [impede access](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/02/01/how-voters-with-disabilities-are-blocked-from-the-ballot-box) to those with disabilities.
1.5.3.1.3.2. Con: The law [seeks to protect](https://www.ada.gov/ada_voting/ada_voting_ta.htm) the right of citizens with disabilities to vote. The failure of polling stations to meet a legislated aim cannot be used to support legislating to duplicate this failure for another group.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: The United States has [minimum voting age requirements](https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-age-requirements), which are uncontroversial.
1.5.3.1.4.1. Con: It can be argued that [children](https://reason.com/2018/12/07/should-we-let-children-vote-the-troublin/) should have the right to vote.
1.5.3.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.4.1.
1.5.3.1.5. Con: The failure to protect the rights of a larger number of people does not mean that the right in question does not exist. It may simply be being breached.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Liberal democracy is founded on a [philosophy of inclusion](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16921). To disenfranchise a part of society sabotages that fundamental value of democracy.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The practice of felony disenfranchisement creates a social class without a political voice and representation.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Since convicted felons still continue to pay taxes, disenfranchising them amounts to [taxation without representation](https://static.prisonpolicy.org/scans/ririghttovote/RTVWhitePaper.pdf).
1.5.3.2.1.1.1. Con: As a number of citizens already pay taxes without representation, the US has clearly shown a willingness to tax people without also wholly enfranchising them.
1.5.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: That a wrong has been done to one group is not a valid reason to wrong another group as well.
1.5.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Residents of [Washington DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_voting_rights) and US territories like [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_voting_rights_in_Puerto_Rico) are US citizens, but they have no representation in Congress or the Senate, and the territories have no Electoral College votes, either.
1.5.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: It is unfair to expect ex-prisoners to pay income taxes whilst at the same time denying them the ability to reap the benefits associated with citizenship, such as the electing of representatives or having a say in policies that may affect their lives.
1.5.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Given that the US was founded largely upon the [principle](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/250-years-ago-today-no-taxation-without-representation) of no taxation without representation, it seems particularly corrupt to subject their citizens to taxation without representation.
1.5.3.2.1.1.3.1. Con: While the phrase "taxation without representation" represented an important [grievance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation) prior to the revolution, it is not part of the United States Constitution.
1.5.3.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.5.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.5.3.2.1.3. Pro: Felons who have served their sentences have paid their debt to society. Permanently revoking their voting rights violates this principle and turns them into second-class citizens.
1.5.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Taking away an inalienable right, simply because someone violated the law previously, puts us on a slippery slope: on that basis, in theory, it is also possible to deny them the right to free speech and even due process.
1.5.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: It is already possible to [deny](https://law.jrank.org/pages/9396/Prisoners-Rights-Free-Speech.html) incarcerated prisoners freedom of speech.
1.5.3.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: The principle of [double jeopardy](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-prohibition-against-double-jeopardy.html) prohibits punishment twice for the same crime. This has been taken to mean that once a punishment has been meted out for a crime, the state cannot attach additional punishments.
1.5.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: The restoration of voting rights after the release of a convict acts as a powerful symbol of ex-convicts' [reintegration](https://okpolicy.org/to-encourage-reintegration-restore-voting-rights-for-people-with-felonies/) into law-abiding society \([p. 794](https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf)\).
1.5.3.2.1.3.3. Con: By maintaining [criminal records](https://www.criminalwatchdog.com/faq/how-long-does-felony-stay-on-record) of felons beyond their release, the state already recognises that the consequences for a crime extend beyond time in jail.
1.5.3.2.1.3.3.1. Con: The persistence of criminal records is also problematic. Just because it currently happens, does not mean that it is right.
1.5.3.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: By keeping criminal records and consequently making it harder for ex-felons to be employed, the state is making it [more likely](http://www.genfkd.org/denying-employment-ex-offenders-increases-recidivism-rates) that ex-felons will return to a life of crime as a way of providing for themselves and their families.
1.5.3.2.1.3.4. Con: Even without voting rights, felons are still under the protection of [many civil rights](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prisoners%27_rights) and not subject to governmental arbitrariness.
1.5.3.2.1.3.4.1. Con: The inability to vote makes it very difficult for them to discourage politicians from further curtailing their civil rights.
1.5.3.2.1.3.5. Pro: Those affected by voting disenfranchisement become a minority without a political voice, easy victims of the [tyranny of the majority](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803110431595).
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.5.1.3.4.
1.5.3.2.3. Con: Democracies not only strive for maximum inclusion, they also require [common identity](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/16921): If the inclusion of felons undermines this then their exclusion can be justified.
1.5.3.3. Con: Exclusion can be regarded as a measure to maintain a democratic society by removing those who want to abolish it or who threaten the values of society via their decision-making processes.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.5.3.3.2. Con: The vast majority of felons can hardly be said to want to abolish democracy, and their disagreements with society's values are often limited to specific laws.
1.5.3.4. Pro: The disenfranchised citizens have to deal with a limitation of their [liberty](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/1d.asp) in the form of restrictions of their self-determination. This violates one of the basic values of a liberal democracy.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: We accept countless other restrictions of individual freedoms, most of which affect an individual's life far more than disenfranchisement. Thus, there is apparently nothing wrong with limiting individuals' self-determination.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: We accept invasions of our privacy for [security](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening) reasons at airports, government buildings, and other sensitive locations.
1.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: Entry into the social contract is generally [taken](https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/) to entail the loss of many freedoms that one enjoys in the state of nature. The loss of complete self-determination is a far greater restriction of freedoms than disenfranchisement.
1.5.4. Con: The basic principle of democracy is [equality](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/ken.nuger/courses/pols120/Ch-3-Principles-of-Democracy.pdf), which convicted felons violated by elevating themselves above the law and thus above other members of society.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Democratic equality has been taken since the days of Greek democracy to entail the idea of [equality under the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law). By refusing to follow the same rules as everyone else, criminals inherently violate this.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Crime only violates the idea of equality under the law if a criminal treats the law as though it applies to everyone else. But that does not need to be the case. A criminal could consistently take the law not to apply to anyone.
1.5.4.2. Con: Democracy [only requires](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/603/1/24.abstract) the "equality of democratic agency". The vast majority of felons did not cause any form of inequality in democratic agency.
1.5.5. Pro: Voting is not a privilege to be 'earned' or maintained, but an inalienable [right](http://www.lincoln.edu/criminaljustice/hr/Vote.htm) of every citizen in a democracy.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Felon disenfranchisement goes against the United States Constitution.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: Constitutions can be amended, so even if felon disenfranchisement is currently not constitutional, that would not be a final or conclusive argument against the practice.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: Constitutions seldom change. In the 229 years since its enactment, the United States Constitution has undergone [only 27 amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution), even though thousands [have been proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Proposed_amendments_not_approved_by_Congress).
1.5.5.2.1.1.1. Con: That the Constitution has remained largely static is not a justification for it continuing to do so.
1.5.5.2.1.2. Pro: Numerous past amendments to the United States Constitution have clarified who is allowed to vote.
1.5.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: The [Fifteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xv) expanded the franchise on the basis of race.
1.5.5.2.1.2.2. Pro: The [Nineteenth Amendment](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-passes-the-19th-amendment) has expanded the franchise on the basis of gender.
1.5.5.2.1.2.3. Pro: The [Twenty-Sixth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty- https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-27.pdf) expanded the right to vote to anyone over eighteen.
1.5.5.2.1.2.4. Con: Previous constitutional amendments related to voting have granted additional voting rights, not taken them away. It seems unlikely that a new amendment would do the opposite.
1.5.5.2.1.2.4.1. Con: The debate under consideration is not about the likelihood of felony disenfranchisement, but rather its desirability. However likely or unlikely a constitutional amendment formalizing the state’s right to disenfranchise felons, the fact remains that such a mechanism is available.
1.5.5.2.1.3. Con: The fact that disenfranchisement is currently not part of the Constitution does in itself provide guidance for law-making. The intentions behind the Constitution as it stands today are commonly referenced in political and legal disputes in the United States, for good reason.
1.5.5.2.1.4. Pro: The Constitution not only defines what is seen as right and just, but also attempts to enshrine what is right and just. If societal norms change, the Constitution should also change.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) of the Constitution explicitly mentions "participation in rebellion, or other crime" as reasons for why the right to vote can be denied. This has been widely taken to allow for disenfranchisement on the basis of at least some crimes \([p. 111](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2140&context=ulj)\).
1.5.5.2.2.1. Con: While the Fourteenth Amendment does mention "participation in rebellion, or other crime" as justification for revocation of voting rights, the context is clearly related to crimes such as treason or revolt, not, e.g., murder.
1.5.5.2.2.1.1. Con: There is no reason the phrase "or other crime" needs to be restricted to the previous phrase and to crimes like treason. It could just as easily be taken as a general exception, to be specified by subsequent acts of Congress.
1.5.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: The reason to think that the phrase "or other crime" is intended to be restricted to cases like treason or revolt is the context of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was passed in the wake of the Civil War, when the full rights of many [ex-Confederates](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-pardon-of-jefferson-davis-and-the-14th-amendment) had still not been restored.
1.5.5.2.3. Pro: Felon disenfranchisement is unconstitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment \([p. 94](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1078&context=ijlse)\), which asserts that "The right...to vote shall not be denied...by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude".
1.5.5.2.3.1. Pro: Incarceration is a form of [involuntary servitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States).
1.5.5.2.3.2. Con: The phrase "previous condition of servitude" in the Fifteenth Amendment is generally taken to refer to enslavement, not to incarceration.
1.5.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: The [Thirteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) and [Fourteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) Amendments, passed at roughly the same time as the Fifteenth Amendment, both explicitly refer to the possibility of imprisonment and the removal of the right to vote on the basis of criminal convictions. It would thus be odd if the Fifteenth Amendment were to rule that out.
1.5.5.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.2.2.
1.5.5.2.3.3. Con: The Fifteenth Amendment has generally been [taken](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-xv/interps/141) to bar racial discrimination in voting, but not to prohibit any bar on voting.
1.5.5.2.3.4. Con: The fact that there is another Amendment \(19th\) to grant [women](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/amendment-19) the vote is a recognition that the 15th Amendment did not contain a broad right to vote.
1.5.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.5.
1.5.5.2.5. Con: The United States Constitution does not claim voting to be an unrestricted right of every citizen. This has been established by the Supreme Court, which [declared that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html) individuals have "no federal constitutional right to vote".
1.5.5.2.5.1. Pro: The disenfranchisement of felons has been ruled to not be objectionable on the basis of the United States Constitution in a variety of cases; the Supreme Court equally has acknowledged its validity \([p. 110](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2140&context=ulj)\).
1.5.5.2.5.2. Con: [Bush v. Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore), the case which supposedly establishes that individuals do not have a federal constitutional right to vote, is widely regarded as being [wrongly decided](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/just-how-bad-was-bush-v-gore/343247/). It is an anomaly inconsistent with most other Supreme Court rulings, one that the Court itself went out of its way to assert could not be used as [precedent](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=976701).
1.5.5.2.5.2.1. Pro: The Supreme Court should have never even taken up Bush v. Gore, because Bush didn't have standing and because the case wasn't yet ripe \(the harm hadn't been suffered\) \([p. 1094](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1707&context=faculty_scholarship)\).
1.5.5.2.5.2.2. Con: Bush v. Gore is not necessarily non-precedential.
1.5.5.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: The phrase in Bush v. Gore that says the decision applies only in the present case does not need to be construed as denying precedent. It may instead refer to the unique set of circumstances of the case, as Chief Justice John Roberts suggested in his confirmation hearings \([p. 1](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=student_papers)\).
1.5.5.2.5.2.2.2. Pro: Bush v. Gore has been used as precedent in voting machine cases in Ohio and other battleground cases \([pp. 29-32](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=student_papers)\).
1.5.5.2.5.3. Con: The Supreme Court's assertion in [Bush v. Gore](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html) that individuals have "no federal constitutional right to vote" depends on reasoning that is specific to the method by which the President of the United States is selected and not necessarily generalizable to voting more broadly.
1.5.5.2.5.3.1. Pro: [Bush v. Gore](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html) clarifies that once a state chooses to elect its electors, all citizens of the state have a right to vote through the chosen process, unless the state decides to no longer choose its electors through an election.
1.5.5.2.5.3.2. Pro: [Electors](https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/) for the President of the United States are officially chosen by the state governments, through whatever process state governments elect. This is why there is no federal right in that instance.
1.5.5.2.5.3.3. Con: While the specific mechanics of the Electoral College are only relevant to the election of the President the fact that [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States) do administer all elections in the United States is sufficient to generalize the ruling in Bush v. Gore to all voting.
1.5.5.2.5.3.4. Pro: Any other elected office lacks the oddity of the Electoral College, so the logic that Bush v. Gore appealed to in declaring that there is no federal right to vote does not apply, because the argument there depended on the fact that electors for President are chosen by the state governments, rather than the people.
1.5.5.2.6. Pro: Scholars [argue that](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/) the universal right to vote is part of the United States Constitution, even if only implicitly, and "the only just basis for self-government" as well as the "standards of human rights" that America promotes.
1.5.5.2.6.1. Con: The inclusion of so-called [penumbral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penumbra_\(law\)) rights \(rights taken to be implied by the United States Constitution if not explicitly included\) has been [criticized](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/faculty/572/) as deriving from the overextension of a metaphor beyond its legitimate range of application.
1.5.5.2.6.2. Pro: The American-made or American-approved constitutions of countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Japan and Germany all explicitly refer to a [right to vote](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/) instead of a privilege. This is testament to the American understanding of democracy.
1.5.5.2.6.2.1. Con: While the United States may have had a hand in other nations’ constitutions, this does not mean that they have any judicial relevance within the United States; the United States Constitution is the only important document when considering the legality of its own laws.
1.5.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.1.1.
1.5.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.5.5. Con: Even if voting is a right, we regularly abridge the rights of citizens. Notably, we abridge the rights of felons by putting them in jail in the first place. Disenfranchisement is principally the same.
1.5.5.5.1. Pro: Prisoners do not have a right to [privacy](https://law.jrank.org/pages/9394/Prisoners-Rights-Privacy.html) while incarcerated. This has been held to include an abridgement of their [Fourth Amendment](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-04/24-prisons-and-regulation-of-probation-and-parole.html) rights against unreasonable search and seizures. The restriction of a broad constitutional right like privacy is comparable to the restriction of another constitutional right like voting.
1.5.5.5.2. Pro: The restriction of the right to liberty is fundamental to punishment by imprisonment \([p. 1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118845387.wbeoc020)\). This is arguably a more fundamental right than voting rights.
1.5.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.1.3.
1.5.5.7. Con: The [Fourteenth Amendment](http://www.pbs.org/tpt/constitution-usa-peter-sagal/equality/due-process-equal-protection-and-disenfranchisement/) of the United States Constitution allows for the deprivation of regularly-referenced inalienable rights with due process of law.
1.5.5.7.1. Con: The legality of a thing is not itself supportive of whether or not it is right to do so.
1.5.6. Con: As long as the process by which disenfranchisement is decided is applied consistently and fairly then the basic principle of equality is preserved.
1.5.6.1. Con: It has not been established that the process by which disenfranchisement is decided has been applied consistently and fairly. Thus, it has not been established whether the principle of disenfranchisement does violate the principle of equality.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Democratic equality depends upon the consistent application of [procedural](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/#PurProConDemLeg) processes agreed upon in advance. The practice of felony disenfranchisement can be consistent with these procedures.
1.6. Con: Most punishments aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminal. Removing the right to vote undermines this goal by alienating the individual from the rest of society.
1.6.1. Pro: Permanently removing voting rights assumes that no one convicted of a felony is capable of change and holds their mistake against them indefinitely.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Genuine attempts at [atonement](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atonement) ought to afford a person the rights, [liberties, and opportunities to pursue happiness](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/why-did-jefferson-draft-the-declaration-of-independence) guaranteed and given to each and every American citizen.
1.6.1.2. Con: A sentence of life imprisonment also holds someone's mistake against them indefinitely. If there are conditions under which this is an acceptable punishment, there should be conditions under which a seemingly more minor punishment \(such as disenfranchisement\) would also be acceptable.
1.6.1.3. Con: Permanent felony disenfranchisement need not be taken as a judgement of one's capacity for change. It simply specifies the length of time for punishment from a past act. In this way, it is no different than any other form of punishment.
1.6.1.4. Pro: The judicial system functions on the understanding that once a criminal has served their time, they should be free to continue their life without interference from government and from further punishment.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.1.3.3.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.1.3.1.2.
1.6.1.4.3. Pro: Other conditions under which the state continues to supervise criminals, such as probation and parole [cannot](https://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/criminal-law/parole_probation/probation_time_parole.htm) extend beyond the length of the sentence. Felony disenfranchisement should be no different.
1.6.2. Pro: Restoring voting rights for convicted felons tends to lead to lower recidivism \([p. 2](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/U.S.-Commission-on-Civil-Rights-Collateral-Consequences-Testimony.pdf)\).
1.6.2.1. Con: The authors of the study finding a lower rate of recidivism themselves acknowledge that "the single behavioral act of casting a ballot is unlikely to be the sole factor that turns felons’ lives around." \([p. 2](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/U.S.-Commission-on-Civil-Rights-Collateral-Consequences-Testimony.pdf)\).
1.6.2.2. Con: The study that found lower rates of recidivism among felons with restored voting rights was not a large scale longitudinal study of the sort that the authors accept as necessary to establish a causal relationship \([p. 3](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3887/bffdb10e5006e2f902fcf2a46abaa9efdf46.pdf)\).
1.6.2.3. Pro: By lowering the rate of recidivism, voting reduces the cost that criminals impose on society.
1.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.6.3. Con: Some punishments are not simply aimed at rehabilitation. Disenfranchisement can help to serve these other aims even if it does not aid in rehabilitation or reintegration.
1.6.3.1. Con: Even the longest prison sentences usually at least take the possibility of rehabilitation into consideration.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: In many countries a life sentence [does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment#Summary_by_country) equal indefinite imprisonment, but expires after a set number of years \(unless there are reasons for continued imprisonment, for example an immediate threat posed by the convict\).
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Even in those cases where an individual is released early from a life sentence, the large sentence has initially been imposed for the protection of society. Were the judiciary to place a higher focus on rehabilitation in these crimes, they would give a lesser sentence in the first place.
1.6.3.2. Pro: By giving out long prison sentences, the judiciary chooses to prioritise the protection of society over the rehabilitative prospects of the felon.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: When a felon is sentenced to a long jail term, that is a tacit acceptance that their rehabilitation is less important, as jails tend to make [rehabilitation less effective](http://theconversation.com/crime-and-punishment-and-rehabilitation-a-smarter-approach-41960).
1.6.3.3. Pro: Felony disenfranchisement can serve [retributive](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/) ends even if it does not serve rehabilitative ends.
1.6.3.4. Con: Even if there are forms of punishment whose aim is not rehabilitation, those forms of punishment should not be counterproductive to rehabilitation.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.1.
1.6.5. Pro: Voting rights keep felons connected to civic life.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Being eligible to vote encourages individuals to [inform](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:PUCH.0000024161.44798.ef) themselves on social issues and follow public debates.
1.6.5.2. Con: The loss of voting rights are not the only obstacle to a felon's connection to civic life. Addressing this without addressing these other obstacles is meaningless.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: Obstacles to [employment](https://work.chron.com/felony-employment-laws-7962.html) pose a much larger obstacle to connection to civil life than voting rights. Without a means to secure a living, it is hard to meet any fundamental needs, and without one's fundamental needs being met, higher order goods such as political participation do not matter.
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Barriers to [housing](https://www.voa.org/homelessness-and-prisoner-reentry) pose a much larger barrier to a connection to civic life than voting rights. It is difficult to participate in any aspects of social life without access to fundamental needs such as housing.
1.6.5.2.3. Con: Whether or not voting rights are the only or even the primary barrier to participation in civic life, as long as they contribute to it at all then restoring voting rights would contribute to a greater connection to civic life.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.
1.7. Pro: Having violated the laws of society, a felon should not be part of the process through which society governs itself.
1.7.1. Con: Not all convicted felons broke the law. A significant number are [wrongfully convicted](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/first-estimate-wrongful-convictions-general-prison-population), and these people deserve to influence the justice system.
1.7.1.1. Con: In the case of wrongful convictions, the problem is with innocent people being classified as felons at all, not with the specific punishments that felons are subjected to.
1.7.1.2. Pro: An estimated 11.6% of all cases with a sexual assault component are wrongful convictions \([p. 11](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/251115.pdf)\).
1.7.1.3. Pro: In 2018, an intake study of those presently incarcerated in Pennsylvania's prison population found that as many as [6%](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/first-estimate-wrongful-convictions-general-prison-population) of all convictions may be false.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: The upper bound of 6% of all convictions being wrongful was found by [examining](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/first-estimate-wrongful-convictions-general-prison-population) the number of inmates who continue to maintain their innocence even after conviction. However, there is no reason to trust that they are generally honest.
1.7.1.4. Pro: There is a strong racial component to wrongful convictions. This means that felony disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact innocent Black Americans as compared to innocent white Americans.
1.7.1.4.1. Pro: Black Americans are far more likely than white Americans to be wrongfully convicted of a [number](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Race-and-Wrongful-Convictions.aspx) of different crimes.
1.7.1.4.1.1. Con: Estimates about the racial disparity of wrongful convictions are extrapolated from data about exonerations. However, exonerations make up a tiny percentage of wrongful convictions and [may not](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2020/may/15/racism-and-wrongful-convictions/) be a representative sample.
1.7.1.4.2. Con: The way to redress the disparate racial impact from wrongful conditions is to address the racism of the criminal justice system.
1.7.2. Con: Everyone deserves a chance to change. If meaningful change is demonstrated, the withholding of rights should be reconsidered.
1.7.3. Pro: Convicted felons have broken the '[social contract](https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/)' and as a result have reverted to a '[state of nature](https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/)' \(wherein there are no binding rights or duties\). It follows that in such a state, the right to vote is also voided alongside the other benefits of society.
1.7.3.1. Con: The state of nature is merely a theoretical concept and not an actual state. Claiming that those who have committed felonies have returned to a state of nature is thus a category mistake.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: The [state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature) was a hypothetical construct postulated by early social contractarians to explain life prior to society. But modern anthropological work suggests that sociality has always been a feature of humans \(and their most recent hominid ancestors\). More recent social contractarians such as [Rawls](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/) therefore avoid appeals to a state of nature.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Citizens do not consent to be part of the social contract but are forced into it [by birth](https://opentextbc.ca/ethicsinlawenforcement/chapter/2-9-social-contract-theory/).
1.7.3.2. Con: By the same logic, it would also follow that the state - and, indeed, the general population - would be free to do anything to a felon, as they fall outside the social contract. However, the law also values [proportionality](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/463/277/case.html) in sentencing and therefore this logic cannot stand.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Locke's theory that rights were forfeited when the social contract was broken led him to conclude that a person who violated the social contract could be killed or enslaved. Indeed, this was part of this justification for the practice of [chattel slavery](https://www.libertarianism.org/essays/two-treatises-government-justifying-war-slavery). If we reject this conclusion, then we should also reject the premises upon which it was based.
1.7.3.3. Con: A portion of society never entered the social contract in the first place. However, we still extend human rights to all individuals, which is why 'universal' human rights are considered important.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: Those who we consider unable to conceptualise the notion of a social contract are still regarded as being protected by it \([pp. 1618-1620](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dff9/93bf2b4b9d7cc30f39a40779fdb24fef5139.pdf)\). Thus, for example, children are taken to have rights to protection.
1.7.3.3.2. Pro: Those who by virtue of severe disability cannot be regarded as capable of entering into a social contract from an equal position \(as is required by the social contract\) are still protected by civil society \([pp. 1616 - 1618](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dff9/93bf2b4b9d7cc30f39a40779fdb24fef5139.pdf)\).
1.7.3.4. Pro: The social contract, which is necessary for the maintenance of civil society, is harmed when people break the law \([pp. 43-45](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf)\).
1.7.3.4.1. Con: The harm suffered by society is abstract and diffuse in comparison to the concrete, specific harm suffered by an ex-felon when they lose their right to vote.
1.7.3.4.1.1. Con: The harm suffered by the felon's victim\(s\) is concrete, specific, and often has wide ranging impacts on society.
1.7.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: The consequences of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme [affected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal#Affected_clients) large portions of the US economy.
1.7.3.4.2. Con: The majority of crimes affect individuals and not society as a whole, thus the existence of society and public order is never seriously threatened.
1.7.3.4.2.1. Pro: The five [most common](https://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/what-are-the-most-common-crimes-in-the-united-states/) types of crime in the US - larceny, burglary, motor theft, assault, and robbery - are all usually committed against an individual or a small group of people.
1.7.3.4.2.2. Con: Individuals living in areas with high rates of such crimes feel unsafe and under threat. As everyone has the right to [feel safe](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/tb1b/Section3/udhrrev.html) and secure, these crimes harm all those living in affected areas.
1.7.3.4.2.3. Con: [Property values](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/real-estate/the-impact-of-crime-on-property-values-research-roundup/) decrease and [insurance rates](https://coverhound.com/insurance-learning-center/do-crime-rates-affect-your-home-insurance-costs) increase in affected areas, causing additional financial harm to a community.
1.7.3.4.3. Pro: Crimes that "interfere with \[...\] society and the ability of people to function efficiently" are, by [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-order_crime), crimes that affect public order.
1.7.3.4.3.1. Pro: For the force of the law to be effective, there needs to be a broad social expectation that everyone will follow those laws. By breaking those laws, criminals undermine the efficacy of this force.
1.7.3.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.
1.7.3.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.4.
1.7.3.5. Pro: In a social contractarian system, [rights](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-contract) are largely contractual, in that they are given on the basis of duties that are expected to be performed. When that contract is violated, there is no expectation that rights will still be granted \([pp. 208-211](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&=&context=law_jurisprudence)\).
1.7.3.5.1. Pro: According to [Rousseau](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/#ReprGove)'s theory of the social contract, there can be no absolute rights because rights are determined by the general will. Violations of the general will therefore end any rights that the state grants.
1.7.3.5.2. Pro: While John [Locke](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/#NatuLawNatuRigh) does accept that some rights are inalienable, the right to vote \(or even political participation\) are not among them.
1.7.3.5.3. Con: At best, social contract theory can show that the state does not have to allow felons to vote. It can not show whether the state should allow felons to vote. This is because social contract theory treats rights in terms of [obligation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism-contemporary/#Consent), not in terms of value.
1.7.3.6. Con: This argument proves too much, because if felons really did all revert to a state where there are "no binding rights or duties", they wouldn't have any rights at all, even the right to life.
1.7.3.7. Con: The felon does not return to a state of nature because by serving a sentence, they remain subject to society's laws.
1.7.3.7.1. Pro: Convicted felons would only be in a state of nature if they were stripped of their citizenship. According to the [citizenship clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Clause#Loss_of_citizenship) of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state does not have the right to strip them of citizenship.
1.7.3.7.2. Pro: After having served their sentence, ex-felons are no longer a part of the state of nature and thus by this logic should once again gain the benefits of the social contract.
1.7.4. Pro: By prioritizing personal benefit over societal good, felons have shown an inability to engage with the principles of democracy, and thus should not be [allowed](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/22/should-felons-ever-be-allowed-to-vote/if-you-cant-follow-laws-you-shouldnt-help-make-them) to be a part of it.
1.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.5.3.
1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.7.4.3. Con: Democracy does not require voters to act in the service of the societal good; it merely aggregates the opinions of all its citizens, regardless of whether they emphasize personal benefit or societal good.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: According to [rational choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory), voters make decisions based on their individual interests and focused on maximum individual benefits.
1.7.4.3.2. Con: There is a huge difference between not acting in the service of the societal good and expressing individual interests in breach of the law.
1.7.4.3.2.1. Con: The logical extension of this principle is that people should not be allowed to vote for a party if that party has policies which harm others. However, balancing the desires of all individuals is the point of democracy.
1.7.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: If an individual votes for a party that will adopt aggressively racist policies, they are choosing a party that will restrict the rights of others.
1.7.4.3.2.2. Pro: Voting according to personal interests, even if this goes against the collective good, does not necessarily result in restrictions on the freedoms of others.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
