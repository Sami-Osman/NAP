Discussion Name: Is science becoming increasingly distorted and losing objectivity?

1. Is science becoming increasingly distorted and losing objectivity?
1.1. Existing biases within the scientific community lead to a loss of objectivity in the practice of science.
1.1.1. Pro: Inferences made within studies are based on perception. Perception is inherently connected with the biased human element.
1.1.1.1. Pro: From neuroscience it is said that the brain automatically attempts to identify patterns, assumes it has all the relevant factors included and manipulates information to support pre-supposed ideas, which leads to mistakes be it consciously or unconscious.
1.1.1.2. Con: As this is an inextricable issue with perception itself, it cannot be said to be a new or growing problem, to a "loss of objectivity". It is a perpetual limit on any possible science, not an increasing distortion.
1.1.2. Pro: The scientific community, like any other, is subject to social pressure.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Scientific research is often conducted with funding from external agencies with vested interest in the study findings. This poses serious conflicts of interest that could implicitly influence study findings.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [sugar industry](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat)(In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nThe article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to "refute" concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.) funded research studies, which shifted the blame for health problems from sugar onto fats.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Historians have challenged the conclusions drawn by the authors and called it a [conspiracy theory](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180215141755.htm)("We think it is an error to demonize, almost as a reflex, scientists and their research when there is evidence of private funding," the authors write. "Our analysis illustrates how conspiratorial narratives in science can distort the past in the service of contemporary causes and obscure genuine uncertainty that surrounds aspects of research, impairing efforts to formulate good evidence-informed policies.") that could set a dangerous precedent.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Funding from [cigarette manufacturers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05937-w)(For decades, the cigarette companies Philip Morris International and R. J. Reynolds supported and promoted studies linking a driven personality to an increased risk of heart disease. The apparent motivation? To raise questions over smoking as a contributor. Subsequent research by scientists without funding from the tobacco industry did not link type A personalities to higher rates of disease or death.) helped shift the blame for cardiovascular diseases from smoking to personality traits, such as being Type A.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Clinical trials funded by the [pharmaceutical industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953608000361) yield findings that favor the industry.
1.1.2.1.4. Pro: Studies emphasizing the importance of breakfast are often funded by [cereal](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/28/breakfast-health-america-kellog-food-lifestyle) [companies](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/how-marketers-invented-the-modern-version-of-breakfast/487130/).
1.1.2.2. Pro: There are many examples of when [scientific groupthink](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-sage-scientific-groupthink) has clouded the judgement of scientists, such as during the 1976 swine flu outbreak in the US.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The community will apply pressure to its members to act in accordance with a certain framework which will inevitably effect outcomes of certain studies.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The scientific community is not bound to commit to frameworks that obscure the purity of the conducted science.
1.1.2.4. Con: The more social pressure there is on certain kinds of research, the more interest and attention it garners. This has several upshots that enhance objectivity.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: When the scientific community are tasked with addressing pressing issues, this can often result in dramatically [increased funding](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1). Better funding often yields superior quality research.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: The more social interest certain research fields attract, the more scientists will want to contribute to it. This is likely to increase the numbers of scientists peer reviewing papers in the field or replicating important studies.
1.1.3. Con: There are ways in which the scientific community can address their biases.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Research indicates that [educating scientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80677-4) about their own biases can form part of a bias mitigation strategy.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The [Centre for Evidence Based Medicine](https://catalogofbias.org/) at Oxford University has produced a 'catalogue of bias' that can be used to educate scientists about the potential for bias in their work.
1.1.3.2. Con: Non-empirical, [philosophical biases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6415937/) - such as the nature of causation, determinism, and reductionism - cannot be easily avoided because such concepts are a cornerstone of scientific research.
1.1.4. Pro: To keep/get research funding, a scientist can overstate or understate their findings to make them more palatable to the funding source or potential funding sources.
1.1.5. Con: The scientific endeavor revolves around logic and facts, which mitigates against the influence of emotions and biases.
1.1.5.1. Con: Scientists will always lack objectivity from their varying degrees of bias, but data will remain objectively verifiable, objectively falsifiable, or objective indeterminable.
1.1.6. Con: Peer review is a fundamental part of scientific research. This mitigates against bias.
1.1.6.1. Con: Peer review biases the process of science production because it is essentially [ideological gatekeeping](https://newdiscourses.com/2020/09/ideological-gatekeeping-future-peer-review/)(Over the course of my career, I have encountered more than my share of jerky reviewers, but the jerks aren’t the major problem with peer review these days. In many fields today – especially those in the humanities and social sciences – peer review has become a mechanism that serves to enforce ideological conformity within the disciplines. This inhibits the formation of communities of open inquiry in higher education.).
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Peer review is only as objective as the peers involved in the review process. Like most humans, they are [not immune](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12652170/) to bias.
1.1.6.2. Con: [The Grievance Studies Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair) exposed serious flaws the the peer review process in the scientific community
1.1.6.3. Pro: The [overwhelming majority](https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/what-is-peer-review/index.html)(90% of researchers feel that peer review improves the quality of their published paper \(University of Tennessee and CIBER Research Ltd, 2013\)) of researchers believe peer review improves the quality of their papers.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: That an article is peer reviewed offers [no guarantee](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/scientific-publishing-peer-review-open-access/) with regard to its quality.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Peer-reviewed articles are regularly [retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/) post publication.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: This branch is circular. The scientific community cannot prove its lack of bias through its belief in its lack of bias.
1.1.6.4. Con: Peer review often gives senior academics power with which to [manipulate citations](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/when-peer-reviewers-go-rogue-collaborating-with-wageningen-university-to-detect-and-prevent-citation-manipulation), and bolster their own research's platform.
1.1.6.5. Pro: Science requires us to show our math and assumptions to be open to peer review, clear thinking, and organized progress with proven processes \(think randomized controlled trials\). However, science does not fail because people are imperfect. Because of peer review and replication, science is self-correcting.
1.1.7. Pro: Lost in day-to-day activities, scientists tend to lose sight of the purpose, morality, and consequences of their work.
1.1.7.1. Con: Many research proposals need to get [ethical approval](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/guidance-for-applicants/research-ethics-guidance/research-organisations-and-research-ethics-committees-our-principles-research-ethics-committees/criteria-for-research-ethics-committee-review/#contents-list)(Researchers, ROs and research ethics committees \(RECs\) must ensure all proposals that have been recommended for funding by the ESRC are appropriately reviewed before the actual research commences.) before receiving funding, so the morality of their work is likely at the forefront of many scientists' minds.
1.1.8. Con: Confirmation Bias may give amateurs the mistaken idea that their favored view is being unfairly suppressed.
1.1.9. Con: Many prestigious awards, such as the Nobel prize, reward good science that challenges the status quo.
1.1.9.1. Con: Nobel Prize laureates [lack diversity](https://theconversation.com/nobel-prizes-have-a-diversity-problem-even-worse-than-the-scientific-fields-they-honor-145799), which suggests there is something more going on than a pure meritocracy based on good science.
1.1.10. Pro: For questions involving human subjects, the pool of research candidates is rarely diverse or representative.
1.1.10.1. Pro: Science in affluent cultures doesn't even make the attempt to control for human diversity.
1.1.10.1.1. Pro: The significance of racial exclusion in psychological research is well captured by the title of a book on this subject, "[Even the Rat was White](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-02454-000)."
1.1.10.1.2. Pro: Research into the human mind has [disproportionately](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird) been conducted in WEIRD \(Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic\) [countries](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100630132850.htm). These findings do not readily generalize to all populations around the world.
1.1.10.1.3. Con: Just because research findings have primarily been derived using samples from privileged classes does not mean that the findings cannot be generalized to other groups.
1.1.10.1.3.1. Pro: Fundamental aspects of the human experience, such as [basic human emotions](https://psychcentral.com/news/2018/01/27/are-emotions-universal#1)(“This suggests that these emotions – and their vocalizations – are similar across all human cultures.”), are universal across all human groups, as verified by cross-cultural comparisons.
1.1.10.1.4. Con: The increase in awareness about the lack of studies conducted using under-represented samples has resulted in an increase in interest in conducting [more research studies](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cross-cultural-psychology-2794903) using such samples.
1.1.10.1.5. Pro: Culture-specific science is ultimately serving corporate interests who will market products \(like drugs\) within that culture.
1.1.10.2. Pro: Pharmaceutical trials were originally conducted using male samples. As a result, women tend to be [overmedicated](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161318.htm) and suffer side effects to a greater degree.
1.1.10.2.1. Pro: The exclusion of women from pharmaceutical trials was largely based on [misogynistic](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161318.htm)(For decades, women were excluded from clinical drug trials based, in part, on unfounded concerns that female hormone fluctuations render women difficult to study, Zucker said.) reasons.
1.1.11. Con: Objectivity is inaccessible to humans. We must accept that all statements of truth are subjective.
1.1.11.1. Con: Subjective claims are justified by human perception, this is a gross limitation of the boundaries of human knowledge.
1.1.11.1.1. Con: It is a limitation which must be accepted. Biases, fallacies, motivations, and perspectives, must be taken into account in all statements and arguments.
1.1.11.1.2. Con: Placing a limit on human knowledge - human perception - is very useful. It allows us to place limits on human actions, claims of truth, and claims of power.
1.1.11.2. Con: This is itself an objective claim, a circular argument.
1.1.11.3. Pro: Using Occam's Razor, It is much simpler to surmise that human-written truths are justified using human means.
1.2. Scientific principles protect science from distortion and loss of objectivity.
1.2.1. Pro: Science is based on the idea that every belief can be questioned, which goes against [the definition of dogma](https://www.google.ro/search?q=dogma+definition&safe=active&sxsrf=ALeKk00_cacGIImPL2_Hsm4YYuVJMuhJ5Q%3A1623535775724&ei=nzDFYJDSK6uSrgSkwpSYDw&oq=dogma+definition&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEMsBMgUIABDLATIFCAAQywEyBQgAEMsBMgUIABDLATIFCAAQywEyBQgAEMsBMgUIABDLATIFCAAQywEyBQgAEMsBOgcIABBHELADOgcIABCwAxBDOg0ILhCwAxDIAxBDEJMCOgoILhCwAxDIAxBDOgIIADoECC4QQ0oFCDgSATFQqusKWKj_CmDhgAtoAXACeACAAZ4BiAHqCpIBBDIuMTCYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAENwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjQncSJjpPxAhUriYsKHSQhBfMQ4dUDCA4&uact=5)(definition: a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true).
1.2.1.1. Con: Dogma is an especially tricky and pervasive type of bias. Insulating science from dogma requires intentional protections and is not guaranteed to succeed all the time.
1.2.1.2. Con: While it may be true that science is based on questioning, professionals executing science in their fields are not immune to twisting or subconsciously distorting science into a dogma and losing objectivity.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.2.1.3. Con: Every belief can be questioned. But scientists cannot necessarily get tenure and funding by questioning every belief.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Scientific beliefs are fleeting and with every change in scientific "fact" or theory come new reasons to fund its research.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Science has a rich history of [theoretical debate](https://www.oxford-royale.com/articles/incredible-scientific-debates-of-the-past/).
1.2.1.5. Pro: Anyone with appropriate tools and skills can test and contest the claims.
1.2.1.6. Con: Dogma is not the opposite of science. Other means of "knowing" reality may have nothing whatsoever to do with dogma.
1.2.2. Pro: The [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) followed by the scientific community is itself so thorough in its efforts to obtain objectively valid results that it would be difficult to twist scientific findings.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Scientists are expected to demonstrate that their results yield statistically significant outcomes, without which any positive conclusions are largely invalid.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Researchers are expected to consider and minimise the impact of confounding variables in the methodology they adopt.
1.2.2.3. Con: Science \(scientific studies\) can be twisted unintentionally by [selection bias](https://catalogofbias.org/biases/selection-bias/)(Background\n\nParticipants in research may differ systematically from the population of interest. For example, participants included in an influenza vaccine trial may be healthy young adults, whereas those who are most likely to receive the intervention in practice may be elderly and have many comorbidities, and are therefore not representative.).
1.2.2.4. Con: In practice, [two-thirds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39054778) of researchers struggle to reproduce studies by their peers, which is a key part of the scientific method.
1.2.2.5. Con: The scientific method does not guarantee that at any point in time the current conclusions from the scientific method are the final conclusions from the scientific method.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: It is counterproductive to reject a method that removes known errors, especially if the alternative is a full of confirmation bias, echo-chamber construction, and virtue signalling for one's own side while demonizing the other side.
1.2.3. Pro: Like turtles, the scientific method goes "[all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down)." The scientific method \(continually finding more sophisticated techniques of testing assumptions\) is the only useful way to criticize those misusing the scientific method.
1.2.4. Con: Scientific principles are ultimately made and applied by fallible and biased humans.
1.2.5. Con: The generation of [hypotheses](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/40/1/95/130748/The-science-of-subjectivity)(Thus, variations in prior experience are shown to bias the formation of evidence-based geological hypotheses.\n\nSuch biases in geologists are quite expected as the processes through which they develop in experts in any field are well known to cognitive psychologists. Biases include over-confidence, anchoring and adjustment, availability, and motivational bias, and the definitions of these can be found in Kahneman et al. \(1982\) or O'Hagan et al. \(2006\).) can often introduce bias and subjectivity into research, and yet science heavily relies on these.
1.2.6. Con: Scientific theories are constantly changing and evolving. If science were objectively accurate, this would not happen.
1.2.6.1. Con: As our understanding of the universe changes with time, research and evidence, so do scientific theories and discoveries change over time, leading to the appearance that science is lacking objectivity.
1.2.6.2. Con: The claim that science is not objectively accurate is not in contention. Science is objective in that it, as a field, is not swayed by personal feelings and opinions.
1.2.7. Pro: Scientific claims never have the pretense of being the ultimate truth, or even to actually provide an explanation for the results.
1.3. Science communication as well as reporting in media lead to the impression that science is distorted.
1.3.1. Con: Mechanisms built in to the scientific publishing industry ensure the output meets the standards of scientific rigor and have not been contorted.
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.3.2. Pro: Science can be twisted in science journalism.
1.3.2.1. Pro: While some journalist are scientists, most are not. More importantly, they are likely not also statisticians. Regardless of intent, journalists who are not experienced in all three fields may be misinterpreting data and/or do not realize missing data is vital for accurate analysis.
1.3.2.2. Con: Science journalism can be an [extremely competitive](https://gsas.columbia.edu/blog/5-tips-scientists-who-want-become-science-writers) field to get into, making it more likely that those who do are competent enough not to distort the science.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Distortion of science is not necessarily caused by incompetence of science journalists; as with all online media these days, it must compete for public attention, and that may sometimes mean prioritising the [entertainment factor](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222250).
1.3.2.3. Pro: Science journalists often portray scientific theories and studies as conclusive, giving an illusion of objectivity where none exists.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: It is theorized that the universe began as an infinitely small, infinitely dense point of potential called a [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity?wprov=sfla1). But there is no evidence that a singularity can exist, whether in black holes or at the origin of the universe. Regardless, popular culture embraces the singularity as truth.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: New theories point to the possibility of multiple universes which [collide](https://www.spacedaily.com/news/cosmology-01b.html) with each other, causing the cosmic background microwave radiation that we find today as evidence of a big "bang". This is called the Big Bump theory. However, the Big Bang theory is accepted as reality.
1.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: [The two theories are not mutually exclusive](https://www.spacedaily.com/news/cosmology-01b.html)(This, says a team of physicists, is how the big bang happened. The approach of the parallel universe caused the expansion of space, and the collision itself produced all energy and matter.)
1.3.2.3.1.2. Con: The singularity follows from the idea that the universe is expanding, which is supported by evidence.
1.3.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Faraway objects recede from us at a [rate proportional to their distance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/02/10/ask-ethan-how-do-we-know-space-is-expanding/?sh=4d070d6c49e6).
1.3.2.4. Pro: Scientists in the public domain and science journalists are not necessarily exclusively motivated to disseminate objective facts.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Journalists are primarily motivated by selling papers, which means many favour sensationalism over scientific rigour.
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Science journalists have historically tended to focus on [making science sound exciting and glamorizing scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/30/problem-with-science-journalism-2015-reality-kevin-folta)(In the 1930s and 1940s, Rensberger wrote, science journalists sought to “persuade the public to accept science as the salvation of society”. Great emphasis was put “on the wonders of science and respect for scientists, rather than on any analysis of the work being done or any anticipation of its effects on society”.) as opposed to analysing their work or commenting on how it affects society.
1.3.2.4.3. Pro: Some scientists and science journalists focus on popularity and agendas, not facts.
1.3.2.4.3.1. Con: None of the incredible scientific [achievements](https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/284158.html) of the 20th century, or indeed of any time, would have been possible if scientists only focused on being popular rather than facts.
1.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Scientific achievements like the [eradication of smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication) are facts than can easily be proven by the fact that smallpox does not exist in humans anymore.
1.3.2.5. Pro: The public are continuously under threat of being misinformed about science for political, social, and economic reasons.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: Science can be a sterile tool of indoctrination.
1.3.2.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: Science is revered as an institution, and has authority and influence.
1.3.2.5.1.3. Pro: As a conceptual method, science is perceived as rigorous, replicable, and logical.
1.3.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Because science is somewhat logical, rigorous, and replicable, people can easily get indoctrinated into thinking that its conclusions are infallible.
1.3.2.5.1.4. Con: Historically, science became so revered precisely because it rejected authority and replaced it with open-mindedness and sceptical enquiry. If anything, it is the antidote to indoctrination.
1.3.3. Pro: The scientific community does little to combat [misrepresentation](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/6/11/18652225/hype-science-press-releases) of science in the media.
1.3.3.1. Pro: [Many journalists](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/6/11/18652225/hype-science-press-releases) just follow the lead of press releases without further investigation.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Scientific papers are, in actuality, very modest in their findings, but are often extrapolated by non-scientists to gain attention in the media.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Media reports on [scientific papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC400292/)(The classification analysis ranked the reporting of risks as the most important variable in determining the categorization of newspaper articles. Only 15% of the newspaper articles and 5% of the scientific journal articles discussed costs or risks, whereas 97% of the newspaper articles and 98% of the scientific journal articles discussed the likelihood of benefits of the research.) tend to highlight the potential of such innovations, while ignoring the potential pitfalls.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Because scientific papers are not freely available to the public, it is difficult to refute or confirm media's presentation of the research.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Scientists still need to make a living, so publishing their work for free, even if it is to combat misrepresentation, comes at too high a personal cost.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: [A statistical study](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/how-many-scholarly-papers-are-web-least-114-million-professor-finds/) estimates that at least 27 million academic papers are freely available online.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Neil deGrasse Tyson and other physicists have gained much attention and notoriety in the media despite the important [discoveries](https://www.space.com/31900-gravitational-waves-discovery-ligo.html) of astrophysicists who are for the most part unknown to the public.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: The relative notoriety of famous physicists does not necessarily undermine the discoveries of their colleagues.
1.3.3.4.1.1. Pro: Famous physicists can use their platform to spread the word about the discoveries.
1.3.3.4.1.2. Con: Famous physicists are not gaining popularity on a comparable rate as their less socially appealing Scientists and discoveries, alluding to a real disparity in their notoriety.
1.3.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Gained notoriety of science popularizers does not effectively reflect on the notoriety of lesser known works/figures in science.
1.3.3.4.2. Con: Not all scientists can or want to be known by the public.
1.3.3.5. Con: Journalists are usually laypeople and not trained and certified physicists who understand highly complex scientific theories. As such, journalists are not part of the scientific community and their mistakes do not reflect on science but on their work as journalists.
1.3.4. Con: It is practically impossible to publicize false ideas as a scientist due to the large competition in the field.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Researchers will always have self-motivated peers wanting to test, replicate, or repudiate their ideas. This is because it is in their interest to author papers, and papers are usually on one of these three things.
1.3.4.2. Pro: There is increasing ['citation inequality'](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2012208118) in which the top-1% most-cited scientists are commanding a larger share of cumulative citations. This means that for the other 99%, there is increasingly intense competition to produce cited papers.
1.3.4.3. Con: Truth is not necessarily a product of competition, especially if the competition is for profit.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Nobel prizes are often given to scientists who disprove established facts. Therefore, there is no reason for one scientist to cover for another.
1.3.5. Con: Science as a concept is objective, the problem is the media [cherry-picking](https://effectiviology.com/cherry-picking/) how and what to present, and the people who keep [spreading](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/04/18/why-people-cherry-pick-science-dataits-happening-with-coronavirus/?sh=7d27ea571a21) that.
1.3.5.1. Pro: In essence, anything can be twisted by the media - this is not unique to science in any way.
1.4. Science is frequently misapplied and politicised.
1.4.1. Pro: [Scientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism) is used to force-fit poor methods into philosophy, ethics, and humanities.
1.4.1.1. Pro: In ["the moral landscape"](https://theobjectivestandard.com/2012/11/sam-harris-unscientific-morality/), Sam Harris attempts to create a model for an objective morality based on "well being" using science. However, he fails to explain why the pursuit of well being has any normative force.
1.4.2. Con: Criticizing science because it is imperfect, is a perfect example of the [nirvana logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy). Valid criticism would need to try to show that science is more biased than other alternatives, not that scientists are imperfect.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If science is severely discredited without providing a [better alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), people will find worse approaches to searching for truth, such as superstition and tribalism.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: None of the alternatives to science are better.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are not other options to science, than "[alternative science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_science)" such as [fringe science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_science), [parascience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parascience), [protoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoscience), [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience), or [unexamined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living) or un-systematic or emotional \(tribalistic or evolutionary\) approach to problems.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Science, like everything else, is never perfect. Also, scientific inquiry does not provide absolute confidence. However, these are advertised weaknesses by those with no better alternatives.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Also, humans can never have \(and do not need\) complete confidence to act. We need only to believe, with pretty good evidence, that one path is probably better for us than the others.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Scientific analysis is often the best way to identify which direction has the most potential benefits and the fewest likely costs.
1.4.2.3. Pro: An argument against science based on "twisting" \(bias\) and loss of objectivity is an oxymoron because the purpose of science is to remove these things. This is like criticizing AAA because people relapse without comparing it to other treatment methods.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Science can be distorted in ways that are impactful. This drawback can exist in AAA. If AAA attendees are increasingly relapsing and losing the qualities required to recover, this would be a legitimate problem.
1.4.2.4. Con: It is possible to discuss science's flaws in their own right, even if ultimately it's still the best methodology we have.
1.4.3. Pro: Many questions of deep importance to people can not be addressed by science. This can leave the impression that science is "distorted" in failing to even register those issues.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Questions of meaning, value, purpose, etc, can not be phrased in terms of testable hypotheses.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Questions about experienced outcomes if some action were taken may depend on the state of the world, and of the individual, in ways that prevent controlled experiment.
1.4.3.3. Con: Science does not purport to answer all of life's questions, so holding it to this standard is too high a bar.
1.4.3.4. Con: Many people seek answers to important questions from other sources like religion. By doing this, they tacitly acknowledge that science does not and cannot answer all life's questions.
1.4.4. Con: If scientific observations are politicized and misapplied, that's not a failing of science.
1.4.4.1. Pro: A significant portion of the twisting is done by those outside the scientific community, so they should be blamed for the loss of objectivity.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: It is common for newspapers to use [sensationalized titles and desciptions](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/3/3/14792174/half-scientific-studies-news-are-wrong) that misrepresent scientists.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Media may present parts of research or use descriptive terms instead of numbers to advance an opinion.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: A media outlet may say "A majority of Group X voting for John Doe led to his victory." The polls say that 51% of Group X voted for John Doe and that Group X accounts for 10% of the vote."
1.4.4.2. Con: By clearly delineating the parameters of their research, scientists can play an important role in limiting misapplication and politicization as it will be harder for others to wantonly misapply and politicize it.
1.4.5. Pro: Scientific conclusions are habitually taken beyond their logical indications to aid external agendas.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Science is guilty of perpetuating the same oppressive ideologies, such as sexism and racism, that are prevalent in society. Thus, scientific conclusions appear to be tainted by bias and prejudice, much like any other way of knowing and understanding reality.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Psychology, especially evolutionary psychology, is founded upon [sexist premises](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/evpsych/chapter/is-evolutionary-psychology-sexist-or-racist/).
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The term "histrionic personality disorder" derives from the word "hysteria" which was originally coined to refer to a condition caused by a [wandering womb](https://www.wired.com/2014/05/fantastically-wrong-wandering-womb/).
1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Historically, particularly in the mid 20th century, [hysterectomies](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287736) were performed unnecessarily.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: Many fields have sexist or racist roots, yet it is the way in which they remedy this that speaks to their current ideology. Psychological education is focused on the missteps in the community's history, educating young minds on these faulty premises.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: The scientific method is not designed to perpetuate any ideology.
1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.4.5.3. Con: Scientific conclusions have also helped the whole of humanity to [face pandemics and diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/), which proves that they remain as objective as possible.
1.4.6. Con: Science can be preserved from distortion.
1.4.6.1. Con: A framework trying to protect science from distortion, such as peer review, would itself probably be biased or fallible since it would be drawn up by humans who are biased and fallible themselves.
1.4.6.2. Pro: There are ways to combat spreading of scientific misinformation after sound conclusions are reached.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Education on the philosophy of science and on the fields of statistics should equip scientists with the logical rules that prevent errors in research and experiments.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: Education about logical rules is a necessary but insufficient condition. Since science is not built on deductive reasoning alone, but primarily inductive reasoning, even if the deductive reasoning is flawless, the research and experiments may still be distorted.
1.5. Over time, scientific inquiry develops abstract and/or counter-intuitive claims, which may offend the "common sense" sensibilities of the uninformed.
1.5.1. Pro: Common sense would suggest that the sun moves around a flat earth. Accommodating a Copernican view requires some cognitive readjustment, and may present metaphysical challenges, as well.
1.5.2. Con: These are examples of discovery, not “distortion".
1.5.3. Pro: [Theories of quantum mechanics and relativity](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/einstein-and-science-s-assault-on-common-sense/)(Quantum mechanics and relativity shattered our common-sense notions about how the world works. The theories ask us to believe that an electron can exist in more than one place at the same time, and that space and time--the I-beams of reality--are not rigid but rubbery. Impossible! And yet these sense-defying propositions have withstood a century’s worth of painstaking experimental tests.) can appear to defy common sense, even among experts in the field.
