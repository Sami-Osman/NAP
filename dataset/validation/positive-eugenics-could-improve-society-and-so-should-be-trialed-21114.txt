Discussion Name: Positive Eugenics Could Improve Society; and so should be trialed.

1. Positive Eugenics Could Improve Society; and so should be trialed.
1.1. Con: Governments \(being the only way to try positive eugenics\) have a responsibility to provide for equal protection of the laws and should respect the equal dignity among men, regardless of the cost.
1.2. Pro: Some people may want to engage in positive eugenics in order to provide the best life possible for their children.
1.2.1. Pro: The ability to select embryos with the most desirable traits is already available today. There is no rational reason why a couple cannot be allowed to select the best embryo for implantation into the womb.
1.2.2. Con: The government should not have any more power over people's reproductive rights and the people should not be expected to pay taxes for this.
1.2.2.1. Con: Eugenics does not have to be run by the government. In fact, the government would simply get out of the way of people choosing their own embryos.
1.2.3. Con: It is incredibly difficult to determine what is the best life possible for a child, making the decisionmaking very subjective and potentially harmful as it's more likely to be based on normative standards.
1.3. Pro: There is no reason why scientific principles cannot be applied to human reproduction.
1.4. Pro: Postive eugenics can potentially remove negative traits from populations.
1.4.1. Pro: Illnesses and diseases could be all but eliminated.
1.4.1.1. Con: Not all diseases are curable this way, as not all diseases are hereditary.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: This doesn't stop it being potentially worthwhile to eliminate whatever we can.
1.4.1.2. Con: [Gene therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy) is a better solution.
1.4.2. Con: It could also cause untold consequences on the genepool of the area trialing it.
1.5. Con: Positive eugenics would increase income inequality.
1.5.1. Pro: More people would be born with a rich background and better starting position in life while the number of people that are born poor would remain unaffected by positive eugenics.
1.6. Con: Genetics is much more complex than we know, hereditary diseases are usually caused by a multitude of genes; positive eugenics are impractical.
1.7. Con: It is a slipperly slope and will likely lead to a form of eugenics more like the negative one that caused so much grief in the 20th century.
1.7.1. Con: Nazi eugenics were based on the unscientific belief that some "races" were inferior. Modern scientific knowledge of human genetics clearly does not provide any justification that some human groups are superior or inferior.
1.7.1.1. Con: Although science may examine human genom, it refrains from assessments of value, like "superiority". Therefore science does not say which genom is superior or inferior.
1.8. Pro: Positive eugenics could lead to a more educated population.
1.8.1. Con: This depends on the educational system, not on individual genetics.
1.8.2. Pro: People with a higher IQ could be incentivised to have more children.
1.8.2.1. Con: Any incentive for more intelligent people to have children than less intelligent people amounts to intellectual discrimination, and as such cannot constitute positive eugenics.
1.9. Con: It is wrong for the state to give rewards for some people to have children and not to others, it is a blatant form of discrimination.
1.9.1. Con: Most countries officially discourage incestuous procreation, even where this is between consenting adults. Discrimination is justified here since it is preventing the spread of genetic disease.
1.9.1.1. Con: There is a difference between punishing incest, which has negative effects on a third party -- the child -- and rewarding those who are deemed genetically preferable by some third party. Discrimination is justified in some cases, but not in all.
