Discussion Name: Should all religions be banned on a global scale?

1. All religions should be banned on a global scale.
1.1. Con: It is impossible and therefore useless to try.
1.1.1. Con: Historical banning of religion succeeded in ending practices. It might also work with a global ban.
1.1.1.1. Pro: According to the USCIRF [1], in North Korea, “Freedom of religion or belief does not exist and is, in fact, profoundly suppressed.” Citizens are expected to worship the state, and in particular, leader Kim Jong-un. Persecution of believers in any religious faith is the overt policy of the government, though there are refugee accounts of perhaps 1.2% to 5.1% of North Koreans secretly practising religion there anyway.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Sudan operates under a strict interpretation of Shari’ah law, enforcing hudood penalties on both Muslims and non-Muslims. The USCIRF says the country opposes the establishment of any Christian communities, and that it has been arresting Christian leaders. www.uscirf.gov [2]
1.1.1.3. Pro: The Saudi Arabian Mutaween (Arabic: مطوعين‎), or Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (i.e., the religious police) prohibits the practice of any religion other than Islam. Conversion of a Muslim to another religion is considered apostasy, a crime punishable by death if the accused does not recant. www.uscirf.gov [3]
1.1.1.4. Pro: Uzbekistan for a long time enforced adherence to a particular interpretation of Islam. In addition, “Members of Protestant denominations were subjected to frequent harassment through raids on private homes, seizures of religious literature, and the levying of fines,” says the USCIRF. Kazakhs and Russians have been arrested entering the country with religious materials, out of stated suspicions of terrorist intent. www.uscirf.gov [4]
1.1.1.5. Con: There is a crucial difference between banning one or a few religions and locally so, compared to banning all of them globally.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: There is no formal or informal organisation that could provide such a ban globally.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Historically successful bans were not approved worldwide - there were always some strong parties oposing such a decision, that might have collectively be stronger than the banning side, yet didn't get involved as it was not their teritory.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Local banning of religion(s) were made when those religions were small minorities and all religious people in world are in vast majority [5].
1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Local banning makes it possible for people to leave the region of ban, while it won't be possible for a global ban.
1.1.1.5.3. Con: Even if a local ban of religion could be easier to put in place, it would still represent an authoritative imposition on people's freedom.
1.1.1.5.4. Pro: Historically successful banning have been in many cases related to getting rid of all, but one religion or even only one, which still left a possiblity to being engaged in some religion.
1.1.1.5.5. Pro: Historically successful bans were aiming at only some religions - mostly replacing it with the other(s). As such getting rid of all would leave an empty space, that in those bans was filled by other religion.
1.1.1.6. Con: Historical bannings were aimed not only at religion as an instituition, but often on belief as such and/or personal practice. Such a nature of ban might have led to higher effectiveness than banning only institutional aspects.
1.1.2. Pro: This would just push religion underground.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Many deeply religious people would simply ignore a ban and continue to practice regardless of the legal consequences.
1.1.2.2. Pro: History has many examples of people worshiping religion in secret after a ban [6] of that religion by the law [7].
1.1.3. Pro: Religion is one of the primary proponents to a worldview. It is utterly impossible to ban all religions, as you would have to erase everyone's thought process, based on their worldview.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Religion cannot be removed from the world without also removing a major piece of almost every culture's traditions, values, and history.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Many cultural traditions are laden with religious history, background, and origins.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There is an extensive list of things in history that should not be glorified.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Senicide [8] and Human Sacrifice [9] among the North American native religions would be a good example of this.
1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: We can strike the middle ground- we don't have to glorify everything, but neither need we eliminate these important parts of cultures.
1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: For example, we should not glorify what the Japanese did in WWII, but we don't need to eliminate Shinto shrines or forbid people from stopping and praying at them.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Religions have already come and go, the cult of Râ [10], Zeus [11], Odin [12] all disappeared in practice, they live on in history books and iconic cultural references. They did not "disappear" but their role changed.
1.1.3.2. Pro: It is impossible, believing in something nourishes the human mind.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Banning religion has failed throughout history because belief is more powerful than oppression.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: A ban would be impractical and counterproductive, best would be to create an environment where religions would naturally disappear because their uselessness would be made manifest.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: People will believe secretly in a religion
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to control the beliefs that a person holds, even if they are not allowed to share those beliefs or practice the traditions that accompany them.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: There is a long history of governments and monarchies attempting to ban particular religions or denominations, only for believers in those faiths to continue to practice in secret.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Religion is a primal human need. It is a consequence of the development in Homo sapiens of an abnormally large prefrontal cortex. This has made self consciousness possible and once that exists, the need for a belief in the continuance of existence beyond this earthly sphere is inevitable.Neuropsychotherapist - The prefrontal Cortex [13]
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Religion as a set of beliefs could never be banned because people will still believe something and will end up inventing new systems of beliefs, though they may not call them religion
1.1.3.3. Pro: We are so intertwined with religion that it would be impossible to un-link our current culture. If we were to ban religions we would still keep the impact they have had on us but lose the context and prevent them from evolving.  As long as people feel strongly about ideas we will always have the negatives from religions anyway.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Only an estimated of 1.1 Billion individuals [14] identify as nonreligious.
1.1.3.5. Con: One may ban organisational activities that are connected to religion.
1.1.4. Pro: The line distinguishing what is and is not an organized religion is can be blurry and difficult to establish.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Some religions just offer spiritual guidance but present huge differences with other organized faiths. It would be very difficult to draw a line when implementing a ban.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: There is no clear definition of "religion" - and even "inside" a religion there can be different orientations. E.g. Buddishm [15] can be lived as very personal path to enlightment (Zen for example) or with pure emphasis on ritual worship.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #16677: Buddhism is not a religion.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: For example, many self-described Buddhists claim that Buddhism is not a religion, but a philosophical orientation, like stoicism. Meanwhile, while certainly a single, organized institution, Unitarian Universalism allows for such diverse beliefs that some would consider it a stretch to call it a religion.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Pro: There is no way to identify whether a movement is a religion except if they self identify as such.
1.1.5. Con: The likelyhood of impossibility does not necessarily mean it is useless to try. Anything worth having or gaining is worth trying for, even if you're unsuccessful. Better to try than do nothing.
1.1.5.1. Con: This ignores opportunity cost [16].
1.1.5.2. Pro: Even if the ban as such in current state of World is not possible one can work (via less radical means) toward creating a World in which such a ban will be possible/worth the price.
1.1.6. Pro: It is generally a bad idea to ban beliefs. There would be no practical way to do it without privileging or prejudicing beliefs based on the power of whoever is making the judgements as to what qualifies as a religion.
1.1.6.1. Pro: To dismiss thousands of years of wisdom accrued by thousands of people and groups across numerous environments far harsher than our own seems fantastically arrogant not to mention un-scientific and runs counter to Darwinian thought. After all, if this collected wisdom brought us through plagues, famine and war it must have conferred some survival benefit.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Religion is about belief, and so society would have trouble banning it, unless we could reliably read minds.
1.1.6.3. Con: It is possible to ban practices and behaviors associated with religion, at least in the public and institutional sphere, without trying to ban individual beliefs.
1.1.7. Con: The non-religious population has increased over time [17], and is continuously rising, suggesting that a ban is possible.
1.1.7.1. Con: Religious people in general (especially Muslims) tend to have more children, than atheists [18], therefore such a trend could not persist for long.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Muslim immigrants in Europe have more children [19] compared to their European counterparts.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: The fertility rate of Muslim women around the world has been on a decline [20].
1.1.7.1.2.1. Pro: In Austria [21], the fertility rate among Muslim women has declined from 3.1 children per woman in 1981 to 2.3 children per woman in 2001.
1.1.7.1.2.2. Con: The fertility rate among Muslim women is still much higher (~75% more children per women) than among Catholics.
1.1.7.1.2.2.1. Con: Catholics are not atheists, therefore the relative fertility of them to Muslims is irrelevant.
1.1.7.2. Con: Projected religious breakdown for 2050 [22] (page 45) [study from 2010] shows that share in world's population taken by unaffiliated religiously people will decrease significantly (from 16.4% to 13.2%).
1.1.7.3. Con: Projected share in unaffiliated popuation for 2060 [23] (made in 2015) shows that atheist numbers would increase just sighlty, therefore their share in world population would decrease significantly (from 16% to 13%).
1.1.7.4. Con: Being non-religious does not make you anti-religious.
1.1.7.5. Con: The fact of non-religious population rising makes perspective of religion ending more realistic, but it's not enough to assume that ban is possible. It would be better for the erosion of religion to occur naturally, as a ban would create a persecution complex.
1.2. Con: Religion can provide certainty, hope, unity and a sense of continuity in changing times.
1.2.1. Con: It can also provide the opposite.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See discussion #8539: Religion has been a good thing for humankind.
1.2.3. Con: Religion helps you feel that justice will always be served by god and you will be rewarded for your good deeds. It is inherently dangerous as it incentivize good deeds when those should be supported by the conviction of it being the only way to make our world a better place. Instead, believing in god's justice leave criminals free such as in the case ofcatholic church sexual abuses [24]
1.2.3.1. Con: A rightfull government can coexist with a proper religion, both have as aim the regulation of people interaction: the former with rules and order, while the second with faith and love. God's justice (the concrete one that motivate good changes within people conscience while living) in this sense helps people to move on even when laws (just or unfair) fail to apply.
1.2.4. Con: Religions quite probably provide false hope which is worse than no hope at all.
1.2.4.1. Con: Hope can be a motivating factor to improve, to fight and to resist and so having hope (even if it based on false premises) may still be beneficial.
1.2.5. Con: Rational human being should be able to find all of those from people close tho them e.g. family and friends. Scientific research can help us accept the fleeting nature of life and appreciate those moments given to us.
1.2.6. Con: Religion is just a replaceable psychological support providing a sense of meaning, progress and security in daily life. Seen as a tool, it has many unwanted side effects when compared to philosophy, psychotherapy and other useful tools based on unbiased observation and research.
1.2.7. Pro: Religion can bring a sense of hope and inspiration to people.
1.2.7.1. Con: The ends do not justify the means. Hope and inspiration can also be provided by dangerous ideologies e.g. Jim Jones [25] or life destroying drugs e.g amphetamines [26].
1.2.7.2. Pro: Martin Luther King Jr. was famous for religious rhetoric, which fantastically pervaded many of his writings and speeches [27].
1.2.7.2.1. Con: Martin Luther King Jr. is not a good example of a religious role model due to his deception [28] and sexual impropriety [29].
1.2.7.2.1.1. Pro: The origin of a claim does not deny the truth of the claim.
1.2.8. Pro: In a changing world, religion provides a sense of continuity
1.2.8.1. Con: Religion is primarily a divisive rather than a uniting practice in society.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Buddhist leadership and controversy over the next Dalai Lama is an up-and-coming issue that is divisive, particularly with China's own input on the matter.
1.2.8.1.2. Pro: Christianity has particularly provided some increased division of issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, sexual choice, and abortion rights.
1.2.9. Pro: Religion can provide social cohesion.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Religion provides a community for some people where they are with others that share the same beliefs who allows them to feel that they are not alone.
1.2.9.2. Con: It more often provide social rift.
1.3. Con: One of the most harmful things you can do to an individual or community is place restrictions (or bans) on what they can think or believe. Any supposed benefits are far outweighed by the very real danger.
1.3.1. Con: Religion itself is a form of control that puts restrictions on individuals.
1.3.1.1. Pro: We humans developed religions & rituals to quiet the 'bumps' in the night and to give a purpose to a seemingly unrelenting work or die life. As we became more communal, laws, punishments and customs were developed to control societies. Religions are mind governments and police individual thought. It's time for each individual to uncover the controls and rid them inside their own valuable life for themselves.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: This fails to actually distinguish the needs for religion from the modern needs for laws and efforts to control society. It also presumes that religion does not provide a means for an individual to become free of the things that control their lives, and thus misses the main point of spiritual and religious paths, which is freedom from control and baser desires.
1.3.1.2. Con: Control is a negatively charged synonym for mental model or framework.
1.3.1.3. Con: The question is whether or not we should go so far as to ban something -- or should we see about taming or pruning its ugliest branches instead.
1.3.1.4. Con: Removing control through a ban amounts to just more control. Forced emancipation is not emancipation. To relieve them of the control they must come to realize what it is themselves.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: The best we can do to help is to provide education at a young age when the religious begin indoctrination.
1.3.1.5. Con: Religion is as much a form of control as any club, sport group or racial affiliation. Religion in modern civilization isn't a barrel to your head. It's something you are usually born into and have the freedom to walk away from as you mature. As with all ideologies, you will inevitably acquire a healthy dose of good and bad information.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: It is not always possible to walk away from religions easily, as there are often hard repercussions of the community, ranging from social isolation to murder.
1.3.1.5.2. Con: People do not choose the religion they are born into, so it can not be equated with clubs or sport groups.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Believing in anything is personal, so it does not need an organised structure to control what is believed. Therefore, the main pupose of religion, historicall has been mass social control: without religion, we are in control of our own beliefs.
1.3.1.6.1. Con: There are plenty of other forms of mass social control, like state propaganda, industry interest groups and advertisement. So we wouldn't be entirely in control of our own beliefs.
1.3.1.7. Con: Control in itself is not a bad thing.
1.3.1.7.1. Pro: Governments are a form of control.
1.3.1.7.2. Pro: Boards of directors [30] are a form of control to prevent an organisation's officers from mismanaging the shareholders/public funds or stealing from it.
1.3.1.7.3. Pro: Parenting is a form of control.
1.3.1.7.4. Con: Control in itself may not be a bad thing, but religion is a form of control of your belief. It can be harmful if it is manipulated (and become a bad thing).
1.3.1.7.5. Pro: Laws, for example, are a form of control.
1.3.1.7.6. Con: Control is a way for the elite to remove freedom.
1.3.1.7.6.1. Con: Control is also a way for the non-elite to control the elite.
1.3.1.7.6.1.1. Pro: The SEC [31] is a way to control the financial elite from defrauding the common investors and ruining the economy for the non-elite.
1.3.1.7.6.1.2. Pro: The three level of government is a way to control the ruling elite so the president does not become an absolute monarch.
1.3.1.7.7. Pro: Locked doors are a form of control.
1.4. Con: Religion has moral and life lessons to imbue upon its adherents.
1.4.1. Con: What religion teaches depends on what the learner focuses on, so the idea that religions teach specific lessons is not universally applicable within those religions.
1.4.2. Pro: The divorce rate [32] is significantly lower for Muslim and Jewish countries, possibly, thanks to religion.
1.4.2.1. Con: This isn't necessarily a good thing, especially if the cause is the religion forbidding divorce. If a religion forbids divorce, you can't leave it even if the marriage is abusive or just generally isn't working well, in which case not divorcing might be worse than divorcing.
1.4.3. Pro: Religion tells us a lot about the human condition and how we interpreted consciousness in ancient times.
1.4.4. Pro: Religions should not be banned because at least one religion is likely true. Banning all religions would require humans to likely believe in falsehood.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Christianity is likely true.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #44455: Jesus was physically resurrected from the dead.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: The Bible reports the supernatural, an artificially created world and certain gifts or powers which can only be acquired. These claims are at the foundation of Christianity. The supernatural, artificial creation and things that need to be acquired are far from the term 'true'.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: From the definition of 'true' [33]: 'Conforming to the actual state of reality or fact.' From the definition of 'real' [34]: 'True, genuine, not merely nominal or apparent.' Synonym of 'real' [35]: '(That has physical existence) actual' Synonym of 'genuine' [36]: 'natural' From the definition of 'natural' [37]: 'Existing in the nature of a person or thing; innate, not acquired or learned.' Also: 'Formed by nature; not manufactured or created by artificial processes.'
1.4.4.2. Con: Banning religion as defined in this debate is about banning institution rather than banning belief as such. Therefore even after banning religions the faith may survive. Thus even if statements of some religion are true in personal belief they might still be followed.
1.4.4.3. Con: Even if religions as such hold some share of truth most probably there are not completly true and the truth is shared by at least a few of them and part of it is still not known / false in each.
1.4.5. Con: Religions, however, tend to end up competing against each other, leading to moral and, by extension, political conflict.
1.4.6. Pro: Many religions teach humility and honesty.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Buddhism is one such example.
1.4.7. Pro: Religion and spirituality bring people closer to God.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Like all rivers in the world merges with the vast oceans on the Earth in the same way all religions on the Earth are a way to Higher Almighty God. Religions are paths to lead the human civilizations to the ultimate high soul. If it is banned then we are closing the ways for the human civilizations to reach the almighty God.
1.4.7.2. Con: Not all religions are focused on "God."
1.4.7.3. Con: God doesn't exist. They are encouraged to worship something that references nothing. This is the essence of idolatry, which the Bible forbids. So from a biblical perspective, at least Judaeo-Christian religion(s) should be banned.
1.4.7.3.1. Pro: The celestial Santa Claus hypothesis is so unlikely to be true that it should be dismissed as an option until further evidence presents itself. To cast this into policy would make this easier to move to higher definitions of truth with actual objects attached.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: God, in the Spinozan sense [38], surely exists, therefore we should seek to exchange definitions and reject celestial grandfather notions. "Celestial grandfather" being defined as any set of attributes or definitions for deity approaching an anthropomorphic, localized, wish or curse casting entity.
1.4.7.3.3. Con: From a biblical perspective or Judaeo Christian perspective, Idols are other Gods created by man that are worshiped as a substitute for the God of the bible, or the God of Isaac, or the God of Abraham and Moses. They all teach that only one God exists (the prophets believed God exists) and any other Gods are false Gods. Therefore religion should not be banned from a Judaeo Christian or biblical perspective. For the bible says God exists.
1.4.8. Pro: Religion can create a pathway to deeper understanding and connection to the world around us.
1.4.8.1. Con: There are other paths to connection and understanding.
1.4.9. Con: If one can live every day as a good, conscientious human being; having sympathy, empathy, unselfishness and care for all living things on this planet, no religion is needed.
1.4.10. Con: They are not mutually inclusive. Aesop's fables teach many lessons without being religious, and morals do not need threats of hellfire, brimstone, and pillars of salt to be effective.
1.4.11. Con: Our conception of moral is inherited from our religions. What is moral from a religious perspective is not necessarily right from a humanist perspective. Moral is the definition of good/wrong behaviour, but we might not agree on its definition [39]. Moral can exist without religion.
1.4.12. Con: There are many calls to murder [40] in the Bible.
1.4.12.1. Pro: In 2 Kings 10:18-27 [41], God orders the murder of all the worshipers of a different god in their very own church.
1.4.12.1.1. Con: 2 Kings 10:18-27 [42] doesn't mention God ordering Jehu's actions.
1.4.13. Pro: Religion promotes faith, which is a good characteristic and trait to teach children, even if when they are older they do not believe in the religion itself.
1.4.13.1. Con: The belief (faith) in the unexplainable and the submission to the hierarchy creates cognitive biases in adults that alter their perception of the right or wrong. This leads to the justification of acts of terror, the hate of homosexual etc.
1.4.14. Pro: If religion were to be defined as a set of answers to the big questions (which is, at least in part) this may lead man to simply ignore the great questions of life, discourage thought, or reduce the value of human existence (at least on a global scale).
1.4.14.1. Con: Every human being can be curious about universal questions without religious beliefs due to science.
1.4.15. Con: More people might learn morality is largely subjective based on the culture we live in, leading to less hate. It is taught to everyone but atheists don't follow it to please god(s) or avoid his/her punishment.
1.4.16. Con: Most organised religions are Ponzi scheme [43]s design to extract wealth from their believer without compensating them by work. The moral aspect of a religion is a lie at its core.
1.4.16.1. Con: Many religions do not strictly require their members to pay the church, and those that do often return the favor by offering spiritually uplifting worship services.
1.4.17. Con: People who are not religious also have morality and teach good life lessons to their children. So, them having the same morality and good life lessons proves that it's source is not actually religion.
1.4.17.1. Con: The same people might have inculcated those values from their parents and their parents might have been religious. So the source might be religion.
1.5. Con: Humans are religious beings, banning their inherent curiosity and need for a reason of existence would be anti-human [44] in nature.
1.5.1. Pro: Denying human ideas about creation or where we came from, is a crime against humanity.
1.5.2. Pro: No human could be ok with banning a religions, because everyone has an idea of how we came to be, why, and what began everything.
1.5.2.1. Con: Only some ideas of "how we came to be, why, and what began everything" are religious in nature - typically those involving gods and other such superstitions.
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.5.3. Con: Many humans do not consider themselves to be "religious beings".
1.5.3.1. Con: Humans as a species tended to be religious for most of their existence.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The tendency of being religious in the past was caused by a lack of knowledge about the world, which is now filled with science.
1.6. Pro: Banning religions will decrease the number of people with religion-induced psychosis like religious delusion [45], schizophrenia [46], scrupulosity [47] and pathological religiosity [48].
1.6.1. Pro: Nowadays the greatest fear of any boy is the fear of God. [49]
1.6.2. Pro: There are similarities between religious experiences and psychotic episodes [50].
1.6.3. Pro: Any religion, that dogmatically and fundamentally works with fear, makes sick. [51]
1.6.4. Pro: The prevalence of religious delusions in schizophrenia is very high. [52]
1.6.5. Con: Ban of religion would lead to multiple mental breakdowns and social distress as it would be too drastical in a world that is still significantly religious. Therefore more dyplomatic/slow paced actions are required.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Study [53] shows that religious education can contribute to adolescent mental health in school setting - such as significant decrease in stress, alcoholism, and depression [54].
1.7. Pro: Religion might be anti-political.
1.7.1. Pro: Christianity might deny democracy. (If taking the Bible strict and literal.)
1.7.1.1. Pro: A Christian must seek [55] and support [56] a global monarchy which is governed by a supernatural king.
1.7.1.2. Pro: A Christian must not lean on his own understanding [57] (which might be the understanding of a democracy) but rather trust in the lord.
1.7.1.3. Pro: A Christian must not conform to the world [58] (democracy possibly might be one of its elements).
1.7.1.4. Pro: A Christian must follow the command of the religious authority and cannot give people anything to eat if they do not work [59].
1.7.1.5. Con: As a Christian it is believed that every person should be subject to the governing authorities. [60]
1.7.1.6. Pro: A Christian must obey god rather than men [61].
1.7.1.7. Pro: A Christian believes that there is no authority except from God [62].
1.7.1.7.1. Con: This teaching by Paul, and other similar teachings by Peter [63], continues on to suggest that authority is also held by governments [64], saying that "those [authorities] which exist are established by God".
1.7.1.8. Pro: A Christian believes that the authorities that exist have been instituted by God [65].
1.7.1.9. Con: Christians live in and have even founded many major democracies, showing many Christians choose not to deny democracy.
1.7.1.9.1. Pro: The US founding fathers were almost all religious [66].
1.7.1.10. Con: Germany has a Christian Democratic party [67].
1.8. Pro: Religion is detrimental to human progress.
1.8.1. Pro: Religion denies humanity the responsibility of Morality and wants to shackle us to itself in doing so.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Religions are keeping us chained to the notion that freewill [68] exists because it's the only answer they have for the problem of evil.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Freewill [69] doesn't exist.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.8.1.1.1.2. Con: This oversimplification is dodging a very complex nuanced conversation with no cut and dried conclusions. From G. E. Moore: "For hard determinism to be correct, there must be NO meaning of "could" (or "can") according to which a person could/can do other than x when the person actually did x. Since we CAN sometimes do other than x when we actually do x, hard determinism is wrong." Taken from analysis of G.E. Moore's position on hard determinism here. [70]
1.8.1.1.2. Con: Some religions are even incoherent in the fact that they admit freewill but also say that everything is written like predestination in Islam [71].
1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: It's possible to have free will and predestination. The article states that predestination is God knowing what choices will land you in hell or heaven as opposed to God choosing for you. He can can predict what will happen to a person based on the choices a person will make. This type of predestination or prophesy, is no different to predicting a child burning their hand on a fire. Drowning in water.
1.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Institutes 3.21.5 [72] Calvin said that "when we attribute prescience to God, we mean that all things always were, and ever continue, under his eye; that to his knowledge there is no past or future, but all things are present... [But] by predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation."
1.8.1.2. Pro: By asserting dominion over Morality, Religion inhibits and hinders Humanity's growth potential.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. There could be instances where religion has aided human growth, the idea of the "Protestant Work Ethic" for example.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Con: Protestant work ethics [73] or the idea that large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Morality can and should be anchored in science [74]. That is to say that moral questions can and must be answered by Science. We don't need Religion to get answers.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: Science is often indeterminate and is constantly evolving as our capabilities grow. Morality is a very time pertinent set of rules and cannot wait for the science to be sorted out.
1.8.1.3.2. Con: There are questions that science cannot and should not attempt to answer.
1.8.1.3.2.1. Pro: Eugenics and forced sterilization are scientific answers to the problem of poor genetics being passed on.
1.8.1.3.2.2. Pro: Any question that involves human dignity and autonomy requires an ethical approach that cannot be trivialized to a scientific principle; questions about medical tests [75] andexperimentation [76], genetic [77] manipulation and disciplines that impact the environment [78] are just a few examples of these.
1.8.1.3.2.3. Con: A rigorous scientific approach may not easily solve ethical problems, but it can provide optimal and 'correct' solutions that may arguably be better for 'humanity' than some religions.
1.8.1.3.2.4. Con: Dr. Mengele performed valuable [79] research and provided effective test material that religion had traditionally prevented from taking place.
1.8.1.3.3. Pro: Neurophilosophy [80] a fascinating new field of research is, so far, in support of a biological origin for morality [81].
1.8.1.4. Pro: We are at a point where we can no more respect and tolerate, vast differences in notions about the well-being of sentient creatures (morality), than we can respect and tolerate vast differences in the notions of how disease spreads, or safety standards in buildings and airplanes. 

We simply must converge, it's a question of survival.
1.8.1.4.1. Con: This does not necessitate converging into a society based strictly on a system of secular ethics.
1.8.1.4.1.1. Con: Be it Relativism, Natural Law, Categorical Imperative, Divine Command, etc. The need for convergence is no less urgent if we are to survive as a species.
1.8.2. Pro: Religion can be detrimental to intelligence.
1.8.2.1. Pro: In the past and also nowadays people who were declared as heretics [82] or also witches [83] have been tortured and executed which was at least partly motivated by the doctrine of a book which raises the question on how to make salt salty again [84].
1.8.2.2. Con: Religion is not the sole responsible for causing stupidity and idiocy.
1.8.2.3. Pro: Some religions have metaphysical claims that are logically fallacious or contradictory. Those can be proven to be wrong.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: When metaphysics is involved one should also assume that metalogic might be in play as well as metaphysical beings and events might not be restricted by logic in similar fashion as they are not by physics.
1.8.2.3.2. Pro: In the Bible it says that the heaven was created and then the heaven was created again and it actually was all water before [85].
1.8.3. Pro: Lack of religion can encourage free thinking and more rationality.
1.8.3.1. Con: Faith is not inherently irrational.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: Rationa [86]l: the quality of being based on or in accordance with reason or logic. Faith:firm belief in something for which there is no proof These are by definition mutually exclusive when applied to the same situation. Faith [87] is the antithesis of reason.
1.8.3.1.1.1. Con: Faith [88] is not defined as believing in something with no proof. It is simply defined as believing in something strongly.
1.8.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The second definition in the link given says exactly that it is believing with no proof.
1.8.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The lack of proof has no bearing on whether or not someone can have faith in something.
1.8.3.1.1.2. Con: By the logic of faith being a belief in something with no proof, one stating that they have faith in the science of a peer-reviewed study would not be a very valid statement.
1.8.3.1.1.2.1. Con: It is a straw man to criticize people for saying they have faith in science. One does not have faith in science or in reason.
1.8.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: People have strong convictions towards science and to reason, based on the prose presented by both, and therefore hold faith in both doctrines.
1.8.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is abundant evidence that science and reason work in the real world. Therefore to believe that they work is not faith based. Having strong conviction is not enough to classify something as faith.
1.8.3.1.1.3. Con: Logic [89] is not dependent on "proof." One can be perfectly logical without providing data or physical evidence. Therefore, being faithful [90] and being rational [91] are not mutually exclusive.
1.8.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Logic [92], is as the definition linked to states, a science. It uses induction and deduction to reach conclusions based on available knowledge and evidence. Making conclusions based on unsubstantiated claims is illogical.
1.8.3.1.2. Con: Faith is an abdication of rationality, it's belief without (and often against) knowledge or proof.
1.8.3.1.2.1. Con: Belief without proof is not inherently irrational.
1.8.3.1.2.1.1. Con: A belief without evidence is not a reasonable belief, because there is no rational cause for the perception to exist. A belief that goes against reason is by definition irrational.
1.8.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Evidence is not always necessary to form a reasonable belief- one merely experiences the world and tries to form logical explanations for it.
1.8.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: By forming a logical explanation from an experience one must be using reason and rationality.
1.8.3.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: World experience is a form of anecdotal evidence
1.8.3.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: A reasonable belief is, by definition, formed through reasons, evidence or justifications. Evidence is often defined as: "grounds for belief". A true belief with justification is knowledge [ according to the ancient Greeks anyway ].
1.8.3.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen". Hebrews 11:1 King James Version (KJV) [93].
1.8.3.1.2.1.2. Con: From the definition of reason (which implies the meaning of rational): a cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event.
1.8.3.2. Con: Free thinking ("forming opinions on the basis of reason independently of authority") is by definition [94] in direct opposition to this debates thesis. Banning people from thinking that God exists is an extremist authoritarian idea, which free thinkers would not accept.
1.8.3.3. Pro: In absence of irrational religious beliefs for them to hold on to, people will have no choice but to look at rational approach for explanations.
1.8.3.3.1. Con: Reason does not ride in on the vanishing coattails of religion.The opposite of religion, irrational or whatever, is not reason -- it's simply non-religion. Still other irrational beliefs and crazy mechanisms are even now waiting in the wings -- if history is any indicator of human tendencies.
1.8.3.3.2. Con: Assuming that people no longer hold "irrational religious beliefs", it is still possible that people hold irrational beliefs.
1.8.3.4. Con: The ground floor of irrational thought in humans is not religion. These are evolved tendencies and as such, must be admitted to have had adaptive benefits at some point in human development.
1.8.3.4.1. Con: That religion is not the source of irrational thought does not imply that it does not increase irrational thought or decrease rational thought.
1.8.3.4.1.1. Pro: Just as expressing anger can strengthen neural pathways for anger, increasing frequency -- expressing a belief in supernatural forces strengthens the neural pathways for belief without evidence.
1.8.3.4.2. Con: It is important to admit religion's role in the past and how it has shaped our world but Human beings are no longer ignorant of our world Science allows us to understand and survive in far better ways than religion has ever done.
1.8.3.4.2.1. Con: Admission of religion's role in the past as well as the recognition of science as a better method for understanding nature and improving human survival does not lead to banning religion as a method for increasing global levels of rational thinking. There is little evidence leading to this as a workable solution and thus, a ban is itself not scientific. It is simply tribalism .....yet again. This thesis proposes as a solution what it seeks to abolish.
1.8.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: Separation of church and state is all that is needed to theoretically stop religion from interfering with science since it removes its authority. As such there is no reason to think that any further measures are necessary to safeguard science.
1.8.3.5. Pro: Religions prevent people from reasoning freely as they're based on dogmas which are by definition incontrovertibly true. Therefore believing in a religion reduces liberty of thought, as religions generally don't tolerate the questioning of their fundaments.
1.8.3.5.1. Con: One may believe in a religion because one agrees with its dogma. Thus, an individual's free thought has led them to their belief by questioning that religion before joining.
1.8.3.5.2. Pro: It would be naive to think that religion is a free personal choice. Cases where people chose theirs are exceptions. For the rest of cases, religions is inherited either from one's family, cultural background or social environment, which would makes one's free thought on this matter even more difficult due to peer/social pressure.
1.8.3.5.2.1. Con: Likewise, one's thoughts would be dictated to a more secular thinking and subjective to the same departments (one's family, cultural background, or social environment). One would still be influenced by these same factors to believe in a secular belief, negating free thought once again, based on the idea that one's own free thoughts within a religion is solely based on these proponents.
1.8.3.5.3. Con: Religions do tolerate the questioning of their fundaments.
1.8.3.5.4. Con: Prohibiting the expression of religious thoughts is even more restrictive.
1.8.3.6. Con: Rational thinking and religion do not have to negate one another. Only the most fundamentalists alienate themselves from mainstream, secular societies.
1.8.3.7. Pro: Ethical understandings/moral code will evolve in accordance with the relevant context, rather than using outdated codes.
1.8.3.8. Con: For those people for whom religious participation is an essential part of community life, choosing faith is an extremely rational decision. Removing the possibility of this choice will not affect people's rationality, only their communities.
1.8.3.9. Con: Legality, not even existence of religion are going to change how people think.
1.8.3.10. Con: Banning religion would not make people more rational.
1.8.3.10.1. Pro: Banning religion would set many people into strikes, protests, and riots, which would be the opposite of rational thinking. Banning even one religion would have a tremendous amount of outrage and would be extremely oppressive, let alone all religions.
1.8.4. Con: Without God, there can be no objective measurement of what 'human progress' is.
1.8.4.1. Con: Human progress as a measurement from God would be subjective to God, not objective, as there is a lot of personal input going into a belief in God, and to follow such a belief is on a subjective prose.
1.8.4.2. Con: Progress can be depicted without any sort of dogmatic principles put in place.
1.8.4.3. Con: Since the concept of God relies upon personal experience alone, it cannot be objective by definition.
1.8.5. Con: Religion provides solace to humans upon the death of a loved one.
1.8.5.1. Con: Solace is not related to progress. Human progress can continue when one is comfortable and when one is not.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Solace can help people recover from trauma, quickening their return to functioning and thus contribution to the world.
1.8.5.2. Con: People being uncomfortable losing someone might be a motivation for innovating ways to keep people alive longer and in better health.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: Losing someone can result in much more than simply being "uncomfortable." It can be highly debilitating and even incapacitating.
1.8.5.2.1.1. Con: The debilitating and incapacitating effects of losing a loved one can be made worse if one thinks their loved one is being tortured in hell for all eternity.
1.8.5.2.2. Pro: There is nothing frightening about returning to nothingness or oblivion. It is comforting to know that there is absolutely zero chance that your loved one will be subjected to eternal torture from a benevolent, just and loving god.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Many people take comfort in religious ideas of people still "existing" or "being alive" via supernatural forces (becoming a spirit, becoming one with the world, looking down from heaven, etc.)
1.8.5.3.1. Con: They could also be looking up from Hell, writhing in eternal agony merely for the crime of not doing a public song and dance pledging allegiance to a hell-creating god.
1.8.5.4. Con: Solace is not solely the domain of religion and can be sought through therapy and counselling.
1.8.5.4.1. Con: Religion is generally free- there is no cost of attendance, for prayer, blessings, etc.- and thus more financially accessible than therapy and counseling.
1.8.5.5. Con: Religion also provides an infinite punishment for finite crimes. Far more comforting, in the secular view, is the zero chance of your loved one being mercilessly tortured after death for all eternity for finite crimes.
1.8.6. Con: Religion is a part of human progress.
1.8.7. Con: The very idea of progress is influenced by religion, such as Christianity, which believes that history as space where things happen and develops to an end (final judgment and paradise), unlike other ancient worldviews that saw history as cyclical.
1.8.8. Pro: The suggestion that an afterlife exists restricts incentive to progress with the life we have.
1.8.9. Pro: Religious organizations are responsible for many historical examples of inciting social regression.
1.8.9.1. Pro: The Inquisitions incited social regression.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: Galileo Galilei's imprisonment by the Catholic Church's Inquisition incited social regression.
1.8.9.1.1.1. Pro: Galileo Galilei was prevented from pursuing further studies, discoveries, and innovations which may have produced even more social progression.
1.8.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: "Publication of any of his works was forbidden, including any he might write in the future." en.wikipedia.org [95]
1.8.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: "He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisition. On the following day, this was commuted to house arrest, which he remained under for the rest of his life." en.wikipedia.org [96]
1.8.9.1.1.2. Pro: The reason for Galileo's imprisonment was that "he was found 'vehemently suspect of heresy', namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to 'abjure, curse and detest' those opinions." To demand a forced denial of Heliocentric Theory is a clear example of social regression.
1.8.9.2. Pro: Imprisoning progressive scientists incited social regression.
1.8.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.1.1.
1.8.9.3. Pro: Members of religious organizations committing criminal activity incited social regression.
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: Covering up criminal activity incited social regression.
1.8.9.3.2. Pro: Catholic Church sexual abuse cases throughout the 20th and 21st centuries has incited social regression.
1.8.9.4. Pro: The sale of Indulgences incited social regression.
1.8.9.4.1. Pro: "By the late Middle Ages, the abuse of indulgences [97], mainly through commercialization, had become a serious problem which the Church recognized but was unable to restrain effectively."
1.8.9.4.1.1. Pro: "Greedy commissaries sought to extract the maximum amount of money for each indulgence." en.wikipedia.org [98]
1.8.9.4.1.2. Pro: "Professional "pardoners" (quaestores in Latin) - who were sent to collect alms for a specific project - practiced the unrestricted sale of indulgences. Many of these quaestores exceeded official Church doctrine, whether in avarice or ignorant zeal, and promised rewards like salvation from eternal damnation in return for money." en.wikipedia.org [99]
1.8.9.4.2. Pro: "Indulgences [100] were, from the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, a target of attacks by Martin Luther and all other Protestant theologians."
1.8.9.5. Pro: Major religions have destroyed [101] invaluable knowledge records (book burning [102], book bans [103], etc) many times since mankind created writing.
1.8.9.5.1. Con: Religious-banning regimes like the USSR [104], Nazi Germany [105] or Khmer Rouge [106], among others, also destroyed [107] knowledge [108].
1.8.9.5.2. Con: Book burning is a way to control ideas and knowledge. A ban on a rich historical area of human thought and expression, while outdated by many measures, is likewise an effort to control ideas and knowledge. To focus on the destruction of "knowledge records" is to conflate goals and tactics.
1.8.9.5.2.1. Con: A ban on religion would not destroy knowledge it would ban belief and expression but that would not cause humans to lose any concrete knowledge. The knowledge of the history and belief systems would remain intact.
1.8.9.5.2.1.1. Con: A society that is willing to take the extreme tactic of banning a system of thought is certainly capable of destroying knowledge. A ban of this type is fascist and anti-democracy as well.
1.8.9.5.2.1.1.1. Con: In a democratic state, people can agree that their state may promote secular values and be secular. In the same manner, a state could vote to implement a ban on organized religion, and that would be democratic.
1.8.9.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The point at which the people of a democratic state might vote to have a broad ban on religion is the point at which one of two things are true: 1. Religion, in general, is no longer widespread and influential in public life or policy, thus calling into question whether a ban is needed. 2. If religion still has influence then such a ban would not pass a majority vote. A non-specific ban is quite unlikely to occur in a democratic state. This could happen in a totalitarian state, however. And has.
1.8.9.5.3. Con: The actions of a few religions canot be generalised to be the actions of all religions.
1.8.9.5.3.1. Pro: This is especially true because the definition [109] of religion does not explicitly state that they take part in such behaviour, and so theoretically a religion can exist which does not behave in such a way.
1.8.9.5.3.1.1. Con: While theoretically religions can exist that do not engage in this behavior, the issue is that historically, two of the biggest’ world religions have indeed participated in these actions.
1.8.9.5.3.2. Con: When these religions [110] represent 2.4 and 1.8 billion of believers and a combined 57% of the world’s religious population, they cannot be characterized as “a few religions” since they are the most impactful and the most spread around the globe.
1.8.9.5.4. Con: Religions have protected knowledge from destructive political movements such as the Pol Pot and Nazi regimes.
1.8.9.5.4.1. Con: This is like excusing the Nazi genocide of the jews by saying they did not subject black people to the same treatment so were "relatively" less racist...
1.8.10. Con: Religion has made great contributions to humanity.
1.8.10.1. Pro: Religion was instrumental in developing and providing charity and the first forms of welfare.
1.8.10.1.1. Pro: Some religions provide a method, reason and means to act charitable to other human beings. The Catholic Church for example runs over 25% of healthcare facilities worldwide [111].
1.8.10.1.2. Pro: The Catholic Church contributed greatly to the construction of social assistance and aid as far back as 370. [112]
1.8.10.1.3. Pro: Hospitals were founded, financed, and staffed by religions. An old French term [113] for hospital is hôtel-Dieu, "hostel of God."
1.8.10.2. Con: While this is true for the past, a lot of historically religious contributions to humanity are increasingly made by other means. At the same time, negative consequences of religion remain rather stable and will inevitably start to outweigh the benefits, if they don't already.
1.8.10.2.1. Pro: Social media to bring together local communities, social welfare programs to create a more humane society and help the poor, or scientific progress to understand life and the world around us.
1.8.10.3. Pro: A principle of the Sikh faith is to serve free food to anyone regardless of religious affiliation, gender, and social status. This is a great strive to conquering world hunger.
1.8.10.4. Pro: Religious Americans do almost double the volunteer [114] work of other Americans.
1.8.10.5. Pro: Research [115] by the Lilly School at Indiana University found Americans with a religious affiliation made average annual charitable donations of $1,590, versus $695 for those with no religious affiliation.
1.8.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.8.10.7. Con: There is no reason to believe religion would become good for humanity again.
1.8.10.8. Pro: Christiantiy has been integral to Western civilization.
1.8.10.8.1. Pro: Western civilization via Christianity has given us great works of art [116].
1.8.10.8.1.1. Pro: Western Civilization via Christianity has given the world great musical [117] compositions.
1.8.10.8.1.2. Con: Art also exists independently from religion and from western culture.
1.8.10.8.1.2.1. Con: Art can exist independently from religion, but the fact still remains that many of some of the greatest statues, paintings, music and writing, have been inspired by religion. The exploration of spirituality can and have often lead to artist trying to recreate the beauty of the spiritual.
1.8.10.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: For instance "Ode to Joy [118]" by Beethoven or "Hallelujah [119]" by Händel as great examples of art inspired by religion.
1.8.10.8.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Beethoven's religious beliefs [120] are a matter of controversy, the song is inspired by a Friederich Schiller's poem [121] that uses mythology and universal fraternity [122] and many see the song as a secular statement of freedom [123] against repression.
1.8.10.8.1.3. Con: Throughout history religion has had copious amounts of money and power, and consequently many religious works of art were commissioned. Had the money been elsewhere different pieces may have been made. It cannot be determined which would be subjectively better or worse.
1.8.10.8.1.3.1. Con: In a free market economy, the money goes where the consumer's interest is. Followers had to first be interested in spending money on their church in order for them to gain status, power and budget.
1.8.10.8.1.3.1.1. Con: The Catholic church sold forgiveness of sins. Not going to hell is pretty high up there when it comes to consumer interest.
1.8.10.8.1.3.1.2. Con: The world was not a free market economy at the time when many major religions showed up. Feudalism was not exactly a free market.
1.8.10.8.1.3.1.3. Con: Consumer interest in something does not mean it is a good influence on the consumers or the world.
1.8.10.8.2. Pro: Western Civilization via Christianity has given the world a great educational system.
1.8.10.8.2.1. Pro: The Christian church during the Dark Ages  saved vast amounts of scholarly records [124] and established universities [125] and libraries all over Europe.
1.8.10.8.2.1.1. Con: Religion tried to play with the monopoly of knowledge, and taught people from a christian church point of view and banned the books that said the oposite.
1.8.10.8.2.1.2. Con: That wasn't to support science, that was to monopolise knowledge (and thus power) and to destroy any writings that contradicted dogma.
1.8.10.8.2.1.3. Con: Religiously motivated burning of books [126] was commonplace and continues to this day.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4. Pro: The few examples of church opposition to scientific progress pale in comparison to its contribution to knowledge. For example, Galileo [127] was not killed or even imprisoned, just put under temporary house arrest and allowed to continue his work.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1. Con: The Catholic church used the Inquisition [128] to prosecute anyone who espoused  views deemed as heretic (for example, some scientific ideas) convicting people to different sentences, including death by burning.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1. Con: The Spanish Inquisition [129] is a perfect example of men, in this case the monarchy, defying clear religious doctrine for malicious self interests. It is an example of men abusing authority, not of actual religion abusing people. "Love your neighbor as yourself." Follow Christ, not men falsely claiming to represent Him.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: If organized religions are lead by men, and men are bound to malicious self interests, then it is likely that religions often fall prey to nefarious actions against fellow men.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Violence is not what religion is about. Even if you meet a so called 'infidel', violence is not the way to treat a human being.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many religious teachings promote violence.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are many passages within the main religious texts that exhort the adherents to kill all non-believers and that any who do not follow this "one true" religion are evil. Examples from the Torah and Bible [130] and from the Quran [131].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Quran [132] condemns apostates to death if they do not quickly repent and rejoin.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Historical texts are not written as a scientific paper, but most of them are written in a prose. A more right interpretation of these typical examples is a spiritual death. Nowadays, we attend to interpretate religious texts literally, however we find there true meaning between the lines; as is in life itself.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It can hardly be claimed that one interpretation is 'right'. Religious scholars have been arguing over the right interpretations for thousands of years with no obvious conclusion. Therefore it is just as viable to claim that literal death is the right interpretation rather than spiritual death.
For example, violent texts  in the Quran [133] and in the Bible [134].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: While some examples could be argued as meaning spiritual death, there are many others that extoll violence/murder be carried out on non-believers or those doing 'bad' deeds. It is hard to argue these are only meant to be taken as non-literal.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Christianity instills values of peace and non-violence.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: One of the 10 commandments is "thou shalt not kill".
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Christianity compels [135] its followers not to kill, commit adultery, or steal.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Contemporary law is not based at all on the 10 commandments. The first four are about god and the sabbath none of which appears in contemporary  western law. Honoring your parents may be expected but is not required. Killing is permitted under certain circumstances (self defense). Adultery and coveting goods are not illegal either. Theft and perjury are all that remain.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Even perjury has been watered down to varying degrees [136]. Generally it can only be illegal if you're lying to the police or under oath.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Religion has preached intolerance for centuries and persecuted people for just as long, people typically do not want to be persecuted and so it would seem that at least not all religions hold that you should treat all others as you would want to be treated.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Religion has historically had to catch up and modify its morality to fit the changing secular standards. If its moral code was truly beneficial it wouldn't have to play catch up to secular ethics.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The Bible [137] was used as both an argument for and against slavery [138].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The Catholic church preached as doctrine that the Jews were collectively responsible for deicide [139]. This belief fostered two millennia of antisemitism and was only repudiated [140] and removed as doctrine in 1962 during the second Vatican Council. This antisemitism was part of the environment that allowed Hitler's rise.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Religion moves too slow in regard to society therefore their values are too archaic to be useful
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Martin Luther Kings famously analogised [141] the struggle of the civil rights movement to the biblical story of Exodus [142], proving that religion is not archaic if recontextualised correctly.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Religion still to this day condemns the morality of the LGBT community, a practice modern western society condemns as bigotry.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: Religion can be used as a protective barrier to further discriminatory, or harmful views that would otherwise be seen as violations of rights. For example, refusing to provide services for LGBT+ individuals on the basis of exercising religious freedom.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5. Pro: The Catholic church molestation scandals [143] show that until pressed by secular authorities religious ones are content to hide their crimes.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.1. Con: The Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete [144] was founded in the 1940's by Fr. Gerald Fitzgerald to expose and help prevent child sexual abuse by the clergy.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Fitzgerald started to assist priests dealing with substance abuse but soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors. He did not bring them to justice and was against secular treatments [145] like psychiatry and psychology.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.1.2. Con: Fitzgerald recommended some priests to be laicized but, in general, most bishops chose to ignore [146] his recommendations and kept employing priests with sexual abuse history.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.1.3. Con: The center was closed [147] in the 1990s as the result of lawsuits over priests who had molested children while staying at the center or after being treated at the facility.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.1.4. Con: Abusive priests from all over the US where brought to the Monastery run by the Servants of the Paracletes since 1947. Very often, those priests were released to work with non-white and poor communities [148] and very often sexual abuses continued. In that sense, the church disposed of abusive priest in predominately white and mid-western communities to bring them to poorer and brown communities, without ever truly eradicating sexual abuse.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Fr. Edward Graff (included in the Pennsylvania grand jury report [149]) was moved from Allentown where the report alleges “raped scores of children” to the Monastery. Eventually, in 1980, he was released and worked in Texas and New Mexico until being arrested for sexually abusing [150] a minor. In the investigation, it was discovered he would employ and potentially abuse young and poor Hispanic youth. He died in prison before trial.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.2. Pro: A report estimated about 7% of clergy [151] had abused children between about 1950 and 2000.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.6. Pro: Christian responses to domestic abuse have been catching up to secular standards over the past 40 years. Many pastors [152] have said and many continue to say that they would never advise a women to leave an abusive husband, and many advise forgiveness and enduring.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.6.1. Pro: Recently church leaders such as the Pope and bishops have openly condemned this behavior and with more women pastors entering the ranks the responses are finally catching up to secular standards.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.7. Pro: Blasphemy laws [153] have been overturned slowly over time and some still exist. This runs counter to the secular ideal of free speech and is slowly being stripped away in the western world.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8. Con: Secular and religious ethics are vastly intertwined. In religious doctrines you are asked to do good and be good. This doesn't mean that religion introduced these ethics but it did help propagate them.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.1. Pro: Scholasticism [154] acted as a bridge between Greek and Roman knowledge and Christian theology, as a way of teaching that focused [155] on "logic, dialectic, and all the scientific disciplines known at the time".
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.1.1. Con: The fact that religious people did logical things does not imply that they did it because they were religious.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.2. Con: Secular ethics and religious ethics are distinguished by where they come from. A framework of secular ethics may have the same exact tenets as a religious one and yet be derived in a completely different way. It is also possible for them to have completely differing tenets. The definition of secular ethics is that it is not derived from religion thus the term secular. So without completely redefining the terms we are using it is impossible to say that they are the same.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.3. Con: While the set of secular morals/ethics can change and be added to as we learn, religion does not change. That makes religion a barrier to morals and ethics beyond those it subscribes to.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.3.1. Pro: The bible ends in 68AD [156], at the end of Revelations, and was finished by Apostle John in 95AD [157] at least 1804 years before any currently living person was born. Nothing was added when we learnt to treat women and men equally, nor when we learnt that cowering is not "yes" and "no" is relevant in marriage, nor when we learnt to treat each others' sexual preferences equally.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: If there is a God he won't have overlooked the morals the bible does. Remember the story [158]: A man on a roof in a flood who waits for God to save him and turns down three forms of salvation before drowning. Then God tells him that he sent those three. Religion has ignored much that it could have seen as messages from God over the last 1800 years. There's been more than a rowboat, a motorboat and a helicopter in that time but religion is still not seeing the signs.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.4. Pro: Even if the Golden Rule [159] (treating other as ones would wish to be treated) was not invented by Christianity, Christianity did make it popular.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.4.1. Con: Religion takes claim of things without regard for the original source; often absorbing aspects of subjected people's culture, as a mean to further control and dominate them.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.9. Con: The higher rate of change of secular ethics does not make them more true. It just means religious ethics move more slowly. This could be a good thing, when the common opinion is changed for the worse.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.9.1. Con: Most religions' primary texts are finalized at some point. After that their ethics don't move slowly—they don't move at all.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: The moral codes often found in religious texts have been the cause of many social injustices including the persecution of homosexuals, people of colour and women.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Religion has tried to control women's bodies by banning abortion, birth control and contraception.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Opposing abortion is a testament to the preservation of life. Abortion can be viewed as killing potential life.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The preservation of life leads to overpopulation, which leads to famine, spreading of diseases, and many other causes of death. So saving some lives indirectly kills much more lives. Overpopulation effects. [160]
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The preservation of life has a marginal effect [161] on population growth. Other factors to take into consideration are: the decrease in mortality rates, the overcoming of poverty, advancements in fertility treatments, immigration and the lack of family planning.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Religiosity has decreased [162] internationally, especially in developed countries, and many believers do not follow every religious teaching, yet if most of the world’s population did, overpopulation could be a bigger problem.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The Roman Catholic Church [163] refuses artificial methods of contraception; many Hindus [164] are unlikely to use contraception; in Orthodox Judaism [165], birth control is not acceptable or only to use in limited circumstances and although Islam [166] allows contraception, more conservative leaders campaign against it.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Opposing birth control and contraception can be viewed as advocating against promiscuity.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of how one views it the consequences are real and can be shown.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: When contraception is prohibited even between married spouses, promiscuity is not the key element in its prohibition.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Religion has made promiscuity a bad thing, because if women had multiple partners the filiation link couldn't be established. By forcing monogamy (at least for women ) on humanity , religion portrayed "promiscuity" as a bad thing. But one could see it as a very natural thing, to respond to one's desires.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: Opposing birth control also increases venereal disease.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #5637: Pregnant people should have the right to choose abortion.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.3. Con: These groups are often, at least politically, unwilling to support those lives after they are born. Their supposed devotion to the preservation of life is flawed.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Evidence suggests otherwise, adoption [167], health, education [168] and poverty [169] are a few of the many societal problems the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations fully embrace.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Control does not imply harm.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Forcing women to continue their pregnancy and give birth may be harmful for the woman. Also, having to raise an unplanned child in a difficult economical or social environment can be a source of pain, such as starvation.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5637: Pregnant people should have the right to choose abortion.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: This is to prevent the greater harm of a death of a child. Religious view abortion as killing a human being with a soul and abhorrent in the same way most people would feel about killing an infant.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The murder of children is wrong
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: While it is true that religious people view abortion as killing a human being it is not true that a fetus is equivalent to a child.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.2.3. Con: The Catholic Church cares much more about the new adept-to-be rather than the wellness of women.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: Fetuses do not have a conscious mind capable of experiencing pain and suffering. Pain reception only develops well into the third trimester [170] of pregnancy.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: As the fetus is a biological extension of the mother, it is up to her do with it what she sees fit.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.5. Con: Not all religious people view abortion as wrong.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.5.1. Con: In a lot of cases, even if individual believers do not think abortion is wrong, their religious teachings say otherwise.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: The Roman Catholic Church [171] considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in Sikhism [172] abortion if forbiden; Hinduism [173] is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; Islam [174] regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and Judaism [175] only permits it for serious reasons.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Some Catholics [176] disagree with the Vatican about abortion and the Church has expressed the right and  responsibility of each believer "to follow his or her own conscience on moral matters, even when it conflicts with Church teaching".
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.1.6. Con: Many religious people feel that while abortion is wrong, it goes against the tenets of that religion to force that belief on others.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Control is not necessarily harming people. Leadership and followship [177] can be beneficial to both parties. Power is sometimes viewed as only tyrannical control over the populations, but we often forget the benevolent and caring side of organized social structures.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Traditionally, a democracy [178] is a way for the followers to elect the leaders. People choose and respect the most competent people that they can trust to rule over them and represent their views on large scale issues.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Democracy is a very inefficient type of government structure. It is maintained as a social luxury, not for its merit.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Even if control was beneficial for a person, it would still be unjustified. Each person should have the right to decide how they will live their life, and noone should be able to make that decision for them. To decide otherwise is the beginning of tyranny.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: People can value security over freedom and therefore feel happier when they don't have to choose everything themselves. Excessive choice is tyranny to some.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.3. Con: A lot of times, religion did not act like a benevolent force of social control. It was often misused to promote the interests of the powerful people without regard to the rights of the people.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.2.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: The creation of standardized structures of morality keeps society predictable and manageable by those who live within them.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.4.1. Con: Religion is not required to create these standardised structures. Morality can successfully be defined by secular methods as well.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.4.2. Con: Creating one standardized structure of morality is near impossible even within one religion, much less in a way that creates predictability about how you should live. Evidence for this is differing opinions on any number of moral issues between different sects of Christianity, Islam or Judaism. If you live in society where multiple sects or multiple religions coexist whose standard prevails?
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.5. Con: "Forced conversions" implies harm would befall the converted if they would not convert. Therefore, this conversion is harmful to the well-being of the converted.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6. Pro: Religious social control can be and most often is consensually chosen by the believers themselves, particularly among converts.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1. Con: Being born and indoctrinated into a faith is not voluntary. Moreover several religions place severe consequences on those who leave.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Hasidic Jews are indoctrinated [179] from a young age, often poorly educated (with lack of English skills) and pressured to have and provide for big families at really young ages. Those who try to live secularly [180] are often completely rejected [181] and, in many cases, their religious communities fight to keep custody of their children [182].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.2. Pro: If you leave Islam in certain countries you will die. If you leave Jehova's witnesses you will never speak to your family again. Same with the Amish. But more importantly you did not choose to have the religion forced on you as a child and it may be so deep in your brain that you could never escape.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.3. Pro: Religious Trauma Syndrome (RTS) [183] “is a function of both the chronic abuses of harmful religion and the impact of severing one’s connection with one’s faith” and can be compared to a combination of PTSD and Complex PTSD.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.4. Pro: Religions are routinely introduced to children who are too young to make an informed choice.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.4.1. Pro: Catholic parents baptise [184] their children when they are babies and thus introduce them into the Catholic faith when they cannot consent.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.4.2. Pro: The First Communion [185] is normally received around the ages of 7 to 10  after a period or cathequesis [186] (education). And Confirmation [187], the time when the believer really gives consent, also happens when children are young or in their mid-teens.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.4.3. Con: Children are capable of choice, but the degree to which they can make an informed and/or rational decision will vary from not at all, through not enough, to a minority who are as capable of making a decision as an adult.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.1.4.4. Pro: Circumcision [188] is performed by Jews on the eighth day of life.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.2. Con: If the religion has control over public policy and uses it to exert social control, then non-believers will also be forced to adhere nonconsensually to the control created. Pew Article on views on abortion [189]Views on homosexuality [190]
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.3. Con: Religious control uses emotion and faith which ignore reason. This makes the religion itself and the individuals less able to rationally evaluate social impacts or structures. A tipping point emerges when a religion cannot assess appropriate impacts within a larger group and are outcast as cult.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.3.1. Pro: The problem is more profound when the religion wields too much influence for it to be outcast.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.6.4. Con: Through history, most often than not religion social control is imposed. Nowadays it is imposed by social stigma in some countries.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.7. Con: Control implies a reduction in freedom. Individual freedom should not be impinged upon except to protect others.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.7.1. Con: Limiting individual freedom is necessary for group activities. The limitations of freedom a parent places on a child are for that child's own good, and similarly it does not follow that the controls exerted by religious adherence are necessarily bad for the individual.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.7.1.1. Con: A gilded cage is still a cage.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.8. Pro: Social control is not a minus in environments lacking other forms of control.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.9. Pro: The state is a form of social control too. Control is necessary to safeguard the rules that keep society safe and working and to protect the values we hold important. Without control, society would not exist.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.9.1. Con: Control in and of itself is neither good nor bad. Certain forms of control bring greater benefit to the whole, while others to a few. Democracy vs dictatorship, as one such example pair.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.9.2. Pro: Religion has been an efficient means of control, spread easily by word of mouth and motivated by fear.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.10. Pro: Control is needed for a society to advance.

1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.4. Pro: This regulation made overpopulation worse. Overpopulation [191] is the main cause of many major problems around the world.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.4.1. Con: The preservation of life has a marginal effect [192] on population growth. Other factors to take into consideration are: the decrease in mortality rates, the overcoming of poverty, advancements in fertility treatments, immigration and the lack of family planning.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Religiosity has decreased [193] internationally, especially in developed countries, and many believers do not follow every religious teaching, yet if most of the world’s population did, overpopulation could be a bigger problem.

Pro: The Roman Catholic Church [194] considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in Sikhism [195] abortion if forbiden; Hinduism [196] is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; Islam [197] regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and Judaism [198] only permits it for serious reasons.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.6.1. Con: Some Catholics [199] disagree with the Vatican about abortion and the Church has expressed the right and responsibility of each believer "to follow his or her own conscience on moral matters, even when it conflicts with Church teaching".
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.7. Pro: Another form of social control through the use of guilt and pressure - in this case to pressure the country to implement such laws.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Religion often condemns homosexuality [200].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: To give some idea of the scope of this issue, including persecution of those perceived as atheists: The percentage of us who are white male heterosexual Christians (using this group not as definitive, but only to get us in the right ballpark) is very low, so the vast majority of us are potential targets.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4. Con: Religious based discrimination often just reflected the attitudes of the time, thus other forces, not religion, drove those views.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon, a text written in the 1830s [201], included [202] a number of contemporary racist themes.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: The Apostle Paul's views on women [203] likely reflected [204] the culture of the time.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.3. Con: Religion has a loud and powerful voice and claims to be divinely inspired and claims to define goodness, sin, and evil. If their morality simply reflects that of the time then it will have a tendency to popularize, and embed terrible trends and attitudes, thus hampering moral progress and holding society back.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.4. Con: If religious moral codes are deemed to transcend humans and be absolute in their own right (because they emanate from a superior force) then they should not be influenced by humanity's failures.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.5. Pro: The shocking thing would be if this weren't the case. Demagogy relies on instilling fear. That religion would not rely solely on creating a difference (believers/infidels) is hardly surprising.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.6. Con: By pointing to other differences that people already accept as bad they conflate belief/disbelief with those. That does not lessen the extent of their demagogy, it highlights it and shows that they were even worse, inventing a new thing to fear out of whole cloth.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.7. Con: Attitudes of the time are often the only overriding force to counter-act religious discrimination.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.8. Con: Attitudes of the time often change, but when adopted and codified into the doctrine of a religion they gain longevity in peoples minds for generations, eventually to the point where people no longer really understand what that attitude came from - they just adopt it - regardless of how toxic. The religion is then very stubborn/takes a long time on giving up on it, as to do so would be to admit fault
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5. Pro: Several religious denominations have often supported gender inequality.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.1. Pro: Abrahamic ethics includes the commandment [205] "You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." This lumps people and wives particularly in as property. This is generally not seen as a kind thing.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.1.1. Con: You own yourself as you would property.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con: However, you do not own your spouse, which is what seems to be implied in the commandment.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.1.2. Con: This is meant as a lesson on jealousy, not as a commentary on the worth of women.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Yet it positions jelousy as coveting someone's possessions and those possessions include women, servants, a house and animals.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.4.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.2. Pro: Although Jainism [206] is a religion of equality that seeks liberation and recognizes the rights of all living creatures (including animals), some sects consider liberation impossible for women without being reborn into men, and many denominations consider women harmful, impure or ‘second-class’ citizens .
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.2.1. Con: The words 'some' indicates that it might be a marginal strand of the religion thus it cannot count as an argument for religion itself to be biased (in favor of males) or patriarchal. Also there are also many denominations [207] that adore women and consider them sacred so in the end, it could balance out.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.3. Pro: Many religions [208] support complementarism [209], a view that favors male supremacy [210] as it defines men as the heads of the house and the Church.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.3.1. Pro: Research [211] points that domestic abuse is higher in regions across the globe "where norms related to male authority over female behavior are more common".
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.3.2. Con: This is only 'true' for the judeo-christian religions but are in no way defined as absolute truths (and often debated) in many other religions or sub-denominations.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: Even in non-judeo-christian religions it is also not implied that because one source of authority claims something, everybody else accepts this, which is quite different in Catholic, Judean or Islamic 'hierarchies' or power structures.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.5.4. Pro: Orthodox Judaism is not egalitarian [212] and opposes women being rabbis [213].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6. Pro: Many religions instill views of shame and sin regarding sexual relationships.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.1. Pro: Anti-sex views [214] can have deep and harmful psychological [215] effects.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.2. Pro: Some religions do not approve pre-marital sex.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.2.1. Pro: The Catholic Church [216] believes that artificial contraception is sinful and immoral, and that sex should be reserved to marriage.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: Monty Python make the case for contraception [217]
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.2.2. Pro: Traditional Judaism [218] prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriages.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.2.3. Pro: Protestantism [219] rejects premarital sex and views it as a sin.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.3. Pro: Religious views regarding sex rely on harmful stereotypes that often place women's virginity and purity as the measure of a woman's worth.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.3.1. Pro: Gendered expectations around virginity often mean that women view virginity loss as giving something away and are encouraged to protect their virginity, while men losing their virginity is viewed as a way to gain status and experience.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: Traditional sexual scripts have resulted in women largely viewing virginity as a gift and something that they therefore have to be careful about giving away, while men see virginity as a stigma and think of its loss as a relief (Humphreys, p. 672) [220].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.3.1.2. Pro: In the US, there has been a spread of virginity balls [221] in Christian communities, where young women attend a ball with their fathers and pledge to abstain from sex until marriage. This often involves the fathers vowing to protect their daughter's purity and therefore equates virginity with purity for women.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.4. Con: Shame and sin regarding sexual relationships can encourage more stable relationships in society. Polygamy is linked to social discontent and war [222], as an individual man taking multiple wives for himself leaves many other men without a wife. Monogamous relationships encouraged by Judeo-Christian (and other) values have been stated as the cause of the success of societies such as ancient Rome, and Western Europe. [223]
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.4.1. Con: The roman republic [224] began in 509 BC and the first christian emperor was during the reign of Constantine the Great [225] (306-337AD) thewestern half of the empire [226] then dissolved in 480AD the vast majority of Roman prosperity in the western European area then was before Christianity was even legal in the region.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.5. Con: Shame and sin can still be instilled on people's sexual relationships in secular societies. For example, in China [227], which is predominately atheist, there is still a huge social stigma against homosexuality.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.5.1. Pro: There are no laws that protect LGBT peoples from discrimination [228] from workplaces under the Chinese Labour Law.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.5.2. Con: According to a study and scholars [229] homophobia did not take root in China until the 19th and 20th centuries and was due to Westernization. As such, it would be the countries of Europe who were predominately Christian at the time which originally influenced and created the stigma in China.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.7. Con: This lies on the idea that what is considered a wrong thing now was wrong in the past. To determine if something is wrong, its reasons and effects have to be analyzed according to the historical moment.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.8. Pro: Religion rely on books written long ago, which are representative of their times. Relying too much to the word, and not the meaning leads to bigotry and ignorance
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Some religions also contain scripture that has undoubtably made people less kind towards fellow humans. For example, violence in Islam [230] or Christianity [231].
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.4. Pro: The origins of the "Golden Rule [232]" (the principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated) which is often attributed to Christianity are actually far older.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.4.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.5. Con: Intolerance of other groups is a sociological phenomenon, and religion is merely the form or pretense it may take. For any example of something bad done in the name of religion, you can find equal evils done in the name of non-religious ideology or even naked tribalism.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.5.1. Con: The more that separates us the easier it is to point fingers.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.5.2. Con: Not every evil done in the name of religion would have been replaced by one done for a secular reason. It's plausible that none of the evils done in the name of religion would have been replaced. We don't all walk around looking for reasons to kill each other.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.6. Pro: Research found that children from religious families are less kind and more punitive [233] than those from non-religious households.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.6.1. Pro: Children from households identifying as Christianity or Muslim were less altruistic [234] than children from non-religious households. Moreover, older children (with a longer exposure to religion" showed "the greatest negative relations”.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Some Buddhist [235] and Abrahamic [236] clergy commit violence toward their fellow man because they believe their religion requires it.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The vast majority of practitioners and believers in these traditions are good people, and violent vocal minorities do not accurately reflect the majority of people.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: It is not a question of whether it reflects that majority. It is a question of whether it reflects the actual messages of the texts and tenets.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Often because they believe the lies by preachers.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: The history of religions is not overloaded with tales of civilians who stand against preachers who are promoting violence but rather with people who stand with those preachers, rational thought set aside, or who stand aside in rational fear.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.3.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Fanaticism, religious or secular, in contrast to mere fervent belief, is identical in its underlying extremism, but most major beliefs themselves do not inherently require intolerance of other beliefs. In the absence of specifically intolerant suppositions, found in fanaticism, belief isn't intolerant - people are.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Extremism is not a problem unless the fundamental beliefs are themselves flawed. A harmless belief taken to extremes is still harmless.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Janism [237] for example, the more extreme you are the less dangerous you are to other people because the fundamental belief is non-violence. You might pose a danger to yourself if you cannot move or eat anything but you are no danger to others.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Extreme forms of love thy neighbor for example are not dangerous taken to any extreme conviction. It is other flawed beliefs that create the danger. Such as the belief that people who disagree should be made to agree or be killed.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: The belief that infidels and apostates [238] must die is the problem, there is not even need to take that to extremes to see the dangers.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.4. Pro: The belief that abortion is murder makes you inherently intolerant of other people's choices, and justifies violence, as you believe that you are preventing substantial harm.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: Many beliefs are themselves inherently intolerant and require neither fanaticism nor extremism to cause problems.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.3.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The belief that abortion is murder is inherently intolerant of the view that it is not since murder is outlawed in modern society, if one truly believes that abortion is murder they cannot allow others to commit the act just because they have differing views.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.4.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Only the Spanish Inquisition [239] operated completely under the royal Christian authority (though staffed by clergy), yet many sentences dictated during Inquisition trials were made within the judicial system [240] of the Roman Catholic Church.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: Cecco d'Ascoli  was the first university scholar burned [241] by the Inquisition.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.3. Con: One incident, in one branch of Christianity, in a small period of time, is not representative for all religion.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.3.1. Con: The Inquisition [242], in different forms, lasted from the 12th century to the 19th century, in various territories and affecting a branch of Christianity that today represents [243] 1.1 billion people, 50% of Christians around the globe and 16% of the world's population.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.4. Pro: Italian Giordano Bruno [244] was tortured and killed by the church of Rome for having introduced the concept of infinity of the universe, the multiplicity of the worlds, and the motion of the Earth respect to the sun.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.2. Con: Being under house arrest does not seem a great endorsement of scientific discovery.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.3. Pro: Galileo was able to continue [245] to work and publish under house arrest.
1.8.10.8.2.1.4.4. Con: Not killing someone does not count as a contribution towards science. It is rather not completely getting in the way of science but is still not a contribution.
1.8.10.8.2.1.5. Con: The motives of the Carolingian Renaissance [246], thanks to which many of the books in the West were preserved, were only partially religious.
1.8.10.8.2.1.6. Con: The first [247] European universities were established several centuries after the Dark Ages [248] ended.
1.8.10.8.2.1.7. Con: First Universities were spontaneouscorporations of people studying (Roman) law [249], theology and medicine.
1.8.10.8.2.2. Con: The earliest forms of formal schooling [250] were developed in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
1.8.10.8.2.3. Con: City-states in ancient Greece [251] provided private education in literacy, arts and gymnastics for young boys (from 7 to 14 years old) mimicking modern formal schooling way before Christianity.
1.8.10.8.2.4. Con: Ancient Greece [252] also developed forms of higher education where rich students could contniue their studies, learning rhetoric, mathematics, geography, natural history, politics, and logic.
1.8.10.8.2.4.1. Pro: In fact, the Hellenistic influence in modern education can be traced in the word Lyceum [253], Aristotle's school named after its location, and a current terminology that many Western and Eastern countries still use.
1.8.10.8.2.5. Pro: Medieval universities started as Christian [254] monastic schools and  modern systems of education in Europe derive from schools founded upon religious principles with the primary purpose of training the clergy.
1.8.10.8.2.5.1. Pro: The Church also mandated in 1179 free education [255] for the poor, so every cathedral had a master to teach boys too poor to pay the regular fee, planting the seed of modern universal and public education.
1.8.10.8.3. Pro: Western civilization via Christianity has made great contributions to philosophy and modern thought.
1.8.10.8.3.1. Pro: During the Middle Ages [256], St. Augustine and St. Ambrose both studied earlier philosophers [257], assimilating Greek and Roman philosophy -the basis of Western thought- into Christian doctrine, trying to give a rational interpretation of Christian faith.
1.8.10.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.8.1.
1.8.10.8.3.3. Con: Despite  previous connections between religion and thought in the Middle Ages, the birth of modern philosophy [258] in the West comes from the total separation of faith and reason.
1.8.10.8.3.3.1. Pro: Enlightenment philosophers even considered that the Church's doctrines were “superstitious” and had “hindered the progress [259] of civilization”.
1.8.10.8.3.4. Con: Considering the big influence [260] from Hellenistic and Roman Philosophy (Socrates, Plato and Aristotle) in Medieval Christian thinkers, it is arguably that non-religious philosophers from Ancient [261] times were actually more seminal to Western philosophy than those applying Christian doctrines to previously constructed theories.
1.8.10.8.4. Pro: Our calendar's (Gregorian calendar [262]) year zero represents the birth of Jesus Christ
1.8.10.8.4.1. Con: While this is what various religions suggest, historians including religious ones cannot agree on the actual date of birth.
1.8.10.8.5. Con: Being an integral part is not necessarily a "good" thing. It is impossible to know what society would be like in the absence of Christianity, but we do know that modern societies are becoming more secular.
1.8.10.8.5.1. Con: Religion was a necessary step [263] to reach structured thoughts and rationality. In fact, the scientific method is only a young leaf (although emergent) in the evolutionary tree [264] of belief systems.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1. Pro: Religion has been helpful in leading us to science as a means to understand the world around us. At any given point in time religion has filled in the gaps of knowledge we have, leading us to innovation that brightens those dark spots. As we build the means to see and understand those gaps, science takes over, but religious belief allowed us to survive and evolve enough to replace superstition with demonstrable truth.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1. Con: Religions historically have claimed to already know the answers to questions science asks. Filling in the gaps with unsupported claims does not encourage inquiry because it thinks it already has the answers.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The big religions are based on revelation, not exploration. If one believes that the most important information in the world already has been written, it tends to cause less curiosity about science and the world as we see it today.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Belief is unfounded assumption. Assume one false thing and any false thing can be proved true. Thus it undermines our rationality.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Much of what we use to navigate the world is based on unfounded assumptions, belief is in no way unique.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Human cognitive process tend to rely on intuition rather than analysis [265] to save energy. Therefore, if ideas come from familiar sources, other people believe them and align with our own beliefs and are good in terms of storytelling, we may tend believe them, even if proper scrutiny would render them false.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Humans have evolved to deal with information [266] in two different ways: in a fast, automatic and intuitive process and in a slow, analytical and rational way. As we tend to have a positivity bias (we assume people act honestly) and a confirmation bias (we tend to believe what fits our views), the first way is often used and while good in ancestral small groups, it can also be dangerous, especially in bigger and more developed societies.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Cognitive fluency [267],  a “subjective experience of the ease or difficulty of completing a mental task”, also makes people believe things or like them because those things feel familiar, are well-expressed and in tune with their own expectations. This could explain why self-assuring religious myths [268] are easier to believe regardless of factual information.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: People are willing to believe that a politician will bring jobs and vote for him or her, even if they have not verified it.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Believing that a politician will bring jobs is typically a verifiable claim and that people do not verify it is indeed a bad thing.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Not every politician has a history that shows success or failure at creating jobs.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: People assume a certain street or route may be less dangerous or assume someone may intend harm and avoid that person or place, even if those beliefs are not founded or verified.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: People may choose certain foods because they think they are healthier without going through the process of verifying it.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: It is very easy to verify whether a food is healthy or not by looking at the nutritional information. That people do not do so is bad.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6. Con: The fact that it is difficult to live without making unfounded assumptions doesn't mean that any particular unfounded assumption is a good thing.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Unfounded assumptions come with varying degrees of unfoundedness and consequence. The higher the unfoundedness and the consequence the less sound is the assumption.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Religions often present what appears to be a lot of foundation, an entire book and other items. However they usually also request a lot of unfounded assumptions and the consequences of making the unfounded assumptions are often substantial.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Most religions use the you-have-nothing-to-lose-by-believing argument. Of course you do: There's your time, your independence, your objectivity, and your cash.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: If one is believing in religion purely because they have nothing to lose or to hedge bets then it is not a genuine belief and one loses their intellectual integrity. At the same time an omniscient deity would surely know that the belief is not genuine.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: Much time is spent praying. Though many say their prayers are answered, evidence of a causal link between their prayers and the outcome that occurred is lacking.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Studies [269] have shown prayer has no effect beyond placebo.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: It's worse than that you've also wasted your time.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Praying may have consequences on brain [270] activity, function and structure.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Research [271] with Buddhist monks suggests that "over the course of meditating for tens of thousands of hours, the long-term practitioners had actually altered the structure and function of their brains".
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The average religious believer and practitioner may not have the same commitment, tools and training as Buddhist monks to be able to achieve such results.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Any form or degree of positive thinking [272] or meditation [273] is beneficial for the human mind.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Prayer shows a specific pattern in brain activity [274], lighting frontal lobes (that affect concentration) while parietal lobes go dark. This last area is responsible for sensory experiences and could explain that those praying “lose their sense of self, feel a sense of oneness, a blurring of the boundary between self and other”.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Those results [275] were consistent with different religious practitioners, from Franciscan nuns praying to Buddhists meditating or Sikhs chanting.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: These results would have been found when the subjects knew that they and their brain activity were being observed. So these results are as (or less) normal as behavior on reality TV shows.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.3. Con: Neuroplasticity [276], the capacity of our brains to change and adapt, is not a unique characteristic of religion but of extreme concentration and 'mental trainning'.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: The more someone can focus [277] on something "math or auto racing or football or God", the more that becomes their own reality, as it  "becomes written into the neural connections of your brain", experts say.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: Much social power, over the religious and/or to speak or act on their behalf, is ceded to religious leaders.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.4. Pro: Once you make unfounded assumptions that are relevant to your decisions/opinions your ability to make those decisions or draw conclusions objectively is at risk.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5. Pro: Some part of donations to the church may result in charitable work that the giver would otherwise make through different means. However, the efficiency will suffer from overheads [278]: for instance the livelihood of a preacher and his boss, and his boss's boss etc, and the buildings they work and live in, their private jets, the adverts, pomp, and the expensive art that adorns their window-frames, walls, ceilings or vaults, and legal fees.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Many religious institutions exist mainly for financial gain, and some are corrupt.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Most of the world’s biggest landowners [279] are monarchs from countries with official state religions that support the monarchy or heads of religions themselves.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Heads of state in Qatar [280], Kuwait [281], Saudi Arabia [282], Jordan [283], Oman [284] and Morocco [285] are among the biggest landowners of the world and and all of their countries have an official state religion (Islam).
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Despite having freedom of religion, monarchies in Bhutan [286] and Swaziland [287], also among the biggest world’s lawnowners, are very tied to Buddhism and Christianity, respectively.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: The Catholic Church [288], with Pope Benedict at its head, is considered to be the third biggest landowner of the world.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: Queen Elizabeth II [289], UK’s monarch and Head of State, is considered to be the biggest landowner of the world.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1.5. Pro: With the conversion of the emperor Constantine to Christianity, the Catholic Church became one of the largest landowners of ancient times and during the Middle Ages, the Church controlled vast amounts of wealth [290] and was again the largest landowner in Europe.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: Some authors consider that the fact that catholic [291] priests are required to be celibate [292] and single (by regulations, not dogma) may have had the intention to avoid priests being able to pass money [293] and property to their offspring [294].
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The documented case of Scientology [295]
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: The idea of the prosperity gospel [296] has been spreading in the US in recent times and the main idea behind it is that donating money to religious institutions will make you healthier and wealthier in the long run.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: As a result of the prosperity gospel many megachurch [297] leaders [298] have their own private jets and exorbitant amounts of money while their congregations remain impoverished or at average income.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: The foundation presented can be the result of centuries of cherry picking the most consistent passages from supporters while destroying opposing/inconsistent views and/or killing or imprisoning or ostracizing the inconvenient authors. Thus even those facts that can be verified can be considered to amount to anecdotal evidence at best.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: A lot of the foundation is often unfounded itself, frequently based on other unfounded assumptions in a web that can be difficult to unravel, thus disguising the ultimate unfoundedness of much of it.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many people who dared to defy given answers were burnt as heretics [299].
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that those gaps being filled with place holders and superstitions was necessary for our survival and evolution.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.3. Con: Heads of religions recognize only the parts of science which fit the description of the world they already give to the masses. All other science is called "sacrilege" and "untrue" and the proponents are persecuted. That narrows fields of scientific research and slows down the spread of new discoveries. Examples: Book burning [300], Galileo Galilei [301], Charles Darwin [302].
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: With religions often claiming things contrary to science, it can not only encourage irrational thought, but encourage to the point of normalizing anti-science attitudes such as climate change denial.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: For example, many Christians believe [303] the world is 10,000 years old.
1.8.10.8.5.1.1.3.3. Pro: Constantine rewrote the bible at the council of Nicea his reign was between 274 to 337 A.D. He prevented the scrutiny of it by the masses, specifically to assist in running his empire; deeming it the domain only of the clergy to express it, rather than having too many heretical views. King James the 'witch burner [304]' opened his version to the masses.King James bible discussion [305]
1.8.10.8.5.1.2. Pro: Regrouping behind common archetypal ideals [306] increases coordination, cooperation and chances for survival and reproduction.
1.8.10.8.5.1.2.1. Con: Religion fragments the commonality of each state and other organisations to those who are of the religion and those who are not, thus reducing coordination and cooperation. For instance there are multiple examples of religious groups not cooperating with local law enforcement or defying local law, which has been known to result in loss of life or liberty.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3. Con: The opposite may also be true. The Greek civilisation [307] starts explaining the world through religious myths, until philosophers consider it necessary to find a more rational explanation (logos) starting a strong tradition of Western rationalism.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1. Con: Recent scholars [308] point that the transition [309] from 'myth' to 'logos' was a continuum, so rational and mythical explanations were never in conflict.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: Having a global understanding of the universe, although possibly filled by irrational beliefs, is an important part of our psyche. It uses intuition and pattern recognition to make decisions and solve problems. The other process thinks rationally, limits the context to what is already known to work and can be articulated precisely.

Although there is some debate on the lateralization of those processes [310], both are important part of your brains mechanisms [311] and are in no way mutually exclusive.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Religion provides a solution in the face of nihilism and the dramatic nature of existence. This is called the Terror management theory [312].
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There are other ways to find meaning in life besides religion, such as through living for others by helping them, or attaching value to material goods such as money or wealth. Religion is not the only way to beat back nihlism
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Altruism is most commonly found in religious traditions, while too much wealth causes anxiety and is therefore not a good option for beating back nihilism. Religion is foundationally about finding meaning and is therefore the oldest and arguably best way to find meaning in ones life.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.6.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Religion does not solve the problem of nihlism, because it never justifies why life has value; it claims that it does because of God. Thus, it would not satisfy a nihlist who was looking for some reason why life had value, since the religious justification depends on an unproven notion of God and his or her actions.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.2. Pro: Pre-socratic philosophers [313] rejected the notion of natural and supernatural and Aristotle using  evidence and observation, marked the distinction between philosophy and empirical science.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3. Con: That does not mean that religion has not prepared our brain and helped structure our thoughts for thousands of years before being able to transition to logic.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1. Pro: Religion led people to do things correctly before science and technology caught up.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Jewish dietary and hygiene laws had an entire people group treating germs and bacteria correctly for many thousands of years before germs and bacteria were discovered (which famously led them to be remarkably unaffected by the Black Plague among other things).
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Although some religions helped to disseminate hygiene rules, this was not always true. The Roman practice of public baths was seen as 'sinful' by early christians [314], who abhorred nudity and went on a crusade against what was seen as a pagan luxury. The condemnation was not unanimous, but it was prevailing.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.3. Con: Religion also taught people to do many things wrong. Such as exorcism for mental illness, human sacrifice to appease gods, and relying on faith healing instead of medicine.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: Rituals can have a Causal impact [315] on people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: Faith healing can be viewed as producing a placebo effect [316].
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Since Placebo effects typically do not fix the underlying condition and only act as a bandage for the problem this is not necessarily a good thing.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.3.3. Pro: Amputating a working body part, the male foreskin [317], is an excellent example of something wrong being forced and enforced by religion.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.4. Con: These "correct things" can easily be derived from observation and do not require a system of religious belief to be enforced.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.4.2. Pro: Religion occupies advancements as if it was the sole inventor even after centuries of resistance to them.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.5. Con: In the past, religion in society was the norm. Choosing to lead a non-religious life was, very likely, not an easy choice to make at that time. In such a non-plural  environment, it would be a fallacy to say that "Religion led people to act correctly..." because there was no testable alternative to see if a non-religious life was "more correct" or "less correct" than a religious lifestyle.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.5.1. Con: The fact that there will be few to no examples of records of non-religious life does not mean that we can't analyse the religion.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.6. Con: Arguably, religion "was" a good thing for humankind in times of ignorance... but its importance in today's society needs to be phased out. At present, we need to operate on facts and evidence, and not on past beliefs rooted in ignorance.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.6.1. Pro: Religion was a good thing for humankind when we had neither philosophy nor science and religion exercised the imagination and created culture and folkloric bases. Now, after the achievement of science and logic, religion has massively contributed to the disbelief of these ways of reaching knowledge and religion continues to control cultures.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.6.1.1. Con: Science didn't start at some point after the rise of religion. It started when someone first used a branch as a lever, noticed there were seasons or that wood floats or… Science comes from common sense. Even the first time someone persuaded a bunch of people there was a "god" that governed the seasons they were already interfering with science.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The damage done by religion in the early days was probably at least as significant as the damage it does now, and as in those days scientists were killed [318] rather than science disputed, it was probably far more severe, literally keeping us in the Stone Age.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.7. Pro: Lessons from religion are also used in marketing so that businesses can fair better on the battlefield of commerce. 
Storytelling is one of  the core techniques when doing anything religious like bible lessons, wisdom sharing and ceremony alike, storytelling also happens to be one of the basic techniques in marketing business to business and in business to client communication.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.7.1. Con: There are far better methods for learning modern marketing techniques than religion. Scientific understanding of human psychology being one of them.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.7.2. Con: The skills of storytelling and wisdom sharing are not limited to religion, therefore religion is not required to teach these things.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.8. Con: Where religion led people to do things correctly it was either by accident (i.e. despite the unfounded assumptions) or where dogma was based on scientific observation rather than other dogma.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.9. Con: Tradition can be observed and judged separate from religion. Good traditions not necessarily reflect good religion and vice versa.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10. Pro: Before modern states could provide welfare, religion was the only source of education, healthcare or economic relief.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.1. Pro: Hospitals were founded, financed, and staffed by religions. An old French term [319] for hospital is hôtel-Dieu, "hostel of God."
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.2. Pro: The Catholic Church was the only institution in Europe during several hundred years that actively contributed to free education for the masses.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.5.1.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.3. Pro: Religious organizations build schools (and universities), orphanages, and other services for community benefits.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.3.1. Pro: Religious organizations have to debate their claims, because of their universal vocation. To be able to stand in a plural contest and argue has its specific pedagogical value.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.4. Pro: Judaic religious tradition has throughout history emphasised education [320] which has been an advantage to its adherents at places and times where illiteracy was the norm, for example in Europe in the early middle ages [321].
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.4.1. Con: Judaic education in reading was historically reserved for boys.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.5. Con: Several religious schools are filled with accusations of child abuse [322]. In Ireland girls were sexually abused in catholic schools. In Canada the United Church committed numerous physical abuses [323] against indigenous children.  Christian run schools prohibited [324] native children to speak their languages and continue with their cultural practices. All over the world there are legal proceedings against priests who run religious schools and abused the children that attended them.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.6. Con: The family was also a source of education, healthcare, and economic relief.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.11. Con: Religion just fills the holes and gaps until science discovers the answers and as such stifled inquiry.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.12. Con: Arguing that religions have done some good is easy but almost everything leads to some amount of good. It is more useful to argue that religion has caused a net amount of good but doing this calculation is very hard and thus it is almost impossible to conclusively show that religion has been a good thing overall.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.13. Con: If the benefits that religion provides can be now outsourced by other means (state, welfare, legal system, etc.) that are not paired with the negatives of religion, it may have been good and yet it no longer is.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.2. Con: Althought they might have helped transfer knowledge and wisdom, Embryonic repertoires of stories were not necessarily large enough to be considered Religions.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.3. Con: Religious dogma does not take well to inquiry and knowledge advancement. Anaxagoras [325], a Presocratic philosopher may well have not started the revolution of thinking that led away from mythology had he been executed for "Impiety" as ordered by the Athenian court
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.3.1. Con: Societies organised around religious values provide a stable framework for their citizens to be safe and comfortable enough in order to contemplate their own thinking, which can then lead to innovations.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Inventions by prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies (tools and curing technologies) were innovations increasing the stability/well-being of all tribe members. There is no evidence for a key role of religious values in these societies; basic human needs and the objective benefits of cooperation can account for these innovations.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.4. Con: It is more likely that structured thinking evolved from intercomunicating useful information. There is no need for religion to explain this process.
1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Take animals for instance. We may observe the evolution of their thinking process (different evolutionary branches at different stages of intelligence), and yet animals don't seem to perform any religious activities. The conclusion is that the evolution of thought is independent from existence of religion.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4. Pro: James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe argue that science has its roots in Christianity. Because it is based on the notion that there exists a rational God who is the source of rational truth. This, they argue, gave rise to the possibility of scientific laws [326].
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.3.3.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.2. Pro: Nearly all the founders of modern science were Christians. These include men such as Kepler [327], Boyle [328], Pascal [329], Pasteur [330], Newton [331], etc.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.2.1. Con: Without illustrating that Christianity specifically motivated and provoked their pursuit of science and rationality simply listing founding scientists who happen to be Christians is not evidence for anything.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.2.2. Con: Christianity only tolerated their scientific work on the premise that it did not conflict Christianity. The moment they discovered or hypothesized anything contrary to Christian doctrine, religious authorities would do pretty much anything to step in the way of their ability to do science.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.2.3. Con: Also, nearly all of them, included the ones listed, were white and male. Following this logic would imply that being white, male and religious makes you a good scientist.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.3. Con: Rationalism long predates [332] Christianity. Philosophical and scientific inquiry began long before Christianity.
1.8.10.8.5.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.3.4.
1.8.10.8.5.1.5. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.1.6. Con: Religion was a useless step to reach structured thoughts and rationality as "God" is the easy answer to everything we don't know. What science does, is to explore all the possibilities to get to the answer.
1.8.10.8.5.1.6.1. Pro: Religion didn't help in developing structured thoughts, intelectual people did, and some of them turned out to be religious, but that's nothing more than an anecdote.
1.8.10.8.5.1.7. Pro: Religions are both good and bad.  They form part of the evolution of modern society towards greater humanity and a growing awareness of our individual vulnerability and interdependence. This period of human development, while incomplete, is slowly coming to an end as religious belief declines.
1.8.10.8.5.1.8. Con: The quoted "evolutionary tree [333]" provides a footnote that claims that it "should not be counted as fact".
1.8.10.8.5.1.9. Con: The Brief History of Human Spiritual Evolution [334] only points out how beliefs evolved into one another, there is no causal connection to evolution of critical thought and rationality.
1.8.10.8.5.1.10. Con: The quoted "evolutionary tree [335]" includes sciences in myths and religions, which is substantially wrong.
1.8.10.8.5.2. Pro: Research [336] in the US, shows that in most sociological measures of well-being, states with less levels or religion fare better [337] than more religious [338] states.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1. Con: Correlation does not mean causation.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1. Pro: Correlation does not imply causation. It is difficult to determine if societies are more economically successful because they are less religious or the opposite. Maybe societies are less religious because they are more economically successful.  The negative correlation between economic success and religiosity does not favor one conclusion over the other.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1. Con: One way or the other, there seems to be a clear link between development and religiosity and it is clear that religiosity fares better when a country is less developed.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: According to research [339], "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies".
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The world’s most religious [340] countries are in very low positions in the Human Development Index [341], while the least religious countries are "very high" or "high" in the same index.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Statistics [342] suggest some level of correlation between religiosity and lower human development rates.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Recent research [343] has found that countries that become more tolerant and secular [344] are more likely to become wealthier and economically stronger.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Studies [345] suggest that secularisation precedes economic development. Even if the causal link is not completely established, the idea that it is economic developement what leads to secularization has been ruled out.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.2. Con: The countries that are very high in the index got there through an extended period of Christian culture. Recent decline in Christian belief has come through materialism, consumerism, individualism, so they are living off spiritual capital in a sense.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Correlation without causation. Arguably gun powder had a more profound effect on the economic well being of many countries since it enabled them to colonize other parts of the world. The industrial revolution had an even higher impact Christianity simply had nothing to do with their economic success.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Possibly an effect rather than a cause. Christian countries were fairly hard on others for significant periods, for instance the Crusades [346], the Spanish Inquisition [347].
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.2.3. Con: Industrial Revolution [348] started and took pace in a period of religious skepticism [349], with less religiously restrictive countries decisively outperforming the more religious ones.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase economic growth [350]. Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Maybe (if this is true) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3.3. Con: The quoted article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3.4. Con: Linked article is pointing to Max Weber theory in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism". This theory doens't confirm the thesis that religion is beneficial for economy.  First of all this book is really ancient stuff without real data. Second - this book states that only protestantism was beneficial for economy. This book was written as a critics of Marx theory and was biased.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3.5. Con: The same source points out also that "the effect of greater religious participation is to reduce economic growth". The positive relationship described is dependent on "believing relative to belonging (attending)", not on religious belief itself.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Without some way to reliably measure "religiosity" it is impossible to state whether societies are more, or less, religious given their economic status.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Gallup [351] and Pew [352] polls, for instances, are made with large samples of respondents in each country who are asked if religion is important for them (or in their lives). Self-report surveys may be limited as research tools, but they do provide some reliable data and are used in a huge variety of fields.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.6. Pro: There is little motivation for religions to act against poverty as lasting change would lower the contributions they receive.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Studies (e.g. This on researchgate.net [353]) have shown that the poor give a greater percentage of their budget to charity than the rich. This means that charity is not necessarily a good thing because it's possibly receiving more from the needy than it can justify from its spending on the needy (maybe different needy), particularly when a certain proportion of contributions goes to a religion's expenses, savings, and investments in buildings, paintings, sculptures etc.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Charitable people are happier [354], thus the poor donating is good for them.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: This study was of 50 people who were given money to spend on either themselves or on someone else. This does not generalize to poor people who are spending their own money which they have little of.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: Religious policy against contraception produces large families and thus poverty and thus higher contributions to the religion.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3. Pro: People living in poor and in conflict areas tend to be religious, because they need religion. They are not unsuccessful because they are religious, they are religious because they are unsuccessful.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.6.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.2. Con: It's a stretch to suggest that anyone "needs" religion.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4. Pro: Religious groups aiding poor countries may potentially sway that poor community to follow said religion. The correlation doesn't mean religion is making countries poor, it can be poor communities leading to religion.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1. Con: Christianity for example preaches that suffering is good and so when they proselytize to the poor and in some case give some amounts of charity they tell them their suffering is good and keep them poor where they want them.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Being content with suffering and death in the hopes of an afterlife may cause some to resign to defeat.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Mother Teresa did not provide noteworthy healthcare to her patients, instead allowing them to suffer and die [355], as she believed that was God's will.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Shebelieved [356] the suffering of the poor and sick was more of a glory than a burden.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Mother Teresa believed that suffering- as Jesus did on the cross- could be an important religious experience, bringing the poor closer to God. While this belief may be ethically objectionable in a secular context, it is also likely consistent with Catholic teaching [357] and therefore should not prevent her canonisation.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: While the acceptance of some inevitable suffering may be an aspect of Catholic teaching, parables like that of the Good Samaritan also call for Catholics to do all they can [358] to alleviate the suffering of others.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Charity, for example, often endorses inequality instead of fixing its roots.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: Research [359] suggests that income inequality may trigger human empathy and thus it is positively associated with the probability to actively participate in charitable organizations.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: Charity [360] validates injustices and it is not an effective response to economic inequality.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.3.3. Pro: Charity is subjective and creates categories: those deserving of it and those who do not.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.3.4. Pro: Some charities give to those in need but do very little [361] in fighting for policy changes like increased minimum wages or other welfare policies.
1.8.10.8.5.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.2. Pro: There is a stark correlation between the 10 most religious [362] states and the 10 worst states [363] in quality of life (9 out of 10 coincidence) and between the 10 less religious [364] states and the 10 best one [365]s (7 out of 10 coincidence).
1.8.10.8.5.2.3. Con: Religiousness is associated with lower suicide rates [366].
1.8.10.8.5.2.3.1. Con: Most religions dictate that suicide will land you a spot in hell, a place of everlasting unimaginable amounts of suffering. Lower suicide rates are not necessarily because people feel better but because they fear a much worse worse fate than their current state. The psychological problems still remain.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4. Con: The correlation is the opposite than suggested above. Countries and states do not fare better because they lose their religiosity - they lose their religiosity when they find ways to establish functioning institutions to address the needs of their citizens who then no longer need to rely solely on hope and prayer.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1. Con: Therefore, religiosity is not necessary for societies' well-being if other secular and collective institutions are strong enough.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: While some religion may have thrived and survived as they provided advantages (social cohesion, cooperation, rules), some present-day societies are successful at “sustaining large-scale cooperation with institutions such as court, police and mechanisms for enforcing contracts” (Norenzayan, p.9 [367]).
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: In Scandinavian countries, strong institutions that facilitate cooperation “usurped” the community-building functions of religion, creating societies that are “some of the most cooperative, peaceful, and prosperous in the world” and thus making religion useless (Norenzayan, p.9) [368].
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.2. Con: The fact that other systems can, through reason or otherwise, replace religion, doesn't mean that religion hasn't been, up until then, the dominant and successful adaptation.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3. Con: The long-term effects of such replacements are not clear and there are examples of dismantling religion in communist countries which, at least partially, led to undesireable long-term consequences.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1. Con: The quoted study [369] does not talk about countries or systems that tried to dismantle or antagonize religion, but democratic countries with freedom of religion that provide a system, alongside religion, that offers much of the same benefits.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In that scenario of secular and religious competition, most developed countries tend to become less religious.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Research points that religious belief declines in economically developed countries [370] with “greater existential security, including income security (income equality and redistribution via welfare states) and improved health”.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Statistics show that birth rates decrease [371] to dangerous levels in those same countries. Perhaps a decline in religious belief is not a good thing.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: As scientific knowledge allows to reduce uncertainty [372], in democracies [373] with strong economies and welfare provisions, people find less need to deal with the uncertainty of the future through religion.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Among those more educated [374], there is a tendency to have higher levels of non belief [375] or to, at least, hold religious beliefs with less certainty.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Some studies show a negative correlation between intelligence [376] and religiosity, possibly explained by the fact that intelligent people are less likely to conform to dogma and tend to adopt a analytic [377] way of thinking.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: These studies may not take into account other variables. Since many positive social conditions (education, urbanization, income, etc.) also happen to be correlated with loss of religion, the link could be explained more by those causes than by intelligence and religion themselves.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Correlation does not indicate causation. Education could just as easily be structured in a way that attracts non-religious people.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4. Con: The cause of this trend could be that religion is less needed in economically developed countries; not that religion stagnates economic growth. Wealthy, comfortable people have little use for a theology that promises rewards in the afterlife. The impoverished, however, may find significant value in religious teachings telling them that human value is not measured by money, and that rewards await them in heaven for living a good life on earth.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Following that logic, religion can then make those impoverished endure the worst situations and not strive to do better in exchange for the promise of a possible better afterlife.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Giving food to a starving person also risks encouraging complacency, yet few would argue that doing so is immoral.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: While an individual action that helps someone in a time of need is not immoral, in a macro level, making people dependent on help and charity deprives them of striving for social mobility, which is indeed criticizable.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.3.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: "Doom and gloom predictions" and apocalyptic ideas "prevalent in Christian fundamentalism, may also help some people attribute a higher purpose to their suffering [378]" and see it as part of God's plan, instead of striving to do better.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2. Con: If religion is less necessary in developed and stable countries, it can be argued that the functions religion provides can be achieved by other systems, and thus its contributions may not really be necessary.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: However, the issue is not about necessity but whether religion is "good" for humanity.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.3. Con: There are probably ways to provide the same types of goods offered by religion, and that the costs associated may be less. But in a utilitarian sense, the mental health benefits offered by religion in impoverished areas may from some perspectives outweigh any tendency towards extremism created in a subset of those populations.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Research [379] suggests that "in places without strong social safety nets to provide people with opportunities for upward mobility, people are more likely to rely on religion for comfort".
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: That is not necessarily good: more safety nets and better opportunities could probably be more helpful to those in impoverished areas.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.1.2.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: Additionally, in places "with little to no social supports, the local church [380] may provide for people’s basic needs through free childcare programs, food pantries, and clothing drives".
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Since religion may condition help to those who belief and are part of a group, social services would be better provided by the community itself through the state.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.4.4. Pro: Religion helps to sublimate the grudges and anger that results from inequality.

1.8.10.8.5.2.4.2. Con: It is pure speculation to suggest that they lose religiosity only after having needs addressed so that prayer and hope need not be relied on. Prayer has been shown to be ineffective and hope need not be religious. The correlation is that as societies lose religiosity they become more successful, to suggest that the success causes the loss of religiosity is pure speculation. All we know is that success and lack of religion in this case go hand in hand.
1.8.10.8.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4. Pro: The secularization of society shows that religion, if it ever had a positive influence, has lost it in recent times.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1. Con: Religious rules are the main source of contemporary laws and in some cases contributed to democracy.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1. Pro: Religions emerged as an evolutionary adaptation. They spread the adoption of behaviors that provided evolutionary advantages.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2. Con: Religion has also spread behaviors that provide evolutionary disadvantages.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Martyrdom has long been celebrated by religions and can in some cases encourage disastrous behaviors such as suicide bombing.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Extreme pacifism promoted by faiths like Janism [381], or Anabaptist [382], among others, can make believers not able to defend themselves or others.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Violence only begets more violence. Hence, the act of not resorting to violence is good for humanity, not bad. Violence is not the only route to protecting one's self.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In some cases violence is the only reasonable response to violence. In the cases of mass genocide to not fight back would be to condemn millions to death.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Martyrs who respond violence with non-violence often venerated. They are not seen as bad or evil. They were good and lived peacefully in accordance to universal moral authority even to the point of death.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It is likely that many victims of genocide would rather have survived than be venerated.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Being able to defend yourself does not imply voluntarily creating violence. Self-defence and malevolence are two distinct ideas.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Violence is not the only route. Seeking help from a stronger ally through use of diplomacy to intimidate your foe through the threat of possible violence is a way as well.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Diplomacy was tried and failed in the case of Nazi Germany. Not only were the Nazis murdering German citizens but they were invading other countries, war was the only way to stop them.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: To be in a position to offer realistic threats of violence, you must have experience with self-defence so that it may be credible to your opponent.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Diplomacy and trade are options to deter violence so that you could protect yourself.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.5. Con: Many progressive movements have only gained influence through the use of violence. Even passive resistance demands violence against self in order to succeed.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.6. Con: Sometimes a word or action is so abhorrent that a non-violent response would not be enough. Ignoring , turning the other cheek or responding with more words could be an act of tolerance, and we should not tolerate the intolerant.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.7. Pro: All violence can be seen to be the result of words failing. So long as there is a chance for humans to discuss things and continue a dialogue, will not feel the need to resort to violence. If violence has occurred, it follows that we have either not used language correctly (or at all) or that our argument has failed. Sometimes our argument is successful and the other cannot find an argument to resist, and at this point they may respond with violence. Violence stems from a lack of words.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.7.1. Con: Some violence has nothing to do with communication or lack thereof.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: For instance rape. It's frequently about power.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.7.1.2. Pro: Abuse against spouses or children which is caused by anger issues and often aggravated by addiction is violence that asserts power and dominance but is not caused by lack of communication.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.1.7.1.3. Pro: Violence related to sadistic personality disorder [383] is caused by a condition in which someone derives pleasure on inflicting pain on others (or oneself).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Unwillingness to defend ones self is a personal choice that ought to be respected. Such a choice has no bearing on a persons ability to defend ones self.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: If someone is born and indoctrinated into a culture or religion which promotes absolute pacifism it is more a product of that than of their own personal informed choice.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.3. Con: Jehovah's Witnesses have never worried about defending themselves with arms. Their more effective defense [384] has been in the courts.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.4. Con: Others may protect them but they won't defend others. This seems to create inequity.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.2.4.1. Con: Protection should be provided to them by dedicated law enforcement officers. They are not obliged to take that role.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.3.4.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.4. Pro: Many religions over time have engaged in human sacrifice.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Human sacrifice could have had evolutionary benefits [385]. Thus the prevalence of human sacrifice does not necessarily counteract the evolutionary benefit of religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5. Pro: Religions' protest against safe sex is causing an epidemic.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1. Con: Most religions advocate for abstinence outside of marriage because sex with multiple partners is never 100% safe.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Research [386] shows that religious individuals are less likely to use condoms when they do engage in risky sexual behavior [387] (extramarital sex, for example), thus increasing risk of infection.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: It is not religion that causes risky sexual behavior in the first place. Religion often denounces such behavior, and as such, may lead to a lower rate of infidelity, thus reducing overall danger.
Research from the University of Nevada in Las Vegas states, "Permissive attitudes toward infidelity increase a couple’s risk and are more likely to occur in liberally minded individuals with low religiosity... (p. 8) [388]"
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.2. Con: Sex with multiple partners is safer with a condom than without it.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.3. Con: Many young people believe [389] oral sex and genital stimulation to be 'abstinent practices', however, they are still unsafe practices without the use of prophylaxis.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.4. Con: This religiously inspired approach ignores fundamental human behaviors that can, and more often than not, do transcend any indoctrinated beliefs of the conscious mind, no matter how deeply ingrained. And when that drive for intimacy does rise above (what the rational mind ultimately considers to be flaky) indoctrination, it's unwise to be uninformed and unprepared to protect against disease and unwanted pregnancy.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.5. Con: Understanding one's sexual compatibility with the person you would consider marrying is an important aspect of ultimately having a happy, healthy, long lasting, and faithful marriage.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.5.1. Pro: There is evidence [390] that sex education can improve the quality of marriage, indicating that the quality of sex is important to many people's experience of marriage.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.6. Con: Having more sexual partners may provide a variety of benefits for an individual.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.6.1. Pro: Having more sexual partners may expand people's horizons about sex as well as giving them a better comparison between what good or bad sex is, since they have something to compare it with.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.6.2. Pro: Having more sexual partners could possibly [391] increase the fertility of women.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: In Central Africa where the Catholic Church keeps advocating against condom use, the devastating HIV and AIDS epidemic is killing [392] people.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.2.1. Pro: In Kenya, around 6% percent of the population between the ages of 15 and 49 are HIV positive [393], in Uganda, close to 8% and in Zambia, 13.5 % of the adult population live with HIV.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.4. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.5.5. Con: There is more than the Catholic Church out there. Other churches promote safe sex. Generally speaking for a church the safest sex would be inside the bonds marriage and faithfulness in marriage.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.6. Con: Religions that majorly spread evolutionary disadvantageous behaviors either went extinct, have been assimilated or are regarded as primitive.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: When Mayas [394] encountered an environmental constraint (drought), their preferred solution was to reduce their population by sacrificing their peers to the rain god.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.6.2. Con: Declaring religious practices primitive now does not lessen their negative impact on history.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.7. Con: Disadvantages seen today may have been useful at some point in evolution, but are now considered evolution remnants [395].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8. Pro: Religion may have spread traits such as gullibility, cowardice or conformity.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.1. Pro: Education tends to reduce human proclivity to gullibility [396] and, at the same time, those more educated tend to be less religious.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.3.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.2. Pro: Religion often relies on simple and intuitive cognitive processes, rather than complex ones.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.3. Pro: According to research, religious people tend to have specific traits that remain constant cross-culturally and cross-religiously: religiosity is associated with to high agreeableness [397] and conscientiousness.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.3.1. Pro: In terms of values [398], religious individuals (regardless of particular faith or culture) tend to give higher importance to "tradition, conformity, and benevolence", and low  importance to "hedonism, stimulation, and   self-direction".
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.9. Pro: Religions state that it is God who provides shelter, food, water, etc. This disconnects us from nature, which is "who" actually provide our resources.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.10. Con: Just because an adaptation has negative byproducts does not make the adaptation as a whole maladaptive.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.11. Con: The fact that we're still here kinda contradicts this argument. We're the survivors of humans with religion. Religion has been an evolutionary disadvantage mainly for those that were killed by people with religion, but not for us, the survivors.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.3.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5. Con: Religion could also be a by-product of the evolutionary development of consciousness. For example, it could represent a search of meaning where there is none [399].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.2. Con: Thinking that there is a meaning in something helps us to restore feelings of certainty and clarity which in turn could improve our self-esteem [400]. Thus, it could be considered as a useful evolutionary adaptation.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3. Con: If religion was just a by-product of human's characteristics, it would not have become the dominant organizing system of every society on earth. This demonstrates that it was a useful adaptation [401], and not a maladaption (at least at the time).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Researchers consider that prosocial religions proliferated through “cultural diffusion, population expansions, and conquest” as they managed to forge “anonymous strangers into large, cohesive moral communities tied together with the sacred bonds of a common supernatural jurisdiction” (Norenzayan, p. 9 [402]).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Despite predictions of religions' demise in the last centuries, most humans in the world are still religious and religions have been growing and mutating at a quick pace (Norenzayan, p. 2) [403].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Estimates calculate that there are about 10,000 religions in the world, with most people adhering to a low number of big religions. Worldly, there are 2 billions of self-identified Christians and 1.3 people identify as Muslims (Norenzayan, p.2 [404]).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2.2. Con: In Australia, religiously unaffiliated [405] people have increased from less than 1% in 1966, to over 30% in 2016.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2.2.1. Con: This only applies to Australia, not the world.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2.3. Con: There is only one religion whose percentage share of the population is expected to grow [406] and that is Islam. This is only because Muslims have the highest fertility rate [407] of any religious group and is far above the average rate of the world population.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2.4. Con: In Europe, the number of non-religious citizens, especially among young adults, is increasing [408].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4. Con: Religion was likely an unexpected spin-off [409] of a useful adaptation - empahty. The need to understand the motives of the group members, crucial for survival, was re-employed to explain non-human objects' behavior. This good adaptation leads first to animism and ultimately to religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1. Con: Despite the religion being a possible spin-off of a positive adaptation - empathy - it does not justify the religion as something necessarily positive. Just as the ability to store fat was positive for hunter-gathers, but became a major cause of death due to obesity in the modern society, religion becomes one of the major causes for unnecessary violence and anti-scientific thinking.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Different religious beliefs and even interpretations have fueled a profound divide between humans for centuries.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.3. Pro: Even today religion has contributing to much violence and problems [410] in the middle east.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.4. Pro: Protestants and Catholics waged several wars [411] against each other in Europe despite both being Christian.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.5. Pro: The Crusades [412] added to hatred among Christians, Jews, and Muslims as they waged war for their holy lands.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.6. Con: Division does not imply harm
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.4.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.6.2. Con: When that division often involves war, violence and conflict, it does indeed imply harm.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.5.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.6.3. Con: Recent study [413] has shown that, if a society is religiously divided in two major denominations and the proportion of the minority is greater than 30% of the population, large-scale religion-based conflicts are likely to happen.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.7. Pro: For instance, Sunni and Shia [414].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.8. Pro: Religions focus too much on their differences thus making it difficult to have a common understanding with one another.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.9. Pro: Throughout history religious conflicts have lead to forced conversions [415].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.9.1. Con: Forced conversion is an example of coercion, something that exists independently of religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.10. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11. Con: While there are examples of religious intolerance, there are also examples of religion tolerance when several faiths have coexisted peacefully.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.1. Pro: There are numerous examples [416] from throughout this history of Islam of tolerance being shown to other faiths.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.1.1. Con: The quoted examples include the way in which Muslims entered Jerusalem peacefully, yet it also contrasts that with the slaughter perpetrated by Crusaders [417] in 1099 [418]. Therefore, while one religion was peaceful in that case, another one was far from peaceful.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.1.1.1. Pro: Crusaders [419] killed many Muslims and Jews or allowed them to live as long as they left the city.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.1.2. Con: While in the Caliphate of Córdoba [420] different religions coexisted, that society was very stratified. Ethnic Arabs were at the top of the social hierarchy, higher than Jews and Christians, who had to pay a tax supporting wars against Christian kingdoms in the north of Spain.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.1.2.1. Pro: The peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians in Spain was stopped by the Reconquista [421], “a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms” for about 780 years, culminating in 1492.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.1.2.1.1. Pro: Even after 1492, in Spain, descendants of Muslims were subjected to expulsions and mass persecution, the point that “indigenous Islam is considered to have been extinguished [422] in Spain”.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.2. Con: Since religion has been often a source of conflict among groups, the fact that in some cases different faiths and denominations have been able to coexist, does not detract from the fact that in the same number of cases, if not more, they have not been able to do so.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.3. Con: Long periods of harmony have been used an excuse for wrongdoing for as long as there's been wrongdoing. "She's a pillar of the community" "It's his first offence" "She runs a charity" "He employs thousands of people". They don't mean anything. The victim is still dead, ostracized or mutilated.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.4. Con: There's no rehabilitation for religions—their tenets don't change.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.4.1. Pro: Meanwhile religious fuelled malfeasance by members is condoned, forgiven, or ignored as an outlier.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.5. Con: Tolerance is claimed to take the high ground. Not because the religion doesn't believe that it's better. It's lipstick on a pig. Laws are obeyed only where the authorities have the power to implement the laws. Where religion can get away with stuff it tries, because it believes it's right.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.11.5.1. Pro: For instance numerous unconstitutional US state laws against LGBTQ [423] and women's [424] rights.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12. Con: Religious beliefs/interpretations have been responsible for the strengthening of communities and social bonds, reducing the levels of division within in-groups/those with similar beliefs. These common ideals and values have knit people together for centuries.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1. Con: They have also done the exact opposite, driving people away who have different views or religious beliefs. It is a tribal mentality that can be seen in any number of groups from football teams, nationalities, political parties etc etc
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.1. Pro: Religion is a form of tribality.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2. Pro: Religion has been used as an excuse to ostracise atheists and people of other faiths.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.9.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.3. Pro: Religion creates the illusion that people can only be considered good if they belong to a religious denomination, therefore religion discriminates.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.4. Con: Atheism has been used to ostracise [425] those with religious beliefs.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.4.1. Pro: Several communist countries that promoted atheism persecuted and marginalized those with religious beliefs.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Christians were persecuted in the Soviet Union [426].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: In comunist China [427], "religion was looked upon as a means of hostile foreign infiltration, as well as an instrument of the ruling class".
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Christians were also persecuted throughout the whole Eastern Bloc [428] (Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Albania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.5. Pro: In some occasions, religion is only charitable or helps those who believe.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.5.1. Pro: Religion only organises charity for those they believe deserve [429] it. Numerous indictments of those like the Salvation Army [430] refusing to help people because they were LGBT, or even because they were Atheist.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The practices and policies of particular religious organizations or people of religion cannot be used as evidence against all religions. Particular religions should be judged based on what they teach, not on how people who espouse the religions do or do not follow the teachings.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.5.2. Pro: Caritas, one of the largest's world humanitarian organizations, asked members in Vietnam to combine charity with evangelization [431].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.2.5.3. Pro: Religion has motivated selfless acts, but often only to others within their own religion: individuals are encouraged to volunteer and do charity work within their own community as opposed to doing things for the greater good. This "us versus them" mentality is the biggest con of religious groups.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.3. Pro: Religion stands next to race, gender and sexual preference as a primary source of bigotry, which, even where it results in no specific and/or deliberate malevolent acts, has still blighted humanity, destroying relationships and potential relationships.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.3.1. Pro: In recent decades the favourite word which religious leaders use to suggest they're not bigots is a giveaway that that's exactly what many of them are: They claim they "tolerate", a word that's open to interpretation either as biased (to placate their bigots) or unbiased (to placate everyone else).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.3.1.1. Pro: Secular laws, governments, and constitutions have played a part in religions starting to use the word tolerate not only to allow a degree of interfaith cooperation to defend their rights as they see them, but also to suggest that they'll conform to secular laws and drop some antisocial practices used against infidels.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.3.2. Pro: Many potential marriages have been stopped dead by differences of religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.1.3.3. Pro: Religions are open to interpretation and yet they claim perfection. This leads to irrepressible conflict even among people who believe in the same [432] particular religion [433].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.12.2. Con: Deeming people of the same religion as not following the imposed prescriptions strictly enough often served as casus belli, even when the real motives were of different kind. Such sort of war justification was e.g. often practiced by Saladin [434].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.13. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.14. Pro: For instance, The Great Schism [435] and subsequent hatred between the Western and the Eastern churches.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.4.1.1.15. Pro: Religion has been used throughout history to separate humanity into distinct camps. For example, in the separation [436] of India and Pakistan in 1947.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6. Pro: Much of the practices of religion are conducive towards good mental health. It is therefore likely that religion has been a good mediator of mental health for humans.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Heaven and hell can be viewed as conceptions of your potential future. By designing your own heaven (desired future) to strive for [437] and your own hell (unwanted future) to avoid [438], you are essentially maximizing your motivation [439] by using two different motivational systems.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.1.1. Con: However, "your own heaven" and "your own hell" are not what religion promote. Religions generally preempt the creation of, or usurp people's versions of, heaven or hell. Thus, led by religion, people may end up in the religion's idea of heaven, which to them may be far from optimal. For instance religion and pregnancy may lead someone to marry and settle down where they're more suited to an outrageously dangerous lifestyle with nobody left to grieve if they die.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: This is an Abraham-centric generalization of "religion."  Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism provide frameworks for a person to understand their relationship with their self, the people around them, and the world around them, and the purpose of these relationships. An argument about the utility of religion cannot simply cast aside half of the world's religious history as if it is irrelevant.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.1.2. Con: Heaven and Hell is a bipolar system based on fear, which suggest to do good things to avoid hell and not do bad things to go to heaven. It's an amoral system.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.2. Pro: Religious participation among young people is correlated [440] with a lower probability of substance abuse and juvenile delinquency
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3. Con: The fear of hell can lead to intense feelings of guilt for insignificant events or actions that are deemed acceptable by society writ large.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.1.1.1.3.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.2. Pro: Many religious people in the LGBT community feel intense fear, guilt, and cognitive dissonance due to their own nature being seen as sinful.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.3. Con: In every [441] Christian denomination in America, belief in a Heaven is stronger than a belief in a Hell.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.3.1. Con: While 72% of Americans say to believe in Heaven, 58% of adults also believe in Hell, which makes for a large number of people who can fear that sins in this life will condemn them in the afterlife.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.3.2. Con: US Christians [442], compared with non-Christians and the unaffiliated, are more likely to believe in both afterlife destinations.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.3.3. Con: The Apocalypsis Book [443] has spread a sense of imminent destruction of our planet, blaming a god's decision; instead of raising a meditation about the consequences of our decisions and lifestyle.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.4. Pro: Surveys [444] show [445] large numbers of people believe in hell. A Gallup international poll [446] suggests that 49% of people believe in hell.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.3.5. Pro: A religion is bad for the psycho social wellness of its followers if it is based on lies. To tell people that God delights in having people jabbed with pitchforks makes them think He is cruel. Very deleterious to the mental well being of those who live in fear of it.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.4. Con: If we know these practice are good for mental health, we can just do them because science tells us that they are good. On the other hand, since religion requires no experimental justification, it could tell us to do something that is horrible for mental health, and we could not protest like we can with scientific conclusions.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.5. Pro: In terms of physical health, research points that religiosity is related to a decrease in smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as having positive effects on heart disease and blood pressure.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.5.1. Pro: Longevity seems to also be improved [447] by religion (especially in men) and there is negative correlation between religiosity and suicide.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.5.1.1. Con: Religious prohibition of suicide can adequately explain the correlation, but fear of damnation does not adress the problem.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6. Con: Religious beliefs and practices often contribute to the development of certain psychiatric disorders.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.6.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.2. Pro: Some studies [448] point at greater anxiety in religious individuals and lower self-esteem when their religion portrays an image if a punitive and vindictive God.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.2.1. Con: There is certain lack of proper studies between religiosity and mental health. Some research suggest lower anxiety [449] among religious individuals and higher self-esteem when God is portrayed as loving.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.3. Pro: On sexual disorders [450], research points that male patients are more likely to come from religious homes.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.4. Pro: Hinduism [451] in India is a contributing factor in conditions such obsession, anxiety and depression.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.5. Pro: Research [452] in the US points that Catholics and Protestants have “higher levels of maladaptive interpersonal guilt than those with no religious affiliation”.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.6. Pro: Certain aspects of Christian beliefs [453] and Christian living can lead to depression, anxiety and panic attacks.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.7. Con: If something happens to shake a person's faith their entire world could fall apart. This would make their faith and religion ultimately detrimental to their mental health.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8. Con: Religion simply justifies the bad things carried out in the name of religion, enabling the wrong-doer to continue with no remorse and the promise of maintaining a place in heaven.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1. Pro: Celibacy can have a negative impact on mental health and may be a contributing factor in sexual abuse.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.1. Pro: Among some religious creeds child abuse and neglect [454] is more common when certain variables are found: authoritarianism, isolation and fear.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.2. Pro: Sexual abuse carried out by priests creates deep trauma in the victims.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.3.3.1.10.5.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.3. Pro: Sexual abstinence is not per se unhealthy but it can be psychologically harmful [455] when an individual wishes to have sex and does not, according to researchers.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.3.1. Pro: Studies have found that regular sex [456] has a protective effect on the heart, lowering the risk of heart attack in men. For men and women, “it increases blood flow to the genitals and probably helps the immune system”.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.3.2. Pro: Psychotherapist and former Benedictine priest A.W. Richard Sipe wrote about the great loneliness, depression, and emotional distress that can come from struggling with prolonged celibacy [457].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.3.3. Pro: Richard Sipe conducted a study [458] of US celibate Catholic clerics (1960 to 1985), and found that half of all priests and  brothers were sexually [459] active at any particular time. Masturbation was the most frequent sexual activity, followed by affairs with women, sex with male companions, and Internet pornography.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.3.4. Con: The claim is totally misleading on regards to the source. The source says: “People will say, ‘I want to but I’m shy,’ or ‘I don’t know how to approach people.’ That’s really hard for people and can make them feel awful about themselves.” The problem is how this unfulfilled desire can have a harmful affect on one's self-esteem that can cause anxiaty and depresion. It has nothing to do with voluntary abstinence.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.4. Pro: A conservative Irish newspaper proposed that celibacy had contributed [460] to the abuse problem within the church and an Australian public inquiry panel claimed that priests being celibate may have also contributed to abuse.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.5. Pro: A report [461], which looked at the findings of 26 royal commissions and other inquiries from Australia, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the Netherlands since 1985, found that mandatory celibacy and a culture of secrecy contributed to minors sexual abuse.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.5.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.6. Con: John Jay researchers reported that about 4 % of the 110,000 priests studied had been accused of sexual misconduct involving children. There is no consensus about the sexual abuse among the general American male population, but estimates are 1 in 10 men or close to 5% and thus the rate of abuse by Catholic priests is not higher [462] than the national estimates.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.6.1. Con: The study was "authorized and is being paid for by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops [463]".
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.6.2. Con: The 4% doesn't account for the accomplices who covered it up. Convicted layers of authority have reached at least two levels [464] above the initial perpetrator.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2. Pro: Child-marriages carried out or endorsed by many religions produce terrible mental health consequences for the victims.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2.1. Pro: A US Marriage Survey conducted in 2011 recorded responses from girls involved in child marriages from Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic, Baptist, Muslim, and other faiths [465].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2.2. Con: A study [466] with more than 500 child and adult forced marriage in the US found that no major religion promotes child marriage.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2.2.1. Con: However, among sects who force generally young girls to marry older men, religious reasons [467] are used to coerce the children.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2.3. Pro: Top Saudi Muslim cleric [468] said; "A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her".
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2.4. Con: Child marriage is not a religious [469] problem but a cultural one. Countries with similar religious devotion have very different rates of child marriages.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.2.4.1. Con: However, religious texts can be and are often used to condone [470] child marriage; religious laws often allow minors to marry and deference to religious customs have often stopped laws [471] from protecting minors' rights.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.3. Con: Some faiths reject those actions and strive to improve their culture and community of faith.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.9. Con: Rules of organized religions are methodically made so adherents cannot live without sin (thought sins etc.), forcing the adherents into constant guilt and they don't have internalized morals, since they rely on fear of God rather than really thinking something is immoral.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.6.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7. Con: While religions may have been beneficial in the past, today's societies have more advanced means of organising themselves.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1. Con: If religion were not a good thing for humankind, we would've abandoned it a long time ago.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.1. Con: This confers humankind a perfect form of decision making in which only what is good is preserved.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Discrimination, tribalism, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, authoritarianism or a lack of care for the environment, among other issues, may not be good for humankind, and yet they still exist.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Scientific method and thinking proved itself to make highly positive impact on the society, yet was abandoned first by Roman and then by Islamic civilizations.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.2. Con: Religion is a philosophical attempt at escape from the absurd [472]. It's a compulsive habit [473], analogous to nail biting [474] and humans don't change rapidly or easily, that's why religions still exists.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Kierkegaard's Leap of Faith [475] is the epistemological inability to grapple with the very nature of Existence, the paradoxes of death [476] and the Real [477].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.2. Pro: Nail biting is a good example in this context as is compulsive although note that is moreover a biological urge stemming from the times before humans had tools to pare nails.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.4. Con: The people in power of the cults won't leave their high standing positions.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.5. Con: Religion may be hard-wired in our brains, that's why it is so hard to abandon it. It's like - "If too much food were not a good thing for humankind, we would've abandoned it a long time ago".
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.5.1. Pro: There is a hypothesis called the God Gene [478] that asserts that humans are predisposed towards spirituality and religion due to a specific Gene.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.5.1.1. Con: The God gene hypothesis is heavily criticised by clerics and scientists alike and is only one of many factors leading to various "esoteric" convictions, including the belief in ESP. Carl Zimmer [479] points out how the study is fundamentally flawed.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.5.2. Con: Even if religion is hardwired into our brains it is still possible to abandon it as the numerous atheists and religious nones of the world have done. As such it is unlike food in that we do not need it to survive.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.6. Con: Abandoning Religion goes against Religious teachings.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.7. Con: People are starting to abandon religion.

1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.2. Con: Being gullible is not a survival skill, as can be attested to by anyone whose life savings have been removed by a confidence trick, including spouses whose spouse emptied their joint bank account and gave it to a religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.3. Con: Religions are still beneficial because they had been evolutionary advantageous so most of the mankind who survived still tend to be prone to religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.8. Con: Even a good evolutionary adaption can lead to evil and vice versa. Being natural doesn't mean it's good (naturalistic fallacy).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.7.1.5.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10. Con: Religion may have been a self-selecting cultural trait, which means that it has persisted without necessarily granting an evolutionary advantage.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10.1. Pro: Natural selection may in fact act on religious ideas, for example tales that are easier to remember may outcompete tales that are more challenging. This leads to some ideas spreading with no requirement for those ideas to provide their "host" individuals with an advantage (this is part of the meme hypothesis [480]).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.2.8.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10.1.2. Con: That a story is easier to remember may give it evolutionary value. The ability to quickly recall the 'moral' of a story can have application in practical ethics.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10.1.2.1. Con: The practical application depends on whether the morals of the story are actually beneficial themselves. Over time society is becoming more secular and discarding many of the morals of religion meaning society deems those morals as not beneficial.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10.2. Con: There is less evidence for a self-selecting mechanism than for one of genuine adaptation. For example, surveys [481] have shown that "religious believers [482] in the United States are happier [483], healthier, longer-lived [484], and more generous to charity and to each other than are secular people."
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.10.2.1. Con: Suveys don't provide reliable information about evolutionary advantage.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.11. Con: It seems unlikely that evolution created religion. Thousands of people didn't wake up one morning with the same set of unfounded assumptions and decide to write them down and start praying to them.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.11.1. Pro: Most religions have an account for the creation of the religion, an account that occurs before it became widespread.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.12. Con: The evolutionary advantage may have been that if you went along with the dominant religion you would not be murdered by the dominant religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13. Pro: Religion was probably indispensable for most of human history in that it improved the strength [485] of small groups to outcompete other groups.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.1. Pro: From caveman rituals [486] to the worship of the Pharaoh [487] as a man God of ancient Egypt, religion as a whole has evolved throughout history. Rituals are a cornerstone of human conduct and help bind together a society.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2. Pro: Shared religions with "big gods" that see everything and punish moral transgressions in the afterlife was initially needed to achieve trust between strangers who would otherwise cheat and exploit each other. This makes larger societies possible [488], causing such religions to spread and gain dominance through "cultural evolution" [489].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.1. Con: Trusting and social [490] behavior [491] is seen in animals who presumably have no gods.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.2. Con: Human settlements grew into civilizations because of agriculture [492]. Why they settled down from being nomadic tribes is up for debate but they were already living in social groups without developing into large societies until the development of agriculture.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.3. Pro: One of the goals of religion isn't to make you good but to remind you that you can be. If we agree on this it means that humans can also be bad. If the counter to 'bad' people in a state is the court and police. Then for the world it is God.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.3.1. Con: Suppose every country ceded its sovereignty to the UN and they drew up a common set of laws for us all. Then the counter to all bad people would be court. The fact that the legal systems are separate does not mean that there is a god above them.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.3.2. Con: Since crime is prevalent all over the world it would appear that God is not an effective counter to bad people in this world.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.4. Con: This is classic "others must fail" thinking. How would a religious group outperform the non-religious? By ostracizing or killing them or forcing them to comply. The fact that there was a victor does not mean that overall efficiency was raised.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.4.1. Pro: Relates perfectly to "the survival of the fittest", the backbone of human nature forcing the weak to submit to the powerful religion rather than their preferred.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.5. Con: Competition is a good thing where it leads to progress, but religions do not change so when a religious group wins progress is less likely.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.5.1. Con: Religions are constantly changing. The rate of change is slow, but that is a positive because it forces new ideas to be tested sufficiently before the new ideas are accepted.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.5.1.1. Con: Religion is dogmatic in nature since it believes it is divinely inspired. As such the changes it makes is when it acquiesces to secular moral pressure and the large amount of time this takes prolongs oppression.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.

1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.8. Pro: According [493] to Jonahtan Haidt's [494] research [495], religion [496] may have been part of human [497] evolution, helping make group-level evolution possible through cooperation, by way of morality. Without beliefs in omniscient judges of morality, it may have never been applied.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.5.3.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.9. Pro: Before the advent of modern ethics, a religious group had a significant advantage on the level of moral compliance of its members (because of divine omniscience), thus outperforming in the overall cooperation.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.10. Pro: Religion as a common imagined order enabled humans to organize themselves in larger numbers than before, therefore enabling them to defeat their enemies and be more efficient.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.10.1. Con: It's difficult to show an improvement in efficiency when you're spending hours each week just listening.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.11. Pro: Religion was an impressive step forward in terms of social organization and morality. It was a way to create a centralized authority which everyone could have in common, providing a stable starting place from which people could better pursue collaborative efforts and bounce ideas off of one another. It was an early marketplace of ideas.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.14. Con: Schopenhauer takes the position that the very best thing for humankind is not to have been born at all, follower very close behind by a swift death. If this is true, then any culture or development which has prolonged human existence is categorically bad for humanity.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.15. Pro: We had both religious [498] and atheistic people exist for as long as we know. But for some reason the atheists never developed pre-scientific civilization. Considering the vast number of samples, that can't possibly be coincidence.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.15.1. Con: Atheism was not as tenable a position to hold until science began explaining things previously thought to have been caused by gods.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.15.2. Con: Atheism was a capital offense [499] in many ancient civilizations. As such the reason atheists never developed their own pre-scientific civilizations is because they were persecuted by the religious majority.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.15.3. Con: Just because civilisation as a whole did not identify as atheist doesn't mean atheists didn't contribute. Atheistic philosophies were around in India, China [500], Greece and (later) Rome [501] well recorded by the 6th century BCE. And this was under penalty of death if it were openly affirmed (as a few tried and were killed for doing so).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.15.4. Pro: No viable means of a better society without religion has ever been demonstrated on any large scale.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.16. Pro: Religion provides a reassuring answer to the great questions of life, such as the meaning of life, post-mortem life, and solutions to our problems such as suffering, injustice, fear of death, and therefore natural necessity for mankind, thus arose independently in different cultures.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.17. Pro: If Atheism would give societies any advantages, those societies would overcome religious societies. But the opposite is clear. Every society known to us are somewhat religious and societies that promoted atheism, like in communistic countries, failed miserably. Because every society has some religious system, we can assume that religion is necessary for functional society regardless its shortcomings (that every social structure has).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.17.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.13.2.2.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.17.2. Con: When civilizations where first made people knew very little about science and the natural world and turned to superstition and supernatural answers. Consequently atheism was a less tenable position. A lack of information in the past creates a correlation between religiosity and the founding of civilizations not a causality.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.17.3. Con: Countries such as the USA were founded with a separation of church and state making them secular societies.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.3. Con: Laws against theft and murder and other crimes existed long before organized religion did. Examples include Urukagina [502] a king who enacted reforms to curb murder and theft among other crimes in the 24th century BC.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.4. Con: Religion is  opposing many contemporary laws.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.4.1. Pro: Legalization of some Drugs [503], legalization of Gay marriage [504], legalization of Abortion [505], are some examples of laws that have traditionally been or are currently contested by religious people.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5. Pro: Christianity has been integral for the development of democracy [506] and the rule of law in Western World and all the good that has come from it and helped people to resist totalitarian rule in these nations.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.1. Con: While Christianity undoubtedly had a large impact on western civilization saying it is the source discredits many important contributors from before Christianity. Ancient Greece and Rome have both contributed to the legal and political systems of western civilization and both predated Christianity. Legacy of Rome [507]. Birth of Democracy [508]
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.2. Con: Fascism [509], a form of totalitarianism that opposed liberal democracy, originated in Europe and ruled in Italy, Germany and Spain.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.3. Con: Christianity is actually anti-democracy: it is more authoritarian at its core as it has one power above all (God).
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: Christianity and monotheism in general often refer to adherents as sheep in a flock and Christians sometimes characterize themselves as slaves to Christ [510] this is totalitarian.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.3.2. Pro: Christianity along with its monotheistic cousins require that one both loves and fears [511] god. This is the basis of a sadomasochistic relationship illustrating the religion's totalitarian nature.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.4. Pro: Robert Woodberry wrote his doctoral thesis on the overwhelmingly positive impact of Protestant missionaries: "The missionary roots of liberal democracy [512]".
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.4.1. Pro: The study proves historically and statistically that conversionary Protestants "heavily influenced the rise and spread of stable democracy around the world", being "a crucial catalyst" for religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, and colonial reforms.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.6. Con: Religious rules also contributed in some cases to support laws like the death penalty [513].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.7. Pro: Christianity [514] played a role in the creation and adoption of capitalism [515].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.8. Con: Throughout history, the Catholic Church favored laws that opposed women's suffrage [516].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.9. Pro: Many religious ideas and ideologies have been secularized into laws which protect people, communities, and countries."...Law can, quite legitimately, be influenced by religion." theguardian.com [517]The Interaction of Law and Religion, Harold J. Berman [518]
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.9.1. Con: "The unrealistic belief that religion is always for the good, however, is a hazardous myth." - Marci A. HamiltonGod vs. the Gavel: Religion and the Rule of Law [519]
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.9.2. Con: Mixing religion and legislation forces the religious views of some on the entire population. Since religion is not required to protect the populous it should not be mingling with the law.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10. Con: Which means that contemporary laws have unjust laws, which would less likely to be a problem without religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.1. Pro: In some countries [520], churches don't have to pay taxes [521].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.1.1. Pro: In some European countries, churches even collect public taxes [522].
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.2. Pro: Girls are forced to wear skirts at school
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.3. Pro: Woman weren't allowed to vote until recently

1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.4. Pro: Some religions compel people to kill non worshippers.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.4.2. Pro: Religious people believe that the God will punish non-worshiped people in the hell, so it seems a 'good' action to kill them.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.4.2.1. Pro: Murdering someone in any system with rule of law is not a moral or good action.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.5. Pro: It used to be punishable by death [523] to have sex outside of marriage and some countries still penalize [524] extra-marital sex.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.5.1. Pro: In some Islamic countries, women are incarcerated after being raped [525] since it is considered adultery and thus legally punished.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.6. Pro: Homosexuality was illegal [526] and still is in some countries, and marriage [527] is still not legal in many places.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7. Pro: There are laws that favour churches over morality.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7.1. Pro: Laws allow priests to not report crimes said in confession.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7.1.1. Pro: In Australia, churches have said if the law changes and priests legally have to report child abuse to police, especially in a confession [528], that the priests [529] would break the law [530]. So, even when the law forces priests to report [531] it, they might not.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7.1.1.1. Pro: Bishops have been allowing priests to abuse children for decades in Australian Christian Churches.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7.2. Pro: There are many claims of child abuse in the church that go unreported until the child grows up.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7.2.1. Pro: Laws don't force priests to report child abuse they know other priests are committing.

1.8.10.8.5.4.1.10.7.2.1.5. Pro: It has taken a long time for the government to improve [532] the laws to prevent priests abusing children.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.11. Con: Countries that are more secular and tolerant, with socially liberal laws [533], often opposed by religion, are more likely to have more economic growth.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.11.1. Pro: Those laws include legalizing same-sex relationships, divorce, abortion, etc.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.12. Con: It is true that religion may have codified & disseminated basic natural/moral values/principles necessary for human co-existence in society and long term survival as a species. But it's a long stretch to assert that those same principles were created by religion.
1.8.10.8.5.4.1.13. Pro: Religion helped or enhanced international trade [534], therefore contributing to global economic development.
1.8.10.8.6. Con: We have advanced civilizations that hold no ties to western religion. As such,  religion's effect is not obvious.
1.8.10.8.7. Con: Christianity has been a part of Western society, but it having had a net positive effect is not a given.
1.8.10.8.7.1. Pro: Religion has historically opposed science
1.8.10.8.7.1.1. Con: During the golden age of Islam, the faith was a major source of support for the advancement of science.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1. Pro: The rise of Islam [535] saw the rise of support for science [536], the wider adoption of Algebra [537], and numerous other technological innovations, as well as an increase in general prosperity.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Islamic Golden Age [538] (8th century to the 14th century) is a period in which "science, economic development and cultural works flourished".
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Correlation does not imply cause and effect.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.3. Con: Post hoc ergo proter hoc. It is a common phenomenon that a large common transportation, linguistic and judicial medium coupled with a grade of cultural tolerance - as it was during the first centuries of Islam - allows for a rapid spread of ideas and thus a boost in arts, sciences and technology.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The creation of the Achaemenid empire [539] created such a medium and induced a rapid progress e.g. in architecture [540] and irrigation [541], while religious motives played a marginal role in the empire building.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Greek expansion over Mediterranean and Black seas created such a medium, eventually sparking the Greek Golden Age, but it was not religiously motivated.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Macedonian conquests and forming of Hellenic states had nothing to do with the spread of a religion, yet the medium they've created allowed for the most spectacular bloom of science, art and technology before the Early Modern Era.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.3.4. Pro: Today's Globalization is not religiously motivated.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.1.3.5. Pro: Roman empire saw the last bloom of the Greek scientific thought, and promoted the spread of numerous [542]advanced [543] technologies [544], while for the upper classes and urban centers religion was becoming more of a tradition as a belief.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.2. Con: Religious islamic dogma also helped end the Golden Age [545] and has not recovered intellectually or scientifically to this day.
1.8.10.8.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Researchers [546] point at other causes (rather than religion or theologians) of the end of the golden age, because religion encouraged the study of sciences.
1.8.10.8.7.1.2. Con: In the "Dark Ages [547]" (Early Middle Ages) scientific development has been arrested due to poor economic condition and political stability. After this period the Church was in fact the largest single benefactor of science in history. Tragic conflicts with individuals like Galileo do not represent the general picture.
1.8.10.8.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.
1.8.10.8.7.1.4. Con: The Dalai Lama is convinced that religion and science are not mutually exclusive [548]. He explains that they are complementary sources [549] of knowledge and that none should be excluded.
1.8.10.8.7.1.4.1. Con: Some religious beliefs are indeed contrary to science and in no way complementary.
1.8.10.8.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: One relevant example: The theory of evolution [550] makes it impossible for the existence of Adam and Eve [551] as described in Genesis.
1.8.10.8.7.1.4.1.2. Pro: An example: Flat Earth Societies [552]. Either the Earth is flat as some religions suggest or it is round as science (part of which is observation) proves.
1.8.10.8.7.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.3.3.1.
1.8.10.8.7.1.6. Pro: Due to religious push back stem cell research [553] was restricted and in part banned.
1.8.10.8.7.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.1.1.3.
1.8.10.8.7.1.8. Pro: The Catholic Church has disputed the theory evolution [554].
1.8.10.8.7.1.9. Pro: In order to maintain its power, the Church has wanted to be the center of the rationalism thinking, erasing for ages the science developing and using instruments as faith and hell threat to keep the power.
1.8.10.8.7.1.10. Pro: Religion has punished those with new (and correct) ideas setting back progress.  For example [555], Galileo was imprisoned for writing in support of heliocentrism.
1.8.10.8.7.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.
1.8.10.8.7.1.11. Pro: Religions have destroyed knowledge in the name of their god countless times through history. Thus religions delayed advancement of humanity.
1.8.10.8.7.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.3.
1.8.10.8.8. Pro: Christianity leaves in its wake a roost of social, cultural, educational, scientific, and economic accomplishments, a record atheism cannot begin to compete with.
1.8.10.8.8.1. Pro: Abstract, Archetypal, Symbolic and Allegorical thought lie at the roots of both religion and creative endeavor.
1.8.10.8.8.2. Con: All of which, followed the 500 years of the "Dark Ages". For 500 years, science was held back by religion. (Tim O'Neill on The NonSequitur Podcast Ep17: History for Atheist [556] )
1.8.10.8.8.3. Con: Christianity has also left in its wake war, destruction, bigotry, and, in some cases, invasive imperialism or colonialism.
1.8.10.8.8.3.1. Con: Religion codifies and retroactively justifies these underlying evolved tendencies in humans but does not create them. Correlation not causation.
1.8.10.8.8.3.2. Con: It is an injustice to Christianity to apply to it the results of political dominance stemming from human greed.
1.8.10.8.8.4. Con: The Church persecuted, killed, burned any and all opponents to its view. A record practical atheism doesn't even want to compete with.
1.8.10.8.8.4.1. Con: The Catholic Church was relatively tolerant compared to other religions and political movements.
1.8.10.8.8.4.1.1. Pro: Atheist states cannot claim any prizes other than ones for maliciousness [557], brutality [558]and volume [559]on this particular branch of argument. One might go as far to say that a Godless state is capable of travesty [560] without mercy.
1.8.10.8.8.4.1.2. Con: This is a what-about-ism. Being relatively tolerant does not excuse, negate, or justify one's still intolerant actions.
1.8.10.8.8.5. Con: Christianity forcefully imposed its dominion over all aspect of human conditions (social, cultural, educational, scientific and economic).
1.8.10.9. Pro: Religion has been instrumental in the promotion and creation of art.
1.8.10.9.1. Pro: Religion has provided an incredible amount of inspiration [561] for very talented artists in history.
1.8.10.10. Pro: Religion has contributed towards science and education.
1.8.10.10.1. Con: Nowadays, science is too advanced to benefit from religious theories or practices anymore, and education stopped being a religious monopoly hundreds of years ago.
1.8.10.10.2. Pro: Medieval cities were often built around catholic monasteries. Monks [562] were ones of the most educated people. They often shared their skills and knowledge [563] for labor/goods helping local communities progress.
1.8.10.10.3. Pro: There have been many advances in disciplines such as astronomy, physics, mathematics and ethics that are directly tied to a religious education [564].
1.8.10.10.4. Con: Science endured and flourished in spite of religion not because of it.
1.8.10.10.4.1. Con: Some of the larger Athiest states have ridiculous [565] and unethical [566] research avenues due to politics and ego. The Church does not have a monopoly on discouraging genuine science.
1.8.10.10.4.1.1. Con: No particular religion does, but Religion itself, yes.
1.8.10.10.4.2. Con: The list of Catholic priests and and Catholic lay scientists is quite extensive [567]. In the chaos that followed the fall of the Roman Empire and the great population alterations, the stability the Catholic Church provided undoubtedly helped science through the dark ages.
1.8.11. Pro: Religions will no longer hold back social or scientific  progress.
1.8.11.1. Con: If we banned religion, religious individuals would likely revolt against whatever regime did this. Vast resources would be needed to quell the masses, detracting us from investing in scientific pursuits.
1.8.11.1.1. Pro: Followed by the development of other superstitions -- like homeopathy.
1.8.11.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.8.11.2. Con: That may depend on the definition of progress.
1.8.11.3. Pro: Faith is to reason what concussion is to a brain, the resulting state of a shock, the shock in question is when a mind first experiences the Absurd [568], the epistemological inability to grapple with the paradoxes of Existence and Death.
1.8.11.3.1. Pro: That is what "Revelation [569]" is, the experiencing of the absurd.
1.8.11.3.2. Pro: The actual "experience" of the Absurd, of Revelation, is very real and profoundly disturbing. You can't blame people for reacting with Faith to this experience, like you can't blame someone for using crutches after breaking a leg but you can question them for clutching at those crutches for the rest of their lives...
1.8.11.4. Pro: Getting rid of attempts towards getting Creationism or Noah's Ark into science textbooks would be a great win for education.
1.8.11.5. Pro: Ending institutional support for "magical thinking" will perhaps sway a larger swath of humanity towards rational thinking, particularly as older generations pass away.
1.8.11.6. Con: Religion and Science can be compatible.
1.8.11.6.1. Pro: Georges Lemaître [570], the father of the Big Bang Theory [571], was a Catholic priest, and an astronomer, and professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven. He would be proof that religion and science can co-exist, and those that are devout in any sort of religion can also make endeavors in science as well.
1.8.11.7. Pro: Religion propagates disinformation that undermines real-world and scientific discoveries.
1.8.11.7.1. Con: This is refuted by centuries of scientific discoveries with religion, often (and historically usually) by religious people.
1.8.11.7.1.1. Con: Since for most of those centuries, education (thus knowledge and science) was under the exclusive dominion of the clergy, this point is rather moot.
1.8.11.7.1.2. Con: The fact that many scientists were religious or even helped by religious institutions, does not negate the fact that religion has historically opposed scientific discovery that contradicted religious ideas.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1. Pro: The Catholic church used the Inquisition [572] to prosecute anyone who espoused  views deemed as heretic (for example, some scientific ideas) convicting people to different sentences, including death by burning.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The Spanish Inquisition [573] is a perfect example of men, in this case the monarchy, defying clear religious doctrine for malicious self interests. It is an example of men abusing authority, not of actual religion abusing people. "Love your neighbor as yourself." Follow Christ, not men falsely claiming to represent Him.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If organized religions are lead by men, and men are bound to malicious self interests, then it is likely that religions often fall prey to nefarious actions against fellow men.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Violence is not what religion is about. Even if you meet a so called 'infidel', violence is not the way to treat a human being.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Only the Spanish Inquisition [574] operated completely under the royal Christian authority (though staffed by clergy), yet many sentences dictated during Inquisition trials were made within the judicial system [575] of the Roman Catholic Church.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: Cecco d'Ascoli  was the first university scholar burned [576] by the Inquisition.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.3. Con: One incident, in one branch of Christianity, in a small period of time, is not representative for all religion.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The Inquisition [577], in different forms, lasted from the 12th century to the 19th century, in various territories and affecting a branch of Christianity that today represents [578] 1.1 billion people, 50% of Christians around the globe and 16% of the world's population.
1.8.11.7.1.2.1.4. Pro: Italian Giordano Bruno [579] was tortured and killed by the church of Rome for having introduced the concept of infinity of the universe, the multiplicity of the worlds, and the motion of the Earth respect to the sun.
1.8.11.7.1.2.2. Pro: Heads of religions recognize only the parts of science which fit the description of the world they already give to the masses. All other science is called "sacrilege" and "untrue" and the proponents are persecuted. That narrows fields of scientific research and slows down the spread of new discoveries. Examples: Book burning [580], Galileo Galilei [581], Charles Darwin [582].
1.8.11.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: With religions often claiming things contrary to science, it can not only encourage irrational thought, but encourage to the point of normalizing anti-science attitudes such as climate change denial.
1.8.11.7.1.2.2.2. Pro: For example, many Christians believe [583] the world is 10,000 years old.
1.8.11.7.1.2.3. Pro: The Catholic Church has disputed the theory evolution [584].
1.8.11.7.1.2.4. Pro: Due to religious push back stem cell research [585] was restricted and in part banned.
1.8.11.7.2. Pro: Humanity is not looking into "spiritual" related topics with a scientific approach / using modern technologies, because those topics are considered part of the religions' realm and religions think they already have all the answers.
1.8.11.8. Pro: Religious beliefs are founded on holy books that were written so long ago that many of their teachings are unacceptable in contemporary society.
1.8.11.9. Pro: The assumption that a deity exists puts a ceiling on how far human progress can go.
1.8.11.10. Pro: The concept of prayer suggests that human progress is unnecessary; "ask and you shall receive."
1.8.11.11. Pro: Monotheistic religions restrict the definition of human progress to a spectrum of submission. Those at the bottom of the spectrum do not submit at all; those considered the 'most progressive' are those that submit the most.
1.9. Con: A ban on religion may bring harmful consequences.
1.9.1. Pro: Without religion, underground spiritual sects might form with more ease because of the lack of other choices for people who need guidance, especially cults with nefarious intentions and methods.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Some underground religious cults have been known to practice mass suicide : (1 [586]), (2 [587])
1.9.1.2. Pro: Some underground religious cults have practiced slavery [588].
1.9.1.3. Pro: A few underground religious cults have practiced cannibalism (1 [589])
1.9.1.4. Pro: A few underground religious cults used followers to do criminal acts : en.wikipedia.org [590] www.bbc.com [591]
1.9.1.5. Pro: The Church of Almighty God in China were responsible for crimes committed from 2002 to 2014 (en.wikipedia.org [592]).
1.9.1.6. Pro: The China Baiyang Sigui Lingbao Holy Path created in China is a cult that tortured a cult member to death. (www.taiwannews.com.tw [593])
1.9.1.7. Con: Organised and established religions are not demonstrably better than underground sects at preventing harmful behaviours
1.9.2. Pro: AIDS is uncommon in North Africa [594] because Islam condemns sex outside marriage and prostitution. If religions are banned, there is a high risk of AIDS infesting North Africa as well.
1.9.3. Pro: This will cause radicalization. [595]
1.9.4. Pro: If Christianity or Islam ends up being true, this would doom everyone on Earth to hell.
1.9.4.1. Con: There are different versions of Christianity and Islam. And many indications that most current interpretations were influenced by events at the time of their development. There is no "true" version of either religion.
1.9.4.2. Con: This is a version of Pascal's wager. God would know if we believe "for insurance", and discount it.
1.9.5. Pro: Any attempt to ban religion would amplify the precise problems it seeks to minimize or eliminate and create backlash [596].
1.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.11.1.
1.9.5.2. Pro: A "ban on religion" is simply a new and clearly tyrannical religion, with all the problems of any religion regarding adherence, punishment of apostates, etc.
1.9.5.3. Pro: Even if you believe something is wrong, unless it directly affects others it should never be banned, because people always double down when forced against their believes. Banning religion would also strongly reinforce the idea to terrorist that they are doing the correct thing, because they would actually be prosecuted.
1.9.6. Pro: Many religious groups engage in charity and charitable work in their local communities and beyond.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Historically, the Christian Church has been the greatest provider of not-for-profit social good and responsible for the building of countless schools, hospitals, and other vital social institutions.
1.9.7. Pro: Banning religion would in itself cause more conflict than has ever been seen in all of history.
1.9.7.1. Pro: Though they are demonstrably untrue and largely harmful to societies, people should be allowed to believe what they wish to because enacting thought crime policies would be even more harmful.
1.9.7.1.1. Pro: A ban might enhance a religious groups sense of being alianated, therefore acknowledging it, fortifying their irrational opinions.
1.9.7.2. Pro: A ban on religion feeds the persecution complex. Doing so may stop outward religious expression but will strengthen internal belief and conviction which while not harmful is contrary to the point of banning religion.
1.9.7.3. Pro: Implementing a global ban on religion would require the introduction of a "world government" with the power to impose laws on every country in the world. Creating such a world government would likely trigger the bloodiest war in the history of mankind.
1.9.7.4. Pro: This would simply be a tool of the powerful to eliminate viewpoints they do not like. They would simply label any viewpoint they dislike as "religious", and any viewpoint they like as non-religious. All viewpoints, including religious ones should only face the restriction of social acceptance, not the restrictions of top-down bans.
1.9.8. Pro: Historical attempts at banning religion have proved disastrous.
1.9.8.1. Con: Enver Hoxha declared Albania "the world's first atheist state" in 1967. Although religious practice has revived since the end of communism in the early 90's, Albania remains one of the most religiously tolerant [597] countries on earth. In this case, the suppression of religion was not disastrous; it seems to have served as a mellowing force.
1.9.8.2. Pro: Historically, suppression of religion is accompanied by genocide. Recent efforts to legally (or forcefully) change or abolish religions in Russia, China, Germany, Cambodia - or even among the indigenous populations of America - have proved in that in order to eliminate a religion, the religious must first be eliminated.
1.9.8.3. Pro: Banning religion can lead to persecution and violence like in atheistic communism regimes.
1.9.8.3.1. Pro: Atheism under Communism has caused more misery and death then any other philosophy in human history.
1.9.8.3.1.1. Con: Soviet ideology was pretty much an organized religion: it had good analogs of clergy [598], theology [599], prophets, scriptures, holy relics [600], chiliastic [601] paradise [602], inquisition, at times even baptism [603]. It only failed deities and afterlife, but not every religion does have them both.
1.9.8.3.1.2. Pro: Estimates consider that communist regimes, outside of war, killed [604] around 110 millions unarmed people from 1900 to 1987 through government agent and pursuant to government policy or high command.
1.9.8.3.2. Con: Atheism, secularism or humanism in democratic societies might not cause harmful consequences.
1.9.8.3.3. Con: It is unclear if the harmful consequences derive from atheism and the banning of religion or from non-democratic and tyrannic regimes.
1.9.8.3.4. Pro: During the 20th century, the Soviet Union [605] ended killing around 20 million of their own people, despite the fact it was a secular society.
1.9.8.3.4.1. Con: This does not mean religion would have stopped the atrocity or that the atrocity was due to the lack of religion.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1. Con: What it does mean is that lack of religion is not correlated with success (and conversely, religion is not correlated with lack of success)
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: There has not been a truly secular society until recently. The data set simply isn't big enough to determine if it is the secularization of society that allowed them to be more successful.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Though religion may be the foundation of many civilizations, increased economic development, education and urbanization lead countries to be more secular [606].
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The world’s most religious [607] countries are in very low positions in the Human Development Index [608], while the least religious countries are "very high" or "high" in the same index.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Statistics [609] suggest some level of correlation between religiosity and lower human development rates.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Recent research [610] has found that countries that become more tolerant and secular [611] are more likely to become wealthier and economically stronger.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Studies [612] suggest that secularisation precedes economic development. Even if the causal link is not completely established, the idea that it is economic developement what leads to secularization has been ruled out.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The countries that are very high in the index got there through an extended period of Christian culture. Recent decline in Christian belief has come through materialism, consumerism, individualism, so they are living off spiritual capital in a sense.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Correlation without causation. Arguably gun powder had a more profound effect on the economic well being of many countries since it enabled them to colonize other parts of the world. The industrial revolution had an even higher impact Christianity simply had nothing to do with their economic success.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Possibly an effect rather than a cause. Christian countries were fairly hard on others for significant periods, for instance the Crusades [613], the Spanish Inquisition [614].
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Industrial Revolution [615] started and took pace in a period of religious skepticism [616], with less religiously restrictive countries decisively outperforming the more religious ones.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Research points that religious belief declines in economically developed countries [617] with “greater existential security, including income security (income equality and redistribution via welfare states) and improved health”.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: As scientific knowledge allows to reduce uncertainty [618], in democracies [619] with strong economies and welfare provisions, people find less need to deal with the uncertainty of the future through religion.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Among those more educated [620], there is a tendency to have higher levels of non belief [621] or to, at least, hold religious beliefs with less certainty.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Some studies show a negative correlation between intelligence [622] and religiosity, possibly explained by the fact that intelligent people are less likely to conform to dogma and tend to adopt a analytic [623] way of thinking.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: These studies may not take into account other variables. Since many positive social conditions (education, urbanization, income, etc.) also happen to be correlated with loss of religion, the link could be explained more by those causes than by intelligence and religion themselves.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Correlation does not indicate causation. Education could just as easily be structured in a way that attracts non-religious people.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Statistics show that birth rates decrease [624] to dangerous levels in those same countries. Perhaps a decline in religious belief is not a good thing.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: The cause of this trend could be that religion is less needed in economically developed countries; not that religion stagnates economic growth. Wealthy, comfortable people have little use for a theology that promises rewards in the afterlife. The impoverished, however, may find significant value in religious teachings telling them that human value is not measured by money, and that rewards await them in heaven for living a good life on earth.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Following that logic, religion can then make those impoverished endure the worst situations and not strive to do better in exchange for the promise of a possible better afterlife.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: Giving food to a starving person also risks encouraging complacency, yet few would argue that doing so is immoral.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: While an individual action that helps someone in a time of need is not immoral, in a macro level, making people dependent on help and charity deprives them of striving for social mobility, which is indeed criticizable.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Charity, for example, often endorses inequality instead of fixing its roots.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Research [625] suggests that income inequality may trigger human empathy and thus it is positively associated with the probability to actively participate in charitable organizations.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Charity [626] validates injustices and it is not an effective response to economic inequality.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Charity is subjective and creates categories: those deserving of it and those who do not.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Some charities give to those in need but do very little [627] in fighting for policy changes like increased minimum wages or other welfare policies.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: "Doom and gloom predictions" and apocalyptic ideas "prevalent in Christian fundamentalism, may also help some people attribute a higher purpose to their suffering [628]" and see it as part of God's plan, instead of striving to do better.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2. Con: If religion is less necessary in developed and stable countries, it can be argued that the functions religion provides can be achieved by other systems, and thus its contributions may not really be necessary.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: However, the issue is not about necessity but whether religion is "good" for humanity.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.3. Con: There are probably ways to provide the same types of goods offered by religion, and that the costs associated may be less. But in a utilitarian sense, the mental health benefits offered by religion in impoverished areas may from some perspectives outweigh any tendency towards extremism created in a subset of those populations.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: Research [629] suggests that "in places without strong social safety nets to provide people with opportunities for upward mobility, people are more likely to rely on religion for comfort".
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.3.1.1. Con: That is not necessarily good: more safety nets and better opportunities could probably be more helpful to those in impoverished areas.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.2.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: Additionally, in places "with little to no social supports, the local church [630] may provide for people’s basic needs through free childcare programs, food pantries, and clothing drives".
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Since religion may condition help to those who belief and are part of a group, social services would be better provided by the community itself through the state.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Religion helps to sublimate the grudges and anger that results from inequality.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Even if it currently is impossible to determine if increased secularization causes more development, empirical evidence seems to support that more development does cause religiosity to decline.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase economic growth [631]. Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Maybe (if this is true) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2.3. Con: The quoted article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2.4. Con: Linked article is pointing to Max Weber theory in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism". This theory doens't confirm the thesis that religion is beneficial for economy.  First of all this book is really ancient stuff without real data. Second - this book states that only protestantism was beneficial for economy. This book was written as a critics of Marx theory and was biased.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2.5. Con: The same source points out also that "the effect of greater religious participation is to reduce economic growth". The positive relationship described is dependent on "believing relative to belonging (attending)", not on religious belief itself.
1.9.8.3.4.1.1.1.2.2.6. Pro: The Puritan heritage of the US has deeply embedded a work ethic that has produced a remarkable economy, and a working population that is content with more work hours per week, and more workdays per year than most other developed nations. nyti.ms [632]. britannica.com [633]
1.9.8.3.4.2. Con: The fact that secular societies have also committed atrocities doesn't exonerate or ameliorate the atrocities committed in the name of religion.
1.9.8.3.4.3. Con: Any dictatorship has been (and will be) bad. This regardless of religious or secular "ism" claimed by the dictator. The dictator doesn't really care about any other "ism" than his (not her) ego-ISM and strive for more power.
1.9.8.3.4.4. Con: Soviet ideology was pretty much an organized religion: it had good analogs of clergy [634], theology [635], prophets, scriptures, holy relics [636], chiliastic [637] paradise [638], inquisition, at times even baptism [639]. It only failed deities and afterlife, but not every religion does have them both.
1.9.9. Pro: Religion in its simplest form could be an idea. Banning religions may create a huge vacuum in a space that was filled up for centuries with faith and matter of assurance for mankind. Taking it away altogether might create a pandemonium to fill that space that may exist once ideologies become non-existent.
1.9.10. Pro: If a God exists, surely banning its worship would not go unpunished.
1.9.10.1. Pro: -> See discussion #2629: God [640] exists.
1.9.10.2. Pro: -> See discussion #3491: The God of classical monotheism (omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent mind) exists.
1.9.10.3. Con: -> See discussion #1960: Because of the existence of evil, there cannot be a monotheistic God (as traditionally conceived).
1.9.11. Pro: Religion is a belief system. Banning it, is like prohibiting someone from believing something on which there life seems to be depended upon. It is like, one day, someone will come and say, "Your mother is not your mother" [1]. In fact, you were told as a kid that SHE is your mother same as you were told about your religion. It will be as painful as [1] to ban religion
1.10. Con: There are better solutions than completely baning all religions.
1.10.1. Pro: A ban could be placed only on extremist religions and religious individuals.
1.10.1.1. Pro: This would not affect harmless religions.
1.10.2. Pro: Bans and rules could be used against specific bad acts, rather than against religions overall.
1.10.3. Con: Religious belief itself might be harmful.
1.10.3.1. Con: In most instances belief in the supernatural is not dangerous at all [641].
1.10.4. Pro: A ban is not necessary since religion may just die out in the future.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Religion is a way to think about the unknown and thus less necessary the more we know.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Religion is a shorthand mode of thinking about ways in which to act within a given set of facts. Religion makes intuitive claims about "ought" while positing allegorical [ often ridiculous and unfounded ] claims about what "is".
1.10.4.2. Con: Humans have an innate need [642] to organize around a common Phenomenon/Belief. Sports, for example, are almost a religion in many places and give fans a sense of belonging.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: While many social phenomena such as sports fandom have some of the same properties as religious experience, a society where only those phenomena existed and superstitious beliefs in gods and souls had disappeared could reasonably be described as a society with no religion.
1.10.4.2.2. Pro: This supports the notion that religion is evolving and may soon die out as it is subsumed into ever more sophisticated versions of itself that more closely reflect an advanced information and science based society. A religion of the intellect may soon replace supernatural claims.
1.10.4.3. Pro: The number of people claiming "none" on polls asking about religion are on the rise. [643] Religion's demise is just a waiting game. No ban required.
1.10.4.4. Pro: There are now more atheists and agnostics [644] in the UK than there are Christians, particularly among young people, nearly 3/4 of whom are not religious.
1.10.5. Pro: Supporting secularism, as opposed to banning religion, is likely to be much more effective.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Implement a rewards system with which to entice secular rational persons to reproduce. The birth rates are falling in secular humanist countries.
1.10.5.2. Con: Doing so on a governmental level shows a partisan preference for a particular worldview. This would be the inverse of Middle Age religious dogma that saw the persecution for other belief structures. Even if law only encourages secularism the real-world ramifications would be a net negative for those not of that worldview and thus would equate to preferential treatment based on thought
1.10.5.3. Pro: Mandating education about where religion comes from and about the evidence for and against its beliefs as well as teaching an understanding of Bayesian analysis of prior probabilities and evidence would be impartial and would make people leave religion because they thought it through rather than leaving because they must.
1.10.5.4. Pro: Suppression of free will is never successful. Rather than a ban, maybe just active promotion of a set of human morals that assures fair treatment across all classes would be better.
1.10.5.5. Pro: Banning religion is a ham-fisted approach to the problem. The best way to fight the demagoguery of organized religion is to simply illustrate a better way to live, to prove kindness, generosity and universal love are altruistic good, and not the discovery or monopoly of religion. Then finally people will see for themselves we have outgrown it once and for all.
1.10.5.6. Pro: Offering more education in science would also be effective, as most of the religious claims about the world can be contradicted with science.
1.10.5.7. Pro: If ones wishes to diminish religion's power, the best solution is to simply remove their tax favored status and their property tax exemption.
1.10.5.7.1. Pro: -> See discussion #14255: Churches in the United States should lose their automatic tax-exempt status.
1.10.5.8. Con: Secularism [645] can be just as harmful as many radical religious ideologies.
1.10.5.8.1. Con: Linking to an article about a state atheist, Communist regime persecuting religious people in it's efforts to ban all religion is not an argument against secularism and is especially not an argument against preferring secularism over banning all religion. Banning all religion is a different thing from secularism, and China is doing the former.
1.10.5.8.2. Con: Secularism coupled with freedom and respect for human rights, within the context of a democracy with proper rule of law, has not proven to be that harmful.
1.10.6. Pro: Fundamentalists, extreme or even violent actors and values within religion are the problem, not religion. Regulations could be in place to ban those.
1.10.6.1. Con: Religions are definitely the problem. They generalise lies as the foundation for a lifestyle, daily practices and traditions that are detrimental or even dangerous for whole group of people (women's right, etc.)
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: The usual issue comes from a religion's description of the creation of the world. They often include the coming of humans into such a world, and in the most popular religions, the relative place of women compared to that of men. However, we know for certain how humans came up in this world, and it's none at all like in the "holy books".
1.10.6.1.2. Pro: Another proven-to-be-lie is the Exodus as described in the Bible. This include the concept of Promise Land, and that Israel belongs to a particular group of people "chosen by god".
1.10.6.2. Pro: It is literalist, sometimes violent strains of religious fundamentalism that are more closely correlated with the problems a ban wouls seek to solve. To place a ban on all religion is to ascribe to the whole what is actually a disease of specific parts.
1.10.6.3. Pro: Attrocities carried out in the name of the religion are the issue at hand. Taking away control from the those people would be a solution. For example, not buying oil from Saudi Arabia so it has funds to finance terrorism [646].
1.10.6.4. Pro: What needs to be eliminated is hatred and intolerance between people of different religions, and not religion itself.
1.10.7. Pro: Banning anything, is not a good decision. Even if the thing itself is detrimental or useless.
1.10.7.1. Con: By that logic, drugs, weapons, slavery or human/animal torture could not be banned either. Some things that a given society deems as very detrimental can and are indeed banned or limited.
1.10.7.2. Con: In the easiest language, you propose to ban prohibition. It's a paradoxical logic that contradicts itself.
1.11. Con: The right to profess a religion freely is fundamental.
1.11.1. Pro: Banning religion would be against freedom of thought.
1.11.1.1. Con: There is no "Free thought [647]"
1.11.1.2. Con: Religion is the very opposite of freethought [648].
1.11.1.3. Pro: Banning religion is tantamount to thought crime, which is unethical.
1.11.1.4. Pro: Christianity condems certain thoughts [649] and instructs to take thoughts captive [650]. Banning it would help ensuring freedom of thought.
1.11.1.4.1. Con: The fact that Christianity condemns some thoughts and requires to control your way of thinking is not a problem as long as it's an internal policy. If something might be considered to be banned it'd be forcing such approach on others, but Christianity as such doesn't seem to require it.
1.11.1.4.1.1. Pro: Fighting thought crime with a thougth crime doesn't seem to be a good approach. It's better to focus on highlighting and executing current laws, which already prohibit forcing a way of thinking - as state by law of freedom of thinking - rather than banning Christianity as such.
1.11.1.4.1.2. Pro: Letters of Paul are centered on internal Christian communities problems rather than about non-Christians' ones. Therefore it is unlikely that this sentences are to be treated as something to force on others.
1.11.1.4.1.3. Pro: The fact that some parts of religion make such an action is not a proof that it is general or accepted by a religion as such. It's about certain fractions of Christianity (e.g. Catholicism) or even a part of it, rather than about Christianity as a whole.
1.11.2. Pro: Banning all religions globally would be undemocratic, since most people follow a religion. [651]
1.11.2.1. Con: Such a ban could be applied gradually, and while providing clear alternatives, like hobby groups, psychology, etc.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: Starting such approach would still require most to agree with it to make it democratic.
1.11.3. Con: Fundamental rights [652] do not accrue when their nature is unclear, such as in the case of religion.
1.11.3.1. Con: Religions should not be banned because the definition of "religion" is too unclear. Such a ban seems like it could be used to ban things that should not be banned.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: Religion is [653] "the service and worship of God or the supernatural," but this is too vague to ban.
1.11.3.1.1.1. Pro: It is unclear whether mediumship is a religion.
1.11.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Mediumship involves paranormal beliefs and interaction with the supernatural [654] but not worship of a deity, so it has some things in common with religion but not others.
1.11.3.1.1.2. Pro: It is unclear whether parody religions such as Pastafarianism are really "religions."
1.11.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Presumably a real religion should involve genuine belief on the part of at least some participants, but it's not clear whether parody religions have actual believers.
1.11.4. Pro: While the reason for a proposed ban have not been stated, the primary reason against is simple: it is a basic human right [655].
1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.1.
1.11.6. Pro: This is no different than the church "banning" the heliocentric view of the solar system. Bans on systems of thought are fascist at their core.
1.11.6.1. Con: This would not be the case for banning systems of fascist thought.
1.11.6.2. Pro: A free society supports diverse systems of thought -- even wildly divergent systems, provided they do not negatively impact democracy, individual rights ...etc. A more selective approach is what's needed here.
1.11.6.2.1. Pro: Banning Creationism in textbooks -- banning the teaching in Biology classes are ways to selectively reduce the encroachment of religious beliefs in society. A step further in classrooms might outline how creationism does a bad job explaining observed natural phenomena. Expose instead of ban. Understanding is more powerful than policy.
1.11.6.3. Pro: Religious citizens [656] of the USSR practiced religion secretly.
1.11.6.4. Con: In most civilized countries, system of thought advocating violence on groups of people based on ethnicity, origin, sexual orientation, etc. are illegal. That includes inciting such violence, promoting hatred, advocating genocide, vilification. We see such system of thoughts in many religion.
1.11.6.4.1. Pro: The biblical curse of Moses on Ham was used and is still used to justify racism.
1.11.6.4.1.1. Pro: Mormons [657] use the biblical curse of Ham to justify banning black men from priesthood.
1.11.6.4.1.2. Pro: The curse of Ham was used to justify slavery [658].
1.11.6.4.2. Pro: Christianity and Judaism advocate [659] violence to non-believer in the old testament : Exodus 22:20: "He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed."
1.11.6.4.3. Pro: Christianity and Judaism advocate violence to homosexuals in the old testament [660] Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."
1.11.6.4.4. Pro: Judaism and Christianity advocate [661] genocide against unbelievers Psalms 79:6: "Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name."
1.11.6.4.5. Pro: Christianity villifies Jews which is a hate speech : John 8:44 [662]: "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do..."
1.11.6.4.5.1. Con: "Those that utilize John 8:44 for anti-Semitic purposes are alsolikely overlooking the fact [663] that Jesus himself was a Jew." "All of the immediate followers of Jesus were Jews", and ignore statements in John, like "Salvation comes from the Jews.", according to Harold Attridge, Sterling Professor of Divinity at the Yale Divinity School.
1.11.6.4.5.2. Con: The passage in question is a somewhat heated dialogue between Jesus and the crowds in Jerusalem. According to the story in John, people have been plotting against Jesus for some time, trying to arrest him and stone him to death. So Jesus reacts rather strongly and calls them children of the devil. According to biblical scholars, however, this statement was never meant to be showcased in isolation [664].
1.11.6.4.5.3. Con: It wasn't because they were Jewish, it's because Jesus said they were fake Jews who were being mean to him [665].
1.11.6.4.6. Pro: Islam [666] villifies jews : they pervert words from their meanings, and have forgotten a part of what they were reminded. You will not cease to learn of some of their treachery, excepting a few of them
1.11.6.4.7. Pro: To this day, antisemitic beliefs and religious customs are still fuelled by Christian dogma and perpetuates antisemitic rhetoric, intolerance and violence against Jews.
1.11.6.4.7.1. Pro: There is a history of jewish persecution by Christians on the basis that the jews killed Jesus (1 [667])
1.11.6.4.7.1.1. Pro: A lot of antisemitic rhetoric appears at Easter which is linked with the death of Jesus and the culpability of Jews for that death (1 [668])
1.11.6.4.7.1.1.1. Pro: Grahame Morris, a labour MP, falsely accused Israel army to hurt a Palestinian children on Easter eve [669] with a video from Guatemalan soldiers hurting a Guatemalan child. He pointed out Easter Monday and asked God to forgive [them]. He did not denounce the Guatemalan army when faced with the fake news.
1.11.6.4.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: The reference to Easter and the beating of a child is a direct reference to the myth that Jews would kill a child before Easter and needed Christian blood to bake matzo. Through religion, labour is raising antisemitic violence [670] in UK.
1.11.6.4.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Israel have done a lot of bad [671] things that justify people's hate against them.
1.11.6.4.7.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: They may commit [672] war crimes and kill people [673] who shouldn't be killed.
1.11.6.4.7.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Israel soldiers [674] are fine with killing children.
1.11.6.4.7.1.1.2. Pro: At Easter, Poles make effigies of Jews beat them and burn them (1 [675])
1.11.6.4.7.2. Pro: At Easter, a popular hymn from Iceland calls the deceit and pride [676] of Jews as they do not apply the righteaous Mosaic law.
1.11.6.4.7.3. Pro: In 1965, Pope John Paul set an official decreed to declare that the blaming of the death of Christ to the fault of all Jews should not be and that the Scripture should not be taken to the letter in regards to Jews being accursed or rejected by God. (1 [677])
1.11.6.5. Con: The difference is that there is hard evidence that the solar system is heliocentric, whereas the same cannot be said for religion.
1.11.7. Con: The right to profess a religion freely is fundamental only as long as it doesn't affect other citizen's liberties and fundamental rights.
1.11.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.4.
1.11.7.2. Pro: French when they defined their Declaration of human and civic rights of 26th of August 1789 [678] for the new republic defined a framework that would also emancipate them from catholic church's hold. See article 4 and 10
1.11.7.3. Con: There is no reason that the right to freedom of religion would limit other fundamental rights any more than freedom of expression, thought, assembly etc.. does.
1.11.7.3.1. Pro: Freedom of Expression [679] is an example of a fundamental right which is not unlimited - for example hate speech or revealing top secret information.
1.11.7.3.2. Pro: Most rights [680] have some limitation, for example you don't have freedom of movement or freedom of assembly if incarcerated.
1.11.8. Pro: Freedom of religion is a human right protected by the UN [681] and legislated and protected [682] by every liberal democracy [683] in the world.
1.11.8.1. Pro: Countries [684] that ban [685] religion, do not allow freedom of religion or promote a specific state religion are generally dictatorships [686] or absolute monarchies.
1.11.9. Pro: Banning religion would be against freedom of speech.
1.11.9.1. Pro: Banning won't then stop at religion, once allowed, it will start a chain process of banning anything deem unfavourable by the governments.
1.11.9.2. Con: Ban to religion as defined in this debate doesn't imply ban on freedom of speech as it's only about institutional aspects of religion not the belief as such. Therefore faith would still be allowed to be expressed freely even after the ban. Only attempt to institutionalize it will be banned.
1.11.10. Con: The right to profess a religion may collide with the right of children [687] to be free from indoctrination [688], which may be seen as a form of child abuse.
1.11.10.1. Con: The rights do not collide, because the right to religion does not include a right to indoctrinate others [689].
1.11.10.1.1. Con: People are more likely to choose a religion based on their parent's [690] religion rather than random selection or logic. Even without religion having a right to indoctrinate others, they do so anyway with things such as infant baptism [691], holy communion, mitzvat, succession of a Dalai Lama [692], or biasly teaching children about religion in schools.
1.11.10.2. Con: There is no legal right [693] to freedom from indoctrination, but there is a legal right to freedom of thought (which includes religion).
1.11.10.2.1. Con: The right to not be indoctrinated is inherent in being a human who is part of society; it can, then, be made legal.
1.11.10.2.2. Con: The right to freedom of thought would include a sub-right to not be indoctrinated.
1.11.10.2.2.1. Con: This is not the case with any existing freedom of thought/expression right. Eg the UN's UDHR [694], USA's First Amendment [695], UKs Human Rights Act [696], France's Rights of Man and Citizen [697], etc..
1.11.10.3. Pro: If parents want to go to church and cannot afford for someone to look after their children, leaving them at home may be dangerous [698] and potentially child neglection [699], which is a form of child abuse. But bringing them to church would be indoctrination. If that is also child abuse, religious parents are dammed if they do and dammed if they don't.
1.11.10.4. Con: Humans are a social animal inescapably shaped by cultural context, and thus some degree of indoctrination is implicit in the parent–child relationship [700], and has an essential function in forming stable communities of shared values.
1.11.11. Con: Many religious people feel their right to religion allows them to force their religion on others.
1.11.11.1. Con: If it is so - what should be banned is forcing religion on others, not religion as such.
1.11.11.2. Con: They are incorrect, and therefore are not a reason to remove freedom of religion from others.
1.11.11.3. Pro: Regardless of how they are written, if human rights are causing damage in practice they should be removed.
1.11.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.10.1.1.
1.12. Pro: Once all religions are banned, people will focus on important things.
1.12.1. Con: They will focus on filling the gaps in their lives previously filled by religious practice.
1.12.2. Con: For many, religion imbues life with meaning and purpose [i.e., importance]. In a world without such meaning and purpose, nothing can be considered important.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Banning religion would force everyone to embrace atheism, which also embraces strong, difficult to test metaphysical claims (e.g. "there is no afterlife").
1.12.2.2. Con: Without religion telling people what is important, they may decide for themselves. This may include them deciding either their loved ones, their career or helping other people is important.
1.12.3. Pro: People can accept injustice and unfairness because they believe that god will reward them at the end. Fighting for your own justice and being treated fairly seems to me like the most important thing a human being has to do in our modern societies.
1.12.3.1. Con: The belief of an afterlife and an absolute moral right and wrong has encouraged many religious people to focus on important things.
1.12.3.1.1. Pro: For example, christian people have ben instrumental in creating the US Constitution, ending slavery, giving women right to vote, creating hospitals, orphanages, standing up to voiceless peoples, and much more.
1.12.4. Pro: People would have more time and space for discovering secrets we don't know about yet. More people could get into science looking for any evidence of higher creation or finding out how the world works.
1.12.5. Con: Religion is not a major attention drain. Series, smartphones and alcohol may be worse.
1.13. Pro: Religion is made up and is fictional.
1.13.1. Con: Being made up or fictional does not imply that something should be banned by law.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Banning made up things would include banning of most forms of art, especially stories. Fictional stories encourage people to read which makes them smarter and many have morals to them. Taking this away would be detrimental to society.
1.13.2. Con: The belief that the metaphysical claims of religion are false is just as unproveable as the belief that they are true.
1.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.2.3.
1.13.2.2. Con: This position is premised on the burden of proof fallacy [701].
1.13.2.2.1. Con: Burden of proof lies on the person making the claim, in this case it would lie with the person claiming that religion is fake, not the person talking about how it cannot be proven as that is common knowledge.
1.13.2.2.1.1. Con: With their own existences, religions, claim that their god(s) exist. This would place the burden of proof on religions to prove that claim.
1.13.2.3. Con: Not all claims of religion are purely metaphysical, and not all the metaphysical claims have no bearing on the physical world. Any number of religious claims have been disproven to a degree that can only be refuted by speculative justifications and further disengagement from reality.
1.13.3. Con: Fiction is a social contract that admits of factual falsity with the promise of other types of truth embedded. Eg., spiritual truth, moral truth. Truth about how one should act. A template similar to a logical form ( Eg., modus ponens ) upon which other facts might be placed. Fiction should not be banned and neither should religion.
1.13.4. Pro: Most religions have evolved from older religions, where the founders have changed elements of that older religion, which they dislike, to make up their new religion.
1.13.4.1. Con: Religion is an attempt to discover the truth. New religions may be made in the same way that scientific theories are proposed, and they may grow or disappear depending on acceptance of these religious 'theories'. We know that in the end there is only one truth, and until it is known there is no reason to stop searching; we know that models in physics are imperfect and there are multiple ideas for how things work but this does not invalidate them all.
1.13.4.2. Con: To support banning all religions, it must apply to all religions, or risk banning a religion that is not made up.
1.13.4.2.1. Con: All religions are made up.
1.13.5. Con: Religion is ''made up'' or better said, it is a human invention that is now becoming obsolete, but so is the nation itself which is a political construct ''invented'' in the 19th century. Some human inventions regarding political thought that emphasize social control are necessities.
1.13.6. Con: Even if that is true, all religions fundamentally promote peace (whether the people follow those teachings is up to them). Even if one thinks think that the Bible, or Quran or Buddha are made up, the teaching still stand in today's society more than ever.
1.13.6.1. Pro: It would be like banning Harry Potter because it's fictional even though it has important lessons to take away from it.
1.13.6.2. Con: The Old Testament justifies wars with invaders of Judea while the Koran sanctions holy wars to drive out infidels who take residence in a Muslim homeland.
1.13.6.2.1. Con: Not all religions advocate ethnic cleansing and war. Buddhism strongly opposes any violence, and Christianity has no teachings from Jesus that say conflict is acceptable, even for revenge. “ ‘Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. [702]
1.13.6.2.2. Pro: God orders the Israelites to exterminate [703] all the existing tribes and peoples living in Israel.
1.13.6.2.2.1. Pro: God commanded the Jews to slaughter the Amalekites. [704]
1.13.6.2.2.2. Con: The Torah had orders to clear the promised land of Canaanites. And other wars and laws for Israel when it was an autonomous nation. After they returned from captivity, they had to abide by the laws of the ruling power. They still had the instruction to 'love your fellow as yourself.'
1.13.6.2.2.3. Con: Most scholars conclude that the biblical accounts of extermination [705] are exaggerated, fictional, or metaphorical.For instances, the Book of Joshua describes the extermination of the Canaanites, yet Joshua and Judges both suggest that the extermination was not complete [706].
1.13.6.2.2.3.1. Con: Modern historians think that the entire exodus story is entirely fiction [707] but that is irrelevant to the fact that it is part of the cannon. Devout Jews truly believe that they were in Egypt and returned to Canaan where they were commanded by their god to massacre the existing populations of non-Jews.
1.13.6.2.2.4. Con: Although the biblical narrative commands the extermination of the of Canaanites, "mainstream Jewish traditions throughout history have treated these texts as purely historical [708] or highly conditioned, and in either case not relevant to contemporary life".
1.13.6.2.2.4.1. Con: Despite that mainstream view, "some minor strains of radical Zionism [709]" have promoted "aggressive war" and they have justified it with biblical texts.
1.13.6.2.2.4.1.1. Con: Zionism is not the same [710] as Judaism.
1.13.6.2.2.4.1.2. Con: Most Zionism has historically been secular. The development of religious Zionism (whether Jewish or Christian) is a recent phenomena.
1.13.7. Pro: There are some things we can conclude about a hypothetical God, if evil exists we know no God is simultaneously all powerful and all loving. [711] Since most people believe in a religion where they pretend God is as such, we can actually conclude that more than the worlds population are in a religion where the deity cannot exist. [712] Although since the two religions which make up over half the worlds population has a murderous God, we should already know the most commonly worshipped God isn't all loving.
1.13.8. Con: Even though religion is made up, so are many things (or ideologies) which are made up and good (like democracy). So the fact that religion is made up is irrelevant.
1.14. Pro: Banning religions would help in stopping religiously motivated inhuman and unjust practices which can’t be prevented as long as religions are allowed.
1.14.1. Pro: Banning religion would help see people as they really are, no one would be able to hide his true motives behind sacred scriptures.
1.14.2. Con: Historic banning of religion, for example in USSR [713] and China [714], has not removed the death penalty; it is very unlikely that other religious ban would lead to different results.
1.14.2.1. Pro: China still practice the death penalty even if it has heavily curbed religion [715] through varying degrees of harassment, including imprisonment, torture, and forced religious conversion to atheism.
1.14.2.2. Pro: The USSR had passed legislation [716] to gradually eliminate religious belief within its borders. However the death penalty was more used in USSR than in Russia. USSR had 2000 death penalties [717] per year in the 1980s whereas pre USSR Russia had banned the death penalty [718] in 1917 and almost never carried it out in the decades before that.
1.14.3. Con: Religions discourage unethical acts.
1.14.3.1. Pro: Religions discourage rape.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: The Bible calls for the death penalty [719] for rapists [720].
1.14.3.2. Con: Religions also support many unethical practices.
1.14.3.2.1. Pro: The Bible promotes death by stoning for mere blasphemy [721].
1.14.3.2.2. Pro: The Bible promotes death for a woman who is not a virgin when wed. (1 [722])
1.14.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.
1.14.4. Con: Religiously motivated inhuman and unjust practices have nothing to do with many religions therefore you should not ban them all just because some other religions do that.
1.14.5. Con: Instead, it makes more sense to allow most religions but only ban the few that cause serious harm.
1.14.5.1. Pro: It would make sense to ban just specific clauses / tenets in every religion that are harmful.
1.14.6. Pro: Criminalization [723] of atheists or agnostics would be impossible.
1.14.6.1. Con: To criminalize atheists or agnostics one does not have to use religion. There are already existing groups (some Muslims and some Masons) that value belief, even if not same as theirs. In a specyfic setting such a view, which is coming more from a culture than religion, with some extremism added might lead to criminalization of nonbelievers even without religion.
1.14.7. Con: I would make criminalization of religious practice, even the one not institutionalized, much easier.
1.14.8. Con: Death Penalty is not exclusive of religious societies. It is/was used also by secular governments.
1.14.9. Pro: Getting rid of FGM [724] would drastically improve the lives of many around the world.
1.14.9.1. Pro: There is a widespread view [725] among practitioners of female genital mutilation (FGM) that it is a religious requirement.
1.14.9.1.1. Con: This is a "self-enforcing social convention [726]" due to lack of education. Women organise all forms [727] of FGM, and the most common reason is to gain social acceptance [728], not because they believe their religion mandates it.
1.14.9.2. Con: FGM is not religious - it is due to tradition and misinformation.
1.14.9.2.1. Con: Malaysia's highest Islamic body the Department for Islamic Development has declared that FGM is not only Islamic, but mandatory [729].
1.14.9.2.2. Pro: There is no mention of FGM in the Bible or the Quran [730], let alone support.
1.14.9.2.2.1. Con: There's no mention of MGM (male circumcision) either.
1.14.9.2.3. Pro: Muslim Fatwahs have [731] condemed [732] and banned [733] FGM.
1.14.9.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.14.9.2.1.
1.14.9.2.4. Pro: Christian missionaries in Africa were among the first to object [734] to FGM.
1.14.9.2.5. Pro: FGM is often driven by support from women [735] themselves.
1.14.9.2.6. Pro: FGM is often due to poor access to information [736].
1.14.10. Pro: If there were no religions there might be a lot less terrorism.
1.14.10.1. Pro: If there was no religion, it would be harder to motivate people to fight or blow themselves up as there would lack rewards such as the 70 virgins. [737]
1.14.10.2. Pro: Terrorist suicide attacks [738] have almost always been motivated by religion.
1.14.10.2.1. Con: Political or social [739] motivations have also led people to take their own lives while attacking others.
1.14.10.2.1.1. Pro: The Tamil Tigers (LTTE), Japanese Kamikaze aviators or the Kurdistan Workers' Party have all used suicide attacks [740].
1.14.10.2.1.2. Con: The total number of casualties due to terrorist groups influenced by a religious identity [741] in suicide attacks is the highest, and way higher than victims from terrorism only motivated by any other causes.
1.14.10.2.1.2.1. Con: Many terrorist groups that partake in suicide attacks are not only guided by religion but also have political and territorial motivations.
1.14.10.2.2. Pro: In fact, the killing of the Philistines by Samson [742] and his own death in the process, could be considered one of the first historical accounts of a suicide attack, already mentioned in the Bible.
1.14.10.2.3. Pro: Research asserts that "groups that are more religious are significantly more likely to adopt suicide bombing [743]".
1.14.10.2.3.1. Con: Even if religious groups are more likely to use suicide bombing, the real underlying causes that may lead someone to do so and their links to religious ideologies are still unclear [744] and a matter of contention.
1.14.10.2.3.1.1. Pro: Some scholars [745] point put that "religion itself is unrelated to the adoption of suicide bombing". However, "religious differences between a group and the target" make suicide bombing more likely, as "religious differences can “inflame” nationalist sentiment".
1.14.10.2.3.1.2. Con: Some scholars argue that extreme religious groups [746] are much more likely to adopt suicide bombing in general as a result of intragroup dynamics.
1.14.10.2.3.1.3. Con: Some scholars argue that the theology [747] of Salafi Jihadis facilitates the spread of the tactic and the globalization of suicide campaigns. Some extreme theologians have used selective readings of the Qur'an to make the use of suicide bombing a critical element of Salafi Jihadi attacks.
1.14.10.3. Con: Terrorism can be prevented if people study and know their religion better. The basis of terrorism is linked with the wrong way of preaching the religion, and not the religion itself.
1.14.11. Con: These effects would not happen instantly after religion being banned.
1.14.11.1. Con: Eventually is better than never.
1.14.11.2. Con: Just because something doesn't bring immediate results does not mean that it is not worth considering.
1.14.12. Con: Banning religion itself would be an 'inhuman and unjust practice'.
1.14.12.1. Pro: A ban on religion amounts to an attack on human liberty and religious freedom. If we consider the resources required to enforce a ban and the intrusiveness of this effort into private life, such a law would indeed be 'inhuman and unjust', on a scale at least equal to, or possibly worse than the depredations inflicted in the name of religion.
1.14.13. Con: People will find a new reason to suppress others.
1.14.13.1. Pro: China is officially atheist [748] and is about to implement a dystopian social credit system [749] while censoring their media [750].
1.14.13.2. Pro: The atheist state of North Korea has a personality cult [751] instead of a religion and is one of the most repressive regimes in the world.
1.14.14. Con: Banning religion might not stop people from practicing it.
1.14.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.3.
1.15. Pro: Any benefit that an organized religion could provide a society is lost in its power struggles, dogma and hypocrisy.
1.15.1. Con: Uselessness doesn't warrant a ban.
1.15.2. Con: There are power struggles (different schools of thought and theories) in almost every field of Science yet it doesn't devalue Science or void the manifest results.
1.15.3. Con: People still find hope and strength through religion regardless of these struggles and dogma.
1.15.4. Pro: Most popular (organised) religions are exploited by individuals for power and money, stirring people towards intolerance and violence.
1.15.5. Pro: Religion is one of the only things that actively invades and wants to control many aspects of one's private life which is something that law cannot do.
1.15.5.1. Pro: Religion tries to control and restrict human bodily autonomy.
1.15.5.1.1. Pro: Celibacy [752] can be a detrimental form of control.
1.15.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.1.6.8.1.
1.15.5.1.2. Pro: Religion exercises control banning or prohibiting abortion and contraception.
1.15.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.
1.15.5.1.2.2. Pro: This regulation made overpopulation worse. Overpopulation [753] is the main cause of many major problems around the world.
1.15.5.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.15.5.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.15.5.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.2.
1.15.5.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.15.5.1.3. Pro: Religious dedication to the fiction of two-genders/sexes can cause new parents of intersex children to impose that will on their children via surgery.
1.15.5.1.3.1. Con: This is not solely an outcome of religion. Even many mainstream secular scientists and people do not agree with the proposition that the idea of there being only two biological sexes is a "fiction". Social roles, biological sex and gender are complicated social issues across the board.
1.15.5.1.3.2. Pro: -> See discussion #1570: Gender is a social construct.
1.15.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2.
1.15.5.2. Pro: The experience of faith is profoundly moving and personal. To hand any large organisation such a massive emotional lever is a bad idea.
1.15.5.2.1. Pro: It is absolute power that is bound to result in absolute corruption.
1.15.5.2.2. Pro: Many organised religions, no matter how they start, end up hierarchical and manipulative.
1.15.5.3. Con: There are definitely laws and political systems that invade and control many aspects of one's private life.
1.15.5.3.1. Con: Democratic governments have a mandate to control what citizens have decided governments must control.
1.15.5.3.1.1. Pro: Religion also receives the same mandate as democracy since people worship voluntarily.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Being born and indoctrinated into a faith is not voluntary. Moreover several religions place severe consequences on those who leave.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hasidic Jews are indoctrinated [754] from a young age, often poorly educated (with lack of English skills) and pressured to have and provide for big families at really young ages. Those who try to live secularly [755] are often completely rejected [756] and, in many cases, their religious communities fight to keep custody of their children [757].
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: If you leave Islam in certain countries you will die. If you leave Jehova's witnesses you will never speak to your family again. Same with the Amish. But more importantly you did not choose to have the religion forced on you as a child and it may be so deep in your brain that you could never escape.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Religious indoctrination at young ages can have harmful consequences [758].
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Among some religious creeds, child abuse and neglect [759] is more common when certain variables are found: authoritarianism, isolation and fear.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: Religious Trauma Syndrome (RTS) [760] “is a function of both the chronic abuses of harmful religion and the impact of severing one’s connection with one’s faith” and can be compared to a combination of PTSD and Complex PTSD.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.5. Pro: Religions are routinely introduced to children who are too young to make an informed choice.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Catholic parents baptise [761] their children when they are babies and thus introduce them into the Catholic faith when they cannot consent.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: The First Communion [762] is normally received around the ages of 7 to 10  after a period or cathequesis [763] (education). And Confirmation [764], the time when the believer really gives consent, also happens when children are young or in their mid-teens.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.5.3. Con: Children are capable of choice, but the degree to which they can make an informed and/or rational decision will vary from not at all, through not enough, to a minority who are as capable of making a decision as an adult.
1.15.5.3.1.1.1.5.4. Pro: Circumcision [765] is performed by Jews on the eighth day of life.
1.15.5.3.1.2. Con: All laws and political systems are not democratic.
1.15.5.3.1.3. Con: Not all citizens might have had a say in what aspects of their lives the government has decided it must control.
1.15.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: In representative governments citizens do not vote on laws, they only vote on the people who make them.
1.15.5.4. Con: Religion can emancipate and liberate the human mind from other forms of social control.
1.15.5.4.1. Con: Replacing one form of social control with another is not liberation or emancipation.
1.15.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.15.5.3.1.1.1.
1.15.5.4.3. Pro: Religion can help emancipate oneself from capitalism [766].
1.15.5.4.3.1. Con: That Christianity can provide [767] "resources for faithfully navigate the postmodern global economy" does not mean religion can make someone escape capitalism.
1.15.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: Christianity [768] played a role in the creation and adoption of capitalism [769].
1.15.5.4.4. Pro: Religion can reduce death anxiety [770].
1.15.5.4.4.1. Pro: Religion comforts people from the inevitability of death.
1.15.5.4.4.1.1. Con: Religion is an institutionalization of the fear of death that we, humans, have as a consequence of our deeper intelligence. In honor to that intelligence that allow us to perceive and fear death, and therefore create gods and praise them, we can also take another step forward, banishing the institution of religion from the empiric realm of the fear of death. We are grown enough as a species to accept we are scared of the end of our lives, and that religion is a social construct.
1.15.5.4.4.1.2. Con: It might be healthier to get over the fear of death and nonexistence all together rather than convince someone it is not the end.
1.15.5.4.4.1.3. Pro: Strong faith can lead people to believe in an afterlife, offering them immeasurable comfort in their final days.
1.15.5.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Being content with suffering and death in the hopes of an afterlife may cause some to resign to defeat.
1.15.5.4.4.1.4. Pro: Religion can bring comfort to the relatives of the recently deceased.
1.15.5.4.4.1.4.1. Con: This could be seen as preying on people when they are at their weakest.
1.15.5.4.4.2. Con: There are many who do not fear death. Nonexistence is nothing to fear and many have come to see this.
1.15.5.4.4.2.1. Con: There's a difference between having death anxiety and fear of death. Death anxiety is crippling malaise that has far-reaching consequences in how you live, perceive your life and treat others. Not fearing death at all, on the other hand, is a luxuourious delusion for people who have never felt the gut-wrenching totality of basic, creaturely will-to-live.
1.15.5.4.5. Pro: Religion usually contain all steps needed to expose and surpass the limits of mental slavery. [771]
1.15.5.5. Con: Religion is not mandatory, it's optional.
1.15.6. Pro: Religious dogma can block exploration of personal spiritual development
1.15.6.1. Pro: Some Christian denominations [772], for example, claim that meditation [773] or yoga [774] are esoteric and do not bring practicioners close to God, even though science has proven that they have many benefits [775].
1.15.6.1.1. Con: Catholics [776] should not participate in any of the "spiritual" aspects associated with yoga, but technically can do the actual physical exercises.
1.15.6.1.2. Con: Eastern Catholic/Orthodox [777] churches also practice forms of meditation.
1.15.6.2. Con: A dogma is only a marker for what constitutes a necessary belief in any given system. You can't be a christian who don't believe that Jesus is the son of God, because believing that is what constitutes being a christian. Likewise you can't be an atheist who believes in God, because not believing in God is the sole criterion for being an atheist. Dogma does not block spiritual development, it merely categorises it.
1.15.6.3. Pro: Faith is a closed-ended inquiry. No learning is possible if you already decided the answer beforehand.
1.15.6.3.1. Con: Faith is not closed minded, nor is it inactive - it takes effort to believe in something that can't be demonstrated or isn't totally based in logic.
1.15.6.4. Con: Religious dogma can be used as structure for building a stable and fulfilled life. There is nothing that says dogma is necessarily enforced top-down.
1.15.6.4.1. Con: Most organized religions [778] are to some degree [779] hierarchical [780] and dogma is indeed enforced top-down.
1.15.6.5. Con: Religion can be viewed as a shared and negotiated spirituality.
1.15.6.5.1. Pro: Much like language: creole languages [781], stable natural languages developed from a mixture of different languages to become a native language, are negotiated.
1.15.6.5.2. Con: "Religion [782]" comes from Latin and suggests a commitment, either written or spoken, to a group or cannon, that would be binding and to that extent non-negotiable.
1.15.6.5.3. Pro: Much like science is a negotiated understanding of how things are, a religion can be viewed as a negotiated understanding of how we should act in the world.
1.15.6.5.3.1. Con: Religion teaches us how we should act in the world if we want to go to heaven. Given that "going to heaven" is a meditative process one can't engage when dead, it is an uncertain reward.
1.15.6.5.3.1.1. Con: Heaven and hell can be viewed as conceptions of your potential future. By designing your own heaven (desired future) to strive for [783] and your own hell (unwanted future) to avoid [784], you are essentially maximizing your motivation [785] by using two different motivational systems.
1.15.6.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Heaven and Hell is a bipolar system based on fear, which suggest to do good things to avoid hell and not do bad things to go to heaven. It's an amoral system.
1.15.6.5.3.1.1.2. Con: However, "your own heaven" and "your own hell" are not what religion promote. Religions generally preempt the creation of, or usurp people's versions of, heaven or hell. Thus, led by religion, people may end up in the religion's idea of heaven, which to them may be far from optimal. For instance religion and pregnancy may lead someone to marry and settle down where they're more suited to an outrageously dangerous lifestyle with nobody left to grieve if they die.
1.15.6.5.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This is an Abraham-centric generalization of "religion."  Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism provide frameworks for a person to understand their relationship with their self, the people around them, and the world around them, and the purpose of these relationships. An argument about the utility of religion cannot simply cast aside half of the world's religious history as if it is irrelevant.
1.15.6.5.3.1.2. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase economic growth [786]. Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.15.6.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Maybe (if this is true) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.15.6.5.3.1.2.2. Con: The parent's linked article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration, leaving the parent unsupported.
1.15.6.5.3.1.2.3. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.15.6.5.3.2. Con: It is not a fair comparison. The scientific method is totally different from how religion has come to be. The idea of a "negotiated understanding of how we should act" is an idealization of how religion spawned.
1.15.6.5.4. Con: The Gospel of Thomas [787], logion 114, shows that mithraic christianity has been gender politics, for the most part, for the last 2000 years.
1.15.6.5.5. Con: Religions are originally dictated by their god(s) through the religious books. The word of God is not negotiable
1.15.6.5.5.1. Con: Gods are human creations that represents archetypes and role models which survived multiple generations through storytelling.
1.15.6.5.5.1.1. Con: Even if we were to assume that gods were only human creations, the words of the religious books exists and their commandments are empowered by the religious entities.
1.15.6.5.5.2. Pro: Younger generations do not feel like they are part of the negotiation, because most religions were settled before they were born.
1.15.6.5.5.3. Pro: Many people believe that God actually exist, and decide to follow the religious dogma without negotiation.
1.15.6.5.5.4. Con: Religious texts are a meditative experience of heaven originally experienced by a prophet or messiah and then interpreted and articulated by them, including human failings: in that sense, the Word is negotiable
1.15.6.5.5.4.1. Pro: For example, in Judaism, the ‘Midrash [788]’ is a type of rabbinic literature in which rabbis interpret and comment the Torah and other religious laws. The purpose of this is to resolve problems and find a common understanding, therefore showing a negotiation process.
1.15.6.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: Contemporary [789] forms of 'midrash' include literature and artwork to facilitate the interpretation of sacred texts. According to some scholars 'midrash' can also be used to “update” or “enhance” sacred texts, thus being a form of rewriting them in a way that  makes them "more acceptable to later ethical standards" and renders what is less obviously implausible.
1.15.6.5.5.4.2. Con: The texts are considered to be the Word of God (to the prophet/author) by the followers of the religion, therefore, they are not negotiable.
1.15.6.5.6. Con: Even leaders of many religions will tell you that what people get from their religion will vary from person to person. Thus viewing religion as a shared spirituality is an inaccurate perception.
1.15.6.6. Pro: There are virtually an infinity of ways for spiritual development (each person can have his own). When following one specific dogma, you can't explore the other ways and can't decide by your own experience which one is best for you.
1.15.6.6.1. Con: An infinite number of ways is more ways than a person has time to explore in a lifetime, religion narrows the field to a smaller subset of infinite ways, which are still more ways than a person can explore in their life.
1.15.6.6.2. Con: The point of religion is to show and teach people the "correct" way (whatever each religion feels the correct way is). Allowing individualism runs counter to this, as it is by definition, not the "correct" way.
1.15.6.6.2.1. Con: Religion and individualism are not mutually exclusive
1.15.6.6.2.2. Pro: Thousand of years of developing a particular theory will most of the time have more wisdom and useful knowledge than what a single individual can produce.
1.15.6.6.3. Pro: Spiritual development is never a collective task. The collective task should be supporting the spiritual development of its members. Religion is actually a tool to sanction spiritual development as it establishes its boundaries.
1.15.7. Con: Some people need to uphold the belief in someone greater to deal with their problems, this should not be a problem. It is a valid way of dealing with life as long as it does not interfere with the lives of others. The problem starts when religion begins to be imposed on people.
1.15.8. Con: Today's legal system came from religion and is one of the many benefits of organized religion. If it was not for the Roman Empire spreading democracy, we would not have the systems of government we know today. Christianity made a significant positive contribution to the development of modern democracy [790].
1.15.8.1. Con: Today's legal system did not come from Christianity, and religion has little direct impact. For Europe, the Magna Carta [791]marks the beginning of rights spreading from the select upper class to the general populace and was not a religious document.
1.15.8.1.1. Con: The Magna Carta had important Christian ties [792] as demonstrated by its preamble that began, “John, by the grace of God…,” and stated that the charter was formulated out of “reverence for God and for the salvation of our soul and those of all our ancestors and heirs, for the honour of God and the exaltation of Holy Church and the reform of our realm, on the advice of our reverend [church] fathers” (Schmidt 251).
1.15.8.2. Con: The cited research is not research at all but a specious attempt to make broad conclusions look like research by embedding numbers into a table that shows nothing to support the author's thesis.
1.15.8.3. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.1.
1.15.8.4. Pro: Christianity has been integral for the development of democracy [793] and the rule of law in Western World and all the good that has come from it and helped people to resist totalitarian rule in these nations.
1.15.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.1.
1.15.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.5.2.
1.15.8.4.3. Con: Christianity is actually anti-democracy: it is more authoritarian at its core as it has one power above all (God).
1.15.8.4.3.1. Pro: Christianity and monotheism in general often refer to adherents as sheep in a flock and Christians sometimes characterize themselves as slaves to Christ [794] this is totalitarian.
1.15.8.4.3.2. Pro: Christianity along with its monotheistic cousins require that one both loves and fears [795] god. This is the basis of a sadomasochistic relationship illustrating the religion's totalitarian nature.
1.15.8.4.4. Pro: Robert Woodberry wrote his doctoral thesis on the overwhelmingly positive impact of Protestant missionaries: "The missionary roots of liberal democracy [796]".
1.15.8.4.4.1. Pro: The study proves historically and statistically that conversionary Protestants "heavily influenced the rise and spread of stable democracy around the world", being "a crucial catalyst" for religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, and colonial reforms.
1.15.9. Con: Dogma, power, and hypocrisy are not unique to organized religions, but exist in any social organization.
1.15.9.1. Pro: Religion is not synonymous with power struggle or hypocrisy. There is nothing inherent in religion which causes it to seek power or cause the religious to disregard the religion's laws but teach them anyway. Religion asserts certain ideas to be true. Believing that one thing is true does not cause you to seek power over people believing differently - it is possible for people to respect opinions. Believing in a spiritual idea does not cause you to be a hypocrite either.
1.15.10. Con: Some organized religions claim anti-dogmatism as one of their tenants. For example, one of the most fundamental teachings of the Buddha, as most forms of organized Buddhism claim to believe, was to reject dogma and adopt a critical orientation towards the world and oneself.
1.15.10.1. Con: Buddhism [797] has dogma [798].
1.15.10.1.1. Con: Buddhism [799] does not demand blind belief and allow for a vast continuum of interpretations. It embraces the individual's path to truth and makes it clear that dogma does not supersede personal conscience and experience.
1.15.10.1.1.1. Con: The path is till guided by basic tenets and doctrines (which are fundamental to the idea of dogma in terms of religion).
1.15.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The key difference is that in most religions, dogmas are doctrines that are “unquestionably true [800]” and generally “authoritatively proclaimed [801]”. If a religion has tenets but they are not mandatory or unquestionable, one can consider them not dogmatic.
1.15.10.1.1.2. Pro: When a person takes on The Five Precepts [802], they are left to the rationalization and justification of the individual. Example: The First Precept is to abstain from taking life. Is it ethical to take the life of one person who is intent on taking the life of another? The individual has to decide and live with the consequences of such decision.
1.15.10.1.2. Con: Buddhism, for example, does not provide strict and unanimous moral teachings on issues like abortion [803], death penalty [804] or euthanasia [805].
1.15.10.1.2.1. Pro: Buddhism has never held views against homosexuality [806] and Buddha's teachings do not condemn non-reproductive sex [807].
1.15.10.1.2.1.1. Con: Buddhism doesn't specifically make statements about sex other than to "not misuse" sexuality.
1.15.10.1.3. Pro: The Pāli Canon [808] is certainly dogma [809] in both definition 1 and 2. The Canon is a central authority and foundational to Buddhism.
1.16. Pro: There will be fewer wars and less conflict.
1.16.1. Con: People will not suddenly live in harmony, selflessness, humility, and grace because religion is banned.
1.16.1.1. Pro: Wars are not generally fought over religions anymore; they are fought over material resources. People use religion as an excuse because they don't want to take responsibility for their own actions.
1.16.1.2. Pro: Atheism has no mechanism for the promotion of harmony, selflessness, humility, and grace
1.16.1.2.1. Con: Atheists can still utilize the mechanics of empathy, reasoning, and more to promote harmony, selflessness, humility, and grace without subscribing to religious doctrines.
1.16.1.2.1.1. Pro: Selflessness, humility, grace, empathy, mercy, harmony are all characteristics of pro social behaviour in all humans. To externalise the source of those things to scripture and divinity is to weaken ourselves
1.16.1.2.1.2. Con: Religions can provide an easier, more organized way of presenting and teaching these mechanics.
1.16.1.2.1.2.1. Con: However, religion can also present these values, while in a more organized way, in a manner that unermines them.
1.16.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is difficult to be emphatic with other, when one believe that non-believers deserve eternal damnation.
1.16.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Harmony and empathy may be difficult to teach when one promotes one gender should be submissive to another or when some sexual oritnetations are described as sinful.
1.16.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.2.
1.16.1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Religious sects and teachings vary, so a broad claim of religions teaching values in an undermining manner is disingenuous.
1.16.2. Con: Religions are rarely the cause of wars.
1.16.2.1. Pro: Historians [810] Phillips and Axelrod document the history of recorded warfare, and from their list of 1,763 wars only 123 have been classified to involve a religious cause. Religion isn’t the problem.
1.16.2.1.1. Con: Conflict is unavoidable, yet while conflicts about land ownerships or civil rights have a tangible outcome (being able to live in a place, the abolition of slavery, etc.) religious conflicts are based on a preventable dispute about ideas that, even after violence, have no substantial consequences.
1.16.2.1.1.1. Con: Religious conflict has at times had immense ideological and sociological consequence. Christianity and Islam both completely upturned the societies they won over. The zoroastrian Mazdakites initiated what amounts to a socialist revolution 1300 years before Marx was born. Religious conflict is one of the major reasons North America was colonised as quickly as it was.
1.16.2.2. Pro: Instances of violence for which religion has been blamed cannot be separated from just as likely secular causes of the same violence. As was outlined in William T Cavanaugh's 2009 book "The Myth of Religious Violence [811]" published by Oxford University Press.
1.16.2.3. Pro: While religion is often blamed as the primary source of most historical conflicts, research shows that there are multiple factors in play, more often than not, secular and political.
1.16.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.2.1.
1.16.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.16.2.2.
1.16.2.3.3. Con: While the primary source of historical conflicts might be political or economical, religion is often used to gather mass consent around particular political leaders, often moving the masses to commit atrocities.
1.16.2.3.4. Con: It might be simplistic to pretend to separate religion from political, economical or other secular interests.  The fact that there are many factors at play in historical conflicts does not exclude religion from being one of the factors contributing to war.  Religion is articulated with other economic, social and cultural factors in order to exacerbate feelings of group chauvinism that are moved against the perceived deviant other.
1.16.2.4. Pro: Secular causes have cause several times [812] as many war deaths throughout history [813].
1.16.2.4.1. Pro: People have been led to do terrible things outside of religion. Some of the greatest atrocities in history had no religious motivation. For example: the Great Leap [814] and the outbreak of World War II [815].
1.16.2.4.1.1. Pro: In modern times by far the greatest source of conflict has been totalitarian political ideologies, which include not just militant imperialism, Marxism, and fascism, but also totalitarian Islamism, which is no mere religion.  Neglecting the mass suffering & oppression, just the death toll of totalitarianism from war, famine, & genocide since the early 20th century is in the hundreds of millions. There is nothing comparable perpetrated by religious organizations outside of said totalitarianism.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: The religions claimed to have waged atrocities were either theocracies or defacto government authorities. One might say it is governmental bodies that incite mass atrocity and not religion. For example,  Logistics of the crusades [816], Classical and Mixed Sharia Systems [817], Catholic Missions [818]
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: One might say in those cases that religion seized political authority and used to it to incite mass atrocity. In such a view governmental bodies would simply be a tool religions can use to do terrible things.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Religion cultivates political power.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Over the course of history the papacy has held tremendous political power in various forms.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The papacy was head of the Papal States [819]
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Pope participated in many coronations in Europe throughout history.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Legislative restrictions may be imposed upon citizens due to religious principles, regardless if those citizens share those values or not.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Personal freedoms are often restricted by laws such as Kashrut or Sharia.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Personal freedom may not be the highest value. For example, conservatives usually prioritize personal responsibility over freedom.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Without resorting to political order, a Religion cannot force its citizens to adopt a set or rules. It may only suggest a moral code by which to live.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The way a political order forces citizens to follow rules is by threat of consequences. Religions have done the same thing with their own threats and consequences. Religions have used excommunication, inquisitions, pogroms, and burning at the steak to enforce their rules and values.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: In the past and even nowadays, religious authorities and religious groups have often pressured legislators to sanction laws according to their beliefs
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Everyone pressures their legislators to sanctions laws according to their opinions and beliefs, this is neither a bad thing nor unique to religion. It's simply how (most) western governments work.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: While lobbying in general is common in most places secularism and separation of church and state [820] is also valued in many modern societies.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: In the USA churches can lose their tax exemption [821] if they endorse political candidates because it is recognized that religion is not something that should be influencing government the same way as everything else.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Religious laws are being created even nowadays, the most numerous of which are probably the anti-LGBT ones in the US [822].
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Religion can be used as a protective barrier to further discriminatory, or harmful views that would otherwise be seen as violations of rights. For example, refusing to provide services for LGBT+ individuals on the basis of exercising religious freedom.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.4.1.4.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Organized religions have often sided with elites, legitimating or enhancing their power.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: In previous times monarchs derived the right to rule directly from the will of God. [823]
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Roman Catholic rulers had their legitimacy supported by the Pope [824].
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Protestant rulers often headed their own state churches.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Sweden funded the Church of Sweden, its own national church in 1477: royals and elected officials could only profess this faith. Although laws gradually allowed religious freedom, it was not until 1951 that nationals could leave the Church without having to be part of another congregation, and it was not until 2000 that the State and the Church were formally separated (Jänterä-Jareborg, p. 672 [825]).
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Until 2012 [826] the constitutional head of the Church of Norway [827] was the King of Norway.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: By claiming to have a direct connection to God and through a supporting morality, monarchs [828] were able to convince their subjects to gladly do things against their own personal interest, but supporting the survival of the nation. This increased social density, which lead to economic and technological development.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Concepts, like the Divine Right of Kings [829], were important in establishing state authority.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: Religions have not developed in isolation, they have reflected cultural norms and enshrined them in a way that makes it harder to shift them. Their privilege, and the privileges they make into doctrines create and perpetuate inequality
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: The success of farming depends on the climate and size of land. At the point of saturation, if lands can not be conquered, then the minds can be conquered instead because it accumulates wealth and creates committed soldiers to defend a faith.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Not if the religion in question actively argues against the use of power. If that religion is used to cultivate political power anyway, the religion is subverted, not the source.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.8. Con: Religion has also fought against the political establishment.
1.16.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.8.1. Pro: Jesus Christ was actually breaking social order [830].
1.16.2.4.1.1.2. Con: If a totalitarian regime is also a religious one or atrocities are committed in the name of religion or because of it then religion cannot simply be separated from the regime and absolved of all blame.
1.16.2.4.1.2. Con: The Catholic church preached as doctrine that the Jews were collectively responsible for deicide [831]. This belief fostered two millennia of antisemitism and was only repudiated [832] and removed as doctrine in 1962 during the second Vatican Council. This antisemitism was part of the environment that allowed Hitler's rise.
1.16.2.4.2. Pro: During the 20th century, the Soviet Union [833] ended killing around 20 million of their own people, despite the fact it was a secular society.
1.16.2.4.2.1. Con: This does not mean religion would have stopped the atrocity or that the atrocity was due to the lack of religion.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1. Con: What it does mean is that lack of religion is not correlated with success (and conversely, religion is not correlated with lack of success)
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: There has not been a truly secular society until recently. The data set simply isn't big enough to determine if it is the secularization of society that allowed them to be more successful.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if it currently is impossible to determine if increased secularization causes more development, empirical evidence seems to support that more development does cause religiosity to decline.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Research points that religious belief declines in economically developed countries [834] with  “greater existential security, including income security (income equality and redistribution via welfare states) and improved health”.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: As scientific knowledge allows to reduce uncertainty [835], in democracies [836] with strong economies and welfare provisions people find less need to deal with the uncertainty of the future through religion.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.5.2.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.3.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase economic growth [837]. Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Maybe (if this is true) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: The parent's linked article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration, leaving the parent unsupported.
1.16.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: Linked article is pointing to Max Weber theory in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism". This theory doens't confirm the thesis that religion is beneficial for economy.  First of all this book is really ancient stuff without real data. Second - this book states that only protestantism was beneficial for economy. This book was written as a critics of Marx theory and was biased.
1.16.2.4.2.2. Con: The fact that secular societies have also committed atrocities doesn't exonerate or ameliorate the atrocities committed in the name of religion.
1.16.2.4.3. Pro: The Soviet Union, an officially anti-religious nation, functionally killed tens of millions of people due to abuse of power; this was fueled by an ideology unrelated to religious ideology. Any ideology can be harmful, not exclusively a religious one.
1.16.2.4.4. Con: Secular war is a terrible thing and so is religious war. There being more secular wars does not diminish the atrociousness of religious war. That is still 75 million people who should not have been killed and this does not even count all the killings done in the name of religion outside of wars such as pograms, genocide, religious massacres, sacrifices or people dying of STDs because the churches preach against the use of condoms.
1.16.2.4.5. Con: Secular wars are fought over real things like resources, land, revenge, and water.  Religion is fought over made up gods which makes the losses from religious wars more pointless.
1.16.2.5. Pro: Opposing interests and capabilities of different groups set them on a war path.
1.16.2.6. Pro: Disruptions in the balance of power cause war, such as the rise of Japan vis-a-vis China spilled war over Asia.
1.16.2.7. Pro: Religions are just one of many mindsets that can be twisted to justify conflict.
1.16.2.7.1. Pro: Religion is not the cause of wars - people who think their religion is the only right religion, thereby not correctly following the religion are the cause of religion wars and persecution.
1.16.2.8. Pro: Religions help to inhibit war because they create similarities between societies.
1.16.2.8.1. Pro: Religions often have similar ethical outlooks, such as reverence to authorities.
1.16.2.9. Con: The Crusades [838] are a broad depiction of religious wars.
1.16.2.10. Con: There is much stigma about Muslim terrorism [839], making a strong position in the West against Islam that involves protest, and even violence towards Muslims whether or not they are terrorists, and in many situation, because of the person's religion, or presentation of their religion. This has been one big reason why American people are okay with the US being at war in countries that are have Islam as their dominant religion.
1.16.2.11. Con: Religions are the root cause of a lot of wars.
1.16.2.11.1. Pro: A few recent conflicts that are fueled by religion [840]: Palestine (Jews vs. Muslims), the Balkans (Orthodox Serbians vs. Catholic Croatians; Orthodox Serbians vs. Bosnian and Albanian Muslims), Northern Ireland (Protestants vs. Catholics), Kashmir (Muslims vs. Hindus), Sudan (Muslims vs. Christians and animists), Nigeria (Muslims vs. Christians), Ethiopia and Eritrea (Muslims vs. Christians), Sri Lanka (Sinhalese Buddhists vs. Tamil Hindus), Indonesia (Muslims vs. Timores e Christians), ...
1.16.2.11.1.1. Pro: If religion had nothing to do with these conflicts, than we would expect to see mixed religions fight on the same side against people of their own religion. Instead, the lines are quite clear.
1.16.2.11.1.2. Con: Some conflicts are not easy to categorize. An example of would be the Ethiopia and Eritrean civil war - border disputes, greed and a botched independence war triggered by the united nations. Both sides have Muslims and Christian factions.
1.16.2.11.1.3. Con: The national disputes are difficult to tie to religion, most of the aforementioned examples demonstrate this; religion can be removed from the situation entirely and the conflict still remains. "Serbians vs. Croats, Serbians vs. Bosnia and Albania, Pakistan vs. India etc.
1.16.3. Con: Not all religions promote violence, therefore it would be irresponsible to ban all religions on a global scale.
1.16.4. Con: -> See 1.9.7.3.
1.16.5. Con: Religion has not been the main cause of war in the last hundred years for 90% of the conflicts in the world, nowadays most wars happen because of political and economical reasons.
1.16.5.1. Pro: The Yugoslav wars in the 1990s [841] were political and economical since the people who fought it were communists (atheists by definition).
1.16.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.15.
1.16.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.8.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.16.8. Pro: Religion gives an identity to people, and this identity becomes a major cause for the person to become a target of hate. Banning religion would remove the cause of this hate. People would think of others as humans first, which is often not the case in today's world.
1.16.9. Pro: -> See 1.16.2.11.1.
