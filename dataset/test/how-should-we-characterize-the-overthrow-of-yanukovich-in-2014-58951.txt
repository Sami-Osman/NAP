Discussion Name: How should we characterize the overthrow of Yanukovich in 2014?

1. How should we characterize the overthrow of Yanukovich in Ukraine 2014?
1.1. It was neither a coup, nor a revolution. It was a parlamentarian democratic process.
1.1.1. Pro: Several countries accepted the actions of the parliament. Even Russia negotiated with the government during the Minsk process, without insisting on the return of Yanukovich.
1.1.2. Con: You can argue that the parliament had no authority to vote on this matter, but should have asked the constitutional judge.
1.1.3. Con: All coups have some kind of legal proforma acknowledgement. Even in the most obvious coups, the new leader is sworn in by parliament or equivalent legal body.
1.1.4. Con: Yanukovich could have been democratically removed via an impeachment process, but [he wasn't impeached](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/viktor-yanukovych-russia-ukraine-coup).
1.1.5. Con: Yanukovich agreed to early elections in 21 February 2014, but the day after he was [chased away](https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/59172) and left the country. Since this is non-parlamentarian, and determined the cause of the following events, they were also non-parlamentarian.
1.1.6. Pro: The parliament voted for Yanukovich's resignation.
1.1.6.1. Con: The parliament did not actually have that legal power. The [correct](https://www.academia.edu/6480320/Was_Yanukovychs_Removal_Constitutional) procedure would be to let the constitutional judge determine what to do.
1.1.6.2. Con: It is irrelevant if the parliament vote. If a leader has the objective choice to die or flee, and choose fleeing, it is not a parlamentarian process. Yanukovich [fled](https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/59172) 21 February. The parlamentarian process is merely recording what happens, i.e. the disappearance of the president.
1.1.6.3. Con: Ukraine had 2010-2013 \(and also earlier in history\) a presidential-parlamentary constitution. It is not up to the parlament to appoint presidents and government in that system.
1.2. It was a coup d'etat.
1.2.1. Pro: The former US Embassador to Moscow, characterized it as a [coup](https://usrussiaaccord.org/acura-viewpoint-jack-f-matlock-jr-todays-crisis-over-ukraine/). Although not an insider at the time, he is a practitioner US diplomat who can better judge the likelihood of events than outsiders.
1.2.2. Pro: The [National Endowment for Democracy \(NED\)](https://www.mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Why-the-Ukraine-Crisis-Is.pdf)(Victoria Nuland, the U.S. as-\nsistant secretary o! state for European and Eurasian affairs, estimated\nin December 2013 that the United States had invested more than $5\nbillion since 1991 to help Ukraine achieve “the future it deserves.” As\npart o! that effort, the U.S. government has bankrolled the National\nEndowment for Democracy. The nonpro\)t foundation has funded\nmore than 60 projects aimed at promoting civil society in Ukraine,\nand the "'3’s president, Carl Gershman, has called that country “the\nbiggest prize.” After Yanukovych won Ukraine’s presidential election\nin February 2010, the "'3 decided he was undermining its goals, and\nso it stepped up its efforts to support the opposition and strengthen\nthe country’s democratic institutions.), which is bankrolled by the US, went out of its way to undermine Yanukovich and support his opponents.
1.2.3. Pro: Washington [publicly supported](https://www.mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Why-the-Ukraine-Crisis-Is.pdf)(Although the full extent of U.S. involvement has not yet come to\nlight, it is clear that Washington backed the coup. Nuland and Republican Senator John McCain participated in antigovernment demonstrations, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine,\nproclaimed after Yanukovych’s toppling that it was “a day for the his-\ntory books.”) ousting Yanukovich prior to him being overthrown.
1.2.4. Con: Coups are characterised by a small group overthrowing a leader. But there were [multiple factions](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/reason-for-yanukovych-departure-in-2014-was-a-coup-detat-led-by-a-fascist-junta) of Ukrainian society that collectively wanted Yanukovich gone in 2014.
1.2.5. Con: In 2014, Yanukovich [stood up to Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/viktor-yanukovych-russia-ukraine-coup), objecting to the annexation of Crimea. As such, it was not in the West's interests to orchestrate a coup.
1.2.6. Pro: For something to be a revolution, it requires radical encompassing changes in many different areas of society, not merely the removal of a government and then 'business as usual'. The overthrow of Yanukovich meets this criterion, with a drastical reorientation against various Russian phenomena \(trade, foreign policy, domestic minorities, language\). This may also be true for some coups, but not for parlamentarian processes.
1.3. It was a popular revolution.
1.3.1. Pro: The participation in the prelude to the regime change itself, the Euromaidan, had widespread support. Coup d'etats are struggles between a few powerful actors.
1.3.2. Pro: Yanukovich was elected on a deal with the EU. When he walked away from that, his voters felt that he was no longer the elected leader but betrayed the country - a foreign agent of Moscow.
1.3.3. Pro: Protests erupted after Yanukovych [restricted](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-Maidan-protest-movement)(Street protests erupted in Kyiv, and Lutsenko and Klitschko emerged as the leaders of the largest demonstrations since the Orange Revolution. Police violently dispersed crowds in Kyiv’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti \(“Independence Square”\), and, as the protests continued into December, demonstrators occupied Kyiv’s city hall and called on Yanukovych to resign.) citizens' rights to protest in aftermath of the EU agreement falling through.
1.3.4. Con: Outside of those protesting, there is [limited data on the public mood](https://eurasianet.org/looking-at-euromaidans-support-in-eastern-ukraine)(Such zeal is more the exception rather than the rule in Kharkiv these days. Most residents simply appear to be trying to maintain their normal routines. When asked about the political situation in Ukraine, smiles are apt to quickly disappear from their faces. It’s hard to get a good read on the public mood because many believe that speaking out, especially in favor of Euromaidan, carries a risk of retribution.) towards Yanukovich in Ukraine in 2014.
1.3.4.1. Con: Many citizens may have declined to publicly express support for Euromaidan protesters as they were often subjected to [violence and intimidation](https://eurasianet.org/looking-at-euromaidans-support-in-eastern-ukraine)(It’s hard to get a good read on the public mood because many believe that speaking out, especially in favor of Euromaidan, carries a risk of retribution.) by law enforcement.
1.3.4.2. Con: A popular revolution may not have the majority, it is enough with widespread support. A popular revolution may be undemocratic in the sense that only a minority support it. The rest may be passive or just weakly opposing the revolution.
1.3.5. Con: Yanukovich's successor, [Poroshenko](https://news.gallup.com/poll/187931/ukrainians-disillusioned-leadership.aspx)(President Petro Poroshenko is now less popular than his predecessor Viktor Yanukovych was before he was ousted.), was less popular with the general public than him and yet there was no comparable popular revolution. This makes a popular revolution to overthrow the former harder to explain.
1.3.5.1. Con: Given the scale of the popular revolution to overthrow Yanukovich, it could be that the general public had residual political fatigue, making them less inclined to overthrow Poroshenko later. That would explain a popular revolution against the former but not the latter.
1.3.5.2. Con: Approval polls are binary and don't record the scale of the general publics approval or disapproval.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Most approval polls allow people to select an "I don't know" or "undecided" option, which provides useful additional context on general opinion \(or lack thereof\).
1.3.5.3. Pro: In 2015, Poroshenko had a public [approval rating of just 17%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/187931/ukrainians-disillusioned-leadership.aspx), compared to a 28% approval rating for Yanukovich in 2013.
1.3.6. Pro: Yanukovich was only voted in with a slim majority, so lacked wide-scale public support to begin with.
1.3.6.1. Con: People in [Russian-speaking regions](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ararat-Osipian-2/publication/361670251_Why_Donbass_Votes_for_Yanukovych_Confronting_the_Ukrainian_Orange_Revolution/links/545c76dd0cf249070a7aa48b/Why-Donbass-Votes-for-Yanukovych-Confronting-the-Ukrainian-Orange-Revolution.pdf)(Scholars should admit that in the predominantly Russian-speaking Eastern regions and some of the Southern regions, Yanukovych was the obvious leader. The majority of his supporters, almost 4.5 million, are concentrated in Donetskaya and Luganskayaoblasts.) of Ukraine almost unanimously voted for Yanukovich.
1.3.6.2. Con: Yanukovich enjoyed significantly [more confidence](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAEC692.pdf)(Graph, p.9) from the electorate than his opponent, Tymoshenko.
1.3.7. Pro: Ukrainians had a severe [lack of faith in their democratic institutions and leaders](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAEC692.pdf)(graph on p.9), which Yanukovich came to personify and symbolise.
1.3.8. Pro: Some people protested against Yanukovich's policy change away from the union, towards a more Russia-friendly policy. The police brutally repressed the demonstrators, which angered the mass, who overthrew Yanukovich.
1.3.8.1. Pro: This course of events gave the mass an understandable motive to be angered.
1.3.8.2. Pro: The mass was arguably led by non-democratic forces, either United States and/or [extreme right organisations.](https://voxukraine.org/en/denial-of-the-obvious-far-right-in-maidan-protests-and-their-danger-today/) However, even if the mass is duped, it is still a [popular revolution.](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/popular-revolt)
1.3.8.2.1. Pro: The last stages of violence may have been escalated by a [false flag attack](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266855828_The_Snipers%27_Massacre_on_the_Maidan_in_Ukraine) from pro-maidan forces. Still, the fact that the mass is duped does not vindicate that it is popular.
1.3.8.3. Con: The mass was a minority."Popular revolution is not defined", but it implies "population", and a minority does not equal the population. Hence it is not a popular revolution.
1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
