Discussion Name: Every country should be ethno-nationalist

1. Every country should be ethno-nationalist.
1.1. Con: Countries that accept other ethnicities flourish, such as the USA, China or Prussia.
1.1.1. Con: Prussia is the prime example "genocide by diversity". Its native people were Baltic. But the [Old Prussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Prussians) were 'outbred' by Germans.
1.1.1.1. Con: The outbreeding of the Prussians was a direct result of the [Baltic crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Crusades), not of German nationalism.
1.1.1.2. Con: Being outbred is not the same as being victims of genocide.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: [Article II section C of UN resolution 260](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention#Definition_of_genocide) can be argued to include being outbred into the definition of genocide.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Article II section C speaks of "Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part". Being outbred is not the same as being physically destroyed.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Genocide [requires intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide)(In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such."). There is no evidence of any intent and concerted effort on the part of the Germans to outbreed Baltic Prussians.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The fact that [Prussia doesn't exist anymore](https://www.britannica.com/place/Prussia/The-kingdom-from-1815-to-1918) shows that such countries don't flourish for a long time.
1.1.2. Con: The USA has a high level of racial tensions due to its diversity.
1.1.2.1. Con: The US has [higher racial tolerance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/?utm_term=.9c12d617f958\)) than many nations.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Racial groups do not vote as a bloc in the US, with many choosing to [vote for Donald Trump in 2020](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/7/21551364/white-trump-voters-2020)(It’s true that Trump appears to have gained about 3 percentage points each with Black, Latinx, and Asian American voters since 2016 \(exit polls appear not to have broken out Indigenous voters, instead lumping them into the category of “other”\). And pointing out that none of these groups are monolithic is an important corrective to the inaccurate idea that “people of color” are homogenous or always vote as a bloc.). This shows that there is bipartisan racial tolerance in the US.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: However, the same source suggests that diverse countries such as India, Turkey and France are highly racially intolerant.
1.1.2.2. Con: Much of the racial diversity in the US stems from the effects of the [transatlantic slave trade](https://www.britannica.com/topic/transatlantic-slave-trade), which uprooted Africans and brought them to America as slaves, not ethnic diversity itself.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Black communities in the US have a high level of [mistrust](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/american-racial-and-ethnic-politics-in-the-21st-century-a-cautious-look-ahead/)(Recent evidence confirms affluent African Americans’ greater mistrust of white society. More college-educated blacks than black high school dropouts believe that it is true or might be true that “the government deliberately investigates black elected officials in order to discredit them,” that “the government deliberately makes sure that drugs are easily available in poor black neighborhoods in order to harm black people,” and that “the virus which causes AIDS was deliberately created in a laboratory in order to infect black people.” In a 1995 Washington Post survey, when asked whether “discrimination is the major reason for the economic and social ills blacks face,” 84 percent of middle-class blacks, as against 66 percent of working-class and poor blacks, agreed.) of the government, and are [poorer](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/american-racial-and-ethnic-politics-in-the-21st-century-a-cautious-look-ahead/)(By conventional measures of income, education, or occupation at least a third of African Americans can be described as middle class, as compared with about half of whites.) than their white counterparts.
1.1.2.4. Pro: High levels of diversity in the USA has lead to fears that white people will become a [minority in the country](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2014/does-diversity-breed-intolerance/)(In addition to the Harvard research, two Northwestern University studies fuel Einstein’s pessimism. One found that as whites learned that they will become a minority, they grew more conservative and Republican-leaning. The other reported that whites who were aware of their future minority status became more negative towards nonwhites and preferred hanging out with their own race.), worsening attitudes towards other ethnicities.
1.1.3. Con: China's ethnic minorities are generally located in [distant plateaus and mountains](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11769-011-0487-8)(As anticipated, results show that Chinese minorities are chiefly concentrated in distant plateaus and mountains in the southwest, northwest and northeast of China. Further, population density centers of the 10 major minorities are rather scattered, alternatively dominating at different parts of the country.), and generally dominate their own regions.
1.1.3.1. Con: China's provinces are determined geographically, not ethnically.
1.1.3.2. Pro: China has treated their Ughyur Muslim population terribly, and there have been reports of [genocide](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037).
1.1.3.3. Con: China is not ethnically diverse enough to be considered multi-ethnic, with [91% of the population being Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China)(As of December 2021, China's population stood at 1.413 billion. According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities).
1.1.4. Pro: A number of countries have two or more ''main'' ethnicities: Switzerland, Belgium, Singapore, New Zealand, etc.
1.1.4.1. Con: The Swiss ethnicities are separated geographically.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Separating these two ethnic communities would fracture successful political regimes, and destroy a common identity between both communities.
1.1.4.3. Con: Belgium has a [major separatist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Belgium) in the Dutch-speaking part of the country \(Flanders\).
1.1.5. Pro: Ideas matter more than ethnicity. Therefore, countries should target anti-national people, regardless of their ethnicity.
1.1.5.1. Con: Morality is subjective. What is beneficial for one people can be a hindrance to another.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.1.5.2. Con: Ethnic homogenity does not stop the spread of ideas.
1.1.6. Pro: Different cultures have different ways of thinking, a key necessity in solving complex problems. Homogeneity of culture leads to a homogeneity of thought, which leads to stagnation.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Ethnic diversity is highly correlated with a greater variety in experience and perspective, which is [highly correlated with better group problem solving and idea generation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1046496496272003)(The ideas produced by the ethnically diverse groups were judged to be of higher quality-more effective and feasible-than the ideas produced by the homogeneous groups.).
1.2. Con: The means of accomplishing an ethno-nationalist state system would be immoral.
1.2.1. Pro: Ethno-nationalism has justified genocide and human rights violations in the past.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The Holocaust was driven by Aryan German [ethno-nationalism](https://identityhunters.org/2020/11/06/hitlers-ethnic-nationalism-where-does-the-notion-of-the-other-come-from/)(Rather than the idea of a nation being people of common culture, language etc, Hitler espouses that, “what makes a people, or, to be more correct, a race is not language, but blood.” This results in ethnic nationalism being more exclusionary than civic nationalism. In fact he directly challenges civil nationalism saying it’s, “inconceivable how such a mistake could be made as to think that a N****r or a Chinaman will become a German because he has learned the German language and is willing to speak German for the future and even to cast his vote for a German political party.”).
1.2.1.2. Pro: The Rwandan genocide was caused by [institutional discrimination](https://humanrights.ca/story/what-led-genocide-against-tutsi-rwanda)(Tensions had simmered for decades between the Hutu and Tutsi populations in Rwanda. The region had operated under Belgian colonial rule from after the First World War until 1962. During this time, colonial policies fostered divisions between the Hutu, who made up the country’s largest ethnic group, and the Tutsi, who formed the second‐largest ethnic group. The Belgians viewed the Tutsi minority as superior, and favoured Tutsi for leadership positions. This favoritism created ongoing and deeper tensions between Hutu and Tutsi.) against one ethnic group/tribe and in favor of another.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The discrimination was not caused by ethno-nationalism, but rather the after-effects of a [discriminatory colonial policy](https://humanrights.ca/story/what-led-genocide-against-tutsi-rwanda)(The region had operated under Belgian colonial rule from after the First World War until 1962. During this time, colonial policies fostered divisions between the Hutu, ... and the Tutsi...).
1.2.1.3. Con: The creation of the Dutch, Spanish, and German nations never led to the genocide of peoples.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Those were not created as [ethno-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism)(Ethnic nationalism, also known as ethnonationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the nation and nationality are defined in terms of ethnicity...), they were not trying to create racial or ethnic purity, just a cohesive political nation.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Spain was [recaptured and reunified](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/spain.htm)(With the decline of the Roman empire, Suebi, Vandals and Alans took control of parts of Hispania. They were followed by the Visigoths, who conquered all of Hispania in the 5th century AD and established a kingdom lasting until 711, when it fell to an invasion by Islamic North African Moors. The Reconquista, the battle between the Christian kingdoms and the Moors lasted until 1492, and in 1512 the unification of present-day Spain was completed.) from ethnically foreign Islamic Moorish control by the native Christian population.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: German unification involved the political [unification](https://history.state.gov/countries/issues/german-unification)(The next attempt at German unification, a successful one, was undertaken by Otto von Bismarck, the Prime Minister of Prussia. Bismarck was a proponent of “smaller” Germany, not to mention a master at the game of real-politik. German unification was achieved by the force of Prussia, and enforced from the top-down, meaning that it was not an organic movement that was fully supported and spread by the popular classes but instead was a product of Prussian royal policies.) of a number of ethnically similar, white states.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Dutch colonialist leaders viewed Indonesians as [uncivilized, and committed atrocities against them](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/08/10/dutch-colonial-history-indonesia-villains-victims/)(During colonial rule, Dutch forces regularly committed atrocities and Indonesian civilians were tortured, raped, and executed. Even in the last years of colonialism, thousands of supporters of independence were jailed.).
1.2.2. Con: International cooperation can ensure that people are able to migrate back to the countries from which they originate in a safe and moral manner.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The [Law of Return](https://archive.jewishagency.org/first-steps/program/5131)(With the inception of the State of Israel, two thousand years of wandering were officially over. Since then, Jews have been entitled to simply show up and request to be Israeli citizens, assuming they posed no imminent danger to public health, state security, or the Jewish people as a whole. Essentially, all Jews everywhere are Israeli citizens by right.\n \nIn 1955, the law was amended slightly to specify that dangerous criminals could also be denied that right.\n \nIn 1970, Israel took another historic step by granting automatic citizenship not only to Jews, but also to their non-Jewish children, grandchildren, and spouses, and to the non-Jewish spouses of their children and grandchildren. This addition not only ensured that families would not be broken apart, but also promised a safe haven in Israel for non-Jews subject to persecution because of their Jewish roots.) allows all Jews world over to move to Israel and become Israeli citizens. Such a practice can be adopted by more countries.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Israel denies many Palestinians who were displaced by Israel a [right to return to their homeland](https://www.afsc.org/resource/palestinian-refugees-and-right-return)(Approximately 750,000 Palestinians were displaced and became refugees as a result of the 1948 war which led to the founding of Israel. None of these displaced persons were ever allowed to return to the homes or communities from which they were displaced and the Palestinian refugee population has continued to grow in the time that has passed since 1948. Today there are more than 7 million Palestinian refugees scattered around the world.). Who can return to where is a contentious issue.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: A consensual and cooperative system of displacement and settlement could allow for a gradual and peaceful transfer of populations.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: Unlike ethnic relocation, the Law of Return is voluntary with many Jews choicing not to move to Israel.
1.2.2.2. Con: Such a system would require that those who do not consent or cooperate are forcefully relocated, which is immoral.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Children of immigrants may be forced to emigrate from their home country and relocate to a country that is culturally foreign to them, merely because of their ethnic background.
1.2.2.3. Con: Second generation immigrants may feel more at home in their country of residence than the countries from which they originate.
1.2.3. Pro: Treating people differently based on irrelevant characteristics such as race is wrong
1.2.3.1. Pro: Ethnicity is an arbitrary characteristic to use to judge someone. Making decisions based on ethnicity is no more justified than using, for instance, hair colour or height.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Race-based treatment has been the cause of terrible human horrors. \(slavery, genocide, lack of dignity\)
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: To gain favor with any [in-group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_and_out-group), simply market any out-group as being the [cause of the in-group's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_and_out-group#Out-group_derogation), and if the out-group is simply eliminated, the problems will cease. This was the [Nazi's tactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_Nazi_Germany), pre WWii, and currently the state of both the [Democratic and Republican parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_campaigning) in the USA.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Race-based treatment erases the dignity of a person because the [othering of people](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/08/us-vs-them-the-sinister-techniques-of-othering-and-how-to-avoid-them) based on race allows for the quick and absolute dissolution of a person's dignity.
1.2.3.3. Con: Not all characteristics based on race are wrong. Some races physiologically are predisposed to certain conditions, [like Vitamin D deficiency](https://coronavirusexplained.ukri.org/en/article/cad0011/)(...biological factors could contribute to the observed differences between ethnic groups. For example, vitamin D deficiency is more common among individuals with darker skin and is a possible risk factor for COVID-19.), that can either help or hinder their particular race. This information might be useful for health related reasons or for physical sports like sprinting.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: A vitamin D deficiency does not divide people to such a degree that Ethno-nationalism is warranted or necessary.
1.2.3.4. Con: People are already treated differently due to their sex, [attractiveness](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1204&context=honors) or other factors of their birth. Treating people differently based on their ethnicity is no different.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Bias in favor of people we find attractive is a hard wired biological trait. This is very different from choicing to forcefully relocate someone in the name of a political ideal.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: Discrimination based on gender differences is also wrong.
1.2.4. Con: If the ends meant the preservation of individual cultures globally, then they would justify the means.
1.2.5. Pro: Ethno-nationalism implies the displacement of entire groups of people, which could destroy families.
1.2.5.1. Con: This is but a short-term factor, as those displaced could quickly settle elsewhere.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Destruction of families would have effects lasting generations.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240051/) show that "nearly three decades of research evaluating the impact of family structure on the health and well-being of children demonstrates that children living with their married, biological parents consistently have better physical, emotional, and academic well-being".
1.2.5.2. Pro: Such a system would result in those of mixed ethnicity having no home.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The issue of mixed-ethnicity ethno-nationality could be fixed by allowing the individual to choose an identity. This would become less of a problem as time goes on and ethnicities only have children amongst themselves.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Those of mixed ethnicity would likely face persecution in the country they grew up in if it were to become ethno-nationalist, as they would be visibly different from their fellow countrymen.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Collective expulsion is prohibited by many articles of [international law](https://www.aacademica.org/andrew.scholten/9.pdf)(According to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling\nnon-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a\nreasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the\ngroup. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state\nregardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several\ninstruments of international law.) \(p.2\).
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Such a system violates the right to [free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association).
1.2.5.3.1.1. Con: Freedom of association is not an inalienable right, and is [often restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association)(The courts and delegated officers of local jurisdictions may impose restrictions on any of the rights of a convicted criminal as a condition of a legal stipulation. Rights to freedom of association and freedom of assembly are waived under certain circumstances, such as a guilty plea or conviction, restraining orders and probationer's search and seizure procedures.).
1.2.5.3.1.2. Pro: Ethno-nationalist states compel individuals to be associated with a state simply due to their ethnicity, which violates their [freedom of association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association)(Freedom of association is manifested through the right to ... not to be compelled to belong to an association.).
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Just because something is illegal does not mean that it is immoral or unethical.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: [Forced displacement](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/refugees-and-the-ethics-of-forced-displacement/) for any reason, but especially because of race, is both immoral and unethical.
1.2.5.4. Pro: There is no way to create or maintain an ethno-nationalist state without the forced destruction of interracial relationships.
1.2.6. Con: The means of accomplishing an internationalist state system would be immoral too.
1.2.6.1. Con: Internationalism is irrelivent to ethno-nationalism. Many more views exist other than just internationalism or ethno-nationalism.
1.3. Con: Ethno-nationalism would be detrimental to the economy of the nation.
1.3.1. Pro: Ethno-nationalism would discourage the recruitment of talent and techniques from other nations, which could lead to underperformance and inefficiency.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The tying of certain inventions to a certain ethnicity or nationality may prevent them being used elsewhere by an ethno-nationalist society, stopping innovation.
1.3.1.2. Con: Friendly inter-ethnic competition could lead to increased innovation and trade, which increase economic performance.
1.3.2. Con: Japan is an incredibly [ethnically homogeneous](https://www.diversityabroad.com/articles/travel-guide/japan)(Although Japan is a highly ethnically homogenous country – 98.5% of the population is Japanese – it is considered a tolerant country, welcoming of visitors.) nation, consisting of 98.5% Japanese people. This is reflected in the stability of their economy.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Japan has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world, [and the lowest unemployment rate among G20 nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate), even though their economy shrunk with their population. This fosters economic stability in the future, and Japan's economy is [in the midst of record expansion](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Japan-economy-faces-crucial-test-on-cusp-of-record-expansion).
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Japan is not an ideologically ethno-nationalist state, and has sought to bring in [migrant workers in order to care for their aging population](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/japan-labor-migration-reforms-breaking-past)(n 2019, Japan began to set aside the decades-old distinction in its migration regime between “un-/low-skilled” work and highly skilled professional employment, hoping to bring in as many as 350,000 medium-skilled foreign workers over five years to fill labor market gaps in a rapidly aging society.).
1.3.2.2. Con: The Japanese economy has been historically volatile, with dizzying highs like the [bubble economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble) followed by devastating [economic crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades).
1.3.3. Pro: [Studies](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/immigration-boosts-germanys-economy/) have shown that migration boosts the economy.
1.3.3.1. Con: Migration can help to alleviate [worker shortages](https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2021/11/26/immigration-a-solution-to-labor-shortages/), however an ethnically homogeneous state with a high birth rate would not require migration to maintain or boost economic growth.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: There is not a single example of a ethnically homogeneous country with a high birth rate.
1.3.3.2. Con: [Demographic changes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4652002/Native-Germans-minority-Germany.html) show that the economic growth comes at the price of the native ethnicity's own existence.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Demographic change does not cause anyone's death or anyone to cease existing.
1.3.3.3. Pro: The [diverse set of skills](https://blogs.imf.org/2020/06/19/migration-to-advanced-economies-can-raise-growth/)(Our analysis looks separately at the effect of overall immigration \(which is mostly driven by economic reasons\) into advanced economies and refugee immigration into emerging market and developing economies.\n\nWe find that immigrants in advanced economies increase output and productivity both in the short and medium term. Specifically, we show that a 1 percentage point increase in the inflow of immigrants relative to total employment increases output by almost 1 percent by the fifth year.\n\nThat’s because native and immigrant workers bring to the labor market a diverse set of skills, which complement each other and increase productivity. Our simulations additionally indicate that even modest productivity increases from immigration benefits the average income of natives.) brought by migrants helps to boost productivity in economies.
1.3.3.4. Con: As the native population recovers after the deportation of the other ethnicities, so will its economy.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: Neither the [study](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/immigration-boosts-germanys-economy/) nor the question of migration specifically relates to ethnicity. A nation could have high migration with limited ethnic diversity or low migration and high diversity.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: The migrant worker population will eventually be replaced if the native population can sustain a high enough birthrate.
1.3.3.5. Pro: Migrants contribute [more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in benefits](https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf)(Migrants contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in benefits.) \(p.1\), being a net positive upon society and the economy.
1.3.4. Con: The economy can be recovered; a nation's people and culture cannot.
1.3.4.1. Con: Economic failure can lead to [famine](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/131461468739459836/127527322_20041117152101/additional/multi-page.pdf)\(p.1\) and [war](https://www.britannica.com/science/famine)(The most common human cause of famine is warfare. In addition to destroying crops and food supplies, warfare disrupts the distribution of food through the strategic use of siege and blockade tactics and through the incidental destruction of transportation routes and vehicles.), whereas national cultures and identity naturally change over time.
1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.4. Pro: Ethno-nationalist states would help preserve human biodiversity.
1.4.1. Con: Preservation of human biodiversity is an argument in favor of integration, not isolation.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Exclusively breeding with close genetic relatives makes for less genetic diversity and more genetic problems.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Ethnically homogeneous populations can lead to [genetic homozygosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding), causing decreased biological fitness of a population.
1.4.1.2. Pro: [Studies](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3146070/Mixed-race-relationships-making-taller-smarter-Children-born-genetically-diverse-parents-intelligent-ancestors.html) in the UK have shown mixed-race relationships lead to taller, smarter offspring.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The research ignores the fact that the British population was already mixed in the first place, and ignores any benefit from historic diversity from Roman, Viking, Saxon and French invasions.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of the source of the diversity, the study shows that ethnic diversity does lead to beneficial outcomes.
1.4.2. Pro: Mixing all the colours of the rainbow creates one colour. And you can never get the other ones back, which is the opposite of diversity.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Constantly mixing and combining cultures could lead to a cultural homogenization, similar to what occurs with the paint colours.
1.4.2.2. Con: Comparing biodiversity to a can of paint is simplistic to the point of nonsense.
1.5. Pro: Ethno-nationalism helps preserve a nation's culture and traditions.
1.5.1. Con: Cultures are always changing, coming and going.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The culture of a nation is normally subject to [synchronic, diachronic and internal changes](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/277811/1-s2.0-S1877042810X00039/1-s2.0-S1877042810002053/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEA0aCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIGYjM7Vq7q5h0d4MT5udtBTwyxlE1gEkQVLyxEPjF3zVAiBRCXvAJcni2nd4uGGYnzc4zO0K6sAJusfPuO319AeSoSrSBAhGEAQaDDA1OTAwMzU0Njg2NSIM82CUAk%2FDWvpW%2Bmv9Kq8EvUNLjV%2BH8dHC89fSTv39B3klH6KRlMKeO2tf8xB%2F4KIdeT9%2BMlmzdJWV%2FjhDMV3IoVQPI%2FuLV7GXD0pdoaR8Z6HCAr0KY0Uj1uC1h%2BUDZZP0R2cNDNjqsEmgAV0%2BIUdESlKWTM9SYCYddVeWBN0THPNTkWy5cpZ60HR3MNJIeTHWRLXPh69jGz%2BIE9CAfqSPDyPVO3%2Ft0E%2BnPMLr1Tth0nuWv1uuuE8pZHROfhxZ7kcs2aEraQo0hxnQH6KhZXP8MenPrrSYb24c5qAcHYNWCSbLlbu71T5HWgIGB%2FD06OZWgXCTtWZBXYPMODvZT0KWj1Cl1yu%2BZ%2Fy2yLrUy%2B46C%2BKqMqZH1I1f4qDinHhSkHTNqsoymGlG%2BNsCss4nM4irpTs0NFRRTDfmnA%2BQZuPN5ItftGmnqN4f7q102bwnq7wQBL5eEB%2FNRHdkmbFcVeglQhk6qas86XzHft8xHYV0TNjWR7ak0UtLKWaj1%2BuAEV2AAcTUjq77PjYzGMkHqPgbUulZ3PY%2B6yHHqE9waO%2F24xqqpSo9WCbajENbtcoPAqxTcldK%2BKUTYObz%2F4XLngUkOgVmrb%2FgY%2FR3Y1%2BlY23EDNCM7xuqk59tAfGwDAmjyb%2FZhJhbr5xmfnkUWAfDuasDF0Dzu6XnXzRum2gFsUefmPu3TxIt%2BUuXVHlc02It5xMUDSDtUxDBlSel9UCcBSjGA3qfJcwY47iGbSkSqO8OE1gaqD%2BEJjYxJzJUcRFsCTDjuLCWBjqqAVl9lu43i1FEuX2mxhkcXemnc05T18tapfQX5TgA4DH%2BWrCLWRYsvNI7BMcJSDw219CjYcsCVGt28nfP7AoKfxk2VcSpdvT6Q8UeLndIzTmRX9%2FnAugxOWzKGzJmqRqKS3%2Fr5t2bVK1mrk4yQIeHfWmampd4olq8W2BHUu7eRA8ez7TJHqS%2BG8N5UazKImFkW6UzxodLsZCI8nbvgeD%2FSqgi0bqjVKBGPKNH&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20220711T135058Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYYFE6SYTB%2F20220711%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=591f2fd40ed67b86783ee96d5e38c1fca1535db51218dd570f619c76bd83d670&hash=2c3ccb7e84fd9f11a6922627d89c1686a8f51845106eb38b82383b94e018374e&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877042810002053&tid=spdf-f6c544fe-e269-453c-bc71-89e92ec68f01&sid=dcf964d4149e33426c283717a0a1d14aa74egxrqb&type=client&ua=57555f5c5750060052&rr=729202de780fe638)(Every culture has an archetype which we can consider to be unique because of its inner ethnic nature; unique as\ninner specificity, but open to the universal through value and symbol. The pulse of a common ancestral background\nbut also the nuances related to the "archeology" of every specific ethnic spirit can always be discovered in archaic\nand symbolic traditional thinking. We cannot speak of an equivalence of cultures but we can assert that beyond their\nontological, axiological, and historical dimension, cultures have common values and symbols)\(p.2\).
1.5.1.2. Con: Many cultures are naturally [hesitant to change, and seek to preserve their traditions through legal or societal actions](https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/change/change_1.htm)(All cultures change through time. No culture is static. However, most cultures are basically conservative in that they tend to resist change. Some resist more than others by enacting laws for the preservation and protection of traditional cultural patterns while putting up barriers to alien ideas and things. For example, the French government has forbidden the commercial use of English words for which there are French equivalencies.), such as moving towards ethno-nationalism.
1.5.1.3. Pro: People with a 'migrant background' can belong and contribute to the nation's culture as well.
1.5.2. Con: Western culture includes a respect for [Human Rights and equality](https://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/25/western-human-rights-in-a-diverse-world-cultural-suppression-or-relativism/)(Human rights are a Western cultural construct. They provide all with inalienable and inherent rights, and cultures which dispute the validity of human rights are those which abuse the human rights of their members, and are those which should change their practices). Mass deportation of all non-native ethnicities would violate these principles, and would thus be the opposite of preserving Western culture.
1.5.3. Pro: Ethno-nationalism important for small ethnic populations, as it helps them to sustain their cultures, thereby sustaining diversity. In a massive multicultural world, the [traditionally dominant demographic can be outnumbered](https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-census-data-shows-the-nation-is-diversifying-even-faster-than-predicted/)(The declining white population share is pervasive across the nation. Since 2010, the white population share declined in all 50 states \(though not Washington, D.C.\) \(download table A\), and in 358 of the nation’s 364 metropolitan areas and 3,012 of its 3,141 counties. Moreover, as of 2019, 27 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas have minority-white populations, including the major metropolises of New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Miami—as well as Dallas, Atlanta, and Orlando, Fla., which reached this status by 2010...) by the other groups, leading to loss of cultural identity.
1.5.3.1. Con: This has not proven true, as there are a number of small, ethnically homogenous nations that have a strong culture, but are not ethno-nationalist, such as [Ireland](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp8iter/p8iter/p8e/)(The largest group in 2016 was “White Irish” with 3,854,226 \(82.2%\) usual residents. This was followed by “Any other White background” \(9.5%\), non-Chinese Asian \(1.7%\) and “Other incl. mixed background” \(1.5%\).).
1.5.3.2. Con: If this were true, then it is unlikely that western civilisations would exist currently, as many Asian countries, such as China and India have incredibly [large populations](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries).
1.5.4. Con: Culture and ethnicity are not mutually exclusive.
1.5.4.1. Con: Although some ethnicities may share the same traditions, they still differ from each other.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: For example, the difference in [the celebration of Saint Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas_Day) in The Netherlands, Alsace-Lorraine, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: Most cultures are multi-ethnic. Culture is more strongly associated with [geographic location than ethnic background](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1419883112)(Also equally important is the question of the geographical boundaries of the cultural/ethnic entities coming into contact. These boundaries were, in my opinion, attenuated and flexible in prestate and early-state societies, when political territories and borders had not yet been precisely established \(9, 10\). In these societies, the individual and group identities may have been more related to their social and cultural affinities \(belonging to tribes, villages, kinship groups, clans, etc.\) than to territories with precisely defined borders.).
1.5.4.2. Pro: People can partake in, contribute to, and take ownership of any culture, regardless of their ethnicity.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: If a culture is inherently ethno-nationalist or xenophobic, this cannot occur as people of other ethnicities would be automatically rejected.
1.6. Pro: It is easier for a state to function with an ethnically homogeneous population.
1.6.1. Con: Political power necessitates political division. Even in a state with a homogeneous population, self selecting groups will form.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Even in societies that proclaim themselves as being based on equality, a ruling or dominant class will emerge. As George Orwell states in 'Animal Farm', "[All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.](https://wychwoodschool.org/blogs/all-animals-are-equal-but-some-are-more-equal-than-others/)(This is a quotation from George Orwell’s allegorical novel Animal Farm. In it the animals conspire to take control of their farm from humans, establishing ‘Animalist’ commandments to prevent the reproduction of the oppressive behaviour of humans. Unfortunately as time goes on that is exactly what happens and the pig Napoleon ends up changing the final rule of ‘All animals are equal’ so that it reads that ‘All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others’. This is a parody of Stalinist Russia which Orwell was criticising.)"
1.6.1.2. Pro: Ethnic identity is only one of possible social cleavages: gender, social class, income levels, age or even type of employment can create conflicts as well.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Many civil wars around the world throughout history have been about political and economic power within ethnically homogeneous countries.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [Spanish Civil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War) war, for example, was entirely due to political differences.
1.6.2. Pro: It is natural for ethnic groups that share common ancestry, history, culture, traditions, language and faith to develop into state-like entities.
1.6.3. Pro: Racial discrimination has consistently led to unfair and unstable societies.
1.6.3.1. Con: Racial discrimination within a nation can only be practised in a country where there are different races in the first place. Removing these races from said nation will effectively end racism in the area.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: To sustain such a racially pure nation, constant racism would need to be applied, because any non-racially pure person would be kicked out. So this would not 'end racism'.
1.6.3.2. Con: Exposure to other cultures and races ends racism. Isolation does the opposite.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: If this were correct, then racism would already have ended, which it hasn't.
1.6.3.2.1.1. Con: Only under the assumption that all people have been properly exposed to other cultures, which they have not.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Studies have shown that social learning in infants [is predicted](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714001590) by the linguistic diversity of the communities in which they live.
1.6.3.2.2.1. Con: Such diversity leads to the bastardisation of either language, creating [mixed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_language).
1.6.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Language is key to [cultural expression and identity](https://greenheart.org/blog/greenheart-international/language-the-essence-of-culture/)(Language is one of the most important parts of any culture. It is the way by which people communicate with one another, build relationships, and create a sense of community. There are roughly 6,500 spoken languages in the world today, and each is unique in a number of ways.). By mixing languages, one erodes the cultural tradition behind the host language.
1.6.3.2.2.1.2. Con: [Contact between languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_contact) and multilingualism have existed throughout human history. Our current languages are bastardisations of previous ones. It isn't a bad thing.
1.6.3.2.3. Pro: Studies have shown that exposure to other cultures can [increase creativity](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100630101028.htm).
1.6.3.2.3.1. Con: Ethno-nationalism doesn't stop people from visiting other countries to experience their cultures.
1.6.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Those with ethno-nationalistic views can still have curiosity and appreciation for other cultures.
1.6.3.2.3.1.2. Con: Tourism only provides superficial interactions with a culture and does not provide the same exposure and immersion as multiculturalism.
1.6.4. Con: The fact that a state may be easier to run does not make its creation moral.
1.6.5. Con: Since civilization has been [migrating for a long time](https://comparativemigrationstudies.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40878-021-00272-y), it is almost impossible to find a state with an "original ethnicity".
1.6.5.1. Pro: Every race and ethnicity can trace their ancestry back to the [origin of human evolution in Africa](https://humanorigins.si.edu/education/introduction-human-evolution)(umans are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the modern human species, Homo sapiens, has a very close relationship to another group of primate species, the apes. Humans and the great apes \(large apes\) of Africa -- chimpanzees \(including bonobos, or so-called “pygmy chimpanzees”\) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and much of human evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely from Africa.), therefore there is no true ethnic biodiversity to protect, only evolutionary adaptations over time.
1.6.6. Pro: In an ethno-nationalist state, many social issues would be rendered irrelevant.
1.6.6.1. Con: It would increase tensions between those who support segregation and those who support free association, as those desiring to associate with those of other ethnicities would be prevented from doing so.
1.6.6.2. Pro: Political discussions can be focused on the economy, infrastructure and other important issues instead.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.6.6.3. Con: There is no evidence that racially/ethnically homogeneous nations face fewer social problems or have stronger economies.
1.6.6.3.1. Pro: With the advent of globalization, there are very few ethnically homogenous nations. This means that it is difficult to get significant amounts of data on the potential positive social effects of homogeneity.
1.6.6.4. Con: There may be fewer issues which are considered divisive within the state, but they would instead lead to division between states.
1.6.6.4.1. Pro: Competition between different different ways of life is good because this way the best is selected.
1.6.6.5. Pro: There would be no racial tensions in an ethno-nationalist state.
1.6.6.5.1. Con: It might instead exacerbate racial tensions between nations.
1.6.6.5.1.1. Pro: Smaller ethnicities would be disadvantaged over larger ones and therefore racial tensions would increase due to the forced segregation.
1.6.6.5.1.2. Pro: Inevitably, claims to territory and culture will overlap, and large scale conflicts between competing ethno-states will arise.
1.6.6.5.1.2.1. Pro: Countries are defined by border lines on maps. Nationalism cares about these lines, ethnicity does not.
1.6.6.5.1.2.2. Pro: Nationalism is a proven driver of conflict. Ethno-nationalism would only exacerbate the divisions in our species and create more conflict, not less.
1.6.6.5.1.2.3. Con: Claim to territory would be determined by the people inhabiting it. This way, there cannot be an overlap.
1.6.6.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: Individual communities in contentious areas could be polled to determine their identity and allegiance.
1.6.6.5.1.2.3.2. Con: Locations with highly intermixed populations, such as Jerusalem, would be impossible to resolve.
1.6.6.5.1.2.4. Con: Large scale conflicts will exist nonetheless. If a country wants war with another, it will find a casus belli.
1.6.6.5.1.2.4.1. Con: This assumes that countries want war and then decide to look for a reason, instead of reasons for war leading to war.
1.6.6.5.1.3. Con: Ethno-nationalism need not be antagonistic, as other nations may still admire and respect the achievements of other ethno-nations.
1.6.6.5.2. Con: Many ethnic/racially homogeneous nations just turn to religious, or "tribal", or regional tensions. Learning to negotiate diversity is the only path to reducing tensions, because diversity always exists; the only change is what differences get focused on.
1.6.6.5.2.1. Pro: When the Northern US was overwhelmingly white, there were divisions between Anglo-Saxon ethnicities and German, Irish, and Italian ethnicities; but when there was more racial diversity, those all just became "white".
1.6.6.5.2.2. Con: These tensions are mostly isolated because of their smaller, more regional scale.
1.6.6.5.2.2.1. Con: Racial tensions are also localised.
1.6.6.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: People have always clustered close to others who are identified as part of their "group" by broader society. When society draws lines of division and one group is in the overwhelming minority that group will cluster together for comfort and safety.
1.6.6.5.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: When society was particularly hostile towards homosexuals, there were vibrant gay communities in cities, and the same occurred with Italian or Jewish communities.
1.6.6.5.2.3. Con: Refusing to relieve one tension "because other tensions will still prevail" is not a reason not to relieve this tension.
1.6.6.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.7. Pro: An ethno-nationalist state system would halt the importation of slave-tier labour from the third world countries.
1.7.1. Pro: Modern ethno-nationalism can be anti-colonial, if all ethnicities are allowed to rule their own nations.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Ethnic self-determination is inherently anti-colonial, as it recognizes the right for each ethnicity to govern themselves.
1.7.1.2. Con: Ethno-nationalism can lead to the development of the ideal of a [master race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_race), which would claim rights over other ethicities across the globe.
1.7.2. Pro: A nation of people that prefer their own ethnicity to others would not want to hire people from other ethnicities, and would thus be willing to pay a premium to hire from their own ethnicity.
1.7.3. Con: Ethno-nationalist ideals of ethnic superiority might lead to [dehumanization](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soc4.12913)(In the media, during sporting events, in online forums, and in interpersonal interactions, whites often portray Black people as animals, especially as apes or monkeys. In this essay we consider what contemporary research on prejudice in American politics has to say about these dehumanizing portrayals of Black people.) of other ethnicities, encouraging their exploitation.
1.7.4. Con: Slave labor may still be practiced in an ethno-nationalist nation by buying foreign products made in slave labor conditions.
1.7.5. Con: If there is a demand for exploitative cheap labor, that is an [economic problem](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0950017021999569)(This article investigates the making of cheap workers at the bottom of global value chains. Adopting a class relational approach, it engages in labour regime and social reproduction analyses, to examine the labour process in Senegalese export horticulture and its relations with rural households. Drawing from primary qualitative data, it analyses power relations within workplaces and households investigating the structural relations between them through the disciplining and exploitation of women. It argues that labour control beyond workplaces is crucial to the supply of cheap and disciplined workers, showing how patriarchy and religion regulate a continuum of class relations between households, fields, and packaging centres.), not an ethnic problem.
1.7.5.1. Pro: An ethno-state can still economically exploit slave labour without engaging in it, by purchasing the products of such labour.
1.7.5.2. Con: Lack of cheap labour leads to innovation, [as employers seek to automate and reduce wage overheads](https://economics.mit.edu/files/8994)(I show that labor scarcity encour-\nages technological advances if technology is strongly labor saving and will discourage them if technology is strongly labor complementary.) \(p.2\).
1.8. Con: Race and ethnicity are superficial demarcations with no objective method of determination.
1.8.1. Con: [Forensic science](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6dca/74712aed4b5ae2c6723ffc13eed57cfe6718.pdf) proves otherwise.
1.8.1.1. Con: The source cited doesn't argue for race being a meaningful biological demarkation.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: The paper says: "It is maintained in this paper that the successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed ‘racial’ category."
1.8.2. Pro: Ethno-nationalism is based on an [unscientific](https://library.harvard.edu/confronting-anti-black-racism/scientific-racism)(A history of pseudoscientific methods “proving” white biological superiority and flawed social studies used to show “inherent” racial characteristics still influence society today.) understanding of human biology in which subdivisions or "races" exist on a biological level and determine higher level social and cultural differences. The scientific community overwhelmingly does not support this hypothesis.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The [current opinion](https://www.livinganthropologically.com/biological-anthropology/race-reconciled-debunks-race/) of anthropology is that race is not an accurate or productive way to describe human biological variation.
1.8.3. Pro: The definition of 'white' has [varied throughout history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States), which proves how difficult it is to define race and ethnicity.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The Irish were [not considered to be white](https://www3.nd.edu/~pclauss/wr13300/handouts/irishwhite.pdf)\(p.1\) by many in history, yet are recognized as white in modern times.
1.8.4. Con: The [right to self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) has a great value for a vast amount of people. So much that this right is recognized by [international law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/self_determination_\(international_law\)).
1.8.4.1. Pro: Countless of wars and other conflicts did happen because of these issues. [Many nations struggled for a long time to achieve their independent nation-state](https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/20/1/111/444727).
