Discussion Name: North Korea should not give up its nuclear weapons for its national security.

1. North Korea should not give up its nuclear weapons for its national security.
1.1. Con: There will be many advantages for its national security when North Korea gives up its nukes.
1.1.1. Pro: Without the sanctions, North Korea can get enormous economic and technological help from the international community to develop its economy, which is beneficial for stablizing its regime.
1.1.1.1. Con: Since Kim Jong-un exercises great control over his people, the most important thing to maintain his power is not the regular people's lives, but the elite's. Hence, developing the country's economy is not a priority.
1.1.1.2. Con: As people become richer and wealthier owing to the economic development, they might open their eyes for political liberty.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: [South Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_Korea) in the 1970s and 80s is a good example of this.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Kim Jong-un can utilize the economic development as a tool to get more supports from his people. Hence, it will be more sustainable and stronger to maintain his power and national security if Kim can make the economic development.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: This is similar to the economic reforms by [Deng and his successors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform) in China.
1.1.1.4. Pro: The [good growth theory](http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/borner/borner9.pdf), which holds that as economic growth is good for people it also promotes political stability, is widely supported.
1.1.2. Con: Diplomatic and economic advantages can always be revoked.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
\(KEDO\) was [not initiated on time and later revoked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula_Energy_Development_Organization) when the Agreed Framework was broken down.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Depending upon the regime in the US and South Korea, the position on the diplomatic and economic advantages can be changed.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: When North Korea participated in the [six-party talks and denuclearlized its facitlity](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/6partytalks) at Yongbyun, its name on the terrorist countries was lifted by the US. Soon after, however, Pyeongyang was re-designated as one of terrorist countries.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: There are huge difference of [positions towards North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations) between Bush and Obama administration in the US.
1.1.3. Pro: Giving up nuclear weapons will help normalize the diplomatic relationship between North Korea and the US which can be more beneficial for North Korean national security.
1.1.3.1. Con: Even when the US had formal relationships with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, Washington still initiated wars and eliminated the leaders in the name of the war on terrors.
1.1.4. Pro: North Korea's nuclear program risks [exacerbating an arms race](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2017/03/08/hey-north-korea-youre-starting-an-arms-race/#56d370a229ac) in the region.
1.1.5. Pro: The US has more incentive to invade North Korea when they posses nukes. The US may be forced to invade to preemptively defend itself from a nation, which is constantly threatening a nuclear strike, and may distribute material and/or weapons to terrorist organizations.
1.1.6. Pro: International sanctions prompted by it possessing nuclear weapons might be harmful for North Korean national security.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Constant sanctions targeting the leadership might weaken the sense of loyalty of the elite towards Kim Jong-un.
1.1.6.2. Pro: International sanctions might have a bad impact on North Korean economy.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Despite sanctions, [free markets](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/2/15502672/north-korea-economy) implicitly embraces by the North Korean government made the North Korean economy better.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: There are other reasons that have cause North Korea's [bad economy](https://www.ft.com/content/9427a7bc-24e1-11e7-8691-d5f7e0cd0a16?mhq5j=e2).
1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: The North Korean economy is in a bad place mainly because of the [flood in the 1990s](http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/COE/Japanese/Newsletter/No.6.english/KIMURA.html).
1.1.6.2.2.2. Pro: The [limited trade partners](http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/COE/Japanese/Newsletter/No.6.english/KIMURA.html) since the collapse of the Soviet Union have resulted in the economy suffering.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: [Several human rights NGOs](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-will-sanctions-on-north-korea-affect-its-people/3277042.html) argue that international sanctions inevitably cause hardships for North Korean people in general as well as their government.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: The [UN sanctions](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2152600/un-sanctions-hurt-vulnerable-people-north-korea-ngos) against North Korea are hurting those who need help the most, according to aid workers with long experience in the isolated country.
1.1.6.2.3.2. Pro: [People who work in the coal and mining industries can suffer](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-will-sanctions-on-north-korea-affect-its-people/3277042.html) due to the international sanctions.
1.1.6.3. Con: International sanctions against North Korea have [not been effective](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/25/news/north-korea-economy-sanctions/index.html) due to arbitrary interpretations and weak implementation.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: [China](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/news/economy/north-korea-china-pressure-trump/index.html) accounts for more than 80% of North Korean trade and it does not completely implement sanctions in terms of oil or other strategic resources.
1.1.6.4. Con: [Beijing](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html) has made the calculation that a nuclear-armed North Korea is a better option than a regime collapse. In this sense, sanctions will not be implemented to a degree so extreme that North Korea gets heavily damaged.
1.1.7. Con: Nuclear weapons can help North Korea deter any possible attacks.
1.1.7.1. Con: It is not nuclear weapons but traditional forces that deter the US from operating surgical strikes on North Korea.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Since [thousands of cannons](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-korea-artillery_n_58f631a4e4b0b9e9848eb990) aim at Seoul, the US cannot choose to attack North Korea.
1.1.7.1.2. Pro: Another reason is the [US military base at Uijeongbu](https://militarybases.com/overseas/south-korea/camp-stanley/). Located between Seoul and North Korea, the army base plays a role as a tripwire. Once the battle occurs, the US army must be attacked which leads to automatic military intervention of the US military regardless of the US Congress permission.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: Nuclear weapons and North Korean traditional military are incomparable. The latter might do significant damage to South Korean assets, however, the former can strike the US continent causing far larger-scale destruction.
1.1.7.1.4. Pro: The lack of information about where North Korean nuclear weapons are prevents the US from striking. If the US cannot assess that it will strike and destroy the nuclear weapons with absolute certainty, it runs the risk of nuclear retaliation.
1.1.7.2. Pro: North Korea has been intimidated by other countries threatening to attack it with nuclear weapons.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Since the Korean war, the US has mentioned the deployment and usage of nuclear weapons in the context of defending South Korea only.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: In 2013, Korean Central News Agency said in its commentary that the [North Korea's underground nuclear test](http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this) was an unavoidable just option to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the country and nation from the ceaseless nuclear threats of the U.S. technically at war with it.
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: North Korea [argues](http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this) that the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises are nuclear war drills targeting it.
1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: According to the description on these military exercises from the US and South Korea the [primary purpose of Foal Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal_Eagle) is to demonstrate South Korean-U.S. military resolve to deter war on the Korean peninsula and to improve the combined and joint operational posture of those forces.
1.1.7.2.4. Pro: The United States president Truman initially mentioned the possibility of using nuclear weapons during[the Press conference on November 30th of 1950](https://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=985).
1.1.7.2.4.1. Pro: Kim Il-sung was [“enormously threatened”](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=2007701000825) by this remark made by Truman.
1.1.7.2.5. Pro: General MacArthur [submitted a list of ‘retaliation targets’](http://sydney.edu.au/arts/government_international_relations/staff/profiles/justin.hastings.php) in China and North Korea, requiring twenty-six atomic bombs in all on December 24th of 1950.
1.1.7.2.6. Pro: In 1951, [Johns Hopkins University research team](http://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/tactical-employment-of-atomic-weapons/) advised General Arthur on twenty-two types of tactical targets that can be attacked effectively with atomic warheads.
1.1.7.2.6.1. Pro: [Operation Hudson Harbor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30209238?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) was planned to establish the capability to use atomic weapons on the battlefield with an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming.
1.1.7.2.7. Pro: [Eisenhower considered atomic bombs](https://www.brookings.edu/book/nuclear-blackmail-and-nuclear-balance/) to not only be a tool to threaten but also a possible option that can be used in the battlefield.
1.1.7.2.7.1. Pro: In 1955, [Eisenhower declared at a news conference](https://millercenter.org/president/eisenhower/foreign-affairs) that in the event of war in East Asia, he would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons against military targets.
1.1.7.2.8. Pro: One year after the armistice treaty of 1953, [Secretary of State John Dulles announced](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dulles-announces-policy-of-massive-retaliation) that the US will protect its allies through the deterrent of massive retaliatory power.
1.1.7.2.9. Pro: In 1958 at the latest, the [US deployed tactical nuclear weapons](https://www.globalresearch.ca/a-history-of-us-nuclear-weapons-in-south-korea/5623878) in the southern part of the Korean peninsula.
1.1.7.2.10. Con: In [an interview](https://www.amazon.com/Two-Koreas-Contemporary-History/dp/0465031234), the South Korean president Park Jeong-hee said that if the US nuclear umbrella were to be removed, they would have to start developing our nuclear capability to save themselves. The South Korean position here was clearly defensive and not offensive towards North Korea.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Nuclear weapons can act as a last line of defence, the threat of which will discourage attacks by opposing states.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: The [Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option#Deterrence_doctrine) has acted as the "ultimate guarantor" of Israeli state security through a deterrence doctrine.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: During the Gulf War in 2003, Kim Jong-il [went into hiding](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37321686) in fear of being assassinated by missile. If North Korea had not been part of the [TNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons), such drastic measures may not have been required.
1.1.7.4. Con: In order to deter attacks using nuclear weapons, a country has to have the capability to strike second. If attacked by a nuclear weapon, they must be able to retaliate afterwards. In the case of North Korea, owing to the small size of territory, it is difficult to have second-strike capability.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: The size of territory does not completely determine the second strike capability. Just as China, Russia, and India, North Korea [has been putting its efforts](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/02/24/0200000000AEN20170224000251315.html) to develop moving missiles which can be used for the second strike.
1.2. Con: North Korea is well-known to have collaborated with terrorism-sponsoring states.
1.2.1. Pro: [An example of this was in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Outside_the_Box) where they assisted during the construction of a nuclear reactor.
1.2.2. Pro: North Korea has been notorious for its extensive support of the [Iranian Nuclear Program](https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/north-korea-iran).
1.3. Con: North Korea is highly unlikely to get a peace treaty if it remains a nuclear power.
1.3.1. Pro: The US [rejected a peace proposal](https://www.dw.com/en/us-confirms-it-rejected-north-korean-peace-treaty-proposal/a-19064646-0) from North Korea when Pyongyang refused to give up its nuclear arsenal.
1.3.2. Pro: The Kim regime has generally been untrustworthy.
1.3.3. Con: Without nuclear weapons, North Korea has little or no bargaining power for a peace treaty.
1.4. Con: Instead of nuclear weapons, other non-conventional weapons can be used for the national security.
1.4.1. Con: For a relatively small and poor country, nuclear weapons are one of the [most economically viable ways](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-nuclear-weapons-reall_b_655373) to ensure security.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.4.3. Pro: North Korea probably could employ [chemical weapon agents](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/us-invasion-north-korea-would-be-opening-gates-hell-57377) by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles.
1.4.3.1. Pro: U.S. military analysts are increasingly concerned about North Korea's "[underestimated and highly lethal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/science/north-korea-biological-weapons.html)” bio-weapons program.
1.5. Pro: North Korea's largest threat, South Korea, has a superior economic and traditional military power. This leads to a necessity of having nuclear weapons.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.5.2. Pro: [Nuclear weapons capability](http://www.news.com.au/technology/why-its-so-important-for-north-korea-to-develop-nuclear-weapons/news-story/ae936c8099fdcfb137860260afcee844) is the only thing that distinguishes North Korea from South Korea, and the inter-Korean competition is profound. This is the only one in which North Korea is on top, so they’ve got to keep those weapons.
1.5.3. Pro: As of 1975, South Korea overtook North Korea in terms of per [capita GDP](http://signsofchaos.blogspot.fr/2013/05/generating-wealth-of-nations-4-real-gdp.html).
1.5.3.1. Pro: As of 2013, South Korean GDP is about [40 times bigger](https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2013/apr/08/south-korea-v-north-korea-compared) than that of North Korea.
1.5.4. Pro: In terms of [military expenditure](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/HELIX.HTM#*), South Korea exceeded North Korea in the mid-1970s, and in the late 1970s, the amount of military budget for South Korea was almost twice as much as that of North Korea.
1.5.5. Con: In terms of the size of [active-duty troops, artillery pieces, and submarines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/04/11/how-north-and-south-koreas-armed-forces-compare-infographic/#a2fdf3b828b4), North Korea has superiority over South Korea.
1.5.6. Pro: In terms of [main battle tanks, combat aircrafts, helicopters and frigates/destroyers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/04/11/how-north-and-south-koreas-armed-forces-compare-infographic/#a2fdf3b828b4), South Korea is stronger than North Korea.
1.6. Con: A shift away from nuclear weapons would reduce NK's threat to neighboring nations, and support the opening of trade and improvement of the quality of life of it's residents.
1.7. Pro: Countries which have historically given up nuclear weapons have ended up with tragic results.
1.7.1. Pro: After [Pyongyang's last nuclear test](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37321686) in January of 2016, a commentary in North Korea's media said stated that history proves powerful nuclear deterrence serves as the strongest treasured sword. The Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq and the Gaddafi regime in Libya could not escape the fate of destruction after being deprived of their foundations for nuclear development and giving up nuclear programmes of their own accord.
1.7.2. Con: [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons#cite_note-10) produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s. Despite this, South Africa has not collapsed or fallen into any security crisis.
1.7.3. Pro: [Ukraine inherited about 5,000 nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons#cite_note-10) when it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. By 1996, Ukraine had agreed to dispose of all nuclear weapons within its territory, with the condition that its borders were respected, as part of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Owing to diplomatic stance of Ukraine towards the European Union and Russia, Russia began annexation of Crimea in 2014.
1.7.4. Pro: The [collapse of Soviet Union resulted in Belarus possessing nuclear weapons](http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/belarus/) made by the USSR. But Belarus agreed to transfer all the for returning the Highly Enriched Uranium \(HEU\) to Russia once the US pledged to give financial supports to Belarus in exchange. But the US ended up imposing sanctions against Belarus because of its violent policies against political opponents.
1.7.5. Con: [Kazakhstan](http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/kazakhstan/) also inherited nuclear weapons following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In its first decade of independence, Kazakhstan dismantled and destroyed Soviet weapons systems and facilities left on its territory, and signed major international nonproliferation treaties. There have been no serious security threats even after giving up nuclear weapons.
1.8. Pro: Nuclear weapons can be a tool to unify the peninsula which can be regarded as a preemptive way to secure its national security.
1.8.1. Pro: Historically, the US held tactical nuclear weapons [in South Korea](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2017.1388656). It is likely that if conflicts escalated, these would return.
1.8.1.1. Pro: If such a war were to happen, the US will likely intimidate North Korea with nuclear weapons.
1.8.1.2. Pro: During a period of [high tension in 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/south-koreas-defense-minister-raises-the-idea-of-bringing-back-tactical-us-nuclear-weapons/2017/09/04/7a468314-9155-11e7-b9bc-b2f7903bab0d_story.html?noredirect=on), South Korea’s defense minister suggested bringing back US tactical nuclear weapons.
1.8.2. Pro: In the 1970s, some North Korean officials [thought](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/111471) that a peaceful unification of the peninsula would be impossible. If a war were to break out again, nuclear weapons would be necessary.
1.9. Pro: Nuclear weapons can stabilize the domestic political situation in North Korea.
1.9.1. Pro: Giving up nuclear weapons can result in Kim Jong-un losing support with his people.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [Andrei Lankov has mentioned](https://www.amazon.com/dp/142141094X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_YofrzbW6STHMC) that the sufferings and destitution of the last two decades in North Korea were a necessary sacrifice to protect the country from outside enemies. Surrender of nuclear weapons would render these sufferings and deaths meaningless.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: Giving up nuclear weapons does not necessarily mean that North Korea will give up fighting against its enemies. Although it would affect not the North Korean willingness but its ability, it does not make North Korea unable to attack.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Nuclear weapons [can play a role in](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html) making hard-liners loyal to Kim Jong-un and reassuring his population about protecting them from the US and its allies.
1.9.2. Pro: Daniel Twining says that [nuclear weapons function](https://www.amazon.com/dp/142141094X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_YofrzbW6STHMC) as a tool to integrate people as well as to make key groups loyal to the regime by distributing resources from the international society.
1.9.2.1. Con: Nuclear weapons are not the only way to integrate people and to allocate resources to its key groups after blackmailing the international society. Other totalitarian regimes including [Libya could do without nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament_of_Libya).
1.10. Pro: North Korea has no allies, right now or historically, that it could rely on.
1.10.1. Pro: After the Cold War, South Korea established relations with [China](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/south-koreas-ties-china-japan-and-us-defining-new-role-dangerous-neighborhood) and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93South_Korea_relations), while North Korea failed to do so with the US and Japan.
1.10.2. Pro: Having nuclear weapons can be a good diplomatic tool for North Korea to make bargains with powerful countries.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Brad Glosserman, the executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US have argued that if [North Korea](http://www.news.com.au/technology/why-its-so-important-for-north-korea-to-develop-nuclear-weapons/news-story/ae936c8099fdcfb137860260afcee844) didn’t get international assistance including food then its people would starve so it needed to basically be “public enemy number two”. This helped inspire just enough fear to keep other countries at bay but not enough for them to attack.
1.10.2.2. Pro: North Korea has been noted to use nuclear weapons as [a bargaining chip](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html) to bring the United States to the negotiation table.
1.10.2.3. Pro: North Korea can use its nuclear weapons and negotiate for materials including [food and energy sources](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-would-north-korea-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-20160110-gm2za5.html) from the international community.
1.10.3. Pro: Coming to a compromise with the United States and South Korea is not a reliable option.
1.10.3.1. Con: Since 1952 the [United States has not invaded North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations). North Korea should not, therefore, use this as a reason to justify a requirement for nuclear weapons to protect itself.
1.10.3.2. Pro: By 2002, the [United States believed North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Overview) was pursuing both uranium enrichment technology and plutonium reprocessing technologies in defiance of the Agreed Framework. North Korea reportedly told American diplomats in private that they were in possession of nuclear weapons, citing American failures to uphold their own end of the "Agreed Framework" as a motivating force.
1.10.3.3. Con: [North Korean](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/6605) officials changed their story in 2010, when they revealed to visiting U.S. nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker that they had an enrichment facility at Yongbyon with 2,000 spinning centrifuges. Hecker was permitted to visit this facility and was impressed with its sophistication.
1.10.3.4. Pro: In 2008, [six-party discussions](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron#2002) on verification, disablement, and energy assistance in Beijing ended in a stalemate due to a failure to reach agreement on verification. U.S. officials later claim that North Korea refused to agree in writing what it agreed verbally in October.
1.10.4. Pro: When the Soviet Union withdrew its nuclear weapons from Cuba, it showed Kim Jong-un that Moscow would not protect him. This led him to announce the [four military guidelines](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/NKIDP_eDossier_12_North_Korea_and_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.pdf) at the fourth-term Party Central Committee on December 1962.
1.10.5. Pro: In the [Chinese-North Korean summit on April 18 of 1975](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/south-koreas-ties-china-japan-and-us-defining-new-role-dangerous-neighborhood), Mao declined to support Kim Il-sung’s proposal to attack the South.
1.10.6. Con: North Korea and China have been keeping the [Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-North_Korean_Mutual_Aid_and_Cooperation_Friendship_Treaty) since 1961.
1.10.6.1. Pro: [The two nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-North_Korean_Mutual_Aid_and_Cooperation_Friendship_Treaty) guarantee to immediately adopt all necessary measures to oppose any country or coalition of countries that might attack either nation.
