Discussion Name: Is Putin's attack on Ukraine unjustifiable and wrong?

1. Putin's attack on Ukraine is unjustified.
1.1. Con: Putin's invasion of Ukraine will benefit Russia in the long term.
1.1.1. Con: [Putin's invasion is hurting Russian's economy,](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/03/putins-invasion-of-ukraine-could-destory-russias-economy/) therefore Russia might struggle in the long term.
1.1.2. Con: Putin's invasion has alienated him from the international community.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Western nations are [alienating Putin since the attack](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-appears-to-have-alienated-putins-few-friends-among-the-western-allies-01645735806).
1.1.2.2. Con: [China could be strengthening its ties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/how-close-are-china-and-russia-and-where-does-beijing-stand-on-ukraine) with Russia.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Many world leaders have condemned Putin's attack on Ukraine for being unprovoked and unjustified.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: US President, Joe Biden, has condemned Russia's attack and has announced [economic sanctions against Russia](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/)(Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.).
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: G7 leaders have stated that Putin has "[put himself on the wrong side of history](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/world-reaction-putin-orders-military-operation-in-ukraine)(“This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe,” the G7 leaders said in a joint statement, adding Russian President Vladimir Putin had re-introduced war to the European continent.\n\n“He has put himself on the wrong side of history,” said the leaders in the statement released by Germany.)” with the Ukraine attack.
1.1.2.3.3. Con: So far, only [Western world leaders](https://www.politico.eu/article/western-leaders-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war-munich-security-conference-nato-us-europe/) have voiced their concerns.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: Since then, many non-Western world leaders signed a UN resolution calling the actions [illegal and demaning a withdraw of all troops](https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/ga12407.doc.htm).
1.1.2.3.4. Con: [Chinese or Indian leaders](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-03/russia-ukraine-nations-that-sit-on-the-fence/100868998) haven't publicly condemned Putin' attack.
1.1.2.3.4.1. Con: Asian countries have remained neutral as they see it as not their war. Russia's main military ally is China and as such China being neutral is a bad sign for Russia.
1.1.3. Con: The anti-Russian attitude among the Ukrainians will be much higher due to the Russian aggression.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Before the annexation of Crimea most Ukrainians didn't want NATO membership, after the annexation the majority did
1.1.4. Con: Every country close to Russia will actively seek NATO membership.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The population of Finland has [shifted their opinion](https://www.businessinsider.com/finland-majority-support-joining-nato-after-russia-invades-ukraine-survey-2022-3) on NATO membership since the invasion.
1.1.5. Pro: If Russia gains control of Ukraine, i[t would benefit from Ukraine's energy and natural resources](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/28/ukraine-war-russia-resources-energy-oil-gas-commodities-agriculture/) which would increase its wealth.
1.1.6. Pro: Russia would benefit from returning ex Soviet Union satellite states under its influence, [regaining the importance in the world](https://www.history.com/news/vladimir-putin-russia-power) the Soviet Union used to hold and restoring Russian pride.
1.1.7. Con: That is a mere prediction and does not justify the attack. Everyone would benefit from resources for more land but that does not make it right to do. Furthermore, sanctions have hurt the Russian Ruble so much that is has less value than some virtual game currencies.
1.2. Pro: Putin's attack on Ukraine is targeting innocent civilians.
1.2.1. Con: [Collateral damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_damage) often happens during severe conflicts. However, it must be proportionate to the goals.
1.2.1.1. Con: If the conflict is itself unjustified, then no amount of collateral damage is proportionate since it is entirely unnecessary.
1.2.2. Con: Innocent civilians are unfortunately a common victim of war. Whether or not they are involved has no bearing on whether the war is justifiable or not.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Death and the destruction of [schools and hospitals](https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/six-grave-violations/attacks-against-schools/) tend to be the results of any war. Following this logic, all wars are unjustified.
1.2.2.2. Con: While innocent victims are often unfortunate collateral, Russia is [actively targeting civilians](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/04/ukraine-russias-cruel-siege-warfare-tactics-unlawfully-killing-civilians-new-testimony-and-investigation/). The egregiousness of this act negates whatever justification preceded it.
1.2.3. Pro: Russian forces have committed war crimes by [intentionally targeting civilians](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113782). This is unjustifiable.
1.2.4. Con: Russia is engaging in peace talks with Ukraine, showing a degree of good faith and commitment to mitigating the violence.
1.2.4.1. Con: As of April 2022, peace talks have been [half-hearted](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-peace-talks-not-ready-leaders-meeting-chief-negotiator-2022-04-03/) as Putin is refusing to meet Zelensky in person.
1.2.4.2. Con: While peace talks have been going on, Russia has committed [genocide](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60987350) against Ukrainians, demonstrating a total absence of good faith.
1.2.4.3. Con: Russia is using peace talks as a [smokescreen](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-parliament-russia-skepticism/index.html) while its forces re-strategize.
1.2.4.4. Pro: In March 2022, Russia said it would scale back its attacks near Kyiv in order to [build trust](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/peace-talks-ukraine-russia-ceasefire_uk_622f6984e4b02961583ef199) in peace talk negotiations.
1.2.5. Pro: The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine corroborated [7,061 civilian casualties](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2022/5/10/russia-ukraine-war-civilian-death-toll-un), with 3,381 killed and 3,680 injured as of May 2022.
1.2.6. Pro: The UN claims that the high number of civilian casualties and the extent of destruction and damage to civilian objects [suggest that the Russians are attacking indiscriminately and disproportionately](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2022/5/10/russia-ukraine-war-civilian-death-toll-un).
1.2.7. Con: Many civilians in Ukraine have [taken up arms](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-60546011) to fight against the Russian invasion, making it difficult to distinguish who is a legitimate military target from Russia's perspective.
1.2.7.1. Pro: When the invasion began, the Ukrainian government handed out [thousands of weapons](https://www.vox.com/2022/2/26/22952073/ukraine-civilian-volunteers-kyiv-war-effort) to volunteers.
1.2.7.2. Con: Any Ukrainian, even with fire weapons, is an innocent person, as they are defending their nation.
1.2.8. Con: NATO members have also intentionally targeted innocent civilians in war, lessening the moral impact of Russia's own anti-civilian actions.
1.2.8.1. Pro: The allied forces in world war 2 [targeted civilian cities](https://intelligencesquared.com/events/bomber-command/).
1.2.8.2. Pro: The US has [targeted civilian cities with nuclear weapons](https://cnduk.org/hiroshima-the-truth-about-the-bombing/).
1.2.8.3. Con: Two wrongs do not make a right, and existing historical actions do not give justification for repeating the mistakes of the past.
1.2.8.3.1. Con: It's not about "an existing historical action", it's about a precedent for a very specific action. And its not about a "mistake of the past", it's about an intentional action. Its not about having or not having a "justification", its about no more need justification because the precedent cancels the rule.
1.2.8.4. Con: It is irrelevant whether NATO has targeted innocent civilians in the past because it is inherently wrong to target innocent civilians: it is not contingent on the wrongdoing of other parties.
1.2.9. Con: In an exposé published by Newsweek, [“Putin's Holding Back](https://www.newsweek.com/putins-bombers-could-devastate-ukraine-hes-holding-back-heres-why-1690494), analysts and advisers working for the Pentagon -- became unlikely whistleblowers. The interviewees, many of whom were military officers and had to remain anonymous in order to be as truthful as possible, all were surprised at how little civilian loss there was on the part of the Russian military. Said one adviser: “I'm frustrated by the current narrative — that Russia is intentionally targeting civilians," calling that view "distorted."
1.2.10. Con: By March 2022, [males 18-60 years of age were not permitted to leave Ukrainian borders](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-24-22-intl/h_4309a4916d57670f85519210a07fb2c9) and apparently required to report to military recruitment offices. Such conscription leads to the targeting of innocent civilians who otherwise would not wish to be in the firing line.
1.3. Con: Putin is supporting the people of Donbas's [right to self-determination](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-donbas-independence-ukraine-tensions/31714654.html), by upholding their vote to become an [independent country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Donbas_status_referendums).
1.3.1. Pro: Putin [claimed his motivation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/full-transcript-vladimir-putin-s-televised-address-to-russia-on-ukraine-feb-24#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20our%20plan%20to%C2%A0occupy%20the%C2%A0Ukrainian%20territory) is not to plan to occupy or annex the Ukrainian territory. Instead he claims to [support independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_Donetsk_People%27s_Republic_and_the_Luhansk_People%27s_Republic#States_formally_recognizing_the_Donetsk_PR_and_the_Luhansk_PR_as_independent) for the [Donetsk People’s Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic) and the [Lugansk People’s Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_People%27s_Republic).
1.3.1.1. Con: Russia is working to subversively integrate Donbas into the Russian federation just short of full annexation.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The freedom in the world 2022 report found that Russia’s policies towards Donbas focused on political “integration,” amounting in practice to [Russification and creeping annexation](https://freedomhouse.org/country/eastern-donbas/freedom-world/2022) more than ever before.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Russia has [issued more than half a million passports](https://freedomhouse.org/country/eastern-donbas/freedom-world/2022) to Ukrainian nationals residing in the occupied areas, and invited them to vote in Russia’s tightly controlled parliamentary elections in September.
1.3.1.2. Con: [The Sevastopol Naval base predates Ukrainian independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol_Naval_Base). This naval base has continued to be run by Russia for the whole duration of Ukrainian independence, therefore Russia has never intended Ukraine to be neutral.
1.3.2. Pro: The [Donbas status referendums](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Donbas_status_referendums) produced 87% and 96% votes for succession, with 75% voter turnout.
1.3.2.1. Con: The referendum broke local and international legal statures.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The Ukrainian constitution requires that any changes to the territory of Ukraine be approved by a [referendum of all of the Ukrainian people](https://www.cfr.org/interview/why-crimean-referendum-illegitimate).
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: It is reasonable for a vote for a succession to only be put to the region wishing to secede. There are no examples of a wider country voting to remove part of its territory.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: International law does not recognize a right of secession by a group or region in a country [unless the region has been denied a right to "internal self determination"](https://www.cfr.org/interview/why-crimean-referendum-illegitimate) \(i.e., its right to pursue its own political, economic, social, and cultural development\) by the central government, or has been subject to grave human rights violations by the central government. This did not occur in Crimea.
1.3.2.2. Con: The Russian backed pro-sepratists created an environment where voting against them was dangerous.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Two official electoral commissioners were [kidnapped by separatists](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/10/putin-s-people-stage-their-bogus-vote.html) prior to the vote.
1.3.2.3. Con: The referendums were of [low quality \(unlike in Krim\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Donbas_status_referendums#Referendum_in_Donetsk_Oblast)(Many of the voters were not on the registration lists but were allowed to vote after showing identification documents. A CNN crew saw several people vote twice at one polling station... BBC filmed a woman putting two ballot papers into the same box...Reporters with German newspaper Bild followed a man that they said voted eight times.) which could explain such a high voting for succession.
1.3.3. Con: In January 2022 Donbas surveys, 52% of the respondents, regardless of whether they lived in either government- or non-government-controlled areas of the Donbas, agreed that it [does not matter where they live, whether in Russia or Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/17/russia-wants-recognize-independence-two-eastern-ukraine-republics-what-do-people-there-think/).
1.3.4. Con: It is not for Russia to decide whether a territory outside of its jurisdiction should be independent. Involving itself in the domestic affairs of Ukraine is therefore unjustified.
1.3.5. Con: [Thousands of people from The Donetsk and Luhansk regions have been forcibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_filtration_camps) deported to Russia where they will not live under a Donetsk or Luhansk government.
1.3.6. Con: Many leaders of the Donbas militants were actual or former Russian citizens, servicemen of the Russian military/intelligence, members of Russian political organizations: [Igor "Strelkov" Girkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Girkin)(... is a Russian army veteran and former Federal Security Service \(FSB\) officer ...), [Pavel Gubarev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Gubarev)(In earlier years Gubarev was a member of the neo-Nazi Russian National Unity paramilitary group.), [Igor Bezler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Bezler)(The Security Service of Ukraine \(SBU\) claims that until 2002 he served in detachments of the Russian General Staff GRU retiring as a lieutenant colonel.\[9\] In 2002 Bezler moved to Ukraine.), [Arsen "Motorola" Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsen_Pavlov)(A Russian citizen,\[2\] Pavlov was born in Ukhta, Komi ASSR. His father came from Tver Oblast, his mother was a native of the Komi ASSR. He lived in Rostov-on-Don and spent some time in the Russian marines.), [Alexander Borodai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Borodai).
1.3.7. Pro: The people of the Donetsk Peoples Republic and Lugansk Peoples Republic made a [formal request for military assistance](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-crisis/separatist-leaders-in-eastern-ukraine-seek-russia-s-help-to-repel-ukrainian-army-kremlin/2511815#) from Russia, which they had every right to do. And [Russia had a duty to stop a humanitarian crisis](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/05/20/war-in-eastern-ukraine-looks-a-lot-different-in-person-than-it-does-on-cnn/).
1.3.7.1. Pro: [The Russian intervention in February came after 8 years of Kiev targeting civilians](https://www.struggle-la-lucha.org/2022/08/02/ukraine-and-russia-without-the-lens-of-facebook-corporate-media/) with military artillery and air craft in 2014, then the ongoing occupation and war and war crimes with increased bombings by Kiev on February 22nd with their 100,000 troops ready to commit genocide.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Putin [claims](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/full-transcript-vladimir-putin-s-televised-address-to-russia-on-ukraine-feb-24) that Donbass has been facing a genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime for eight years.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: Russia's Investigative Committee opened a criminal case over [mass graves of over 300 civilians](https://tass.com/world/1405755) on the territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, who according to the Russian ambassador to the USA were "[killed only because they considered Russian as their native language](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/9/smells-of-genocide-how-putin-justifies-russias-war-in-ukraine#:~:text=How%20else%20can%20one%20interpret%20the%20shelling%20of%20residential%20areas%20by%20Ukrainian%20Armed%20Forces%20using%20multiple%20rocket%20launchers%20or%20the%20discovered%20mass%20grave%20sites%20of%20almost%20300%20civilians%20near%20Lugansk%2C%20who%20were%20killed%20only%20because%20they%20considered%20Russian%20as%20their%20native%20language%3F)".
1.3.7.1.1.2. Con: Russia has "[not provided any credible proof](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/9/smells-of-genocide-how-putin-justifies-russias-war-in-ukraine#:~:text=Russia%20has%20not%20provided%20any%20credible%20proof%20to%20support%20its%20claim) to support its claim" according to Alexander Hinton, director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Con: The number of civilian casualties has plummeted without Russian intervention. [Since its 2014 peak of 2084, down to just 18 civilians in 2021](https://ukraine.un.org/en/151093-conflict-related-civilian-casualties-ukraine-8-october-2021). Therefore, there is no evidence Russian presence is needed in Donbass to further reduce civilian casualties.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: The azov Battalion has committed [war crimes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/1/who-are-the-azov-regiment).
1.3.7.1.2.1. Con: Azov [mostly consists of Russian-speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Regiment#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20unit%20members%20are%20Russian%20speakers%20and%20come%20from%20the%20Russian%2Dspeaking%20regions%20of%20Ukraine.%20It%20also%20includes%20members%20from%20other%20countries.%5B11%5D%5B25%5D) and east-Ukrainians.
1.3.7.1.2.2. Pro: The Azov battalion has been accused of using [human shields in Mariupol](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-accuses-kyivs-azov-battalion-of-using-150-civilians-as-human-shield-in-mariupol-articleshow.html).
1.3.7.1.2.3. Pro: A [2016 UN report](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_13th_HRMMU_Report_3March2016.pdf) accused the Azov regiment of violating international humanitarian law, embedding their weapons and forces in used civilian buildings, displacing residents after looting civilian properties, and raping and torturing detainees in the Donbas region.
1.4. Pro: Putin's attack is in violation of international agreements and consensus
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.4.2. Pro: The invasion of Ukraine violates [the Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances), an agreement that guarantees sovereignty of Ukraine in it's post-1991 borders. It was signed by the Russian Federation, among others.
1.4.3. Con: The US already create a precedent for attacking another country without any UN resolution [after the events of 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._government_response_to_the_September_11_attacks).
1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.8.3.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The US led invasion of Iraq was [illegal according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Iraq_War).
1.4.4. Con: Because several of Russia's political rivals have seats on the UN Security Council, it is unlikely any explicitly pro-Russian resolution would be able to pass. In this specific instance, a lack of UN resolution means little.
1.4.4.1. Con: It's not just the Security Council condemning the invasion, the UN General Assembly [voted 141-5](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/3/un-general-assembly-demands-russia-withdraw-troops-from-ukraine) for Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine with most of Russia's allies abstaining rather than voting against.
1.4.5. Pro: The [UN General Assembly resolution](https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/ga12407.doc.htm)(...Deploring in the strongest terms its aggression against Ukraine in violation of the Charter of the United Nations, the Assembly also demanded the Russian Federation immediately and unconditionally reverse its 21 February decision related to the status of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe Assembly demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its unlawful use of force against Ukraine...) states that the Russian aggression against Ukraine violates the Charter of the United Nations.
1.5. Pro: Unilaterally attacking another country is always unjustified.
1.5.1. Pro: Wars are always worse than initially expected and lead to terrible human suffering.
1.5.1.1. Con: That wars are worse than initially expected does not justify the claim that attacking other countries is always wrong.
1.5.2. Pro: The Russian army has entered territory of Ukraine without the permission of its government.
1.5.2.1. Con: The lack of permission doesn't make the attack unjustified per se. For example, it can be justified if it aims to prevent crimes of the attacked country's government.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: There are established definitions for what constitutes a "[Just War](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/just/cause_1.shtml)".
1.5.2.2. Con: When [Russian troops have invaded Syria on Assad's invitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_involvement_in_the_Syrian_civil_war#Military_support_for_the_Assad_government)(\<russian media reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had asked for Russia to intervene by providing military assistance.), the invasion is still not justified. So, in general I think, that invitation is not an argument to justify invasion in general.
1.5.3. Con: A part of the human population thinks the attack on Ukraine is right.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Several surveys found that around [60% of Russians supported](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/03/17/what-do-ordinary-russians-really-think-about-the-war-in-ukraine/) a special military action, both before and after the invasion.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Russians have reduced access to accurate information due [to state censorship](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/4/russia-restricts-access-to-several-western-media-websites).
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Russian government actively blocks access to independent media from inside Russia \([Facebook and Twitter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-completely-blocks-access-to-facebook-and-twitter); [BBC, Deutsche Welle and Meduza](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220304-russia-says-limiting-sites-of-bbc-deutsche-welle-meduza)\). Therefore, opinions of the Russian population can be manipulated by the one-sided perspective of state media.
1.5.3.2. Con: Putin's approval rate in Russia does not necessarily indicate Putin's approval rate among the human population as a whole.
1.5.3.3. Con: The protests that broke out across Russia almost immediately illustrate the people's [disagreement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/25/russians-greet-vladimir-putins-war-in-ukraine-with-dismay-not-enthusiasm) with Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
1.5.3.4. Pro: A carter centre poll found that [75%](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3174934/ukraine-war-most-chinese-believe-backing-russia-their-national) of the chinese public support Russia in Ukraine due to it being in China’s national interest.
1.5.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.5.3.6. Con: [141 countries did not agree with it in the UN Assembly vote](https://www.axios.com/2022/03/02/united-nations-ukraine-russia-141), which shows that there's a high consensus of disagreement against Russian's attack.
1.5.3.7. Con: The apparent increase in Putin's approval rating may not be caused by the invasion of Ukraine. The "part of the human population" may still think the invasion is wrong, but like Putin for other reasons.
1.5.3.7.1. Con: Surveys asking [specifically about the invasion/special operation](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/03/17/what-do-ordinary-russians-really-think-about-the-war-in-ukraine/) also show a positive approval rating.
1.5.4. Con: War can be justified when the alternative would be worse \(like a genocide for example\)
1.6. Pro: Putin's conditions\[[1](https://tass.com/politics/1409189)(I made the decision to hold a special military operation. Its goal is to protect the people that are subjected to abuse, genocide from the Kiev regime for eight years, and to this end we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine and put to justice those that committed numerous bloody crimes against peaceful people, including Russian nationals)\]\[[2](https://tass.ru/politika/13380415)(So NATO needs to collect the belongings and go to the borders of 1997)\] are inadequate.
1.7. Con: NATO broke anti-expansionism promises by spreading East, threatening Russian safety.
1.7.1. Con: In 1997 NATO and Russia signed the [NATO-Russia Founding Act](https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/eur/fs_nato_whitehouse.html), where it was made clear that NATO and Russia were not enemies.
1.7.2. Con: NATO's strategic vision and USA's strategic doctrines changed [dramatically after 1991](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/4/pdf/2003-NATO-Russia_en.pdf). The assumption of Russian collaboration and friendship allowed USA [to shift military resources away from Europe](https://theconversation.com/the-us-military-presence-in-europe-has-been-declining-for-30-years-the-current-crisis-in-ukraine-may-reverse-that-trend-175595), and it allowed European countries to cut military budgets.
1.7.3. Con: Russia is [expansionist by spreading West](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-general-says-ukraine-war-goal-conquer-east-south-2022-4), threatening NATO's safety.
1.7.4. Pro: In 2008 Putin made it very clear and public that NATO in Georgia and Ukraine is never going to happen and has [declared it to be a red line](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/04/nato.russia) \(in a same way as US would never allow a Russian invasion on Cuba following the [Monroe Doctrine](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/monroe-doctrine#:~:text=The%20Monroe%20Doctrine%20is%20the,further%20colonization%20or%20puppet%20monarchs.)\).
1.7.4.1. Pro: Putin has [warned several times](https://theconversation.com/amp/ukraine-war-follows-decades-of-warnings-that-nato-expansion-into-eastern-europe-could-provoke-russia-177999#:~:text=Putin%20has%20been%20clear%20for%20many%20years%20that%20if%20continued%2C%20the%20expansion%20would%20likely%20be%20met%20with%20serious%20resistance%20by%20the%20Russians%2C%20even%20with%20military%20action.) that weaponizing Ukraine and the training of their army cannot be tolerated and that Russia would prefer a NATO-free, neutral Ukraine that would respect the autonomy of the Donbass and Secession of Crimea.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.7.4.1.2. Pro: This is Putin's view since 2014 which has been [reflected in parts in the Minsk-II agreement](https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/frustrated-refusals-give-russia-security-guarantees-implement-minsk-2-putin-recognizes-pseudo#:~:text=More%20than%20anything%20else%2C%20it%20was%20the%20refusal%20of%20Ukraine%20to%20implement%20the%20provisions%20of%20Minsk%202%20%E2%80%93%20especially%20the%20provision%20that%20would%20give%20the%20predominantly%20Russian%2Dspeaking%20regions%20a%20special%20constitutional%20status%20%E2%80%93%20that%20caused%20Russia%20to%20threaten%20military%20action%20against%20Ukraine.) and which Kiev has breached several times and is refusing to implement.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: All parties involved \(Ukraine, Russia, LPR, DPR\) have failed to uphold the [Minsk and/or Minsk-I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements#Minsk_II,_February_2015)I agreements. Alexander Zakharchenko of the DPR was the first to [openly break the Minsk II agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Debaltseve).
1.7.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The full scale invasion of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions by The Russia Federation with heavy weaponry, is evidence of [Putin's complete disregard of the Minsk-II agreement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/9/what-is-the-minsk-agreement-and-why-is-it-relevant-now).
1.7.4.2. Con: This is not evidence that "NATO broke anti-expansionist promises". It's just evidence that Putin wouldn't be happy if they were accepted in NATO, should that ever happen.
1.7.4.3. Con: An invasion of Cuba is not a like-for-like comparison with accepting a country's application to a defensive alliance.
1.7.5. Con: There were no promises made by NATO to Russia regarding NATO accepting new members. Russia, on the other hand, has signed [the Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances), which guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty.
1.7.6. Pro: Several western leaders made [assurances](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-gorbachev-heard-western-leaders-early) about NATO expansionalism moving "not one inch eastward".
1.7.6.1. Con: Russia broke expansionism promises by annexing Crimea, after Ukraine agreed to denuclearize.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: Russia claims the 2014 Crimea succession and annexation was legal.
1.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: Polls before and after the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in the Black Sea show [locals support the annexation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/).
1.7.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: In February 2015, [a poll by German polling firm GfK](http://www.gfk.com/ua/Documents/Presentations/GFK_report_FreeCrimea.pdf) asked Crimeans “Do you endorse Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”. 82% of the respondents answered “yes, definitely,” and another 11% answered “yes, for the most part.” Only 2% said they didn't know, and another 2% said no.
1.7.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: In June 2014, [a Gallup poll with the Broadcasting Board of Governors](http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/Ukraine-slide-deck.pdf) asked Crimeans if the results in the March 16, 2014 referendum to secede reflected the views of the people. A total of 82.8% of Crimeans said yes.
1.7.6.1.1.2. Con: The Crimea-case being an [illegal annexation](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/seven-years-russia%E2%80%99s-illegal-annexation-crimea_en) or a legal secession is still highly disputed and there is no international body that can clarify this dispute once and forever.
1.7.6.1.1.3. Pro: The [Crimean status referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_status_referendum) of 2014 produced a 97% vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83 percent voter turnout.
1.7.6.1.1.3.1. Con: [Most countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_status_referendum#cite_note-Svyatets-155), the EU, NATO, and the [UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum) declared the referendum invalid.
1.7.6.1.1.3.2. Con: Russian forces and voting procedures created pressure to vote for the reunification.
1.7.6.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The final date and ballot choices were set only [ten days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_status_referendum#:~:text=The%20final%20date%20and%20ballot%20choices%20were%20set%20only%20ten%20days%20before%20the%20plebiscite%20was%20held) before the referendum was held, not giving enough time for voters.
1.7.6.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: The voting boxes were transparent and the ballots were not placed in envelopes in such a way as to [make the marked ballots visible](http://mashable.com/2014/03/16/crimea-votes-the-day-in-pictures/) through the box walls.
1.7.6.1.1.3.3. Pro: There were [foreign independent observers](https://www.quora.com/Were-any-international-observers-invited-for-referendum-in-Crimea/answer/Elias-Azrak-1?ch=15&oid=57243319&share=b14e9d33&srid=VJrV&target_type=answer) from many different countries who did not report any issues with the referendum.
1.7.6.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Oversight bodies such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe \(OSCE\) were not included for oversight.
1.7.6.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: On March 10, 2014 the de facto Prime Minister of Crimea [invited the OSCE to monitor the referendum](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-referendum-osce-idUSL6N0M73AP20140310), but they refused.
1.7.6.1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: An OSCE spokeswoman said that Crimea did not have the authority to invite the organization into the region as [only fully-fledged OSCE members can request services](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-referendum-osce-idUSL6N0M73AP20140310).
1.7.6.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: On March 15, Mikhail Malyshev, head of the commission for holding a referendum in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, announced that [135 foreign observers and 1,240 representatives of local organizations](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140928/http://mir24.tv/news/politics/10075643) would monitor the voting process.
1.7.6.1.1.3.3.3. Con: The Russian government invited individuals belonging to European [far-right, anti-semitic and neo-Nazi parties](https://newrepublic.com/article/117048/crimean-referendum-was-electoral-farce) to serve as observers, who may be biased.
1.7.6.1.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.7.6.1.1.3.5. Con: The results were falsified.
1.7.6.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: Russia’s own official Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights reviewed the vote and said [turnout was no more than 30 percent of the electorate and only half of those who voted chose secession](https://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-people-stage-their-bogus-vote#:~:text=This%20week%2C%20Russia%E2%80%99s%20official%20Presidential%20Council%20on%20Civil%20Society%20and%20Human%20Rights%20suggested%20that%20the%20real%20numbers%20in%20Crimea%E2%80%99s%20plebiscite%20fell%20far%20short).
1.7.6.2. Con: According to a 2014 [Interview with Mikhail Gorbachev](https://www.rbth.com/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html)(M.G.: The topic of “NATO expansion” was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a singe Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either.), there was no formal or informal promise that NATO should not expand eastwards.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: This transcript only shows Gorbachev clarifying that the 1990 conversations with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker talked about "making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance" as opposed to general expansion of NATO. He explicitly acknowledges the interviewers quote "NATO will not move one inch further east" but puts it in context by saying "Baker’s statement, mentioned in your question, was made in that \[military\] context".
1.7.6.3. Pro: The German publication Der Spiegel [researched the question](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html)(After speaking with many of those involved and examining previously classified British and German documents in detail, SPIEGEL has concluded that there was no doubt that the West did everything it could to give the Soviets the impression that NATO membership was out of the question for countries like Poland, Hungary or Czechoslovakia.) whether there is evidence for Russia's claim about Western promises and found there to be ample reason for Russians to believe NATO wouldn't expand eastward.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: This is an example of the [appeal to authority](https://www.softschools.com/examples/fallacies/appeal_to_authority_examples/430/#:~:text=Appeal%20to%20authority%20is%20a,%22authority%22%20on%20the%20subject.) logical fallacy, with a potentially biased authority source.
1.7.6.4. Pro: A Feb 9th 1990 declassified record of a [conversation](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/16117-document-06-record-conversation-between) between US secretary of state James Baker and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev includes three assurances that if Germany were allowed to unify in NATO then NATO would not expand to the East.
1.7.6.4.1. Con: A declassified conversation from the negotiation stages does not override the final signed agreement of the same event.
1.7.6.5. Pro: A declassified cable from Feb 1st 1990 shows West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, proposed that [NATO would not expand to the East](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/16112-document-01-u-s-embassy-bonn-confidential-cable), and that the former territory of the GDR in a unified Germany would be treated differently from other NATO territory.
1.7.6.6. Con: No official treaty or agreement puts this in writing, and it was [not on the official agenda](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/115204.htm#myths) according to NATO.
1.7.6.6.1. Pro: There are no documented promises to stop expanding NATO to the east.
1.7.7. Pro: Since 1991, Nato has absorbed [10 eastern European countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_NATO#:~:text=The%20incorporation%20of%20former%20Eastern,2022%20Russian%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine.) including three former Soviet republics.
1.7.7.1. Con: NATO is not a country. NATO can't "absorb" nor conquer other countries. NATO is a defensive pact. [For NATO having small and fragile countries entering in the alliance is a cost](https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/it-is-long-past-time-to-stop-expanding-nato/), not a benefit. This is one of the reasons why the so called "expansion" of NATO in eastern Europe was rejected by USA and European countries for almost two decades.
1.7.7.1.1. Pro: The entrance of, for example, the Baltic states in the NATO was a [diplomatic success](https://upnorth.eu/task-securing-freedom-baltics-not-ambassador-daniel-fried/) of those countries that, after 2 decades, convinced NATO to accept them.
1.7.8. Pro: Russia felt militarily threatened by NATO.
1.7.8.1. Con: From 1991 NATO European countries economically [tied themselves](https://www.marshallcenter.org/de/node/1276) to Russia and [Russian-friendly political party](https://ecfr.eu/article/commentary_putins_friends_in_europe7153/) and even governments spread across Europe. This is evidence that NATO didn't see Russia as an enemy and didn't plan any military action against Russia.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: Economic actions of individual sovereign states don't indicate whether multinational organisations like NATO see Russia as an enemy, because economic decisions are made separately to military ones.
1.7.8.1.2. Con: The economic ties referenced are for natural gas, which occured due to necessity instead of political/military reasons.
1.7.8.1.2.1. Pro: Europe is in a gas crisis, with 2021 prices almost [five times the level they were in 2022 and 20% of EU energy coming from gas](https://ig.ft.com/europes-gas-crisis-pipelines-explainer/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20UK's%20gas,from%20the%20Netherlands%20and%20Belgium.). This created a dependency on Russian gas.
1.7.8.2. Con: Offensive capabilities cannot be faked. Until 2014 there were [no offensive capabilities in Europe](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/military-size-by-country) that could [threaten Russia whatsoever](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/europe/military-cuts-render-nato-less-formidable-as-deterrent-to-russia.html). [Even today \(2022\)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/02/nato-baltic-states-sea-russia-military-defense/), even after two invasions of Ukraine from Russia, Europe still doesn't have threatening military capabilities, nor offensive doctrines.
1.7.8.2.1. Con: Europe does have threatening military capabilities, including roughly [17 battalions](https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/03/13/new-nato-russia-military-balance-implications-for-european-security-pub-68222#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20Baltic%20states%E2%80%99%20forces%20and%20other%20NATO%20forces%20available%20on%20a%20D%2DDay%20for%20an%20initial%20forward%20defense%20of%20Baltic%20territory%20total%20roughly%20seventeen%20battalions) which could be used offensively.
1.7.8.2.2. Con: America’s withdrawal from the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/INFtreaty) in 2019 indicates they intend to deploy [land-based intermediate- and short-range missiles](https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/why-intermediate-range-missiles-are-a-focal-point-in-the-ukraine-crisis/) in areas allowing them to reach Russian territory.
1.7.8.2.3. Pro: The US and NATO have focussed on installing [missile defense systems](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/352-missile-defenses-eastern-europe-who-threatens-whom), instead of offensive capabilities.
1.7.8.2.3.1. Con: Russian spokesmen [claim](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/352-missile-defenses-eastern-europe-who-threatens-whom#:~:text=scenarios%20advanced%20by%20Russian%20spokesmen%20as%20to%20why%20these%20defenses%20allegedly%20threaten%20Russia.) these defenses threaten Russia by removing Russia's ability to launch retaliatory strikes, making Russia more vulnerable to other offensive attacks.
1.7.8.3. Con: Russia is a nuclear power, so there is no risk of NATO aggression against Russia.
1.7.8.3.1. Pro: When it comes to action involving Russia, NATO is only able to do anything cohesively through defensive situations because of Russia's nuclear armament, posing no real threat to Russia unless it continues to expand.
1.7.8.3.2. Con: The implicit threat wielded by a nuclear power acts as a deterrent, but does not preclude aggression by other parties.
1.7.8.3.2.1. Pro: Other nuclear states such as [India and Pakistan](https://www.gakushuin.ac.jp/~881791/hoodbhoy/Deterrence.html) have received aggression from other parties.
1.7.8.3.3. Con: NATO is also a [nuclear power](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50068.htm), with access to [100](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_sharing) nuclear weapons.
1.7.8.3.4. Con: NATO includes the only power who has [used nuclear weapons against civilians in war](https://www.atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/med/med_chp10.html) \(the United States\) demonstrating at least one member is willing to employ the nuclear deterrent against Russia in retaliation of any strike.
1.7.8.4. Pro: One of NATO's [founding goals](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/nato) was to combat the Soviets.
1.7.8.4.1. Con: NATO was founded in 1949. Much has changed in the geopolitical arena since then, making some of its founding goals less relevant today.
1.7.8.4.1.1. Pro: The [Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/collapse-soviet-union), rendering NATO's anti-Soviet founding goal redundant.
1.7.8.4.1.2. Con: If NATO thought its founding goals were irrelevant today, it would have been disbanded.
1.7.8.4.1.2.1. Pro: NATO membership is [very expensive](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nato-spending-by-country)(During the 2014 summit, all NATO members agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDPs on defense by 2025. In 2017, only four nations met the threshold: The United States \(3.6%\), Greece \(2.4%\), the United Kingdom \(2.1%\), and Poland \(2.0%\). However, by 2021, ten countries were meeting the percentage target.) as it requires members to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence. Member states must therefore carefully weigh whether it's worth the expenditure.
1.7.8.5. Pro: Putin claims an "attack on Crimea was being prepared" and "The \[NATO\] alliance began [military development of the territories adjacent to us](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/9/putin-marks-russias-victory-day-as-war-continues-in-ukraine)”, calling the fighting “inevitable”.
1.7.8.5.1. Pro: NATO’s [Enhanced Forward Presence](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_136388.htm) has since 2017 included battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.
1.7.8.6. Con: Between 2012 and 2015 [Russia granted access](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2012/03/14/lavrov-backs-nato-using-ulyanovsk-base-a13280) for NATO to use Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport to transport supplies and troops to Afghanistan. The Russian people would have openly opposed the presence of NATO troops and equipment in their country, if they considered NATO a threat.
1.7.8.7. Pro: In the last 20 years U.S.-led NATO military presence has nearly doubled.
1.7.8.7.1. Con: The Iraq war was a coalition led by the US, and [did not involve NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#:~:text=20%5D%5B21%5D-,Belligerents,-Invasion%20phase%20\(2003).
1.7.8.7.1.1. Pro: NATO involvement with Iraq is limited to the [NATO Mission Iraq \(NMI\)](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_166936.htm), which is a non-combat advisory and capacity-building mission at the request of the Iraq government.
1.7.8.7.2. Con: It reported that [as few as 489 and as many as 528](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Civilian_casualties_during_Operation_Allied_Force) civilians were killed in the NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia according to the [Humans Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/Natbm200-01.htm). This number of civilian casualties is [lower than any other conflict involving modern mass airpower](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Civilian_casualties_during_Operation_Allied_Force#cite_note-4:~:text=Statistically%20speaking%2C%20civilian%20casualties%20were%20lighter%20than%20any%20other%20conflict%20involving%20modern%20mass%20airpower.%5B4%5D).
1.7.8.7.3. Pro: Between 2014 and 2022, the Nato Response Force \(NRF\), which is designed to provide a rapid military response in a crisis, has [grown from 13,000 to 40,000](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nato-troops-russia-ukraine-estonia-map-b2031894.html).
1.7.8.7.4. Pro: The Arab Organisation for Human Rights together with the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights says there is evidence that war crimes and human rights violations were committed [by NATO forces in Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya#cite_note-226:~:text=In%20January%202012%2C%20the%20Arab%20Organization%20for%20Human%20Rights%2C%20Palestinian%20Centre%20for%20Human%20Rights%20and%20the%20International%20Legal%20Assistance%20Consortium%20published%20a%20report%20describing%20alleged%20human%20rights%20violations%20and%20accusing%20NATO%20of%20war%20crimes.%5B226%5D).
1.7.8.7.4.1. Con: Reports by [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/05/13/unacknowledged-deaths/civilian-casualties-natos-air-campaign-libya) found only 72 civilian deaths, which was "low given the extent of the bombing and duration of the campaign".
1.7.8.7.5. Con: Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 US troop numbers in Europe have [continuously fallen from over 300,000 to 63,000](https://theconversation.com/the-us-military-presence-in-europe-has-been-declining-for-30-years-the-current-crisis-in-ukraine-may-reverse-that-trend-175595#:~:text=was%20central%20to,the%20late%201950s), indicating no intention for the US to attack.
1.7.8.7.6. Pro: Since the [dissolving of the Warsaw pact in 1990](https://www.nato.int/cps/us/natohq/declassified_138294.htm), NATO has bombed 10,000 homes in Yugoslavia, and as acknowledged by [Madeleine Albright, killed 500,000 children in its war in Iraq](https://www.newsweek.com/watch-madeleine-albright-saying-iraqi-kids-deaths-worth-it-resurfaces-1691193).
1.7.8.7.7. Pro: NATO led-military operations have destroyed nations, [such as Libya](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/20/nato-killed-civilians-in-libya-its-time-to-admit-it/), which shows that NATO is a dangerous and belligerent alliance.
1.8. Con: Russia claims to be protecting Russian civilians against war crimes by Western supported far-right nationalists and Neo-nazis.
1.8.1. Pro: There is a large ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking population in Donbas.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Around 39% of the Donbas region are [ethnic Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas#:~:text=Ethnic%20Russians%20form%20the%20largest%20minority%2C%20accounting%20for%2039%25%20and%2038.2%25%20of%20the%20two%20oblasts%20respectively).
1.8.1.2. Pro: Russian is the [main language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202001%20census%2C%20Russian%20is%20the%20main%20language%20of) of 70-75% of residents.
1.8.1.3. Con: [Article 4 of Ukraine's constitution](https://rm.coe.int/constitution-of-ukraine/168071f58b) states: "there is only one citizenship in Ukraine". Any Russian civilian who is granted Ukrainian citizenship is required to [renounce their non-Ukrainian citizenship\(s\) within two years](https://dmsu.gov.ua/en-home/services/acquisition-of-ukrainian-citizenship.html).
1.8.1.4. Con: Ethnicity and language do not translate automatically into territorial control of a country. It would be absurd in other situations, like towns in Mallorca that are populated by large German populations. It would be absurd to expect parts of Mallorca to be ceded from Spain to Germany on that basis.
1.8.2. Con: In 2014 Amnesty International reported that summary killings and atrocities are being committed by both sides, but also said that Russian media reporting was "[hugely exaggerated](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/10/eastern-ukraine-conflict-summary-killings-misrecorded-and-misreported/)".
1.8.3. Pro: Putin [claims](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/full-transcript-vladimir-putin-s-televised-address-to-russia-on-ukraine-feb-24) the far-right/nazis in Ukraine will "never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for freely making a choice to reunite with Russia" and will "undoubtedly try to bring war to Crimea just as they have done in Donbass".
1.8.3.1. Con: Putin's claim only illustrates his stance and doesn't provide evidence that Russia is indeed protecting its civilians against neo-nazi
1.8.3.2. Con: Since the [Crimean referendum was illegal and illegitimate](https://www.cfr.org/interview/why-crimean-referendum-illegitimate), there's no way of knowing if Crimea really wanted to belong to Russia.
1.8.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.6.1.1.1.
1.8.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.6.1.1.2.
1.8.3.2.3. Con: We really should respect the voting of Crimea people. We still may discuss, how free this voting has been, but we cannot ignore that the voting has happened and that it has supported the secession. Polls after the voting have confirmed it and when you vote today whether Crimea want to go back to Ukraine I bet the votes for secession would have increased even more.
1.8.3.2.4. Con: Currently it is not even clear who is in charge to legitimate seccession in general terms when not the country itself - in our case Ukraine. As Kiev will never allow secession of Crimea regardless of Crimea's votings, this does not bring us closer to a solution and might be considered as one of the main reasons why the war has escalates and why negotiations do not take place.
1.8.3.3. Pro: Oliver Stones documentary "Ukraine on fire" interviews Crimea people telling how they have stopped invasion of Nazi-hordes short after the Maidan-revolution in 2014.
1.8.3.4. Con: Putin cannot verify this claim on facts because I have never heard the Crimea has been attacked after 2014.
1.8.3.5. Pro: The Western narrativ as the permanent Kiev polemic that Crimea is an illigal annexion rather than a legal secession, does not really help Putin to see it other than the western supported "Nazis" \(Nazi for Putin has another meaning than for Europeans, have anotehr meaning for US-Americans\) trying to getting Crimea back.
1.8.3.6. Pro: Ukraine, till recently, has stopped water-supply for all the Crimea peninsula.
1.8.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.1.1.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.
1.8.5. Con: Ukraine is [one of only a handful of nation states led by a Jewish leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_heads_of_state_and_government), making it unlikely that the ruling government supports, let alone tolerates Nazi ideology.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Ukrainian [decommunization laws](https://verfassungsblog.de/decommunization-in-times-of-war-ukraines-militant-democracy-problem/) in 2015 took such a hard line against nazi ideology they have been subjected to wide [international legal](http://www.osce.org/fom/158581), [scholarly](http://krytyka.com/en/articles/open-letter-scholars-and-experts-ukraine-re-so-called-anti-communist-law) and [domestic](http://life.pravda.com.ua/society/2016/05/7/211912/) criticism.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s great-grandparents [died](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/killed-in-a-fire-zelensky-gives-new-details-about-his-familys-holocaust-history/amp/) when the Nazis burned their village.
1.8.6. Con: Ukraine has very few organized Neo-nazis. The [Russian government is much more tied to far-right organizations](https://theconversation.com/putins-fascists-the-russian-states-long-history-of-cultivating-homegrown-neo-nazis-178535).
1.8.6.1. Pro: The ultranationalist party in Ukraine, Svoboda, [gathered about only 2% in 2019](https://reportingradicalism.org/en/thematic-analyses/the-far-right-and-the-2019-parliamentary-election)(In the end, Svoboda’s party list received just 2.25 percent of the vote – half of what it received in 2014 and a quarter of what it won in 2012. It did not pass the election threshold.) elections. Moreover it was against the current elected president, Zelensky.
1.8.7. Con: During 2014 revolution [far right extremists](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/12/06/racism-crimea-and-crimean-tatars/) were very few in numbers and they were present on [both sides](https://euromaidanpress.com/2014/07/04/the-black-hundreds-the-most-important-russian-group-now-active-in-ukraine/).
1.8.8. Con: By far Russia caused vastly bigger amount of deaths among Eastern Ukrainians than Ukraine.
1.8.8.1. Pro: The Russian siege of Russian-speaking Mariupol alone is estimated to have killed between [3.4](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/un-estimates-thousands-of-civilians-have-died-in-mariupol-since-feb-24/2583986#)-[10](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/over-10000-civilians-killed-during-russian-occupation-of-mariupol-mayor-claims/)k civilians, compared to [3.4k](https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Conflict-related%20civilian%20casualties%20as%20of%2031%20December%202021%20%28rev%2027%20January%202022%29%20corr%20EN_0.pdf) civilian deaths in the entire Donbas conflict from 2014 to Feb 2022.
1.8.9. Con: -> See 1.8.1.3.
1.8.10. Con: The Azov Battalions first operation was in [June 2014](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Azov_Battalion#cite_note-pancevski-7). Four months after the first Russian Soldier entered Ukraine in [February 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation#:~:text=Russian%20President%20Vladimir%20Putin%20signs,in%20Moscow%2C%2018%20March%202014.&text=Russian%20masked%20troops%20invaded%20and,military%20bases%2C%20following%20Putin's%20orders.).
1.8.11. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.
1.8.12. Pro: The Azov battalion has been supported by the West and NATO.
1.8.12.1. Con: The Russian invasion has forced the West and NATO to work with Azov, as they have significant [manpower and experience](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/1/who-are-the-azov-regiment)(As a battalion, the group fought on the front lines against pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, the eastern region of Ukraine. Just before launching the invasion, Putin recognised the independence of two rebel-held regions from Donbas.\n\nA few months after recapturing the strategic port city of Mariupol from the Russian-backed separatists, the unit was officially integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine on November 12, 2014, and exacted high praise from then-President Petro Poroshenko.\n\n“These are our best warriors,” he said at an awards ceremony in 2014. “Our best volunteers.”) that can be used to defeat Russia.
1.8.12.1.1. Pro: The Azov battalion first saw combat [recapturing Mariupol from Russian forces and pro-Russian separatists](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/europe/ukraine-mariupol-siege.html) in June 2014.
1.8.12.2. Con: The Azov battalion has [less than 2500 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion#:~:text=Various%20media%20reports%20have%20estimated,and%20are%20of%20various%20backgrounds.) and was at its strongest during a pro-Russian government.
1.8.12.3. Con: Many nations have small [ultra-nationalist groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nationalist_organizations) in their countries.
1.8.12.3.1. Pro: Russia has a [significant number of known ultra-nationalists fighting in Ukraine](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ukraine-krieg-organisierte-neonazi-gruppen-kaempfen-fuer-russland-geheimdienstbericht-a-f1632333-6801-47b3-99b9-650d85a51a52).
1.8.12.4. Pro: The Global Times discovered that American politicians, military and intelligence officers were highly likely to have had [cooperation with the Azov Battalion](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1254217.shtml), in order to foster extremist forces in Eastern Europe against Russia.
1.8.12.4.1. Con: Because China has [good relations with Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China–Russia_relations#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20China%20and%20Russia%20currently,alliance%20against%20the%20United%20States.)(Nevertheless, China and Russia currently enjoy the best relations they have had since the late 1950s.) and [bad relations with the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China–United_States_relations)(Tensions between the United States and China have remained under the Biden administration, which made China one of its focal points in implementing U.S. foreign policy.), it's clear that the global times \(which is a chinese newspaper btw\) will only write anti-American articles that the CCP wants to hear, therefore the global times isn't an objective source to rely on.
1.8.12.5. Pro: The Ukrainian state has, since 2014, provided [funding, weapons and other forms of support](https://unherd.com/2022/03/the-truth-about-ukraines-nazi-militias/) to extreme Right-wing militias, including the Azov battalion.
1.8.12.6. Pro: The Azov battalion is a [member of](https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab7dw/azov-battalion-ukraine-far-right) the National Guard of Ukraine.
1.8.12.7. Pro: In June 2015 the United States announced that their own forces will not support or train the Azov regiment but the following year, however, the US [lifted the ban](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/1/who-are-the-azov-regiment) under pressure from the Pentagon.
1.8.12.7.1. Con: Yaryna Ferentsevych, Press Officer of the US Embassy in Ukraine claims that “as far as we know,” there were [no members of the Azov Regiment being trained by US forces](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/02/01/azov-f01.html).
1.8.12.7.2. Pro: Sgt. Ivan Kharkiv of the Azov battalion “spoke about his [battalion’s experience with US trainers and US volunteers](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/02/01/azov-f01.html) quite fondly, even mentioning US volunteer engineers and medics that \[were\] still currently assisting them.”
