Discussion Name: Graphic images on cigarette packs

1. The graphic images on European cigarette packs should be removed.
1.1. Pro: Either goods are banished or not, but allowing free sale while doing everything to prevent people from buying seems half-hearted and a commission to a health-damaging industry.
1.1.1. Con: Banning tabacco products entirely is just not an option that's on the table, since it would create a huge black market.
1.1.2. Con: Smoking has the same problem as achohol have today, if smoking and alchohol was discorvered today it would never have become legal, but since it used to be legal, people can't imagine a world without them.
1.1.3. Con: It is a half-measure, but that is better than no measure at all.
1.2. Pro: The images scare children.
1.2.1. Con: Scaring children is intentional in this case.
1.2.1.1. Pro: If children are afraid of what smoking cigarettes will do to them, they are less likely to pick up the habit.
1.2.2. Pro: Whether scaring children is intentional or not is not the main point. It simply should not be done. Explicit images should not be available for the general public to see. They can figure something to show when opening the packet for the smokers only.
1.2.2.1. Con: The intention of showing these images is to discourage smoking. If they were to be shown exclusively to smokers upon opening the packet, non-smokers would have less exposure and knowledge of the dangers associated with smoking.
1.2.3. Con: The purchase of tobacco is [restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_age) in most places. Thus, the majority of children are unlikely to regularly see cigarette packets.
1.2.3.1. Con: If a kidâ€™s parents smoke, then they will see cigarette packets.
1.2.3.2. Con: Cigarette packets can be easily seen in grocery stores and gas stations.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: In many European countries, tobacco products are locked in a metal cage that is only opened on request.
1.3. Pro: The images are disgusting for non-smokers
1.3.1. Con: Is that a problem? That just gives them another reason to not smoke.
1.3.2. Pro: Shops selling cigarettes now suddenly have a wall of splatter behind their pay desk, which is disturbing for all customers, not only the smokers.
1.3.2.1. Con: It's the shop owner's decision to sell cigarettes.
1.3.2.2. Con: In Norway you have to have your cigarette packs in a fridge type thing, not sure what it is called. This solves the problem.
1.3.2.3. Con: Cigarettes can be placed away from view in a cupboard. This will prevent people from having to look at graphic images regularly.
1.4. Pro: There is little evidence that graphic images on cigarette packs lead to people quitting smoking.
1.4.1. Con: But there are probably [studies](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/why-smoking-rates-are-at-new-lows/?mcubz=3) that shows that less people has started to smoke due to higher awareness of the consequenses of smoking, this also has to do with education and school teaching about it.
1.4.2. Pro: There are more effective ways to make smokers quit.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [Price](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/well/live/20-percent-more-smokers-quit-after-1-price-increase.html?mcubz=3) is the main driver for people to quit smoking. Therefore, regulatory efforts should be focused on price instead of graphic images.
1.4.2.2. Pro: It's a negative reinforcement that really bothers no-one. It would be more useful to organize tour in oncology hospitals and offer professional and dedicated support and to raise awareness in schools rather than put horrible images that mean less than nothing.
1.4.3. Pro: As a store clerk I can say that people just say i.e. "Every pack is fine just not that one with big eye". Great on paper, sadly not working with humans.
1.4.3.1. Con: The images are the reason why I quit. I realize this is anecdotal, but I can look into my own head better than any store clerk can look into the minds of his or her customers.
1.4.4. Con: There is some evidence.[news.osu.edu](https://news.osu.edu/news/2015/12/21/graphic-warnings/)
1.4.5. Con: Even if there is little evidence that graphic images on cigatette packs lead to people quitting smoking, it could help non-smokers from picking up smoking.
1.5. Con: Images help preventing non-smokers to start smoking.
1.6. Con: Smoking is a huge health risk and causes great expenses for the state.
1.6.1. Con: Compromised smokers need medical treatment and medicine, which benefits health care as well as the pharmaceutical industry.
1.6.2. Pro: It is the responsibility of the state [to protect life](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/).
1.6.3. Pro: In countries with free public health, policies that lead to worse health for individuals can put pressure on the local health service.
1.6.4. Con: Smoking does not cause great expenses for the state because of the excise taxation.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Excise taxation makes about [3% of a country's GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise#/media/File:GDP_per_capita_PPP_vs_excises_2016.svg) which is around 15% of its government's budget. This is a rough estimate, and real numbers vary greatly from country to country.
1.6.4.2. Con: Smoking is not only associated with health risks and costs but also with the [loss of productivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5299499/) due to factors including smoking breaks, illness, or death.
1.7. Con: The graphic images overtly show the consequences of smoking, which is something many smokers try not to think about.
1.7.1. Con: Smokers are too addicted to be affected by mere scare tactics.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Despite [68 percent of smokers](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/smoking-cessation-fast-facts/index.html) wanting to quit \(possibly due to campaigns\) only around 8 percent do.
1.7.2. Pro: Smoking is a negative thing even if you do it alot or have ''good experience'' with it. It will slowly kill you in the end and thats why its important to show the consequenses that could occur.
1.7.3. Pro: This also scares away people who might consider smoking but isn't pressured to do so by others.
1.7.4. Pro: The graphic images make the cigarette packets look much less attractive and even repulsive, especially to young people who are not used to seeing those sort of images, making them less likely to start smoking as they do not want to look at the packets.
1.7.5. Pro: [Smoking has damaging effects on the environment](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/31/health/tobacco-environment-who-report/index.html) such as: polluting the air, land, and water, and may result in accidental ingestion by animals. Non-smokers are also affected by [secondhand smoking](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/secondhand-smoke.html). Even though there is little evidence that the pictures lead to a decrease in smoking, they make smokers think about the consequences of their own actions.
1.7.6. Con: The graphic images are likely to be distressing to some smokers. Instead of using graphics, the consequences of smoking can be explained verbally instead to prevent this distress.
1.7.6.1. Con: Humans are visual animals and [have stronger responses to pictures.](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/pictures_move_people_more_than_words)
