Discussion Name: Gender in the Animal Kingdom

1. Gender exists in the animal kingdom.
1.1. Pro: Gender roles exist among animals. This would be possible only if gender exists within the animal kingdom.
1.1.1. Pro: Males tend to play the role of protector, as they are [larger and more aggressive](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201910/gender-differences-animals). This is attributable to their higher levels of testosterone.
1.1.1.1. Con: In several species, such as [clownfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocellaris_clownfish) and [meerkats](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/meerkat-dominant-female.htm), females are larger and more aggressive.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: From an evolutionary perspective, it makes more sense for women to be larger, as this is conducive to childbirth. Their smaller size is, therefore, a [product of inequality](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36789370_Why_are_women_smaller_than_men_When_anthropology_meets_evolutionary_biology) in the allocation of food.
1.1.2. Con: There are many animals, such as [seahorses](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/seahorse.html), that defy what humans consider to be normal gender roles.
1.1.2.1. Con: Such roles are deviations from the norm. As such they are the exception, not the rule.
1.2. Pro: In humans, dominance is associated with the masculine gender role. Similarly, animal males also have an incentive to acquire [a high social status](https://theconversation.com/how-understanding-animal-behaviour-can-liberate-us-from-gender-inequality-102981)(In humans and many other mammals, there is a particularly strong evolutionary incentive for males to acquire high status, since this can greatly increase their reproductive output.\n\nHigh-ranking males can fend off other males from accessing females, and they also tend to be more attractive to females due to their high status. Therefore, these males can potentially produce vast numbers offspring, as some notable tyrants like Genghis Khan have done. Many of us may even have such a male as an ancestor.), because it increases their likelihood of reproductive success.
1.2.1. Con: The [Australian Giant Cuttlefish](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.2507#:~:text=Males%20seldom%20exhibit%20courtship%20behaviour,arms%20and%20grasping%20her%20head.) do not always follow this trait. The males which have a high social status, that is the largest and most aggressive males, have harems of females to mate with. However, smaller, lower social status males, will pretend to be female in order to mate with the females in the dominant males harem. Some research suggests this is a more successful means of passing on their genes.
1.2.2. Con: The argument that gender is a marker for sex for the purposes of reproduction is negated by the existence of [homosexual behaviors](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/homosexual-animals-debate) observed in various animal groups.
1.2.3. Con: Female chinchillas and hyenas are more [socially dominant](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201910/gender-differences-animals) than their male counterparts.
1.2.3.1. Pro: This also applies to many species of [insects](https://www.euclidlibrary.org/prayingmantis#:~:text=Female%20praying%20mantises%20are%20larger,of%20their%20head%20called%20ocelli.) and [arachnids](https://www.wired.com/2010/08/tiny-male-spider/).
1.3. Con: [Gender theorists](https://nautil.us/no-animals-do-not-have-genders-9212/) unequivocally reject the argument that gender exists in the animal kingdom.
1.3.1. Con: Although many gender theorists reject this notion, there is still a considerable amount of ongoing research on [gender roles in advanced primates](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/primate-diaries/monkeys-show-gender-is-not-a-fixed-variable-in-childhood-behavior/).
1.3.2. Con: One group rejecting an argument does not inherently make their stance true, especially if their rejection is based on a theory that has not been scientifically proven.
1.4. Con: Differences in behavior in the animal kingdom between male and female creatures are [based off their physical](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1500983), rather than social, traits.
1.4.1. Con: This is not universally true. In humans, traditionally, the male provides for the family. In lions the lioness' provide, the lion protects. Even through lions are stronger than lioness' and could take down prey significantly larger than a lioness.
1.4.2. Con: The penis of a male hyena and [pseudo-penis of a female hyena](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201910/gender-differences-animals)(Hyenas are particularly interesting because, in addition to being larger than males, females have a pseudo penis superficially indistinguishable from that of males that plays a role in social greeting and dominance relationships.), both of which have a social function, are virtually indistinguishable.
1.4.3. Con: [Darwin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210015198)(While some have suggested distinguishing between sexual and natural selection is worthless, Darwin made the distinction clearly, cogently and for good reason — he was trying to explain the existence of characters that were apparently not favoured by natural selection \(Figure 1\). He says, for example, that sexual selection “depends not on the struggle for existence, but on the struggle between males for possession of females.”) suggests that sexual selection "depends not on the struggle for existence, but on the struggle between males for possession of females.”. This action is different between male and female animals for the purposes of securing reproductive rights.
