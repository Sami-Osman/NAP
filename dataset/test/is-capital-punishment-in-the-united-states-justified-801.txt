Discussion Name: Is Capital Punishment in the United States justified?

1. Capital punishment should be abolished in the United States.
1.1. Pro: The death penalty is often applied in an arbitrary, discriminatory, or inconsistent manner.
1.1.1. Pro: Wrongful conviction can result in wrongful execution.
1.1.1.1. Con: If we reserve capital punishment for the worst of crimes with complete proof then there would likely be no risk of wrongful punishment.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Seemingly complete and decisive proof can turn out to be erroneous or incomplete.
1.1.1.2. Con: Even though wrongful conviction is an obvious judicial system problem; the solution is to repair the justice system and not to forego the death penalty completely.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: We should not have punishments which can only be justly administered in a perfect world.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Meaningful changes in the judicial system are bound to take years, if not decades to complete.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: There are [structural issues](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/courts/reports/2019/05/08/469504/structural-reforms-federal-judiciary/) with the US judiciary which make it incredibly difficult to seek meaningful reform of the system.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: If the only problem with the death penalty is tied to administrative issues, the resources to fix those issues can be made available.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Until the justice system is repaired, even one wrongful conviction and execution is enough to justify removing the death penalty.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Capital punishment ignores the plausibility that eventually exonerating evidence may come to light. It therefore undermines justice by exacting a punishment that cannot be undone or satisfactorily compensated.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Executions never take place immediately. In fact, there is an average of 15 years between conviction and execution in America. Wrongful convictions have a large window in which they can be appealed \([p. 19](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/cp12st.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: No matter the size of the window, there will always be a chance of wrongful execution.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Courts tend to [accept new evidence](https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/issues/postconviction)(Critics of the death penalty view Porter’s case as a failure of the capital post-conviction system to catch and correct wrongful convictions, notwithstanding its provisions for considering new evidence of actual innocence.) during appeals, which can allow new witnesses, if found, to testify.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: A considerably large number of people, who were executed prior to being shown they were innocent, are later exonerated by the [Innocence Project](https://innocenceproject.org/the-death-penalty/).
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: [New technology](https://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/md/kirk-bloodsworth.html) can help bring new evidence to light.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: [Genetic genealogy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2020/06/30/genetic-genealogy-golden-state-killer/) is a method of catching criminals which is only in its infancy, and may help to exonerate people in the future by catching the true criminals.
1.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: DNA testing can and has led to exonerations of those on death row.
1.1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The advent of DNA testing led to the exoneration of many defendants who had been convicted before the police had access to such technology \([p. xix](https://books.google.ie/books/about/Convicted_by_Juries_Exonerated_by_Scienc.html?id=lHnQu9nCVDEC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)(This report reviews more than two dozen cases in which forensic DNA typing ultimately exonerated suspects or defendants. Most were prosecuted at a time when forensic DNA typing was not available to police or prosecutors.)\).
1.1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: As of 2011, DNA testing has led to the exoneration of [17 individuals](https://www.aclu.org/other/dna-testing-and-death-penalty)(In the U.S., as of September 2011, 273 people including 17 death row inmates, have been exonerated by use of DNA tests.) on death row in the United States, who would otherwise have been wrongfully executed.
1.1.1.3.3.2.3. Con: This is not an argument against capital punishment in the modern world, since access to this technology exists.
1.1.1.3.3.2.4. Con: There are many [issues](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/a-reasonable-doubt/480747/) with the use of DNA testing in criminal trials.
1.1.1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: While DNA testing is considered to be highly reliable by jurors, studies have shown that [DNA analysts](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-surprisingly-imperfect-science-of-dna-testing-2/)(A 2013 survey by the National Institute of Standards and Technology asked analysts from 108 labs to look at a three-person mixture and determine if a suspect’s DNA was present. Seventy percent of the analysts said the suspect might be in the mix; 24 percent said the data was inconclusive. Just six percent arrived at the truth: The suspect was not in the sample.) themselves are much less certain.
1.1.1.3.3.2.4.2. Pro: A wrongful exoneration based on DNA evidence allows the perpetrator to continue to pose a threat to public safety \([p. 178](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344959555_A_Broken_Tandem_Understanding_Lack_of_Witness_Cooperation_in_the_Interview_Room)\)
1.1.1.3.3.2.4.3. Pro: DNA evidence has previously led to the [imprisonment](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-19412819) of the innocent, showing how flawed it can be.
1.1.1.3.3.2.4.4. Con: The fact that DNA testing is imperfect shows how rampant wrongful convictions could be.
1.1.1.3.3.2.4.5. Con: Many of the issues with DNA testing are on account of [contamination](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24534110). This can be mitigated by the proper handling of [evidence](https://www.ncjrs.gov/nij/DNAbro/evi.html).
1.1.1.3.3.2.5. Pro: A study estimates that if all death-sentenced defendants remained under sentence of death indefinitely, [at least 4.1%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent) would be exonerated due to discrepancies in DNA, testimonies, and biased juries. If we abolish the death penalty, it allows time for these innocent people to be exonerated.
1.1.1.3.3.2.5.1. Con: [That study](http://pnas.org/content/111/20/7230) looks at death row inmates whose sentences are changed to life-in-prison, and judges that some of them would walk out of prison entirely if they had remained on death row where the efforts to defend them are greater. It does not offer any evidence that any executed inmate was deserving of exoneration.
1.1.1.3.3.3. Con: This is ultimately a speculative belief with little to support it.
1.1.1.3.3.4. Con: The pace of technological development is now [slower](https://itif.org/publications/2019/11/01/technology-feels-its-accelerating-because-youve-been-watching-too-many-ted) than previous periods, meaning such occurrences will become less likely.
1.1.1.4. Pro: [Wrongful convictions are rampant in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_United_States). With such a flawed system, the death penalty should not be used.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: If it is wrong to kill an innocent person, then capital punishment could only be moral if there was zero chance of wrongful conviction.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The US Supreme Court recently found that the [burden of proof](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-death-penalty-kansas-carr-brothers.html) for mitigating factors in the sentencing of death penalty cases is not beyond reasonable doubt, making it easier for the defense to invoke mitigating circumstances.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Inadequate legal representation is a factor leading to wrongful conviction; this affects mostly uneducated and poor people.
1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: A study by Columbia University found that 68% of convictions were reversed on appeal, with poor representation cited as the main reason for the reversal \([p. 11](http://www2.law.columbia.edu/brokensystem2/report.pdf)(Our June 2000 Report shows how often mistakes occur and how serious it is: 68% of all death verdicts imposed and fully reviewed during the 1973-1995 study period were reversed by courts due to serious errors. \[...\] Analyses presented for the first time here reveal that 76% of the reversals at the two appeal stages where data are available for study were because defense lawyers had been egregiously incompetent, police and prosecutors had suppressed exculpatory evidence or committed other professional misconduct, jurors had been misinformed about the law, or judges and jurors had been biased.)\).
1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: In the United States, in 2007, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, 95% of people on death row had disadvantaged economic backgrounds \([p. 1](http://www.worldcoalition.org/media/resourcecenter/EN_WD2017_FactSheet)(However, an ongoing feature of the application of the death penalty is that it is inextricably linked to poverty. Social and economic inequalities affect access to justice for those who are sentenced to death for several reasons. Defendants often lack the social, economic and political resources to adequately defend themselves and will in some cases be discriminated against because of their social status.\n\[...\]\nIn the United States, in 2007, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, 95% of people on death row have disadvantaged economic backgrounds.)\).
1.1.1.4.2.3. Con: Even if a defendant is poor, they can receive legal aid from the state in the form of a public defender.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Out of all offenders who are sentenced to death, [three quarters](https://politicalpromise.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/the-death-penalty-unhelpful-immoral-and-dangerous/) of those who are allocated a [legal aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid) lawyer can expect execution. This figure dropped to a quarter if the defendant could afford to pay for a lawyer.
1.1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Legal aid is based on the right to an attorney, which is founded on the [Fifth Amendment](https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-rights/miranda-rights-and-the-fifth-amendment.html).
1.1.1.4.2.3.3. Pro: The Fourteenth Amendment has been found to be a source for the right to counsel, as in the case of [Powell v. Alabama](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-powell-v-alabama).
1.1.1.4.3. Con: By this logic, any and all punishments should be forgone, since there is always a possibility of sentencing an innocent person.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: The death penalty is worse than other punishments.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: Absent capital punishment, life imprisonment would be the only choice, which can be equally, if not more, cruel.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Some criminals may consider life in jail, which is still meaningfully a death sentence, to be more inhumane than capital punishment.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The death penalty provides an [escape](https://www.smh.com.au/national/death-penalty-is-easy-way-out-says-boston-runner-bobby-odonnell-in-australia-20150516-gh37ev.html) for those who committed crimes from having to face the long-term consequences of their actions.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Most prisoners on death row believe that the death penalty is a [preferable punishment](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90935&page=1) to life in prison.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1.3. Con: A prisoner's input is not and should not be considered relevant to the punishment they are given.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Insofar as the criminal justice system seeks to alter behaviour, the perceptions and reactions of those who interact with it are relevant.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: While true, it should not matter whether or not the criminals find the punishment 'inhumane.'
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: [Many death row prisoners spend decades](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/time-death-row) in prison between sentencing and execution while appealing. The ever present threat of being put to death while they wait makes the death penalty more cruel.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.3. Pro: There is no point abolishing the death penalty if life without parole is the alternative since it is simply the death penalty by stealth.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: In both cases, the convict ultimately ends up dead, spending no more of their life outside prison.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.3.1.1. Con: There is still a substantive difference between a long life spent in prison and a short stay before execution.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4. Pro: Imprisoning violent criminals and gang members exposes fellow inmates to danger, as they are the most likely to engage in prison violence \([p. 6](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/737956/understanding-prison-violence.pdf)(Who \(which prisoners\) are the most likely to commit incidents of violent disorder within establishments?\nThe most firmly supported variable is younger age, and there is moderately high support for previous involvement in violence while in prison, for having a conviction for a violent offence, a history of drug offences or drug abuse, and for gang involvement.)\).
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Long prison sentences do not prevent convicted criminals from frequently offending in jail, as the high number of crimes in prisons, such as [jail murders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/23/how-often-do-prisoners-die-behind-bars/?utm_term=.77bf77439248), indicates.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: The inmates who come to be victims of prison violence do not deserve this treatment, as they are already serving out their prison sentence.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4.3. Con: Exposure to potential harm is preferable to certain harm \(execution\).
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4.4. Con: Prisoners can and should be better protected from harming one another.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: The criminals who are most likely to hurt other inmates can be kept in [solitary confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement).
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5. Pro: The [modern death penalty](https://vittana.org/15-biggest-capital-punishment-pros-and-cons), using lethal injections, in the United States has evolved into a process that is intended to be painless and effective.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Lethal injection can cause an incredibly painful death.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: One inmate [executed in 2014](http://nation.time.com/2014/01/10/oklahoma-convict-who-felt-body-burning-executed-with-controversial-drug/) was heard saying, "I feel my whole body burning."
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1.2. Con: This is irrelevant; the fact that one method of capital punishment may result in a painful death does not in any way lead to the conclusion that all forms of capital punishment are torture.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Given that lethal injections are considered among the most modern and humane forms of capital punishment, it is very relevant that they can lead to painful deaths.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: It took almost two hours for Joseph Wood in Arizona to die when executioners used an [experimental drug combination](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/arizona-inmate-injected-15-times-execution-drugs-joseph-wood).
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: Lethal injection involves the use of an [anesthetic](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/lethal-injection/overview-of-lethal-injection-protocols) to ensure the inmate does not feel pain.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Recent research has found that the anesthetic often does not work \([p. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240744460_The_Death_Penalty_by_Lethal_Injection_and_Hill_v_McDonough_Is_the_USA_Starting_to_See_Sense)(Recent research however has established that it is highly probable that many prisoners are not in fact anaesthetised when the pain inducing drugs are injected into their systems.)\).
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.6. Con: Life imprisonment confers benefits on the criminals which would otherwise not be possible.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.6.1. Pro: Life imprisonment gives criminals the hope that they may eventually regain their liberty.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.6.2. Pro: Life in prison [guarantees](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/prison_system/prison_conditions.html) inmates three meals a day, medical care, education, entertainment and other benefits for free.
1.1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Wrongfully imprisoned people can be paid reparations by the state - the same cannot happen for executed people.
1.1.1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Some states have paid reparations to the [families](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15476561) of those who have been wrongfully executed.
1.1.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: The death penalty, unlike many other punishments, is wholly [irreversible](https://www.aclu.org/other/case-against-death-penalty)(Capital punishment denies due process of law. Its imposition is often arbitrary, and always irrevocable – forever depriving an individual of the opportunity to benefit from new evidence or new laws that might warrant the reversal of a conviction, or the setting aside of a death sentence.).
1.1.2. Pro: The death penalty might be imposed on political grounds.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Politicians use the death penalty as a vote catcher, which can lead to harsher use of capital punishment.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In many states, judges are elected by the citizens of their states, from District Courts to Supreme Court positions, in [partisan or non-partisan elections.](https://ballotpedia.org/Judicial_selection_in_the_states) Such elections often incite candidates to promise "harsh sentences" to satisfy and sway electorates.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Judges are more likely to affirm death penalty convictions, or overturn life sentences in favour of the death penalty, in close proximity to judicial elections \([p. 13](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/How_Judicial_Elections_Impact_Criminal_Cases.pdf)(Empirical studies across states, court level, and method of election find that proximity to re-election makes judges more punitive — more likely to impose longer sentences, affirm death sentences, and even override life sentences to impose death.)\).
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: In more than half of the states in the US, the governor [appoints](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/judicial-selection-significant-figures) judges to their first term from a list of candidates provided by a nominating commission. This reduces the effect of negative incentives brought about by elections.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Politicians can use the death penalty to appeal to their base, or position themselves as "law and order" candidates.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Donald Trump [restarted](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-death-penalty-federal-execution-2020-election-a9021501.html) federal executions in 2020, in a move which many viewed as an attempt to appeal to his Republican base.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Some politicians can and have campaigned on [abolishing](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/criminal-justice-reform/capital-punishment-death-penalty/) the death penalty.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Regardless of whether politicians campaign for or against it, the death penalty is a matter of life and death, and should not be a political issue.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Political issues routinely concern problems of life and death, as the debate around the legalisation of [euthanasia](https://www.thejournal.ie/dying-with-dignity-assisted-dying-ireland-5216667-Sep2020/) highlights.
1.1.2.2. Con: This could apply to most punishments.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: In a state where the judicial system is [compromised by politics](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2995008), it does not matter which punishments are given out.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The US has, in the past, implemented the death penalty based on [political grounds](https://www.history.com/news/rosenbergs-executed-spies-cold-war).
1.1.3. Pro: Race continues to play a strong role in US death penalty cases.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Those who kill white people are considerably more likely to be sentenced to death than those who kill Black people \([p. 649](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/PierceRadeletStudy.pdf)(Of the executed, 14 were whites convicted of killing other whites \(51.8%\), nine were blacks convicted of killing whites \(33%\), and four were blacks convicted of killing other blacks \(14.8%\). Thus, 23 out of the executed prisoners \(85%\) were convicted of killing white victims.)\).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The problem here is not that the killers of white people are given the death penalty, but that the killers of Black people are not.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Even though Black and white people are murder victims in nearly equal numbers of crimes, 80% of people executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977 have been executed for murders involving white victims \([p. 5](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/104000/amr510462003en.pdf)(Since 1976, blacks have been six to seven times more likely to be murdered than whites, with the result that blacks and whites are the victims of murder in about equal numbers. Yet, 80 per cent of the more than 840 people put to death in the USA since 1976 were convicted of crimes involving white victims, compared to the 13 per cent who were convicted of killing blacks.)\).
1.1.3.2. Con: The problem here then is racism, not the death sentence. Unjust sentences due to race are not restricted to the death penalty. Extending this logic would mean that any kind of punishment should be abolished in case people of colour are convicted.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: As society becomes [less racist](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/americans-are-becoming-less-racist-and-homophobic-according-to-new-research.html), the need to abolish the death penalty should be reduced.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The death penalty is disproportionately applied to non-white defendants.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Historically, the death penalty has been disproportionately applied to Black offenders.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: The death penalty was disproportionately used to punish African-Americans in wartime. In this way, the death penalty [perpetuates the tradition of bias](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/the-inhumanity-of-the-death-penalty/361991/) and evokes the history of abuse.
1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: During the Civil War, Black soldiers were significantly more likely to be court-martialed and [executed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/the-inhumanity-of-the-death-penalty/361991/)(During the Civil War, black soldiers were significantly more likely to be court-martialed and executed than their white counterparts.) than white soldiers.
1.1.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: According to law professor Elizabeth Hillman, in World War II, "African-Americans comprised 10 percent of the armed forces but accounted for [almost 80 percent](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/the-inhumanity-of-the-death-penalty/361991/)(This practice continued into World War II. "African-Americans comprised 10 percent of the armed forces but accounted for almost 80 percent of the soldiers executed during the war," writes law professor Elizabeth Lutes Hillman.) of the soldiers executed during the war."
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: In the case of Furman v. Georgia, two US Supreme Court judges noted the racial bias included in its administration \([pp. 303-304](https://escholarship.org/content/qt8sg579fp/qt8sg579fp.pdf)(Furman's counsel argued that as historically applied, the death penalty was discriminatory, with a greater proportion of Blacks executed com-pared with whites. In addition to identifying sources of institutionalized discrimination in the Georgia capital sentencing system, the petitioner argued that the imposition of the death penalty was standardless, arbitrary and capricious.\n\[...\]\nAlthough not central to their concurrence in the Court's result, Justices Douglas and Marshall voiced concern that the administration of the death penalty was racially tainted.)\).
1.1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Although the execution rate for white offenders has been declining, the execution rate for Black offenders has not demonstrated a similar downward trend \([p. 19](http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/61617.pdf)(As can be seen, after the seventeenth century the execution rates for both groups tended to decline. The decline in white rates, however, began earlier and is more precipitous than the decline in the rates for African Americans. The African American rates also tend to be more volatile and marked by more and wider fluctuations.)\)
1.1.3.3.1.4. Con: Historical trends are irrelevant to a conversation about the merits of the modern death penalty.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: While only [13.4%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219) of the US population is Black, as of 2020, [41.6%](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/overview/demographics) of inmates on death row are Black.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: As of 2007, over half of those on death row in the US were non-white offenders \([p. 3](https://rm.coe.int/168008b914)(For instance, over half of those on death row in the United States are non-white.)\).
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: If they were legitimately convicted of committing crimes, then these statistics have no bearing.
1.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that non-white people offend at a rate so much higher than white people.
1.1.3.3.4. Con: More [white people](https://prodeathpenalty.com/info/pro-death-penalty-arguments) have been executed than any other race in the US since 1977.
1.1.3.3.4.1. Con: While [48.6 percent](https://prodeathpenalty.com/info/pro-death-penalty-arguments) of executions were of white people, white people make up more than [60 percent](https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-census-data-shows-the-nation-is-diversifying-even-faster-than-predicted/) of the US population as of 2019.
1.1.3.3.4.2. Pro: Over [half](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/executions-overview/executions-by-race-and-race-of-victim) of those executed in the US since 1977 have been white.
1.1.3.3.4.3. Pro: 52 of 91 executions between January 2017 and May 2021 have been of [white people](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/executions-overview/executions-by-race-and-race-of-victim).
1.1.3.4. Pro: There is an administrative bias in the processes of capital cases which is prejudiced against non-white defendants.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: [North Carolina's Racial Justice Act](http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/8086772/)(North Carolina's Racial Justice Act allows defendants to argue that racial bias played a role in their sentences.) enables people charged with a crime that could lead to capital punishment to raise a claim of racial bias, which slackens court procedures.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: The Racial Justice Act was [repealed](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/20/justice/north-carolina-death-penalty/index.html) in 2013 by Governor Pat McCrory.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The repeal of the Racial Justice Act was found to be [unconstitutional](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/north-carolina-supreme-court-finds-repeal-racial-justice-act-unconstitutional) by the North Carolina Supreme Court.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Multiple defendants had their death sentences [vacated](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/north-carolina-racial-justice-act) under the Racial Justice Act.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.1.3.4.3. Con: Judges can institute intervention strategies to combat the prevalence of racial bias in the justice system \([p. 22](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/matthewclair/files/clair_winter_how_judges_think_about_racial_disparities.pdf)(Through in-depth interviews with Northeast State judges, we uncover a range of explanations judges hold and strategies judges employ with respect to racial disparities in the criminal justice system, thereby moving “beyond official records” and toward the identification of “more subtle variables about organizational pressure and the attitudes of major participants”.)\).
1.1.3.4.4. Pro: [White prosecutors](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/08/420913118/does-it-matter-that-95-of-elected-prosecutors-are-white)(That demographic, she said, "really just does not have the kinds of life experiences that most of the population has. If you're a person of color, you know what it is to be treated with suspicion from a policing perspective.") are less likely to understand the life experiences of a Black person, and may treat them more harshly as a result.
1.1.3.4.4.1. Pro: [95%](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elected-prosecutors-diversity_n_5db1b486e4b0131fa99ad093) of prosecutors elected in both 2015 and 2019 were white.
1.1.3.4.4.1.1. Con: The 2020 elections saw a spate of prosecutors elected who were [against](https://theappeal.org/politicalreport/new-prosecutors-challenging-death-penalty/) the death penalty.
1.1.3.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Some prosecutors who ran against the death penalty saw [backlash](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/aramis-ayala-prosecutors-death-penalty.html) from both conservatives and liberals.
1.1.3.4.5. Pro: [Diverse juries](https://www.voanews.com/usa/all-about-america/why-jurys-racial-composition-matters) are more likely to consider all of the evidence in the case, not to presume guilt, and deliberate for longer.
1.1.3.4.5.1. Pro: More than 20% of Black defendants who have been executed were convicted by all-white juries \([p. 40](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/104000/amr510462003en.pdf)(At least one in five of the nearly 300 African Americans executed in the USA since 1977 were tried in front of all-white juries.)\).
1.1.4. Con: There are many cases where society has to accept some individual injustices as part of the overall functioning of a system.
1.1.4.1. Con: [Blackstone's Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio) is a cornerstone of the modern justice system that assumes "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer". This is especially true for capital punishment.
1.1.4.2. Pro: For example, society accepts deaths in the medical system and traffic.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The death penalty is not an unavoidable part of the functioning of the justice system, unlike what [vehicular accident deaths](https://www.wisemorrissey.com/blog/2020/01/car-accidents-are-inevitable-these-days/) are for mass vehicular transit.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Society is actively attempting to minimize deaths in both of these cases.
1.1.5. Con: This is an argument against the current implementation of the death penalty, not the idea in concept.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Capital punishment is proportional and just in response to certain offenses.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: The US Supreme Court has, as yet, failed to develop a coherent framework for applying the death penalty in a proportionate manner \([pp. 268-269](https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/criminal/id/151/download)(As four of nine justices recently concluded in its first post-Ridgway proportionality decision \(State v. Cross, 2006\), the Washington State Supreme Court has yet to articulate a coherent methodology to inform comparative proportionality review.\n\[...\]\nThe predicaments encountered by the Washington judiciary in its conduct of comparative proportionality review are indicative of the defining dilemma that federal and state courts have struggled to resolve in attempting to craft a constitutionally coherent doctrine regarding capital punishment.)\).
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The concept that a punishment must be proportional to the crime has been articulated by courts, and is in keeping with most people's inherent conception of [justice](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/for_1.shtml).
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: The idea of [proportionality](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-08/10-capital-punishment-proportionality.html)(\[T\]he Eighth Amendment’s protection against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments ﬂows from the basic ‘precept of justice that punishment for \[a\] crime should be graduated and proportioned to \[the\] offense.' Whether this requirement has be fulfilled is determined not by the standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791 but by the norms that 'currently prevail.' The Amendment 'draw\[s\] its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.) in the United States is tied to public perception of what the most abhorrent crimes are.
1.1.5.1.4. Pro: To create a fair and [proportional hierarchy](https://iep.utm.edu/cap-puni/#SH2b) of crimes and punishments, the most severe crime must be met with the most severe punishment: death.
1.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Torture is more severe than execution, yet we consider it unethical to use torture. Thus, it is not true that the most severe option available must ever be used.
1.1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Everyone who experiences torture will die, but not everyone who dies will experience torture. Thus, torture adds to the pain and misery of one's life, while execution only brings it to a close sooner.
1.1.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: Torture can go on indefinitely, even until the subject would prefer death to more torture. In contrast, execution is inherently finite, ending not long after it begins. Thus torture involves more harm and evils than execution.
1.1.5.1.4.1.3. Pro: People in great suffering may sometimes wish to be killed to end their suffering, whereas the dead themselves do not suffer. It is often seen as a sign of mercy to kill a person or animal in great suffering to give them peace from their misery.
1.1.5.1.4.1.4. Con: Torture allows for the possibility of a future life, and thus for future positive experiences and acts, whereas execution clearly does not.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Many commentators who are in favour of the death penalty [concede](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/the-death-penalty-appropriate) that it is flawed in its current implementation.
1.1.5.3. Con: The concept and principle of the death penalty cannot be divorced from its implementation, since the current implementation of the death penalty is so egregiously unjust.
1.1.6. Con: The legal processes a capital case must go through are rigorous and help to prevent injustice.
1.1.6.1. Con: The justice system is always subject to human biases and therefore should never be used to implement an irreversible penalty.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Judges are not immune to unconscious racism, and juries have [frequently demonstrated racism](http://www.nationalmagazine.ca/Articles/July-2015-Web/Who-are-you-calling-racist.aspx)(My review of two decades of case law on challenges for cause suggests that the progress we have made in examining the racial prejudices of jurors has been negligible.\n\[...\]\nJudicial conceptions of racism have neglected to keep up with its more subtle, contemporary manifestations. Given that explicit racial prejudice is now socially stigmatized, racism is far more likely to assume systemic, subconscious, or covert forms. Despite attempts by some defence counsel to expand the scope of questioning to better capture racism’s adaptations, most judges have resisted efforts to move beyond the cursory investigation adopted in Parks and Williams.) in [conviction](http://time.com/4949761/keith-tharpe-death-penalty-supreme-court/) and sentencing.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: It has been [proven](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full)(The plot shows that the likelihood of a ruling in favor of a prisoner spikes at the beginning of each session—the probability of a favorable ruling steadily declines from ≈0.65 to nearly zero and jumps back up to ≈0.65 after a break for a meal.) that judges make more lenient decisions after they have had a meal.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Humans are subject to cognitive biases and [systematically make choices](https://nobaproject.com/modules/judgment-and-decision-making) that defy clear logic.
1.1.6.1.4. Con: Given that all human actions are subject to cognitive biases, there is no such thing as a perfect mechanism to determine truth.
1.1.6.1.5. Con: Since humans are fallible, the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated.
1.1.6.1.5.1. Con: This is a good reason why capital punishment shouldn't exist. That anyone be wrongfully killed by the lawfully acting State should be considered unacceptable.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The United Nations, of which the US is a member state, passed a resolution in [1984](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/deathpenalty.aspx) which established a series of limitations and constraints on the use of the death penalty.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: In March 2021, UN experts called on the US to [abolish](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1087012) the death penalty, demonstrating the insufficiency of the US's legal processes.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: The 1984 resolution has been reaffirmed further by the UN, such as the 2014 General Assembly Resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty \([p. 66](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/e/a/266186.pdf)\).
1.1.6.3. Pro: In many states, unanimity of the jury is required to sentence someone to death \([p. 1](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/2/115/files/2014/12/Class-9-Part-1-Jury-Selection-2a8w5vl.pdf)\).
1.2. Con: Some criminals deserve the death penalty due to the severity of their crimes.
1.2.1. Pro: Moral philosophy justifies capital punishment under certain conditions.
1.2.1.1. Pro: [Immanuel Kant](http://tragicfarce.com/tag/immanuel-kant/)(If an offender has committed murder, he must die. In this case, no possible substitute can satisfy justice. For there is no parallel between death and even the most miserable life, so that there is no equality of crime and retribution unless the perpetrator is judicially put to death...A society that is not willing to demand a life of somebody who has taken somebody else’s life is simply immoral.) said that a society that is not willing to demand a life of somebody who has taken somebody else's life is simply immoral.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Kant said](http://acad.depauw.edu/~jeremyanderson/old/120s05/120z_kant.html): "However many they may be who have committed a murder, or have even commanded it, or acted as art and part in it, they ought all to suffer death; for so justice wills it."
1.2.1.1.2. Con: There is a [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#The_Second_Formulation:_The_Formula_of_Humanity) not to kill people. This applies to evil people as much as to the rest of society. If you don't believe in murder you shouldn't ordain state murder.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Capital punishment does not stringently violate the categorical imperative: a fair court procedure and an appropriate sentence depending on the severity of the committed crime can very well be principles for [universal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#Second_formulation:_Humanity).
1.2.1.2. Pro: The retributive philosophy of an "eye for an eye" is the most just form of punishment.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Morality is absolute, not relative. It is morally wrong to kill someone, irrespective of the morality of that individual.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If it is acceptable for soldiers and police to kill people in the course of their duties, then it is hypocritical to claim that killing is inherently wrong.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is an ethical difference between killing in combat and killing a disarmed, incarcerated person.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is generally accepted that it is [ethical](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/just/whom_1.shtml) to kill in conflict, as soliders have often consented to be there \([p. 119](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=yjlh)\). Those on death row have not consented in the same way.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Both acts end with the death of a person and so, at the most basic level, they are equatable acts.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Over [1000 people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database) were killed by US law enforcement in 2016. Since the police are representatives of the justice system, it cannot be claimed that killing is inherently wrong.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There has been significant [public backlash](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/08/23/905244109/fatal-police-shooting-of-black-man-in-louisiana-sparks-outrage-and-protest) to police shootings, with protests occurring across the world calling for an end to [police violence](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/black-lives-matter-protests-around-the-world).
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The foundation of [moral absolutism](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/moral-absolutism) is evidenced by the fact that there are some values which are shared across cultures.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The notion that [killing is wrong](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/morality-is-absoluteand-e_b_942477) is one of these shared by civilized societies everywhere.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Retributive punishment is one of the oldest forms of justice, and has historically been accepted by societies as necessary.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Old Testament of the Bible says "[one eye for one eye](http://biblereasons.com/eye-for-an-eye/)".
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Being old and historically accepted doesn't make something moral or just.
1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Slavery can be found in many ancient legal and moral [codes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology/The-law-of-slavery). However, slavery is not just or moral.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Con: "An eye for an eye" only doubles the amount of harm done, rather than trying to reduce existing or future harms. Thus, it is not a moral form of punishment.
1.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: Roman judges used the principles associated with retributive justice as early as [451 BC](https://www.britannica.com/topic/retributive-justice/History-of-retribution).
1.2.1.2.3. Con: It is wrong to attempt to punish murderers for killing people by taking their lives. Capital punishment is murder, and it is hypocritical to endorse one murder as retribution for another.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: [Murder is defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder) as "the crime of unlawfully killing a person". [Execution is defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/execution) as "a putting to death especially as a legal penalty". Putting to death as a legal penalty is mutually exclusive with unlawfully killing a person.
1.2.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: With the death penalty being a legal measure, neither the executioner nor the state become criminals by applying it under federal or state legislation.
1.2.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Legality is a construct of the state. If the state apparatus decides that the death penalty is legal, then in that jurisdiction it is legal.
1.2.1.3. Con: Allowing the death penalty expresses a moral maxim that seems to contend with the moral maxim of "it is wrong to kill".
1.2.1.4. Pro: The death penalty can be defended from a purgative point of view, in that it is right to purge evil people through execution \([p. 8](https://philpapers.org/archive/DANKPR-2)(The gist of the purgative rationale is straightforward enough: the death penalty is \(strongly\) justified whenever death is needed in order to purge defilingly evil offenders from a moral community.)\).
1.2.2. Con: There are no means by which to objectively define which circumstances warrant death and which do not.
1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Morality is [ever-changing](https://theconversation.com/changing-morals-were-more-compassionate-than-100-years-ago-but-more-judgmental-too-112504), so an execution-worthy offense one day may be different the next.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: [Murder](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190617-deep-ethics-the-long-term-quest-to-decide-right-from-wrong)(For instance, while almost everyone has a strong moral sense that killing is wrong and that it simply “mustn’t be done” \[...\]) is the most consistently condemned crime across a broad variety of cultures and eras. Societal condemnation of it is not likely to change.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The views of people on issues like [abortion](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/support-legal-abortion-matches-24-year-high-poll/story?id=64221457), and [gay marriage](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/), have changed in recent years.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Even the worst criminals are [byproducts of genetics, psychological development, and chance circumstances](http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/jones.html). Justifying punishment assumes agency on the part of the criminal to transcend the factors that caused them to commit their crimes.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: This is an argument against any punishment, not just capital punishment.
1.2.3. Con: The purpose of the justice system should be to rehabilitate offenders and to attempt to right wrongs, not to punish or to satisfy a desire for revenge. The death penalty precludes the possibility of rehabilitation.
1.2.3.1. Pro: American courts have recognized that felons have an implicit right to rehabilitation by virtue of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \([p. 192](http://ijcjs.com/pdfs/Seigafoijcjs2017vol12issue2.pdf)(Given these points, it is apparent that an inmate’s Right to Rehabilitation is grounded in the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment. For this reason, the courts can cite both constitutional rights to create a zone that can implicitly establish an inmate’s Right to Rehabilitation.)\).
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Rehabilitation is not a right. It is a sought after byproduct of the justice system. The right belongs to society to ensure that it rehabilitates people prior to releasing them.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Everyone should have the right to the opportunity for rehabilitation. Whether or not they successfully do so is a different question.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: The '[right to rehabilitation](https://www.thedailystar.net/law-our-rights/right-rehabilitation-511504)' is not a constitutionally guaranteed right in most countries.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Even if rehabilitation were provided in all prisons, one cannot guarantee the outcome of such a process and so cannot offer a right to such an outcome.
1.2.3.1.1.3.1. Con: It is still possible to try and maximize the possibility of producing this outcome.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: US courts have failed to recognize the right to rehabilitation in full \([p. 193](https://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/pdfs/Seigafoijcjs2017vol12issue2.pdf)\).
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The right to rehabilitation has only been recognised in the context of prison conditions \([p. 1068](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6540&context=jclc)\).
1.2.3.1.3. Con: US courts have de-emphasized the concept of the 'rehabilitative ideal' in recent years \([p. 430](https://scholarship.law.slu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1323&context=faculty)\).
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Rehabilitation and reintegration should be the goals of the prison system, and the worst of criminals should be just as entitled to that opportunity as any other criminal.
1.2.3.2. Con: There are some people who cannot be rehabilitated, and will commit their crimes again.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: There are some cases where there is irrefutable evidence that someone has committed a crime, and that the person is unable to, or unwilling to, be rehabilitated. In these situations, a life sentence is a waste of resources.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: [Jeffrey Dahmer](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-10-13-9104020601-story.html) served a number of months in prison before being released and killing again.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: [Dahmer](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-10-13-9104020601-story.html) was not in prison for killing, despite having already murdered five people, as this was not known at the time. Therefore he may not have received the appropriate treatment in prison.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that an evaluation of one's ability to be rehabilitated can be made before they have spent time in such a system.
1.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: The fact that [remorse](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226873462_Why_Should_Remorse_be_a_Mitigating_Factor_in_Sentencing) is seen as a mitigating factor in sentencing shows that judges are willing to make such a determination before someone has spent time in prison.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: People sentenced to death are charged with severe crimes, which are the result of a personal [lack of empathy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0185106315000074)(In regard to empathy scores, we found that the control group had the highest scores in the perspective taking subscale compared to both violent group 1 and violent group 2. Reduced empathy in violent groups has been extensively reported before.) or other social disorders.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898494/)(First, on the behavioral level, we observed significantly reduced accuracy in emotion recognition, mainly for disgust, in violent offenders compared to healthy controls.) concluded that violent offenders' emotional recognition capabilities were lower compared to healthy controls.
1.2.3.2.2.2. Con: Crimes can be caused by factors other than social disorders.
1.2.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Economics](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-5690-2_409) can motivate killing e.g. for inheritance or for an insurance payout.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Such people need not be executed, but can be imprisoned indefinitely.
1.2.3.3. Con: The purpose of the justice system is to apply the legally established punishment for committed crimes.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: It's debatable whether the legally established punishment for any crime should be death. For instance, this entire discussion.
1.2.3.4. Pro: A rehabilitated criminal could make a morally valuable contribution to society.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: In most cases, convicted felons are heavily [stigmatized](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/dec/14/ex-offender-prison-neglect-public-services-advice-support-criminal-justice-innovation) and hence often unable to reintegrate or even contribute to society.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: This is especially true due to the freely accessible '[Inmate Release Information database](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/offendersearch/Search.aspx?TypeSearch=IR)', through which everyone can check if their neighbor is a former inmate.
1.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: This should be seen as an argument against social stigmatization, or the very existence of the Inmate Release Information database. It shouldn't discourage the rehabilitation attempt.
1.2.3.4.1.2. Con: There are ways to [reduce](https://preventingcrime.ca/2016/11/23/ways-to-humanize-people-in-prison-reduce-the-stigma-of-loved-ones/) the stigma faced by formerly incarcerated felons, short of giving up and instituting the death penalty.
1.2.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Ex-convicts should be re-integrated into society to help them make positive contributions to it and to reduce recidivism.
1.2.3.4.1.3. Con: Given that the stigma is not the fault of the criminal, it is unfair to institute the death penalty on these grounds.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: If the justice system is successful in inculcating moral values in inmates, then it is only logical that they will be valuable members of society.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Society would benefit much more from a reformed and positively-contributing person than from a dead one.
1.2.3.4.4. Con: Under the status quo, US prisons are a hostile environment, which make prisoners more dangerous and leads to high rates of recidivism \([p. 193](http://ijcjs.com/pdfs/Seigafoijcjs2017vol12issue2.pdf)\).
1.2.3.4.4.1. Con: While prison rehabilitation may not work as is [\(p. 17\)](https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2017/3720/In-Prison-Rehabilitation-120617.pdf), there are ways to change the focus of such efforts in line with research, such that they produce [better outcomes](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48885846).
1.2.3.4.4.2. Con: Prisons should be reformed, rather than simply implementing the death penalty for those who had no hand in creating the state of US prisons.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.3. Con: The death of a criminal can give closure to the victim's families.
1.3.1. Con: Although this is a common conception, empirical studies show that victims' families do not actually get peace or closure from the death of the criminal.
1.3.1.1. Pro: A study on revenge showed that, while people expect to feel better for exacting revenge on an offender, in reality those who do not call for punishment move on faster than those who do \([p. 1324](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/93e9/a6e0272b16c08bd5c0934f8ca0fd26b5c98f.pdf)(In both studies, then, people showed clear expectations that the punishment would lead to pleasure. The present studies, however, also measured hedonic reactions after the punishment was conducted and found that punishers were substantially less happy than the nonpunishers after both a 1- and 10-min delay.)\).
1.3.1.2. Pro: [A study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/blog/longing-nostalgia/201306/what-price-vengeance) showed that only 2.5% of victims' families mentioned feeling a sense of closure specifically after the perpetrator had been sentenced to capital punishment.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: This same study found that [20% of victims' families](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/blog/longing-nostalgia/201306/what-price-vengeance) explicitly reported that the sentence of capital punishment did not bring them any real closure.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: This study only analysed the [public statements](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/blog/longing-nostalgia/201306/what-price-vengeance)(In one study of statements made to the press, 23% of those making a statement described the event as a conclusion to a traumatizing time in their lives: “I guess we’re just glad to have this part over.”) of victims' families after executions, when not much time has passed, and they may not have had time to process ramifications of the event.
1.3.2. Con: Capital cases have a uniquely layered format of [appeals](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-offense/what-death-penalty-appeals-process). When appeals are filed, they can lead to retraumatisation for victims and their families \([pp. 13-14](https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=5144&context=mulr)(This new area of interest reflects concerns about victim retraumatization and the antitherapeutic potential of the criminal justice system to accentuate crime victims’ feelings of powerlessness and compound feelings of injustice, thereby producing lowered self-esteem, depression and discontent, and self-degradation.)\).
1.3.2.1. Pro: Some states have [automatic appeals](https://thebusinessprofessor.com/knowledge-base/state-supreme-courts/)(Some state cases have automatic appeal rights to the state Supreme Court. This is the case for all capital murder cases.) in place for death row inmates, which guarantees additional suffering on the part of the victims' families.
1.3.2.2. Con: Victims and their families would also have to deal with parole appeals if the perpetrator was given a life sentence.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Evidence suggests that victims of serious crimes show higher levels of well-being when there is a clear appeals process which has finality to it, rather than one which is protracted \([p. 99](https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=5144&context=mulr)(In Minnesota, survivors had greater control, likely because the appeals process was successful, predictable, and completed within two years after conviction; whereas, the finality of the appeals process in Texas was drawn out, elusive, delayed, and unpredictable. It generated layers of injustice, powerlessness, and in some instances, despair.)\).
1.3.2.4. Pro: The uncertainty brought about by the appeals process can retraumatise victims, and force them to [relive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/its-time-to-end-the-death-penalty-in-virginia/2019/11/22/0b1db69c-025f-11ea-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html)(Instead of supporting my family and me when we needed it the most, the commonwealth devoted its resources to the trial and appeals that lasted more than 10 years. Year after year, I was retraumatized by the uncertainty and was repeatedly forced to relive the worst day of my life.) harrowing events.
1.3.3. Pro: Some [families have stated](https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2019/03/20/death-penalty-california-murder-victims-families)(Phyllis Loya, opposes Gov. Newsom's decision \[to suspend the death penalty\]. Her son — Pittsburg, California, police officer Larry Lasater — was killed in the line of duty in 2005. His killer is on California’s death row.) that a life sentence is not satisfactory punishment and that execution would provide closure.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Some victims' families want the death penalty to allow them to [move on](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/24/us/arkansas-execution-victims-families/index.html)("We couldn't move on and have that closure because they wouldn't let us," Jones, 38 of Little Rock, Arkansas, said Sunday. "It's like they trapped us ... thinking about it and going to clemency hearings, and telling them one more time 'Yes, we still want you to finish this.' ") with their lives.
1.3.3.2. Con: The feelings and desires of the families of the defendants in capital cases are also relevant considerations in the justice system \([p. 1173](https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1391&context=lr)(Given that reality, every possible procedure should be implemented to ensure fairness for the criminal defendant and respect for the victim’s and defendant’s family members.)\).
1.3.3.3. Con: The views of the families may be subject to short-term considerations, and may lead to greater harm for them in the long-term.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The death of the perpetrator may deny victims and their families any chance of answers to questions they may have, such as why a crime was committed in the first place.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Families often get these answers from speaking to the police and from proceedings during the criminal trial.
1.3.3.4. Con: Not all people affected by murders demand the death penalty for their perpetrators.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: The parents of an 8-year-old boy who was killed in the [Boston marathon bombings](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/26/globe-poll-shows-diminishing-support-for-death-penalty-for-tsarnaev/S3GMhFlGj5VUkZrmLzh1iN/story.html) do not want the perpetrator to get the death penalty, as it would extend their anguish.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: Families of victims have said that the death penalty is "[too easy](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2017/07/akron_child_killer_ronald_phil_1.html)".
1.3.3.4.3. Pro: A lot of personally [affected people](http://www.californiacrimevictims.org/), such as victims' families, oppose the death penalty, and have formed groups to lobby against its use.
1.3.4. Con: Even if the death of a criminal does provide the family of the victim with closure, it is unclear why this is a fair trade off.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The life of one person is being exchanged for the peace of mind of another. This is not a like-for-like transaction.
1.3.4.2. Con: The family of the victim has done nothing wrong, while the criminal has transgressed in a way which society deems abhorrent, so it is reasonable to equate the comfort of one with the life of another.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Comfort and life are not commensurate.
1.3.5. Pro: Closure is an important consideration in the justice system.
1.3.5.1. Pro: 'Providing closure' is often cited as a consideration in legal judgements \([p. 13](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=public_law_and_legal_theory)(The theme of the courtroom as a place for closure or catharsis has become explicit in the years since Payne. Lower courts explicitly invoke the importance of closure.)\).
1.3.5.1.1. Con: A notable study found that court systems continue to rely on the families’ claimed support for capital punishment as a vehicle for closure even as the families themselves increasingly reject capital punishment \([p. 78](http://www.westerncriminology.org/documents/WCR/v12n1/Mowen.pdf)(The American public continues to support capital punishment for the most atrocious crimes, mainly on the basis of promoting closure to victims’ families through retribution, but the evolving victim clemency movements and the prior research on covictim closure through capital punishment both suggest that the contemporary justifications for the death penalty do not accord with the lived experiences of covictims.)\).
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Legal judgements are handed down by judges, who are the embodiment and [representatives](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/abaj45&div=41&id=&page=) of the justice system.
1.3.5.2. Con: Closure should not be considered as important as it is.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Closure is a vague and abstract concept that creates more confusion in legal proceedings.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: Different victims have very [different notions](https://johnhoward.ca/blog/what-is-closure/) of what is meant by closure.
1.3.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Incorporating such a concept into the law leads to inconsistent and unequal outcomes, which is unfair.
1.3.5.2.1.2. Con: While this is true, it is at least possible to identify certain key elements of closure e.g. holding the perpetrator accountable for their crimes.
1.3.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Holding someone accountable can be a part of law without having to invoke the concept of closure.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: Too heavy a burden has been placed on the criminal justice system in providing closure. The criminal justice system should seek only to provide information and accountability, and from there the family must heal themselves \([p. 1525](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=ilj)\).
1.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: That justice is meted out should be sufficient closure for anyone. If it is not, their problem is psychological, which is not the responsibility of the justice system to resolve.
1.3.5.2.3. Con: Victims' needs, of which closure is often one, should be one of the most important considerations of the justice system, since they are the wronged party.
1.3.5.2.4. Pro: Centering closure is harmful, as it puts the onus of capital punishment on the victims' families \([p. 77](http://www.westerncriminology.org/documents/WCR/v12n1/Mowen.pdf)\).
1.3.5.3. Con: The satisfaction of vengeance or the offering of closure are not the responsibilities of the justice system.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: [Justice](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1086#:~:text=justice,rights%2C%20both%20natural%20and%20legal.) encompasses the meting out of fair and merited desserts, correcting existing unfairness, and reducing the chances of future unfairness. Closure may be offered by this, if the affected party is satisfied by it. Vengeance \(enacting a wrong to compensate for an experienced wrong\) has no part in it.
1.3.5.4. Pro: The concept of closure is considered to be important by the [media](https://johnhoward.ca/blog/what-is-closure/)(‘Providing closure’ is one of the comments we often hear in media coverage of verdicts and sentences in criminal cases. The suggestion is that a harsh sentence provides victims of crime, or family members of victims, with some kind of relief in regard to the loss and harm they have experienced.).
1.3.5.4.1. Con: The media's focus on criminal justice has led to calls for more punitive measures, despite a reduction in the crime rate \([p. 476](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&context=wmlr)(Fundamental economic forces have reshaped the news media in the United States, and market forces are determining to a substantial degree the extent and content of the news media's treatment of crime and the criminal justice system.\n\[...\]\nDuring that period, crime fell, but the news media's focus on crime, especially violent crime,increased. Remarkably, at least half of the public remained ignorant of the reduction in crime, and a large majority continued to rate crime as one of the nation's most serious problems and to support even harsher measures.)\).
1.3.5.4.2. Con: The interests of the media are not the same as those of justice or society and so should not be given similar weight.
1.3.5.4.2.1. Pro: The incentives of the media are often driven by [revenue incentives](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0267323114538851).
1.3.5.4.2.2. Pro: The media often represents upper-class interests and dominant ideologies, and so are not representative of the entire population \([p. 7](http://www.westerncriminology.org/documents/WCR/v12n1/Mowen.pdf)(Schiff \(1997\) concluded that the owners of media outlets tend to influence newspaper content with both upper-class interest and dominant ideologies. This bias affects the current study as it highlights the natural proclivity newspapers may have to represent popular opinion, in this case the pro-death penalty covictims.)\).
1.3.5.4.3. Pro: Media is often [reflective](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/finding-the-right-media-for-the-message-in-the-middle-east/)(More often than not, the media reflects public opinion more than it shapes it.) of public opinion, and so insofar as the media consider closure important, it can be said to be important for society.
1.4. Pro: The death penalty is not efficient in terms of costs and procedure.
1.4.1. Pro: There has been a [shortage](https://apps.texastribune.org/execution-drugs/) of lethal injection drugs lately in some states. This implicates practical problems for the future, such as the US having to move to [less humane alternatives](https://www.popsci.com/execution-lethal-injection-alternative-humane).
1.4.1.1. Con: A shortage of lethal injection drugs would only result in longer time spent on death row by inmates, as they wait for drugs to be produced.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Many offenders are already kept 'waiting' on death row for a very long time. In the US, the average wait is [20 years](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/death-row-time-on-death-row), as of 2018. Extending this further prolongs their suffering.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Several states have recently executed many people in an effort to use their existing stockpile of chemicals prior to their being banned. In the [short term](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/arkansass-rush-to-execution.html), this has actually lessened the average length of time on death row.
1.4.1.2. Con: Only [China, Guatemala, Taiwan, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam](http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/methods-of-execution.cfm) use lethal injection as a standard method of execution. Alternatives are therefore readily available.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Many alternatives are actually more humane. Lethal injection—at least without proper general anesthesia—is likely [excruciating](https://eji.org/news/lethal-injections-cause-suffocation-and-severe-pain-autopsies-show/).
1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Evidence suggests that death by [firing squad](https://www.popsci.com/execution-lethal-injection-alternative-humane/) is actually the most humane method of execution.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Shooting, as a method of execution, has been found not to be a form of torture \([p. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240744460_The_Death_Penalty_by_Lethal_Injection_and_Hill_v_McDonough_Is_the_USA_Starting_to_See_Sense)(Cruel and unusual punishments are forbidden by the Constitution, but the authorities referred to are quite\nsufficient to show that the punishment of shooting as a mode of executing the death penalty for the crime of murder in the first degree is not included in that category, within the meaning of the eighth amendment.)\).
1.4.1.3. Pro: Many, [including the biggest](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/pfizer-execution-drugs-lethal-injection.html), pharmaceutical companies have blocked their products from being used in lethal injections based on either business or moral reasons.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: There are no concrete reasons that pharmaceutical companies cannot reverse this decision, and so the shortages may just be temporary.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Countries have stopped selling the "safe" lethal injections to the US; this has now caused the US to create [cocktails](http://www.livescience.com/51389-why-lethal-injection-is-getting-harder.html) that are even less safe, and make the final moments of the inmate's life dreadful.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: There have been [several botched executions](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i21/Botched-Executions-Put-Lethal-Injections.html)(And problems with executions seem only to be mounting as supply challenges force execution teams to turn to untested drug providers and change protocols on the fly.), which are correlated with the shortage of lethal injection drugs.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Lethal injections](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i21/Botched-Executions-Put-Lethal-Injections.html) have the highest rates of botched executions of all methods which have been used in the US since 1900.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Botched executions are more often a result of [improperly administered](https://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i21/Botched-Executions-Put-Lethal-Injections.html)(The medical establishment’s stance on executions also means that relatively inexperienced people are likely administering lethal injections. “I think that when people talk about botched executions, generally the botched part comes from how the drugs were administered, not so much that the drugs don’t work,” says Pearl, who has never been involved in an execution.) drugs than they are of the shortage.
1.4.1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1.3.
1.4.1.4.1.4. Pro: An [untested drug cocktail](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/oklahoma-execution-botched-clayton-lockett) was used in the executions of an Oklahoma man, who did not die for 43 minutes.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: The Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of new lethal injection drugs in the 2015 case of [Glossip v. Gross](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-gross/).
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: The Supreme Court ruled that the cocktails being used to carry out lethal injections were no more "[cruel and unusual](https://www.livescience.com/51389-why-lethal-injection-is-getting-harder.html)" than the alternatives.
1.4.2. Con: The costs of capital punishment are irrelevant, what matters is whether the punishment is moral or not.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Economic considerations should be deprioritized when dealing with matters of life and death.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: States should not be making economistic analyses when human lives are at stake - there is no value that can be placed on life.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: There have been attempts made to value human life.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Governments have long been placing a value on human life - one such valuation is [$10 million](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/843310123/how-government-agencies-determine-the-dollar-value-of-human-life).
1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Human life is [sacred](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zqnpjty/revision/1) and should not be cheapened by placing a value on it.
1.4.2.2. Con: Even if the capital punishment were to be considered moral, it might still be too expensive to realistically implement.
1.4.2.3. Con: Between equally moral options, cost could potentially be a distinguishing factor.
1.4.3. Pro: The [financial cost](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty) of putting criminals to death can often be more than the cost of putting them in prison for life.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Reviews of the death penalty at state level have found that, on average, it is less costly to imprison someone that it is to execute them.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: In 2000, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services found that the Oregon Judicial Department alone would save [$2.3 million a year](https://oadp.org/facts/13-reasons)(In 2000 a fiscal impact summary from the Oregon Department of Administrative Services stated that the Oregon Judicial Department alone would save $2.3 million annually if the death penalty were eliminated. It is estimated that total prosecution and defense costs to the state and counties equal $9 million per year.) if the death penalty were eliminated.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: It costs [three times more](https://tcadp.org/get-informed/texas-death-penalty-facts/)(In Texas, the cost of an average death penalty case is nearly three times higher than imprisoning someone in maximum security for life, according to a study by the Dallas Morning News.) to execute someone than to put them through life in prison in the state of Texas.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: To put someone in jail for their entire life is a poor basis of comparison, since it greatly exceeds the [average life sentence](https://www.sportsmansbailbonds.com/blog/how-long-is-a-life-sentence).
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: Activists in [Kansas](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/summary-of-the-kansas-death-penalty-cost-report-by-dpic)(The estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution \(median cost $1.26 million\). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration \(median cost $740,000\).) tracked the cost of death penalty cases through to execution and found that the median cost of a death penalty case was $1.26 million, while non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000.
1.4.3.1.4. Con: The high costs of execution are justified on account of the [factors](https://www.thebalance.com/comparing-the-costs-of-death-penalty-vs-life-in-prison-4689874) related to its administration.
1.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: The cost of keeping someone on death row is higher than that of keeping someone in a minimum security prison, as there are [additional](https://www.thebalance.com/comparing-the-costs-of-death-penalty-vs-life-in-prison-4689874) health and security costs.
1.4.3.1.5. Con: Just because the administration of the death penalty is more expensive than imprisonment does not mean that it should be abolished.
1.4.3.2. Con: The costs of putting to someone to death are largely on account of post-conviction proceedings and extra appeals, and so are not a necessary component of the system.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Several states have lowered that cost by [speeding up the pace of capital punishment](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2013/06/18/some-states-speed-up-death-penalty).
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: The proposed plans include limiting people's ability to appeal, which is not worth the potential economic saving.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Post-conviction proceedings necessitate keeping a prisoner on death row for many years.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Maintaining each death row prisoner costs [taxpayers](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty) $90,000 or more per year than a prisoner sentenced to life without possibility of parole in a maximum security prison.
1.4.3.2.3. Con: The greatest costs associated with the death penalty occur prior to and during the trial, not in post-conviction proceedings. Even if all post-conviction proceedings were abolished, the death penalty would still be [more expensive than alternative sentences](https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/death-penalty/death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-cost/).
1.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: Defending a death penalty case costs about four times as much as defending a case where the death penalty is not sought, according to a [study by the Kansas Judicial Council](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/5737).
1.4.4. Pro: Appeals procedures and additional, often complicated, requirements for death penalty cases clog the court system.
1.4.4.1. Pro: [Montana](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/new-voices-death-penalty-too-expensive-for-overburdened-courts)'s death penalty cases are incredibly complex. They involve twice as many attorneys and experts as non-capital cases, the jury selection process is incredibly time-consuming, and it requires more working hours than other cases. When factoring in appeals, these cases can go on for years, and keep the courts busy.
1.4.4.2. Con: Courts often expedite capital cases \([p. 350](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6974&context=ylj)\). This can help save time and costs.
1.4.4.3. Con: It is important that appeals take time so the courts can be as thorough as possible, since it is a matter of life and death \(p[. 309](https://www.ncsc.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/15188/why-so-long.pdf)\).
1.4.4.3.1. Con: It is possible for the courts to be more efficient, while also still ensuring that death-row defendants receive a full review of their conviction \([p. 310](https://www.ncsc.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/15188/why-so-long.pdf)\).
1.4.4.4. Pro: [A new study](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty-cases-colorado-take-six-times-longer-life-sentences)(The study, published in the University of Denver Criminal Law Review, found that LWOP cases required an average of 24.5 days of in-court time, while the death-penalty cases required 147.6 days.) of the cost of the death penalty in Colorado revealed that capital punishment proceedings require six times more days in court and take much longer to resolve than life-without-parole cases.
1.4.5. Con: Capital punishment contributes to solving the problem of [overpopulation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/01/26/the-worlds-most-overcrowded-prison-systems-infographic/) in the prison system.
1.4.5.1. Con: There are more humane methods of combating overpopulation in prisons.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Increasing access to [mental health services](https://www.floridatechonline.com/blog/criminal-justice/how-to-reduce-prison-overcrowding/)(Because mental illnesses and drug addiction place many in prison—often times as default—rather than in institutions that would actually benefit them and reduce recidivism, it is vital to see where the system can be reformed to help rather than punish those convicts.) has been shown to reduce crime to begin with, as well as reducing recidivism for those who have committed crime, therefore combating overpopulation.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: [Using furloughs](http://restorativejustice.org/am-site/media/overcrowding-en.pdf)(Unless there are legal obstacles, permit trustworthy prisoners to leave during the day or weekends for employment, family visitation or community service activities.) can help with overcrowding, as trustworthy prisoners can be permitted to leave for short time periods.
1.4.5.2. Con: There are not enough executions to have any significant effect on prison populations.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Texas, famous for its high execution rate, [executed 571 people](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/number-executions-state-and-region-1976) between 1976 and 2020, compared to a current [prison population](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/TX.html) of approximately 250,000.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: As of February 2021, only 205 inmates are on [Texas' death row.](https://apps.texastribune.org/death-row/)
1.4.5.3. Pro: The lack of carried-out death sentences is a major source of [prison overpopulation](https://futureofworking.com/10-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-death-penalty/).
1.5. Con: Capital punishment improves public safety.
1.5.1. Pro: The death penalty is an effective deterrent, preventing serious crimes from occuring in the first place.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Most crimes are committed as a result of a [cost-benefit analysis](https://qrius.com/economics-behind-people-commit-crimes/), therefore increasing the penalty would increase the associated costs of committing the crime and make the crime less likely to occur.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: As the vast majority of individuals want to avoid their lives being taken, it is very likely that the death penalty works as an effective deterrent.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Death is often referred to as "[paying the ultimate price](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pay-the-ultimate-price)", underscoring the societal consensus that death is the worst thing that could happen to a person.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Some criminals embrace death or view it as inevitable, and so would not be deterred by the death penalty.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Murderers often have [suicidal personalities](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/science/the-mind-of-those-who-kill-and-kill-themselves.html?_r=0).
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Familial murders are often [murder-suicides.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37011767) This is an extremely common form of murder, averaging more than ten a week in the US in the first half of 2014 \([p. 10](https://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2015.pdf)\).
1.5.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Many terrorists expect, and plan, to die committing their crime. The prospect of possibly being sentenced to die years later is hardly going to deter them \([p. 88](https://nasmhpd.org/sites/default/files/Suicide%20Terrorism%20sheehan-are-suicide-terrorist-suicidal-a-critical-assessment-of-the-evidence.pdf)\).
1.5.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Certain high-profile mass shootings, such as the [2017 Las Vegas Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting) shooting and the [Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting), ended with the perpetrator taking their own life.
1.5.1.1.1.2.3. Con: This does not preclude the possibility that deterrence could work for at least some criminals.
1.5.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The potential of preventing even a minority of crimes is important enough to be made a priority in the decision-making metric.
1.5.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: This is particularly true in the event that violent crimes like murder are prevented.
1.5.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: The possibility of deterring a small number of people may not be worth the death of some criminals.
1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: Irrespective of the rationality, most people [fear](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jul/25/we-fear-death-but-what-if-dying-isnt-as-bad-as-we-think) death.
1.5.1.1.1.3.1. Con: In a survey about their personal future, only [21.9%](https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2015/10/13/americas-top-fears-2015/) of respondents answered that they were "afraid" or "very afraid" of dying. In the same survey, only 16.8% of people said this with regards to their daily life.
1.5.1.1.1.4. Con: Most criminals do not assume that they will be caught for their crimes.
1.5.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Research has shown that increasing the severity of a punishment does not have much effect on crime, while increasing the certainty of punishment does have a deterrent effect \([p. 9](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Deterrence-in-Criminal-Justice.pdf)\).
1.5.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Statistically, there is a [40% chance](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/24/17896034/murder-crime-clearance-fbi-report) of getting away with homicide in the US.
1.5.1.1.1.4.3. Con: This is easily remedied by punishing criminals more often, showing that punishment is likely.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: This assumes humans to be totally rational beings, dispassionately weighing the options.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Homicides are often [crimes of passion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/crime_of_passion), and therefore insusceptible to rational deterrence.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.
1.5.1.2. Con: There remains no evidence that capital punishment effectively deters violent crime.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: States where the death penalty is still legal have [higher murder rates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates) than those that have abolished it.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: FBI data shows that all 14 states without capital punishment in 2008 had homicide rates at or below the national rate \([p. 8](https://www.amnestyusa.org/files/pdfs/deathpenaltyfacts.pdf)\).
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: That does not necessarily mean that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder. It is plausible that states with higher murder rates are motivated by that fact to support stronger anti-crime measures, including capital punishment.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Research has found [no significant correlation](https://fullfact.org/news/do-countries-death-penalty-have-higher-homicide-rates/)(Finally, Full Fact calculated if there was any correlation between countries imposing a death penalty and having higher homicide rates, as the averages would suggest. Ranking all 147 countries for which data was available in terms of homicide rate, and comparing this to whether the penalty existed or not, yielded a weak positive correlation of 0.2. This means that there is some correlation between imposing the death penalty and having higher homicide rates, but this correlation is in fact weak to bordering on insignificance.) between capital punishment and homicide rates.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: Twelve papers published by economists all conclude that capital punishment does deter murder \([p. 5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237588087_Statistical_Evidence_on_Capital_Punishment_and_the_Deterrence_of_Homicide)(Using improved data and more sophisticated regression techniques, twelve refereed papers have been published or are forthcoming in the economics literature. Their conclusion is unanimous: all of the modern refereed papers find a significant deterrent effect.)\).
1.5.1.2.4. Pro: Top criminologists do not believe that the death penalty acts as a [deterrent](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/study-88-of-criminologists-do-not-believe-the-death-penalty-is-an-effective-deterrent) to homicide.
1.5.1.2.4.1. Pro: [A UN survey](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml) in 1988 failed to provide scientific proof that executions have a greater deterrent effect than life imprisonment.
1.5.1.2.4.2. Pro: In a survey of professional associations of criminologists, 85% of the experts agreed that the empirical research on deterrence has shown that the death penalty never has been, is not, and never could be superior to long prison sentences as a deterrent to criminal violence \([p. 10](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=6901&context=jclc)\).
1.5.1.2.4.3. Pro: As two of the US' most experienced deterrence researchers concluded after their review of recent scholarship, "The available evidence remains 'clear and abundant' that, as practiced in the United States, capital punishment is not more effective than imprisonment in deterring murder" \([p. 155](https://books.google.ie/books?id=M84JCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.5.1.3. Pro: Capital punishment is a spectacle that serves to communicate to society what actions are heinous and deserving of the most extreme form of punishment.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Abolishing the death penalty may indicate that society is taking a [softer stance on crime](https://harvardpolitics.com/when-politics-turn-deadly-the-democrats-move-away-from-tough-on-crime/)(Leaders either supported putting serial killers to death, or they didn’t. It was therefore easy for supporters of the death penalty to paint opponents as soft on crime, as George H.W. Bush did in 1988; when Michael Dukakis said he could not support the death penalty even if someone killed his wife, Bush made this comment into a major campaign issue.).
1.5.1.3.2. Con: An execution is a single [event](https://iep.utm.edu/cap-puni/#H2)(The idea here is that an execution is a single, severe event, perhaps not long remembered by others, whereas life imprisonment provides a continuing reminder of the punishment for misconduct.), often not long remembered by others, whereas life imprisonment provides a continuing reminder of the punishment for misconduct.
1.5.1.3.2.1. Con: Elderly life-sentenced prisoners are considered an "[invisible](https://www.penalreform.org/blog/elderly-life-sentenced-prisoners-a-forgotten-and-invisible/)" group, showing that those imprisoned for life are not remembered by others.
1.5.1.4. Con: A punishment may both deter crime and be unjust.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: If torture were used as punishment, that would likely deter crime \([p. 16](https://law.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/04/Hajjar_Does-Torture-Work.pdf)\). However, the fact that it deters crime would not make it any less unjust.
1.5.1.4.2. Con: Since justice, as a concept, is nebulous and difficult to [define](https://people.howstuffworks.com/what-is-justice.htm), the justification for a policy like the death penalty must emanate from consequential and verifiable metrics.
1.5.1.4.3. Pro: It is immoral to use people as a means to an end in punishing them to try and alter the behaviour of others.
1.5.1.5. Con: The number of death sentences executed is too low to count as a deterrent against the high number of committed murders.
1.5.1.5.1. Pro: [According to FBI figures](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/table-11), there were 16,470 murders in the US in 2016, and well over a million violent crimes generally. By comparison, the US executed only 20 people in 2016, so even a murderer faces a miniscule chance of execution.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely that someone committing a crime would conceive of the possibility of receiving the death penalty, since it is such a small probability.
1.5.2. Pro: Capital punishment ensures that convicted criminals do not offend again.
1.5.2.1. Con: A criminal who believes they will be executed for one crime they've already committed has no reason not to commit further crimes, since they will already be subjected to the ultimate penalty.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: If the death penalty were abolished, the most severe punishment would be life imprisonment. In that instance, if a criminal committed a crime that would result in life imprisonment, they would equally be willing to commit more crimes as there would be no greater punishment than the one they were already due.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Capital cases in the US are [structured](https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/resources/trialprocess) such that a finding of guilt does not guarantee the imposition of the death penalty.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: A criminal who fears the death penalty may engage in the intimidation of either witnesses or jury members.
1.5.2.1.4. Pro: Criminals may be more erratic and violent in their attempts to evade capture if they believe their arrest could lead to their death.
1.5.2.2. Con: When the state executes someone, they risk making them a [martyr](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/24/september11.usa), and offering their supporters and colleagues a reason to commit further crimes.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Some criminals can be portrayed in a [sympathetic light](https://time.com/5825475/true-crime-victim-families/) by the media, leading people to grow to [idolise](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ted-bundy-netflix-chris-watts-women-who-love-serial-killers-hot-felon_n_5cbf5ee4e4b0a5de6e3e931a) them.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Many criminals are [idolized](https://harpymagazine.com/home-1/2019/5/17/why-are-women-so-infatuated-with-serial-killers) even when they are in prison.
1.5.2.2.1.2. Con: As seen with the case of the Zodiac killer, the identity of the original criminal need not even be known for them to inspire "[copycat crimes](https://people.howstuffworks.com/5-copycat-killers.htm#page=9)". Therefore, whether the criminal faces the death penalty or not is unlikely to impact such a phenomenon.
1.5.2.2.1.3. Pro: In the past, there has been an [outpouring of support](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/12/07/misplaced_sympathy_for_killers/) for criminals who are sentenced to death.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: Most people will not want to risk their own safety or security to attain revenge for someone else.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: This only applies to the types of criminals who have followers in the first place.
1.5.2.2.4. Pro: Anyone who is executed, having committed a crime with an ideological motive, could become a [martyr](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/15/opinions/parini-death-penalty-tsarnaev/index.html)(This punishment only continues the cycle of violence, and it will not bring peace. In fact, the execution of Tsarnaev will transform him into a martyr, and millions around the world will find fresh reasons to dislike the United States.) and an inspiration for future killers.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Inmates can still escape from prison and commit crimes. Capital punishment removes this possibility.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Inmates spend so long on death row, that there is an opportunity for them to escape too. This has [occurred](https://leelofland.com/escape-from-death-row-the-briley-brothers-2/) in the past.
1.5.2.3.2. Con: This is a highly unlikely scenario since someone who has managed to escape prison will not want to draw attention to themselves by committing crimes.
1.5.2.3.3. Pro: In December 2000, members of the [Texas Seven](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/texas-seven-prison-break) escaped from prison and went on a crime spree.
1.5.2.4. Pro: A dead criminal cannot commit another crime.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: Life without parole can also make sure that a convicted criminal does not ever offend again.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: Many criminals who are only incarcerated continue to [arrange and indirectly commit crimes](http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/sep/24/federal-indictments-say-prison-gangs-used-cellphones-run-crime-rings/326926/) through associates on the outside.
1.5.2.4.1.1.1. Con: This can be remedied by limiting the contact prisoners are allowed to maintain with the outside world.
1.5.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are [no legal barriers](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/1994/mar/15/the-rights-of-visiting-and-visitors/) to curtailing the access of prisoners to the outside world.
1.5.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: [Mobile phones](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/corrections/southern-prisons-have-smuggled-cellphone-problem-n790251) are often used by inmates to order murders or other crimes on the outside.
1.5.2.4.1.1.2.1. Con: This problem could be solved by having stricter monitoring in jails, to ensure that inmates cannot access phones.
1.5.2.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Mobile phones are [endemic](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/corrections/southern-prisons-have-smuggled-cellphone-problem-n790251) in the prison system, to the degree that getting rid of them would likely be near impossible.
1.5.2.4.1.2. Con: In most states, life without parole is handed out far less frequently than life with parole \([p. 4](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Facts-of-Life.pdf)\).
1.5.2.4.1.3. Pro: Prisoners cannot commit crimes when in prison forever \([p. 163](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1127902/files/fulltext.pdf)(One traditional function of prison has, so far, been ignored in this paper: incapacitation. Bad actors who are imprisoned theoretically cannot commit further bad acts.)\).
1.5.2.4.2. Con: The risk of recidivism among the types of criminals who would be receiving the death penalty, such as murderers, is low.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: Among those whose death sentences were commuted in 1972, only about one percent went on to kill again \([p. 27](https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1612&context=llr)\).
1.5.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Punishments are typically [commuted for low-risk prisoners](http://theconversation.com/reduced-sentencing-for-nonviolent-criminals-what-does-the-public-think-103730), who are unlikely to re-offend. This may not be true of the general group on death row.
1.5.2.4.2.1.2. Con: The commutation of one percent of murderers in 1972 still led to the seven additional killings, and thus seven additional innocent lives taken \([p. 27](https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1612&context=llr)\).
1.5.2.4.2.2. Con: A study has shown that 54% of homicide offenders recidivated \([p. 8](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259809249_Criminal_Recidivism_Among_Homicide_Offenders)\).
1.5.2.4.2.2.1. Con: Only 3% of cases studied saw the released criminal commit another homicide \([p. 8](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259809249_Criminal_Recidivism_Among_Homicide_Offenders)\).
1.5.2.4.2.3. Pro: The Irish Prison Service have said that those who committed homicides were the least likely of all categories of offenders to reoffend \([p. 13](http://www.irishprisons.ie/images/pdf/recidivismstudyss2.pdf)\).
1.5.2.4.2.4. Pro: Of 368 murderers granted parole in New York between 1999 and 2003, only six were returned to prison within three years for a new felony conviction, with none of them a [violent offense](https://thecrimereport.org/2011/01/07/low-recidivism-rate-reported-for-paroled-ny-murderers/).
1.5.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.1.4.
1.5.3. Con: By abolishing the death penalty, the state would save money that could be reinvested in public safety.
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Spending money on additional police officers or drug rehabilitation would be a [more effective](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/abolish-death-penalty-invest-public-safety) way to improve public safety.
1.5.3.3. Con: Only [3 percent](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/criminal-justice-police-corrections-courts-expenditures) of state and local expenditure goes towards corrections as is, and so the redirection of money would be relatively insignificant.
1.5.3.4. Con: Given the pervasiveness of the [prison industrial complex](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2012/jan/15/the-societal-impact-of-the-prison-industrial-complex-or-incarceration-for-fun-and-profitmostly-profit/), it is unlikely that money taken from corrections would go towards effective public safety regimes.
1.5.4. Con: Public policy that allows for the death penalty [weakens the social principle against killing people](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~unger/articles/deathPenalty.html).
1.5.4.1. Con: Removing the ultimate punishment of death, for the ultimate crime of homicide, cheapens the value of human life, and makes it more likely that people will kill in the future.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: The use of the death penalty does not decrease violence in society; it increases it instead.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: Lower [murder rates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/study-international-data-shows-declining-murder-rates-after-abolition-of-death-penalty) in non-death penalty nations show that murder rates have less to do with the value of human life than the general morality that exists within any one society.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: The gravity of the death penalty shows the high regard society holds for human life.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that the state is willing to take someone's life for the crime of homicide shows the severity with which society views such crimes.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The state can break the cycle of violence initiated by the murderer by taking a stand against execution, thereby demonstrating that killing is immoral.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: The state already does much to break the cycle of violence by including due process, equality under the law, and maintaining a legal monopoly on violence.
1.5.4.3. Pro: A state should not have the power to either give life or take away somebody’s life.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: States have both the right and the moral obligation to punish offenders, and such punishment is not only intrinsically good or right, but also sufficient to justify punishment \([p. 704](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/73389/OSJCL_V9N2_699.pdf)\).
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.5.4.3.3. Pro: The state should not be involved in premeditated killing.
1.6. Pro: The death penalty violates the norms we value as a society.
1.6.1. Pro: The death penalty generates too many ethical difficulties for those involved in the justice system.
1.6.1.1. Con: The justice system has to frequently face difficult questions. Changing policies due to ethical problems is not pragmatic. Otherwise we would not be able to incarcerate people at all.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: [Some jury members](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/15/us/juries-reject-death-penalty-in-nearly-all-federal-trials.html?mcubz=1) are reluctant to convict if it means putting someone to death.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: If juries are less likely to convict in death penalty cases, this creates an unequal justice system, where people are more or less likely to be found guilty of their crimes, based on what the punishment could be.
1.6.1.1.1.2. Con: This is arguably a good thing, as it means juries are unlikely to convict in all but the most cut-and-dry cases.
1.6.1.2. Con: The people who end up in positions like these are aware of the work that they will have to do. It is not coercive.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Jury members are [screened](https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/resources/deathqualification) to ensure they have no principled opposition to the death penalty.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Those involved in administering the actual death penalty, once it has been decided that that it is the appropriate punishment, face a strong ethical dilemma.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: With modern technology, the death penalty could eventually be automated.
1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: New technologies and the automation of executions still require people to sentence a human being to death. Therefore, many of the ethical difficulties remain.
1.6.1.3.1.2. Con: Automation only transfers the responsibility from the executer to the engineers and coders designing such technologies.
1.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: Euthanasia experts already have designed and produced an almost fully automated [suicide machine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/15/a-euthanasia-expert-just-unveiled-his-suicide-machine-at-an-amsterdam-funeral-fair/?utm_term=.587ce0ffaf89).
1.6.1.3.2. Con: The ethical difficulties of the death penalty could be overcome if the people chosen to be involved in administering the death penalty themselves did not have any ethical qualms.
1.6.1.3.2.1. Pro: Many enforcers of the death penalty view themselves as [protectors](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-enforcers-of-the-death-penalty/379901/), not murderers, and so would have no ethical issues with being involved in the process.
1.6.1.3.2.2. Con: Deferring such a delicate procedure to individuals who might not only claim no qualms but might actively seek the thrill of the occasion is a deeply disturbing prospect.
1.6.1.3.3. Con: In some execution methods, multiple people are involved in the process, but not all of them are the true executioner – that is left to mystery in order to relieve their ethical concerns.
1.6.1.3.3.1. Pro: In a firing squad, one of the marksmen is usually given a [blank cartridge](https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/execution/firing-squad/)(Although each firing squad member must fire, one of the shooters usually receives a gun with a blank. This ensures that no one in the group is able to know for sure which of them fired the fatal round.). This leaves the shooters with some peace of mind that they may not have fired the lethal shot.
1.6.1.3.3.2. Pro: Some states use a system which involves multiple IV lines, with three executioners. It is [not known](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/us0406/5.htm)(Three executioners plunge eleven syringes in a complicated sequence, alternating the drugs between the left and right arms. It is not known who, if anyone, directs the sequence of drug administration for the executioners.) who administers the sequence of drugs which actually kills the convict.
1.6.1.3.3.3. Con: Only [some states](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/us0406/5.htm) use methods to mask the true executioner, leaving most executioners to know were they are the true killer.
1.6.1.3.3.4. Con: The involvement of multiple people in the execution process can lead to more people being exposed to the negative psychological consequences of ending a human life.
1.6.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: While some measures cast a veil over the true executioner, this leaves more people to live with the possibility that they may be the one who killed the convict.
1.6.1.3.4. Pro: Medical professionals will often be forced to violate their individual code of ethics in order to administer or supervise the death penalty.
1.6.1.3.4.1. Pro: [Lethal injection](https://ethics.harvard.edu/event/excellent-execution-why-physicians-participate-lethal-injection-prisoners) requires medical personnel being directly involved in killing. This is a fundamental contravention of medical ethics.
1.6.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Death penalty undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine — to [do no harm.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/first-do-no-harm-201510138421)
1.6.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Physicians perform euthanasia where they act in the best interest of their patients by ending their lives.
1.6.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Capital punishment lacks the [informed consent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070710/)(In all jurisdictions, the request for euthanasia or pas \(physician assisted suicide\) has to be voluntary, well-considered, informed, and persistent over time. The requesting person must provide explicit written consent and must be competent at the time the request is made.) which is a necessity with euthanasia or assisted suicide.
1.6.1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Some medical professionals aid in the administration of the death penalty to try and minimize the pain and suffering of the inmate \([p. 1286](https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/186433?path=/bmj/342/7810/Feature.full.pdf)(Reasons for the doctors’ willingness to participate range from religious and political beliefs to the idea that it is important to try to minimise the suffering of convicts right up to their time of death.)\).
1.6.1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: The [Hippocratic Oath](https://www.medicinenet.com/hippocratic_oath/definition.htm)("I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect."), which is foundational to the ethics of modern medicine, contains prohibitions against giving lethal drugs to people.
1.6.1.3.4.1.2. Con: The American Medical Association [disallows](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1775)(Both the American Medical Association \(AMA\) and the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians \(NAEMT\) recently issued public statements reminding members of their ethical obligation not to participate in legally authorized executions. As courts and legislatures throughout the country continue to struggle with questions related to lethal injection procedures, AMA president William G. Plested III noted that AMA policy clearly prohibits medical professionals from participating in executions because it “erodes public confidence in the medical profession.”) its members from participating in executions. When they do not participate, the ethical conflict is avoided.
1.6.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: The top medical officer for Washington State's Department of Corrections [resigned](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/washington-prison-doctor-quits-over-death-penalty-1/)(The state Department of Corrections’ top medical officer has resigned, saying that the use of agency staff members to prepare for an execution is unethical.) prior to the 2008 execution of Darold Ray Stenson believing that participation in executions violated his professional ethics.
1.6.1.3.4.2. Con: There are methods of execution that do not require a doctor, such as electrocution, hanging, lethal gas and firing squad.
1.6.1.3.4.2.1. Con: At present, lethal injection is the most [common method](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution) of execution in the US.
1.6.1.3.4.2.2. Con: All of these methods have severe flaws, which is why they are no longer used.
1.6.1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: Electrocution causes a horrific and painful death. It often fails to kill too; there have been [84 botched electrocutions in US](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions) history.
1.6.1.3.4.2.2.2. Pro: Hanging is unreliable and causes a painful and slow death by strangulation, which is why in [1886](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a25689/gerry-commission-report-methods-of-execution/), New York State created a commission which sought to find alternatives.
1.6.1.3.4.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.6.1.3.4.2.2.4. Pro: The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that gas chambers, as a method of instituting the death penalty, constituted [cruel and unusual punishment](https://www.lectlaw.com/files/cas73.htm)(The district court's findings of extreme pain, the length of time this extreme pain lasts, and the substantial risk that inmates will suffer this extreme pain for several minutes require the conclusion that execution by lethal gas is cruel and unusual. Accordingly, we conclude that execution by lethal gas under the California protocol is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual and violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.).
1.6.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Tennessee has recently been executing people by [electric chair.](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/20/us/nick-sutton-execution/index.html)(Sutton, 58, had been on death row since 1985. He was the fifth person to die by electric chair in Tennessee since November 2018.)
1.6.1.3.4.3. Pro: It is not ethical to make another human being carry the weight of killing someone.
1.6.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: [Dr. Allen Ault](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26273051)("I still have nightmares," he told me. \[...\]\n"It's the most premeditated form of murder you can possibly imagine and it stays in your psyche for ever."), who was corrections commissioner for Georgia until 1995, was unable to get past the memories of his actions.
1.6.1.3.5. Pro: [Correctional officers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/federal-executions-trauma/602785/) face great trauma on account of their involvement in the administration of the death penalty.
1.6.1.3.5.1. Pro: Prison guards have reported post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and even personality changes on account of their involvement in [executions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201810/prison-executioners-face-job-related-trauma)(As illustrated in Into the Abyss, a documentary detailing the death sentence of convicted killer Michael Perry, many execution guards experience post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\). One guard explained his acute symptoms at the outset of his descent into PTSD. He began crying and shaking uncontrollably when “the eyes of all the inmates he had executed began flashing before him.” Another developed nightmares, cold sweats, and sleeplessness.\n\nOther guards, like Givens, have reported depression, inability to sustain relationships, and changes in personality.).
1.6.1.3.5.2. Pro: Working on [death row](https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2019/07/the-death-penalty-punishes-pas-corrections-workers-too-opinion.html)(The work hardens you in order to survive it. It can make you frozen inside – sometimes to a point where even your loved ones’ own tears won’t move you. Some officers indulge in alcohol, drugs or other dangerous behaviors to find relief. Some isolate and leave their families. Some have even taken their own lives when it becomes too overwhelming. The stress on death row staff is seldom-discussed but undeniably real. Each tour of duty on death row makes you feel less human.) can be incredibly challenging for prison officers.
1.6.1.3.5.3. Con: Correctional officers have a [maximum amount](https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2019/07/the-death-penalty-punishes-pas-corrections-workers-too-opinion.html)(No officer is permitted to work there longer than two years, and most “tours of duty” on the row are much shorter.) of time they can spend working on death row.
1.6.1.3.5.3.1. Con: There would be no need to institute a maximum time working on death row if there was nothing traumatic about working on death row. Thus, the limit to the time implies that the occupation is indeed traumatic.
1.6.1.4. Pro: The gravity and severity of the death penalty may mean that complainants may not come forward, for fear of having the death of someone on their conscience \([p. 10](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/pdf/nasw-07-343-11-14-07.pdf)(The threat of capital punishment for child sexual abusers greatly amplifies the concerns that already prevent many victims and relatives from reporting abuse. Victims who love their abusers maybe all the more reluctant to report abuse to police when the possible consequences include lethal injection.)\).
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Non-offending family members in situations of abuse, who already find it difficult to come forward, are less likely to report what they know to authorities on account of the death penalty \([p. 10](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/pdf/nasw-07-343-11-14-07.pdf)(Likewise, a non-offending family member, already facing “a difficult decision to make, will face an even harder choice. Instead of encouraging the best positioned witnesses—the victim and other family members—to report abuse, Louisiana’s law will reinforce the internal constraints that victims and their family members may already feel.)\).
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.1.
1.6.3. Pro: Killing people is against most religions.
1.6.3.1. Pro: The [Union for Reform Judaism](https://reformjudaism.org/why-reform-judaism-opposes-death-penalty), which represents the majority of American Jews, has called for total abolition of the death penalty since 1959.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: Jewish laws approve of the use of the death penalty.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: The [Torah](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/capital.shtml) lays down certain crimes for which the death penalty is the punishment.
1.6.3.1.1.2. Con: The [Talmud](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/capital.shtml) created so many barriers to actually using the death penalty that in practical terms, it is almost impossible to actually use it.
1.6.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The Talmud still [allows](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zhts4wx/revision/4) for capital punishment in spite of these barriers.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: The Union for Reform Judaism is the [largest](https://urj.org/organizations-reform-movement) Jewish organization in all of North America.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Con: The Union for Reform Judaism does not speak for all Jews, but only for [1.5 million Jews](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/union-of-reform-judaism)(The Union of Reform Judaism \(formerly the Union of American Hebrew Congregations\) is an association of the more than 900 Reform and Liberal congregations of the U.S. and Canada, representing some 1.5 million Jews, with headquarters in New York.) out of a global population of [14.7 million](https://ajn.timesofisrael.com/global-jewish-population-hits-14-7-million/).
1.6.3.1.3. Con: Many Jews are in [favour](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zhts4wx/revision/4)(Many Jews believe that capital punishment is acceptable but that it should be used as a last resort. People who are unlikely to reform and who are a threat to society should be given the death penalty.) of capital punishment, albeit only as a last resort.
1.6.3.2. Con: Religion is not demonstrably true.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Religion is [not objective](https://theobjectivestandard.com/2017/04/religion-is-super-subjectivism/), nor is there consensus about it on this or any point.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Religion stands in conflict with science, which is verifiable and [evidence-based](https://theconversation.com/yes-there-is-a-war-between-science-and-religion-108002)(I’ll construe “science” as the set of tools we use to find truth about the universe, with the understanding that these truths are provisional rather than absolute. These tools include observing nature, framing and testing hypotheses, trying your hardest to prove that your hypothesis is wrong to test your confidence that it’s right, doing experiments and above all replicating your and others’ results to increase confidence in your inference.).
1.6.3.2.2.1. Con: Religion can also not be proven to be [untrue](https://www.thecut.com/2014/11/we-like-it-when-our-beliefs-cant-be-disproven.html).
1.6.3.2.3. Con: Whether religion is true or not, [many people](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/27/religion-why-is-faith-growing-and-what-happens-next)(If you think religion belongs to the past and we live in a new age of reason, you need to check out the facts: 84% of the world’s population identifies with a religious group.) believe in it, and so basing laws on it is appropriate.
1.6.3.3. Pro: [Christianity](https://www.prisonfellowship.org/resources/advocacy/sentencing/the-death-penalty/)(Although the Law may sound bloodthirsty, it was applied with great restraint. In Ezekiel 33:11 God laments, "As sure as I live . . . I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live." The Lawgiver Himself was reluctant to impose the death penalty, preferring that the wrongdoers repent.) argues that the death penalty denies the criminal the time they may need to repent and reconcile with God.
1.6.3.3.1. Con: [Christians](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/capitalpunishment_1.shtml) argue both for and against capital punishment.
1.6.3.3.2. Pro: In 2018, the [Vatican](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-deathpenalty-idUSKBN1KN1EQ) changed their teachings to oppose the death penalty.
1.6.3.3.3. Con: Multiple parts of the Bible support the use of the death penalty.
1.6.3.3.3.1. Con: The Bible says "[Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A7&version=NIV)". This has been interpreted as an opposition to the death penalty \([p. 758](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1757&context=facultypub)(From these texts, it certainly can be argued that at least some biblical figures or writers opposed capital punishment. Judgment should be left to God, who preferred that offenders be permitted to live, so that they might turn around or repent; or at any rate live out their lives as exiles or fugitives.)\).
1.6.3.3.3.1.1. Con: The biblical passage in which Jesus says, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone," is not original to ancient manuscripts. The story, which is only found in the [Gospel of John](https://spectrummagazine.org/article/2007/12/18/misquoting-jesus-story-behind-who-changed-bible-and-why)(It appears in only one passage \(John 7:53-8:12\), and it appears not to have been original even there. As it turns out, it was not originally in the Gospel of John. In fact, it was not originally part of any of the Gospels but was added by later scribes. The writing style is very different from what is found in the rest of John and includes a large number of words and phrases that are otherwise alien to the Gospel.), is widely thought to have been added by later scribes.
1.6.3.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.6.3.3.3.3. Pro: There are many actions which the Bible deems [capital offences](https://www.christianbiblereference.org/faq_CapitalPunishment.htm), such as murder, blasphemy, and engaging in homosexual acts.
1.6.3.3.3.4. Con: [Exodus 20:13](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm) says "thou shall not kill", without making reference to any exceptions.
1.6.3.3.3.4.1. Con: A [closer translation](https://apholt.com/2015/03/17/thou-shalt-not-kill-vs-thou-shalt-not-murder/) would be "thou shall not murder". The Old Testament clearly allows and even promotes killing, and modern scholars translate the Hebrew as "murder" rather than "kill".
1.6.3.3.3.5. Pro: [Genesis 9:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/9/Genesis-9-6.html) says "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind". This supports the notion that a murderer should be put to [death](https://answersingenesis.org/sanctity-of-life/capital-punishment-today/).
1.6.3.4. Con: Islam [accepts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/capitalpunishment.shtml) capital punishment on the whole.
1.6.3.5. Con: In spite of this, violence and murder have been a large part of the history of most religions.
1.6.3.5.1. Pro: [32,000 people](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Spanish-Inquisition) were executed during the Spanish Inquisition.
1.6.3.5.2. Pro: Muslims and Christians have fought [wars](https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79706&page=1) in the past.
1.6.3.5.3. Con: What religions have done in the past is irrelevant to their current teachings.
1.6.4. Pro: International norms are against the death penalty.
1.6.4.1. Con: As of 2020, [56 countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45835584) still have the death penalty on their books, and billions of people live within capital punishment jurisdictions.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: These countries should not serve as models for the US, as most are not democracies. Most major democracies have abolished and condemned the death penalty.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: There are other very successful democracies which carry out the death penalty, such as [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Japan) and [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country#Industrialized_countries).
1.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: [Singapore](https://harvardpolitics.com/singapores-stubborn-authoritarianism/) has been considered an authoritarian state from its inception.
1.6.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Japan has recently been upgraded to being considered a "[full democracy](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO2102/S00047/japan-south-korea-and-taiwan-upgraded-to-full-democracies-in-the-eius-2020-democracy-index.htm)".
1.6.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Japan has been accused of trending towards [authoritarianism](https://www.thecaravelgu.com/blog/2020/4/17/opinion-shinzo-abe-is-eroding-japanese-democracy)(While some applaud Abe's aggressive economic policies, not only has he failed to fulfill his promises, he has actively made Japan a more authoritarian state.) in the recent past.
1.6.4.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Japanese democracy is [robust](https://www.brookings.edu/research/japans-consolidated-democracy-in-an-era-of-populist-turbulence/), and has stood strong against the rise in populism.
1.6.4.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Japan's upgrade to being considered a "full democracy" came only as it had its [first year](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20201229/p2a/00m/0na/011000c) in almost a decade without executions.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Pro: A total of [106 nations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/death-penalty-in-2019-facts-and-figures/), more than half of the world, abolished the death penalty by 2019.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Every country faces its own unique challenges, and as a result, some countries require different laws than others. This can include instituting the death penalty.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Morality and justice are universal, centralizing concepts. Therefore, democratic countries face similar moral challenges, and should conclude to similar lawmaking.
1.6.4.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Some countries see more or less [violence](https://www.theweek.co.uk/64495/what-are-the-safest-and-most-dangerous-countries-in-the-world) than others. As a result, some countries may need to use different methods to tackle crime.
1.6.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: The US carries out more executions than most other liberal democracies in the world. This is incompatible with the US' status as "world's greatest democracy".
1.6.4.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: No country which carried out more executions than the US in [2018](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/the-10-countries-with-the-highest-number-of-executions-in-2018?slide=11) is considered a democracy.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: The US is not considered a [pariah state](https://www.worlddata.info/pariahstates.php) since many other states continue to practice the death penalty too.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The death penalty violates human rights.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Capital punishment is a form of [torture](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx), which is a recognized violation of human rights, since it can lead to enormous pain and suffering.
1.6.4.2.1.1. Con: There are painless methods of execution, such as [inert gas asphyxiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation), which occurs without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation.
1.6.4.2.1.1.1. Con: The US Supreme Court has ruled [against](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/01/politics/supreme-court-death-penalty-bucklew/index.html) the use of inert gas asphyxiation as of 2019.
1.6.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Since torture requires [physical pain](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/torture/), inert gas asphyxiation would not constitute torture.
1.6.4.2.1.2. Pro: With hanging, an option still available in [Washington and Delaware](http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/c/about/methods/hanging.htm), if the rope is too long, the inmate could be decapitated, and if it is too short, the strangulation could take as long as 45 minutes.
1.6.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: There have been [85](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/botched-executions) botched hangings between 1890 and 2010.
1.6.4.2.1.2.2. Con: The last execution by hanging took place in [1996](https://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/c/about/methods/hanging.htm)(Hanging is still used in Delaware and Washington, although both have lethal injection as an alternative method of execution. The last hanging to take place was January 25, 1996 in Delaware.).
1.6.4.2.1.2.3. Con: Both Delaware and Washington still have lethal injections as an [alternative](https://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/c/about/methods/hanging.htm) to hanging.
1.6.4.2.1.3. Pro: Living conditions on [death row](http://www.worldcoalition.org/Death-penalty-is-torture.html)(The link between torture and the death penalty is particularly obvious when considering the living conditions on death row: insufficient access to food or medical care, isolation, the restricted amount of visits and support from family and relatives.) have been likened to torture.
1.6.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: Most death row inmates spend [23 hours a day](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/oct/10/death-row-torture-chamber)(Inmates are locked up for 23 hours a day in solitary confinement for an average of 14 years. That meets the definition of torture) in solitary confinement.
1.6.4.2.1.3.2. Con: This is an argument for minimizing the amount of time spent on death row, not abolishing capital punishment.
1.6.4.2.1.4. Pro: Execution by lethal injection could be considered [torture](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/torture/)(Torture is when somebody in an official capacity inflicts severe mental or physical pain or suffering on somebody else for a specific purpose.).
1.6.4.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.1.
1.6.4.2.1.4.2. Pro: Lethal injection can lead to pain and suffering, and not even achieve its desired ends.
1.6.4.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: An Ohio man [survived a botched execution](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/ohio-inmate-romell-brown-who-survived-2009-execution-appeals-high-n636311)(The state stopped Broom's execution after two hours when executioners failed to find a usable vein following 18 attempts to insert needles.), raising ethical concerns over the practice of capital punishment.
1.6.4.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: In Alabama, a man had to suffer [for three hours](http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/death-row-inmate-survives-botched-lethal-injection/)(On the night of February 22, 2018, the state of Alabama attempted to execute inmate Doyle Lee Hamm, a 61-year-old who's spent the past 30 years on death row. However, after almost three hours and 12 puncture wounds, midnight was approaching and the death warrant was set to expire. Hamm left the execution chamber, bloodied and bruised, but alive.) in the execution chamber due to unsuccessful lethal injections. Finally, he left the chamber injured and bruised, but alive.
1.6.4.2.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.1.5.2.
1.6.4.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.1.1.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: If the death penalty is legal, then it in fact does not violate human rights. Rights exist in law and are not inherent to the universe's nature.
1.6.4.2.2.1. Con: Human rights are '[universal](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)'; every human being has these these rights irrespective of the national legislation.
1.6.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Philosophers like John Locke argued that every person has rights, like the rights to life and liberty, which are derived from [nature](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/), and so everyone has them independent of conduct.
1.6.4.2.2.2. Con: Countries can adopt laws which are later found to be in violation of human rights \([p. 330](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282\(13\)00521-9/pdf)\).
1.6.4.2.2.3. Pro: The idea that [rights](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2018/Jasaynonaturalrights.html) are anything more than a construction of the law is an assumption without any verifiable basis.
1.6.4.2.3. Pro: Capital punishment violates international human rights treaties and declarations.
1.6.4.2.3.1. Pro: The death penalty violates several articles of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) by abridging the right to life.
1.6.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: The United Nations has adopted resolutions condemning the death penalty based on [Article 3](https://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/article_3.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person”.
1.6.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly first adopted a resolution which called for a [moratorium](https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/62/149) on the use of the death penalty.
1.6.4.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: The United Nations General Assembly adopted [eight resolutions](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/12/un-opposition-to-the-death-penalty-continues-to-grow/)(This is the eighth time UNGA has adopted a resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, with a view to abolishing the death penalty, since 2007. The number of states voting in favour of these resolutions has risen from 104 in 2007 to 121 in 2018 and 123 in 2020.) between 2007 and 2020 calling for an end to the death penalty.
1.6.4.2.3.1.1.3. Con: Article 3 does not expressly forbid the death penalty \([p. 2817](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144225018.pdf)(After all, while the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in article 3, says that everyone has the 'right to life, liberty, and security of person,' and, in article 5, states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to 'cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment', neither article explicitly forbids the death penalty.)\).
1.6.4.2.3.1.2. Con: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights itself is not [legally binding.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/universal-declaration-of-human-rights/)
1.6.4.2.3.2. Con: This is based strictly on codified international human rights law and ignores [customary international law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/customary_international_law) - which is also considered a primary source of international law.
1.6.4.2.3.2.1. Con: The trend in customary international law, according to some scholars, is that the death penalty will soon be considered a violation of international law \([p. 10](https://studylib.net/doc/8909468/the-death-penalty-under-international-law)(While Human Rights Committee decisions are not binding, this decision supports the assertion that the human rights discourse surrounding the death penalty is expanding. It is highly likely that, eventually, international customary law will view the death penalty as a breach of the right to life, the prohibition against torture, and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.)\).
1.6.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: As of 2020, the death penalty is not currently prohibited under customary international law \([p. 2](https://www.pgaction.org/pdf/2020-10-24-webinar-background_en.pdf)(The death penalty is not prohibited under customary international law or any international instrument which could be considered universal.)\).
1.6.4.2.3.3. Con: Since there is no [supranational body](https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/1/issue/1/enforcing-international-law) capable of enforcing international law, most lawyers do not consider international law to be [binding](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/netherworld-nonbonding-agreements/) or enforceable.
1.6.4.2.3.4. Pro: [Article 6](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to life of citizens, and states that no one shall be deprived of their life arbitrarily.
1.6.4.2.3.4.1. Con: Article 6 does not apply in situations where a [fair trial](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx)(In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present Covenant and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a competent court.) has been granted.
1.6.4.2.3.4.2. Pro: The [Second Optional Protocol](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/2ndopccpr.aspx) to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights calls on countries to abolish the death penalty.
1.6.4.2.3.4.2.1. Con: This Protocol has only be ratified by [85 countries](https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/10/568172-death-penalty-has-no-place-21st-century-un-chief-guterres)(The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \(ICCPR\), now ratified by 85 States around the globe, requires its parties to abolish death penalty. It is the only universal international legal instrument that aims to end the practice.) around the world.
1.6.4.2.4. Con: [International human rights bodies](https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/death-penalty/death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-mental-illness/) have recognized that executing someone with a mental illness is a violation of their human rights. Some US states [prohibit](https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/09/ohio-could-soon-exempt-killers-serious-mental-illnesses-death-penalty/3793903001/) these types of executions in line with international standards.
1.6.4.2.4.1. Pro: [Mentally ill](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30316117) convicts are only put to death if it can be assessed that they have a rational understanding of their crimes and the punishment for their crimes.
1.6.4.2.4.1.1. Con: The National Association of Mental Health has estimated that 5 to 10% of those on death row have serious mental illnesses \([p. 11](https://www.amnestyusa.org/files/pdfs/deathpenaltyfacts.pdf)\).
1.6.4.2.4.2. Con: Numerous [capital inmates](https://www.aclu.org/report/report-mental-illness-and-death-penalty?redirect=mental-illness-and-death-penalty) suffering from serious mental illnesses have been executed, in violation of their human rights.
1.6.4.2.4.3. Pro: In [Ford v. Wainwright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/477/399/) \(1986\), the US Supreme Court banned the execution of inmates who were insane.
1.6.4.2.4.3.1. Con: The dissent in the [Ford v. Wainwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_v._Wainwright) decision, however, left the determination of sanity up to each state.
1.6.4.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: In 2005, Texas declared a man [sane](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/texas-execution-mentally-ill-history-scott-panetti) enough for execution even though there were considerable indications that he was not.
1.6.4.2.4.3.2. Pro: In legal terms, [insanity](http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=979) is defined as "mental illness of such a severe nature that a person cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis, or is subject to uncontrollable impulsive behavior." This definition is broad and captures many people.
1.6.4.2.4.3.2.1. Con: This definition still fails to take into account all those with mental illnesses.
1.6.4.2.4.3.3. Con: Courts have struggled to define what is meant by 'the competency to be executed', which was the legal term introduced by Ford v. Wainright \([p. 239](http://jaapl.org/content/jaapl/42/2/234.full.pdf)\).
1.6.4.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: The test in Ford v. Wainright is not considered rigorous enough \([p. 1498](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4516&context=wlulr)(The U.S. Supreme Court needs to more fully and specifically define the range of severity of mental illness sufficient to bar the carrying out of the death penalty. The “insanity” test of Ford v. Wainright is not rigorous enough, and the jumbled conclusions of Panetti v. Quarterman give little concrete guidance to the lower courts in their determination of where to draw the line regarding mental illness among those on death row.)\).
1.6.4.2.5. Pro: The right to life is [universal and inalienable](https://bangkok.ohchr.org/what-are-human-rights/); even the worst offenders cannot be deprived of this right.
1.6.4.2.5.1. Pro: A new emphasis on the value of the individual and human life, as demonstrated by the institutionalized global human rights regime, [drove](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/669507)(The main finding in three separate models on full, ordinary, and de facto cumulative measures of abolition show that the global sacralization of the individual, measured as the institutionalization of the human rights regime, represents a significant driver of states’ abolition.) the reform movements against capital punishment.
1.6.4.2.5.1.1. Con: A stronger belief in the value of the individual and human life does not preclude capital punishment. It emphasizes the significance of capital punishment in those strict cases in which it is warranted.
1.6.4.2.5.2. Con: The [government](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/) should prioritize the rights of all people in society. Therefore, the murderer's life should not be protected if it jeopardizes the right to safety of others.
1.6.4.2.5.2.1. Pro: It is wrong for the interests of an individual who has proven to be dangerous to society to overrule the interest of society in protecting itself from that individual.
1.6.4.2.5.3. Con: There are many reasonable circumstances in which it is acceptable to deliberately ignore someone's right to life. Therefore, there is no absolute right to life, only a conditional right which depends on the circumstances.
1.6.4.2.5.3.1. Pro: When a criminal violates someone else's fundamental right to life, they revoke their own right to those same human rights.
1.6.4.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: If one person attacks another, the victim's [right to self-defense](https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/self-defense-and-stand-your-ground.aspx) supersedes the attacker's right to life.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2. Con: Rights are not negotiable or dependent on conduct. Humane, civilized societies do not deprive citizens of rights, except in the interests of protecting others.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2.1. Con: Most rights, in practice, are not inalienable.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Convicts lose the [right against search and seizure](http://jailhouselaw.org/your-right-to-be-free-from-unreasonable-searches-and-seizures/)(In Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 530 \(1984\), the Supreme Court held that prisoners don’t have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their cells, so prison officials can search them as a routine matter without any particular justification, and without having to produce anything like a search warrant.) while in prison, where random searches are common.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: Convicts' [right to vote](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-voting-rights-after-parole-20150806-story.html) is commonly suspended during incarceration as well. Some loss of rights as punishment for duly convicted crime is normal, even in humane and civilized societies.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Suspending a convict's right to vote is [unjust](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/prisoners-convicts-felons-inmates-right-to-vote-enfranchise-criminal-justice-voting-rights-213979/)(The new consensus around post-release enfranchisement demands a smarter way to think about prisoners’ political rights behind bars. A prison constituency with rights to vote and related rights of free speech can engage in civic activism that will continue after release.) and produces negative outcomes.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2.1.3. Con: It may not be just, however, to rescind someone's rights.
1.6.4.2.5.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.2.2.1.1.
1.6.4.2.5.3.3. Con: In every scenario where it is acceptable to deliberately ignore someone's right to life, one only does so to directly ensure someone else's right to life. The death penalty does not adhere to this criterium.
1.6.4.2.5.3.3.1. Con: If the death penalty leads to a more just society due to the deterrent effect of preventing future crimes, then it will ensure fewer deaths and injustices in the future. Depending on these benefits, it could be said to adhere to this criterium.
1.6.4.2.5.3.3.2. Pro: The right to self defense only exists to defend the life of the [innocent party](https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/are-stand-your-ground-laws-a-good-idea/stand-your-ground-laws-protect-the-innocent).
1.6.4.2.5.4. Pro: If human life is universal and unalienable, then letting a murderer live is morally acceptable since doing so protects from further loss of life.
1.6.4.2.5.4.1. Con: Human life has no specific, objective value. It is valuated differently by any number of philosophical, spiritual, and ethical ideologies.
1.6.4.2.5.4.1.1. Con: Barring evidence to the contrary, it is generally safe to assume most of these value human life pretty highly, if not equally.
1.6.4.2.5.4.1.2. Pro: There are [different schools of thought](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life-meaning/) on the meaning of life. If there was an objective value, there would be no divergence.
1.6.4.2.5.4.2. Pro: Many Western philosophies and cultures have [anthropocentrism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/anthropocentrism)(Anthropocentrism, philosophical viewpoint arguing that human beings are the central or most significant entities in the world. This is a basic belief embedded in many Western religions and philosophies. Anthropocentrism regards humans as separate from and superior to nature and holds that human life has intrinsic value while other entities \(including animals, plants, mineral resources, and so on\) are resources that may justifiably be exploited for the benefit of humankind.) at their core, which is the idea that human beings are the most important entity in the universe.
1.6.4.3. Pro: [Since 1976](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/international/countries-that-have-abolished-the-death-penalty-since-1976), over 75 countries have abolished the death penalty.
1.6.5. Con: A majority of Americans are in favor of capital punishment, and their opinions should be reflected in the law.
1.6.5.1. Pro: According to a 2014 poll, most Americans [favor](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/25/death-penalty-poll_n_4661940.html) the death penalty as a punishment for people convicted of murder.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Although a majority may still be in favor, support for capital punishment is rapidly [declining](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/public-opinion-polls/national-polls-and-studies)(Public Support for the Death Penalty Lowest in a Half-Century). Legalizing capital punishment may not represent the majority opinion for much longer.
1.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: In 1996, 78% of Americans supported the death penalty. In 2015, [only 56%](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/16/less-support-for-death-penalty-especially-among-democrats/) were still in favor.
1.6.5.1.1.1.1. Con: 56% is still a clear majority.
1.6.5.1.1.2. Con: Laws can be changed back and forth. Legalizing something now does not mean it will never again be made illegal \(and vice versa\). As times change, so do laws.
1.6.5.1.1.3. Pro: In 2016, [polls](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/YearEnd2016) showed that support for the death penalty was at a 40-year low while support for alternative punishments was rising.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: [Polls](https://theconversation.com/can-opinion-polls-ever-be-accurate-probably-not-61097)(In the end, the poll results depend on how people reply to a survey. There is no reason to reply honestly, or even at all. And there is also the likelihood that a sampled individual won’t actually vote on the election day. So we can probably never have an accurate polling procedure when the public opinion is so split so close to 50-50.) are rarely accurate representations of the [truth](https://www.aei.org/articles/why-political-polls-are-so-often-wrong/)(Kentucky is not the only place where the polls seem to be getting it wrong. The 15 public polls conducted in the week before Britain’s election last May showed the Conservative party leading Labour 34%-33%. Conservatives won the popular vote 38%-31%.\n\[...\]\nSimilarly, pre-election polls in this year’s elections in Israel and Argentina seem to have been notably different from actual results.).
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: With the exception of 1966, every year up to 2020, since the beginning of recording in 1937, has seen the majority of Amercians being [in favor](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx) of capital punishment.
1.6.5.1.4. Pro: 2018 saw an [uptick](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/06/11/us-support-for-death-penalty-ticks-up-2018/) in support in the US for capital punishment, with 54 percent of Americans being in favour.
1.6.5.2. Con: Majorities are not necessarily right.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: The death penalty was abolished in France in 1981 against the will of the majority of the French population, and it was not until 1999 that public opinion saw more people support abolition than not \([pp. 39-40](https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=hastings_journal_crime_punishment)(France became the last Western European nation to abolish its death penalty in 1981.\n\[...\]\nIt was not until 1999 that more people opposed the reestablishment of the death penalty than supported it.)\).
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Claiming that a majority is correct, simply because it is a majority, is an example of a 'bandwagon fallacy' \([p. 2](https://www.astate.edu/a/global-initiatives/online/a-state-online-services/online-writing-center/student-resources/Avoiding%20Fallacies.pdf)(The bandwagon fallacy is committed by attempting to get people to do or think something because“everyone else thinks this way.” Instructors often catch this fallacy because students create arguments based on popular opinion.)\).
1.6.5.2.3. Con: The majority view is the basis of democracy.
1.6.5.2.3.1. Con: Democracy also includes [safeguards](https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/glossary_term/majority-rule-and-minority-rights/)(In every genuine democracy today, majority rule is both endorsed and limited by the supreme law of the constitution, which protects the rights of individuals. Tyranny by minority over the majority is barred, but so is tyranny of the majority against minorities.) to protect the rights and opinions of minorities.
1.6.5.2.3.2. Pro: In its simplest form, democracy is based exactly on determining where a majority of the population stands.
1.6.5.2.3.3. Con: The majority view is the basis for direct democracy. The US, however, is a representative democracy, where elected officials do not always have to [represent](https://www.thoughtco.com/representative-democracy-definition-pros-cons-4589561)(The votes of elected officials in a representative democracy may not always reflect the will of the people. The officials are not bound by law to vote the way the people who elected them want them to vote.) the majority \([p. 1](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/lesson-plans/Government_and_You_handouts.pdf)\).
1.6.5.3. Pro: Commonly held notions of justice are the ultimate foundation of our justice system and the measure by which its success should be judged. If a justice system diverges from the majority opinion of right and wrong, then it loses its moral force.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: While the laws are influenced by public opinion, it was never the intent that they always reflect them exactly. [The powers of Congress belong to Congress](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei)(All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.) and not directly to the people by design.
1.6.5.3.2. Con: On the contrary, a justice system can gain moral force by diverging from the majority opinion of right and wrong.
1.6.5.3.2.1. Pro: For instance, even 50 years after the last execution in Britain, people still tend to [support the reintroduction of the death penalty](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2014/08/13/capital-punishment-50-years-favoured), by 45-39%. The decision in hindsight has only bolstered the authority of the justice system.
1.6.5.3.3. Pro: A justice system which did not conform to popular morality would not be sustainable in the long term.
1.6.5.4. Con: What the US public think is irrelevant, as the death penalty contradicts the democratic principles of the US Constitution.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: The death penalty constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment," which is prohibited by the [Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)
1.6.5.4.1.1. Pro: Judges must interpret the Constitution according to [evolving standards of decency.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty) As society in the US increasingly [turns against](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/gallup-poll-public-support-for-the-death-penalty-lowest-in-a-half-century) the death penalty, interpretations of the Eighth Amendment must reflect that.
1.6.5.4.1.2. Pro: The death penalty as a whole violates the Eighth Amendment because it is [unreliable, arbitrary, slow and rare](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/opinion/is-the-death-penalty-unconstitutional.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fwilliam-baude).
1.6.5.4.1.2.1. Con: If the death penalty is unreliable and slow, then there are problems with the legal system that must be fixed. This is not a reason to rule out the death penalty.
1.6.5.4.1.3. Con: Different Supreme Court justices have different interpretations of cruel and unusual punishment, so determining whether a statute violates the Eighth Amendment is difficult \([p. 13](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1001&context=uauje)(The Supreme Court, as a non-partisan, non-elected body, has a duty to disregard public opinion and rule on the merits of the statute. Unfortunately, interpretations of cruel and unusual punishment also vary among justices. Therefore, determining whether a statute violates the Eighth Amendment is subject to varying interpretations.)\).
1.6.5.4.2. Con: The US Supreme Court has not deemed the death penalty unconstitutional. In fact, they have confirmed its constitutionality.
1.6.5.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.2.
1.6.5.4.2.2. Pro: As recently as 2008, [Baze v. Rees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baze_v._Rees) determined by 7-2 that use of the lethal injection often used in capital punishment is not unconstitutional.
1.6.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: In 2019, the case of [Bucklew v. Precythe](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/587/17-8151/)(Ultimately, this Court answered these legal challenges in Baze v. Rees.) confirmed the strong precedent of Baze v. Rees.
1.6.5.4.3. Pro: From [1972 until 1976](https://www.aclu.org/other/case-against-death-penalty)(In 1972, the Supreme Court declared that under then-existing laws "the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty… constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.") the US Supreme Court put a halt to capital punishment due to its conflict with basic rights.
1.6.5.4.3.1. Con: In the [Gregg](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/reinstatement-of-the-death-penalty.html) decisions, the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, and the Court maintained that the death penalty was constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.
1.6.5.4.3.2. Pro: In the case [Furman v. Georgia](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/69-5030), the US Supreme Court found that the death penalty was being imposed in an unconstitutional manner, on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
1.6.5.4.3.2.1. Con: Only two justices in the Furman case argued that the death penalty was [unconstitutional](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/69-5030) in all circumstances.
1.6.5.5. Con: The law should reflect the will of the people, but the will of the people should itself reflect what is just and moral. Whether or not the death penalty is just and moral is precisely the point in question.
