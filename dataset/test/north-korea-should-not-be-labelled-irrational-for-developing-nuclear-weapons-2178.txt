Discussion Name: North Korea should not be labelled irrational for developing nuclear weapons

1. North Korea should not be labelled irrational for developing nuclear weapons.
1.1. Con: Developing nuclear weapons continues a pattern of irrational behavior by the regime.
1.1.1. Pro: Rejecting US demands of abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear program before entering negotiations with them demonstrates North Korean hubris and irrationality.
1.1.1.1. Con: The US demand to a weaker foe, who utterly lack trust in their adversary whatsoever, to completely disarm themselves before they enter negotiations under the promise of non-aggression is unreasonable.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US track records of not severely interfering or outright invading foreign countries when they are vulnerable due to lacking deterrence is dismal
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US pursued several attempted and successful regime changes throughout the world such as [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat) in which the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown due to primarily US-American and British desire of control over Iranian petroleum reserves
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: During the [Libyan Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_\(2011\)#Foreign_military_intervention) in 2011, [US forces and allies](http://abcnews.go.com/International/libya-international-military-coalition-launch-assault-gadhafi-forces/story?id=13174246) fired missiles, undertook sorties, naval blockades, enforced a no-fly zone, provided military logistical assistance and bombarded Tripoli which eventually led to the ousting and murder of Muammar Gaddafi who had [voluntarily dismantled](http://www.newsweek.com/nations-gave-nuclear-bombs-78661) his [nuclear](https://ia601806.us.archive.org/5/items/libyasnucleardis00norm/libyasnucleardis00norm.pdf) [weapons](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/0830/A-troubling-lesson-from-Libya-Don-t-give-up-nukes) programme years earlier
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The US invaded Iraq in 2003 [under false pretences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Rationale_based_on_faulty_evidence) and fabricated or [manipulated evidence](https://gowans.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/why-un-sanctions-against-north-korea-are-wrong/), most importantly alleged nuclear weapons and an utter [disregard for diplomatic solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Military_intervention_vs_diplomatic_solution) in preference of military force
1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: The [axis of evil speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil) by George W. Bush and John R. Bolton’s [beyond the axis of evil speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil#Bolton:_.22Beyond_the_Axis_of_Evil.22) in 2002 grouped Iraq, Iran, North Korea, followed by Cuba, Libya and Syria together as principal rogue states that only had their rejection of US interference in their domestic affairs in common
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: From the perspective of [constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_\(international_relations\)), in which international relations are socially constructed by ongoing social practice and interaction, negative experiences of the past and history will influence that social interaction, especially in light of a profound lack of positive reinforcements which in turn shape North Korean identity and interests contrary to the US
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: From the perspective of [liberal institutionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_liberalism) in which nation-states are considered rational actors operating in an international system in which hierarchy cannot be enforced but in which international institutions and organisations such as UN, NATO, EU, ASEAN can increase and aid cooperation, North Korean nuclear behaviour due to lack of membership as well as trust issues stemming from no positive experiences from foreign aid and said institutions is, yet again, reasonable
1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: North Korea was forced to deal with the US as the solely remaining [global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony) [hegemony](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/gji3/files/american_hegemony.pdf) after the collapse of the Soviet Union, yet was unable due to vastly different national experiences \([Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War)\) and highly divergent understandings concerning the nature of the regional security structure \(rejection of [hub and spokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_and_spokes_architecture) and US dominance\) to simply bow before the US and accept their leadership
1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The US established the [hub and spokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_and_spokes_architecture) system which undermined the establishment of a strong regional institution until recently \([ASEAN+3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN_Free_Trade_Area#ASEAN_Plus_Three) for instance\)
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: From the perspective of [neorealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neorealism_\(international_relations\)) that is defined by an international system characterised by an anarchic world without any higher, central authority above all nation-states, in which all state actors adopt self-help behaviours due to a profound security dilemma that is based on the importance of distribution of power, North Korean nuclear behaviour should be seen as [utterly reasonable](http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2013/11/06/neorealism-in-international-relations-kenneth-waltz/)
1.1.2. Pro: The North and South Korean leaders met on 27 April 2018 and announced [plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-south-kim-jong-un.html?action=click&contentCollection=Asia%20Pacific&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article) for peace talks and plans for de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This shows that the North Korean leadership is capable of rational considerations.
1.1.3. Con: Many other countries have developed nuclear weapons, yet aren't labelled irrational.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The United States is the only country to have detonated [two nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) during armed conflict, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, yet are not labelled irrational despite [still being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_of_the_United_States) a nuclear power.
1.1.4. Pro: North Korea [are prone](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/31/north-korea-sabre-rattling-seoul) to provoking crises and "sabre rattling", showcasing their irrationality.
1.1.4.1. Con: During the Cold War, the US had to carefully maintain a public image with [a degree of irrationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) in order to be perceived as a nation which was capable of using nuclear weapons.
1.1.4.2. Con: Rather than being irrational, North Korean [negotiation strategy](https://www.usip.org/press/2003/01/understanding-north-korean-negotiating-behavior) through [provocation and evoking crises](http://paperroom.ipsa.org/papers/paper_1521.pdf) are consistently used in order to bring adversaries to the negotiation table and obtain maximum concessions.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: North Korea's [failure](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/03/north-koreas-military-arsenal/) to keep up in industrial capacities and technological advancement within the conventional military sphere has diminished the pressure on adversaries to negotiate.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Historically, North Korea are only taken seriously and asked to join the negotiation table when they are [perceived as a serious threat](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/jitters-as-north-korea-reverts-to-sabre-rattling-rhetoric).
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: The North Korean government is [drawing attention](https://www.usip.org/press/2003/01/understanding-north-korean-negotiating-behavior) via highly [aggressive actions](http://paperroom.ipsa.org/papers/paper_1521.pdf) and behaviour, thus hoping to be taken seriously, recognised and heard on matters concerning their very existence
1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Stirring up [crises](https://www.usip.org/press/2003/01/understanding-north-korean-negotiating-behavior) and high risk incidents in order to call for negotiations and draw as many concessions out of it as possible has become the [standard modus operandi](http://paperroom.ipsa.org/papers/paper_1521.pdf) by the North Korean government
1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: The third conclusion for North Korea was that in case of inability to become a mortal threat to the survival of the US such as the Soviet Union, one has to reach specific capacities capable of disrupting, damaging and threatening political as well as economic structures and institutions that are deemed vital for US interests
1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: The second conclusion North Korea reached when analysing US foreign policy was that when a country is no economic powerhouse, one has to become an adequate threat such as the Soviet Union either for the US itself or the political structures it has created in order to be negotiated with
1.1.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: When observing US foreign relations North Korea came to the first conclusion that one has to be an economic powerhouse such as Japan or China in order to be taken seriously and negotiated with
1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: A North Korea that stirs up trouble without the necessary political, economic or military might behind it will be [crushed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Military_intervention_vs_diplomatic_solution) such as [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Rationale_based_on_faulty_evidence), [Libya](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/0830/A-troubling-lesson-from-Libya-Don-t-give-up-nukes) or [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat)
1.1.4.2.3.3. Pro: A North Korea that is unwilling to accept the current world order and US hegemony but remains quiet in regards to its concerns is going to be ignored or its fears simply brushed away as inconsequential
1.1.5. Pro: The North Korean regime propagates irrational dogma about North Korean history and their leaders.
1.1.5.1. Pro: North Korea's [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_cult_of_personality) surrounding the Kim family is irrational and largely factually incorrect.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The North Korean regime [maintains](https://www.golf.com/golf-plus/behind-kim-jong-ils-famous-round-golf) that Kim Jong Il shot a 38-under-par 34 on his first ever round of golf.
1.1.6. Pro: The North Korean regime's ideologies and policies are irrational.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Juche is an irrational ideology itself, insofar as it has led North Korea to being impoverished and [heavily reliant](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48637518) on foreign aid.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The [Songun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songun) \("military-first politics"\) policy under Kim Jong Il funneled resources to the military at a time of [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine) and economic collapse, causing great suffering to the people.
1.1.6.3. Pro: The ["Byungjin"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byungjin) policy is irrational in that it attempts to develop nuclear weapons and the economy at the same time.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: This has [resulted](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/07/article/north-korea-economy-shrinks-most-since-1990s-famine-seoul/) in North Korea's economy shrinking by more than at any point since the 1990s famine.
1.1.6.4. Pro: North Korea's mismanagement of its economy has resulted in it being one of the [most corrupt](https://www.transparency.org/country/PRK) [countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48432690) on earth.
1.2. Con: The development of nuclear weapons threatens to alienate North Korea's only ally, China, which will lead to Chinese abandonment of the North Korean government.
1.2.1. Pro: China has supported [several](http://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-nuclear-usa-idUSKCN0VY0ER) [resolutions](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-un-idUSKBN13I1OY) and [sanctions](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/30/china-joins-us-allies-in-sanctions-on-north-korea/) against North Korea over the nuclear weapons program.
1.2.1.1. Con: Economic aid from China has [significantly](http://www.newsweek.com/china-north-korea-trump-allies-economy-583883) [increased](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/asia/china-north-korea-trade-coal-nuclear.html) despite North Korea continuing their nuclear weapons program.
1.2.2. Con: It is not in China's interests to see the North Korean regime collapse.
1.2.2.1. Pro: China opposes having [US military](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/04/11/nkor-a11.html) [forces stationed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/world/asia/chinese-annoyance-with-north-korea-bubbles-to-the-surface.html?_r=0) directly at its mainland borders, which is likely to happen if the North Korean regime collapses.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: China has significant issues with the US being the sole global sea power that exerts total control over the sea lines of communications \([SLOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_of_Pearls_\(Indian_Ocean\))\), which the vast majority of resources and goods are transported on.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: China has [geopolitical issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_island_chain) with the “first island chain”, a chain of [US allies](http://www.newsweek.com/china-north-korea-trump-allies-economy-583883) surrounding China geographically.
1.2.2.2. Pro: A [failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state) North Korean state at China’s border poses [massive risk](http://www.nytimes.com/cfr/world/slot2_071306.html).
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Due to the large number of ethnic Koreans living on the Chinese border, a reunification of Korea could [wake aspirations for independence](http://thediplomat.com/2017/01/how-far-can-china-go-in-imposing-sanctions-on-north-korea/) in other minorities in China.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Domestic revolt](http://thediplomat.com/2017/01/how-far-can-china-go-in-imposing-sanctions-on-north-korea/) from several ethnic minorities living in China would severely hinder Chinese domestic security.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: In the scenario of a total collapse of North Korea, several [million refugees](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/china-s-dilemma-over-north-korea-on-show-at-border-8718404) would seek [shelter](http://www.newsweek.com/china-north-korea-trump-allies-economy-583883) in China.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Millions of refugees pose a severe problem for Chinese economic security, a main concern of China as economic insecurity and loss of wealth could [destabilise the entire Chinese community](http://thediplomat.com/2017/01/how-far-can-china-go-in-imposing-sanctions-on-north-korea/).
1.2.3. Con: In 1961, North Korea and China signed the [Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-North_Korean_Mutual_Aid_and_Cooperation_Friendship_Treaty).
1.2.3.1. Con: China has [developed positive relations](https://cpianalysis.org/2016/06/16/responsible-stakeholder-with-chinese-characteristics/) with all neighboring and regional states by becoming the [industrial hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN_Free_Trade_Area#ASEAN_Plus_Three) of the entire region, making it uncertain whether China would support North Korea over other allies.
1.2.3.2. Con: North Korea has resisted broad economic reforms [suggested by China](http://www.ndsl.kr/ndsl/search/detail/article/articleSearchResultDetail.do?cn=ART001633520).
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: North Korea has not consistently followed the [Chinese economic reform program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform) that was implemented in 1978, which led to China adopting a capitalist market.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The special economic zone with South Korea, the [Kaesong Industrial Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong_Industrial_Region), was "temporarily" closed in 2016 after operating for 11 years and is yet to reopen.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: The [Rason Special Economic Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rason_Special_Economic_Zone) \(formerly Rajin-Sonbong\) which mirrors the Chinese "[special economic zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zones_of_China)" began in 1992 yet remains underdeveloped.
1.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Despite adjusting laws and regulations repeatedly in order to accommodate wishes of foreign investors, North Korea's efforts in securing international investment [have been largely unsuccessful](http://www.38north.org/2014/12/rfrank121614/).
1.3. Pro: The nuclear weapons program is a vital source of underground revenue, information and relationships for North Korea.
1.3.1. Pro: [Greater proliferation](https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/cyber-week-review-june-16-2017) of nuclear weapons technology has led to an increase of potential trading partners and sources for necessary materials.
1.3.1.1. Con: [Nuclear proliferation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation) is highly problematic as it increases the numbers of actors with access to nuclear weapons, fissionable material, weapons-applicable technology and information which in turn increases the possibility of nuclear warfare.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: In the absence of any meaningful and substantial economic relations [despite having reduced restrictions to a minimum, adjusted laws and regulations several times in order to accommodate foreign investors](http://www.38north.org/2014/12/rfrank121614/), the accusation of illicit activities towards the bereaved who has to survive by any means necessary is simply hypocritical
1.3.1.2. Con: Because of sanctions, North Korea's nuclear weapons technology has dramatically decreased their number of potential trading partners. \([pg. 6](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41259.pdf)\)
1.3.2. Pro: Nations which are shunned by the US and greater world community are likely to form special beneficial relationships in trading for illicit goods or information they cannot receive elsewhere.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Trade with other nations related to the nuclear weapons program has led to [supplementary benefits](https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/cyber-week-review-june-16-2017) for North Korea.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: When compared to the missed opportunity costs of not trading with other, wealthier nations, this is an irrational choice.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: North Korea has benefited from its relationship with Iran.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: As illicit nuclear programs depend heavily on [procurement networks](https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/cyber-week-review-june-16-2017), it is likely that both North Korea and Iran share procurement network intel.
1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Such [close cooperation](https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/cyber-week-review-june-16-2017) is plausible due to the fact that both North Korea and Iran were customers of the [Khan network](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-01-31/long-shadow-aq-khan), which bought and sold illegally proliferated nuclear weapons technology.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: It is likely that Iran and North Korea have [cooperated on centrifuge technology](https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/cyber-week-review-june-16-2017).
1.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: Iran and North Korea have [collaborated on ballistic missile technology](https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/cyber-week-review-june-16-2017).
1.3.2.2. Pro: According to [liberal institutionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_liberalism), the fostering of special relationships based on trade and dependency could lead to the establishment of an underground network.
1.3.2.3. Con: Nations which are shunned by the world community are likely to be [much poorer](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/peace-rights-and-security/sanctions/) because of it.
1.3.3. Pro: North Korea is likely to make significant revenue from illicit arms deals and exporting "goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons". \([pg. 7](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2094\(2013\))\)
1.3.3.1. Con: It is irrational to choose illicit forms of money making when there are far more lucrative and safe ways to make money legitimately.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In South Korea, Samsung alone makes over [$200 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung) a year by engaging in world markets as a legitimate actor. By contrast, North Korea's entire GDP in 2018 was only $32 billion.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: The difference between [North](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/prk/) and [South](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/kor/) Korea's trade figures shows the benefits of pursuing legitimate, rather than underground, revenue.
1.3.4. Pro: As North Korea [lacks any significant economic relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_kingdom) with the rest of the world, these underground benefits are even more vital.
1.3.4.1. Con: North Korea could have significant economic relations with the rest of the world if they gave up their nuclear program.
1.3.5. Con: The nuclear weapons program is the reason that North Korea is cut off from far more beneficial forms of legitimate revenue, information, and relationships.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.
1.4. Pro: Having a nuclear weapon directly enhances national security.
1.4.1. Pro: The security guarantees provided by nuclear weapons help the regime stay in power, which is a rational choice, as many top leaders would likely face charges for [crimes against humanity](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/108/71/PDF/G1410871.pdf?OpenElement) \(p.319\) if they lost power.
1.4.2. Pro: Nuclear weapons help North Korea to deter any possible military attacks.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons allow North Korea to ensure state defense through a [deterrence doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory#Nuclear_weapons_and_deterrence).
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The "[Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option)", where Israel launches [massive retaliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_retaliation) through nuclear weapons in the scenario the state is invaded or destroyed, has acted as the "ultimate guarantor" of Israeli state security.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: The superior conventional military technology of the US or South Korea is [meaningless](https://gowans.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/why-un-sanctions-against-north-korea-are-wrong/) if North Korea has nuclear weapons acting as a "last resort".
1.4.2.2. Pro: No country which has developed nuclear weapons [has ever become the target](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/0830/A-troubling-lesson-from-Libya-Don-t-give-up-nukes) of a large scale invasion attempt.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Other countries which had no nuclear weapons who acted against the US, [such as Libya and Iraq,](http://www.newsweek.com/nations-gave-nuclear-bombs-78661) were invaded and involuntarily had their [regimes changed](https://gowans.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/why-un-sanctions-against-north-korea-are-wrong/) by the US.
1.4.3. Pro: Nuclear weapons would act as compensation for North Korea's inferior conventional military forces [compared to hostile nations](http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&country1=north-korea&country2=united-states-of-america&Submit=COMPARE).
1.4.3.1. Pro: North Korean troops’ effectiveness is significantly diminished due to men and women [suffering from malnutrition](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11207725/North-Korea-extends-10-year-military-conscription.html).
1.4.3.2. Pro: North Korea [has failed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/03/north-koreas-military-arsenal/) to keep up with adversaries in conventional military technology advances.
1.4.3.3. Con: North Korea does not need nuclear weapons as China would [support North Korea](http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-06/28/content_20365659.htm) in the event of a war.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.4.3.3.4. Pro: China supported North Korea in the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#China_intervenes_.28October_.E2.80.93_December_1950.29).
1.4.3.3.4.1. Con: The generations that have [fought and shed blood together](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/world/asia/chinese-annoyance-with-north-korea-bubbles-to-the-surface.html?_r=0) in the Korean War against the US and its allies have largely died out
1.4.3.4. Pro: In the scenario of a hostile invasion, the use of small tactical nuclear warheads against conventional troops could force the foreign invader to withdraw.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: It is likely there will be outcry, especially if the invading country is a Western one, at the actual and imagined loss of military life to nuclear weapons.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: There was [substanial opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War) to the US-Vietnam war, with [imagery](https://time.com/vietnam-photos/) of military personnel perishing in flames, which could parallel military personnel dying to nuclear warheads.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Con: It is likely there will be equal, if not greater, condemnation of North Korea for using nuclear weapons in warfare.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: There is [doubt](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/20/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons/index.html) against North Korea’s claim to have managed to miniaturise a nuclear warhead that is able to fit on an intercontinental ballistic missile \([ICBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile)\), let alone on a tactical missile.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Nuclear weapons are [capable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_yield) of wiping out [immense groups](http://www.visualnews.com/2012/04/24/visualizing-the-frightening-power-of-nuclear-bombs/) of hostile forces.
1.4.3.6. Con: In case of use against a conventional invasion or occupation force, the deployment of nuclear weapons would render much of North Korea’s landmass irradiated and uninhabitable.
1.4.3.6.1. Con: As North Korean leaders, figureheads and decision makers would face imprisonment or death regardless in the event of a successful foreign invasion or occupation, use of nuclear weapons as a last resort makes sense from a [survival aspect](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm).
1.4.4. Con: North Korea already has weapons of mass destruction in the form of [chemical and possibly biological weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Biological_and_chemical_weapons), meaning they do not need nuclear weapons for ensuring security.
1.4.4.1. Con: Nuclear weapons have [far higher potency](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm) in terms of sheer [damage output](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11603665/North-Korea-v-South-Korea-How-the-countries-armed-forces-compare.html) and affected area, rendering superior conventional military technology and common countermeasures ineffective.
1.4.4.2. Con: [Biological weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare) effectiveness is [significantly limited](http://healthresearchfunding.org/biological-warfare-pros-cons/) as weaponizing them is difficult.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Biological agents deal [significant harm](http://healthresearchfunding.org/biological-warfare-pros-cons/) and are [unpredictable](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321030.php), making them undesirable to use.
1.4.4.3. Con: [Chemical weapons](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/cw.htm) are [volatile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon) and dissipate quickly, limiting their scope of use in a wartime scenario.
1.5. Pro: The nuclear weapons program serves as a prestige project that legitimises the validity of its government to the North Korean general population.
1.5.1. Pro: The nuclear weapons program supports multiple North Korean ideologies.
1.5.1.1. Pro: For North Koreans, the nuclear program represents [Songun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songun) \(선군정치\), the military first principle.
1.5.1.2. Pro: The feat of developing a nuclear programme is seen as [Juche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) \(주체사상\), one of the purest manifestations and representations of this concept that entails self-sufficiency, self-reliance and independence.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.5.2. Con: Government legitimacy [derives](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/#SouPolLeg) from consent of the governed, of which North Korean citizens have none, not the existence or size of a nuclear weapons program.
1.5.2.1. Pro: North Korea [ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) at the bottom of the world in the Democracy Index.
1.5.3. Pro: The nuclear weapon program symbolises North Korea's defiance against the US, directly challenging the current world order devised by, and in the interest of, the US.
1.5.3.1. Con: It is unclear whether this is beneficial or detrimental to the North Korean regime.
1.5.3.2. Pro: North Korea’s nuclear weapons program [challenges](http://www.ips-dc.org/north_korea_the_npt/) the [status quo](https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/05/10/us-hegemony-on-korean-peninsula-challenged/) of the security structure in East Asia by [rejecting the US as the principal hegemon](https://www.hamilton.edu/documents/levitt-center/Maass_article.pdf) in that region.
1.5.3.3. Pro: North Korea’s withdrawal from the [NPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) as the only country to have ever done so, as well as its continued defiance to the US, is behavior that could be [emulated by other states](http://www.ips-dc.org/north_korea_the_npt/) that feel threatened by the US and/or its foreign policy.
1.5.3.4. Pro: North Korea’s continued nuclear weapons program [challenges](https://www.rferl.org/a/1071920.html) the NPT \([non-proliferation-treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons)\), a [cornerstone](https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pdfs_koreachapt2.pdf) of US foreign policy.
1.5.4. Con: The nuclear weapons program sucks resources away from more appropriate measures of a country's prestige, such as the ability to [feed](https://www.dw.com/en/some-starving-in-north-korea-as-covid-constrains-china-trade-say-un-experts/a-53754390) its people, [respect](https://www.hrw.org/asia/north-korea) for human rights, and [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita) flourishing.
1.5.5. Pro: The fact that North Korea has managed to become a member of the “[very exclusive club](https://www.rferl.org/a/1071920.html)” of nuclear powers is a point of immense national pride.
1.5.5.1. Con: North Korean citizens' national pride is difficult to measure due to the [severe restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_North_Korea) on free speech in the country.
1.5.5.2. Pro: [Joining the elite club of nuclear powers](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron) is an extraordinary feat that was achieved [despite heavy US-led economic sanctions](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/20/asia/north-korea-nuclear-sanctions-timeline/index.html) and wide political resistance.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.6. Pro: Jimmy Carter [visited North Korea in 1994](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615210532/http://cartercenter.org/documents/nondatabase/nytimesarticle.htm) in order to defuse the impending North Korean nuclear crisis. The fact that a former US president visited North Korea to speak to their leader is a point of pride to North Koreans.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The North Korean government sees it as extremely important to [be taken seriously and seen as an equal](https://books.google.de/books?id=fPGohXMHdU8C&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=north+korea+national+pride+seen+as+equals&source=bl&ots=jDFXxwoSKJ&sig=HQot2kDDw19nWaHu-c5-TPeXDos&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjq_O7fycbUAhXMJ8AKHXc8Au4Q6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&q=north%20korea%20national%20pride%20seen%20as%20equals&f=false).
1.6. Pro: North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is beneficial during negotiations with other nations.
1.6.1. Pro: The mere claim of maintaining a nuclear development program led to the US entering negotiations with North Korea in 2002 to sign a [non-aggression pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_North_Korean_nuclear_program#Phase_III), where North Korea offered to freeze the program in exchange for further aid.
1.6.2. Con: Defying the US and broader world community by openly developing unapproved nuclear weapons could lead to a full breakdown of negotiations.
1.6.2.1. Con: Pakistan, India and Israel defied the US by [developing unapproved nuclear weapons](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003-12/features/israel-india-pakistan-engaging-non-npt-states-nonproliferation-regime) yet enjoy fruitful relations with the US.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Pakistan, India, and Israel never threatened to use their nuclear weapons against the US, [unlike North Korea](https://www.defensenews.com/home/2016/03/27/north-korea-nukes-washington-in-propaganda-video-threatens-south-korea/).
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: The US has accommodated India’s [national interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93United_States_relations), increased bilateral trade and investment, [included India](http://www.thehindu.com/news/resources/indous-joint-statement-after-us-president-barack-obama-and-prime-minister-narendra-modi-talks/article6821279.ece) in decision-making processes on issues of global governance and advocated for India’s admission into multilateral export control regimes.
1.6.2.1.3. Pro: Israel is the [largest cumulative recipient](http://www.policyalmanac.org/world/archive/crs_israeli-us_relations.shtml) of US foreign economic and [military aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf), receiving unique benefits other countries do not.
1.6.2.1.4. Pro: Pakistan receives significant [economic and military aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_aid_to_Pakistan#United_States) from the US.
1.6.2.2. Con: France, [in order to develop its own nuclear arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella#NATO), withdrew from NATO in 1966 \(only rejoining NATO military command in 2009\), yet never experienced any form of sanctions or breakdown of negotiations.
1.6.3. Pro: In 1994, North Korea received [substantial ongoing humanitarian, financial and industrial aid](https://web.archive.org/web/20031217175315/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc457.pdf) when signing the Agreed Framework with the US in exchange for freezing their nuclear power plant program.
