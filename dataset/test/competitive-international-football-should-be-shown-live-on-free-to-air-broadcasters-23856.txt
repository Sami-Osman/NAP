Discussion Name: Competitive international football should be shown live on free to air broadcasters

1. Competitive international football should be shown live on free to air broadcasters.
1.1. Pro: UEFA's website claims that its objectives are "to promote football in a spirit of unity... without any discrimination". As such, it should make efforts to broadcast football to all in as equal a way as possible, i.e. by broadcasting it without charging.
1.1.1. Con: Following this logic, each and any product that is being sold for money would discriminate since those with a lot of money have easier access than those with little.
1.1.2. Con: The types of discrimination [UEFA](https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/what-uefa-does/) aims to avoid are discrimination "...on the part of politics, race, religion, gender or any other reason". Therefore, it is unclear whether UEFA would extend the definition of discrimination to subscription-paid broadcasting of its matches.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Paying for a broadcasting service is not a typical example of discrimination in many national or international laws.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: National and international law is designed to protect the economic rights of the wealthy. If uefa genuinely stands against any discrimination, then it should seek to ensure that football at all levels is accessible to all people.
1.2. Pro: Football should be shown live on free to view media because it's a really important and loved sport.
1.2.1. Pro: People want to cheer on their countries and it is just not fair if they can't.
1.2.2. Con: Most forms of entertainment are loved, but that doesn't mean that all music, movies, books, and activities should be free.
1.2.3. Con: Many things are beloved yet not available for free - and no one argues that they should be.
1.2.4. Con: Football is not important on any scale.
1.2.4.1. Con: The sheer amount of money in the football industry suggests that it is extremely important to a large number of people.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Nothing really matters.
1.2.5. Pro: Competitive international football [unites people](https://theovertake.com/~racism-and-football/bringing-people-together/), which is important.
1.2.5.1. Con: Football is built on rivalries, and these are particularly competitive at the international level. [Intense rivalries can divide](https://johancruyffinstitute.com/en/blog-en/football-unites-and-separates-people-equally/) as much as they unite people.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: In the recent [Bulgaria v England](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10145743/five-bulgaria-fans-arrested-racist-england/) match, Bulgarian fans chanted racists slurs and made Nazi salutes at English players.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Intense rivalries specifically unite one set of people against another set of people.
1.3. Pro: More people would watch the games.
1.3.1. Pro: There would be greater reach for advertisers if games were shown on free to view media.
1.3.2. Con: This logic is problematic. Accordingly, all movies, books and games should be free since the maximization of their reach is a goal in itself.
1.3.2.1. Con: There is an important difference between being able to read any given book and being able to watch the nation's team competing in an international event.
1.4. Con: Subscriptions bought mainly for football bring in revenue to support the broadcast of a wider range of sports offerings to the public.
1.4.1. Pro: Pay-TV offerings like [Sky in countries like the UK](https://www.sky.com/shop/tv/) most likely subsidize the broadcasting of relatively small sports, like Darts and Snooker, through the money they make by selling subscriptions that attract many customers because they include football broadcasts.
1.5. Con: Uefa is primarily a money making organisation.
1.5.1. Pro: Losing advertising space and rights would be a significant blow to their economic standing.
1.5.1.1. Con: They seem to be doing very well economically from television rights for paid channels.
1.6. Pro: More children are likely to follow football and be inspired to play.
1.6.1. Pro: This is particularly important since new and emerging forms of competition are available for free, for example video game tournaments, which are - arguably - less beneficial than soccer.
1.6.2. Con: Children can still watch plenty of other tournaments and leagues that are available for free.
1.6.2.1. Con: Hardly any form of competition is as inspiring to children as one in which nations compete with each other.
1.6.3. Con: It is not necessarily a good thing for more children to be aspiring footballers. Football carries risk of injury, failure to succeed and other disadvantages for aspiring footballers.
1.7. Pro: Supporting one's country at tournaments is a part of our culture.
1.7.1. Con: Those watching football on TV don't provide any tangible support.
1.7.2. Con: Fans can still support their country by following matches via other means, e.g. live tickets or on the radio.
1.8. Con: Uefa does not have a responsibility to the wider public.
1.8.1. Con: Even if UEFA does not have a responsibility, the government could intervene on the basis of their responsibility to citizens and deem the matches in the public interest and require the broadcasting to be available without a paywall.
1.8.2. Con: As the primary European football institution, they should have similar level of responsibilities of any other governing body with similar power and authority.
1.8.2.1. Pro: If [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) is accepted in its authority as the administrative body for association football in Europe, it follows that it should carry a responsibility to the wider public if they wish to continue and exert their influence upon European Football.
1.8.3. Con: Elite football is ultimately, and primarily an activity performed for the sake of public entertainment. As the primary administrative body of elite football in Europe, UEFA has a responsibility to consider the consumers of the sports.
1.8.3.1. Con: If Uefa consider fans as consumers of entertainment, then it makes sense to seek to maximise revenues from them in whatever ways work best.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: UEFA is a [not-for-profit](https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/OfficialDocument/uefaorg/Finance/02/59/06/07/2590607_DOWNLOAD.pdf) organization.
1.8.4. Con: UEFA's website has a whole section dedicated to [Social Responsibility](https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/social-responsibility/). This indicates that the organization, at least on papers, presents itself as one with a public responsibility.
1.9. Con: All broadcasters were entitled to bid for the rights.
1.9.1. Con: Free to air broadcasters cannot compete with paid subscription broadcasters. The paid broadcasters have extra revenue generated through their subscriptions which allows them to outbid the free broadcasters. It is not a fair starting point in competing for the rights.
1.9.2. Pro: If subscription-paid broadcasters succeeded in the bid for broadcasting rights, then this is the justifiable product of natural market forces.
1.9.2.1. Con: Subscription broadcasters have a competitive advantage over free to air broadcasters.
1.10. Pro: The domestic game is being priced out of many peoples reach, the national game should be protected.
1.10.1. Pro: As a national team competing on an international stage, the opportunity to support the nation should not be reserved only for those wealthy enough to pay for subscription channels.
1.10.2. Con: There are more effective ways to change the commercialization of the sport, or protect the national/ domestic games than through broadcasting policies.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The government could introduce legislation to reduce the wealth of individual clubs and tackle some of the key drivers of football's ever increasing commercialization.
