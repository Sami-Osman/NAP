Discussion Name: Is the USA a good country to live in?

1. The USA is a good country to live in.
1.1. Con: The United States does [not provide](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/social-spending-highest-lowest-country-comparison-oecd-france-economics-politics-welfare/) as much social welfare as other developed countries.
1.1.1. Con: Although not as much as other countries, the US government provides adequate social services.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The country has a healthcare system high above the global average; the average life expectancy in the USA is [over 79 years old.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&idim=country:USA:GBR:CAN&hl=en&dl=en)
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The United States has one of the [most expensive and least effective](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/06/16/once-again-u-s-has-most-expensive-least-effective-health-care-system-in-survey/?utm_term=.d9374d3d2bc8) healthcare systems in the developed world.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The United States leads the world in medical innovation which is then adopted within other health systems.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Cost of medical treatment in the US is [incredibly high](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/02/why-are-americans-paying-more-for-healthcare)(The United States has one of the highest costs of healthcare in the world. In 2020, U.S. healthcare spending reached $4.1 trillion, which averages to over $12,500 per person.).
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Other countries benefit from the innovation paid for by US providers/consumers.
1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Even though the quality of health care services in the United States is good, millions of Americans do not have access to them.
1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: About [44 million people in the United States](https://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/uninsured.html) have no health insurance.
1.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The number of people who have access to healthcare in the US [has been on a decline in recent years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States).
1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: Those who are unable to afford health insurance in the US, such as low-income adults, are provided healthcare coverage under [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/index.html).
1.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Some of those healthcare systems were shut-down, such as Obama-care.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: If the [trends](https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/02/09/the-u-s-does-not-have-a-debt-problem-it-has-a-health-care-cost-problem/#52b5fcaf6eb7) of the last 20 years continue, health care spending will eat up U.S. GDP.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The US [educational system](https://rankingamerica.wordpress.com/tag/education/) is ranked high above the global average.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The United States [ranks 17th](https://www.ibtimes.com/us-17th-global-education-ranking-finland-south-korea-claim-top-spots-901538) in global education rankings and most other developed countries are ahead of the US.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: 17th of 195 is still better than most countries in the world.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: The US does not rank in the [top 10](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading) for education. It even ranks 35th among the industrialized countries for math.
1.1.2. Pro: There is an opioid epidemic and drug crisis that the government does not have the ability to deal with adequately compared to countries like [Switzerland](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1926160,00.html) that provide clean needles and free drugs to help users change.
1.1.3. Pro: High rates of [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homeless_population) can make big cities relatively unpleasant.
1.1.4. Pro: The United States's [employment rate](https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm) is lower than other developed nations such as Sweden, Germany and the UK.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The low employment rate, when combined with the lack of a strong social safety net leaves the US with one of the highest [poverty rates](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) in the developed world.
1.1.5. Pro: Social welfare should not be a responsibility of the US central government rather a duty of neighbors to help the elderly and struggling.
1.1.5.1. Con: This allows poor communities to stay poor and wealthy ones to stay wealthy.
1.1.6. Con: The United States has lower [individual tax rates](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/personal-income-tax-rate) than other developed countries.
1.2. Pro: The United States of America has been [instrumental in the development](https://cz.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/usa-and-human-rights/)(The United States has played a special role in the development and support of human rights ideas and practices. The Declaration of Independence, by which the American colonies severed their allegiance to the British Crown in 1776, proclaimed that “all men are created equal.” No less important, the declaration asserted the right of a people to dissolve political bonds that had come to be oppressive.) of international human rights.
1.2.1. Con: If the US was once instrumental in the function of human rights, this is [no longer the case](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-states).
1.2.1.1. Pro: The US is not a pioneer of [Internet Freedom](https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTN_2018_Final%20Booklet_11_1_2018.pdf).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Internet freedoms in Communist countries are worse than that of the US internet.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Korea has a [history upon the censorship of their nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_North_Korea).
1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Communist China has been [heavily censoring the media.](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china)
1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: This argument makes use of the [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) fallacy \(which, ironically in this case, was used prominently by Soviet propaganda during the cold war\).
1.2.1.2. Pro: The US has terrible human rights issues. LGBT discrimination, discrimination against non whites, Islamophobia, [concentration camps on its southern border.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-unimaginable-reality-of-american-concentration-camps)
1.2.1.3. Pro: The US was and still is late to legalize same-sex marriage in [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States) after about 100 countries already legalized it.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The USA only [scores](https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights) slightly above 0 \(on a scale of -4 to 4\) when it comes to human rights so it can not be considered a pioneer. European and especially Scandinavian countries score much better.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: The website in question judges arbitrarily and with great bias. Using the 2018, "Paris Principles" as the bedrock of its argument is a major fallacy, as those accords are not universally accepted nor recognized.
1.2.1.5. Con: America is [founded](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/founding-principles/) on the belief that all men are created equal, and are entitled to inalienable God-given rights that may never be infringed upon. The US [Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights) codifies these rights.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: France has made its [own declaration of human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen) in its first constitution as a republic, which, along with the English [Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689) \(made in 1689 and [inspired the American Bill of Rights](https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/english-bill-of-rights)\), served as the basis for the United Nations declaration of human rights. As those are quite comparable to the American bill of rights, it is quite inaccurate to say "no nation to date has come anywhere close to granting its citizens \[...\]".
1.2.1.6. Pro: Human rights are evermore decreasing especially towards those of [white descent or male gender](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/straight-while-men-suffering-sex-feminism), namely due to large radical groups.
1.2.1.7. Pro: [Mass incarceration of people of color](https://www.afsc.org/story/facts-about-mass-incarceration-people-color-us) is a human rights abuse and major problem in the United States.
1.2.1.7.1. Pro: The [prison–industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison–industrial_complex#School-to-prison_pipeline_reform) introduces economic incentives to uphold a large incarceration rate.
1.2.2. Con: The US still upholds [capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States).
1.2.2.1. Con: Capital punishment in and of itself does not violate human rights, it is simply a more extreme form of punishment than incarceration.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Capital punishment is carried out with the intent to effect- and usually actually does effect- the ending of a person's life. Thus, capital punishment inherently violates the human right to life.
1.2.3. Con: The U.S. does not guarantee the right to an [adequate standard of living](https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2021/12/editing-the-constitution/guarantee-decent-living-conditions)(Though affordable housing, living wages, clean water, health care, and paid family leave are not guaranteed in the US Constitution, the federal government has affirmed them as rights since 1948. Article 25 of the United Nations’ International Declaration of Human Rights says that every person has a “right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.” But Pamela’s life and death in unnecessary squalor remind us that we have failed to live up to the commitments we made alongside the nations of the world.).
1.2.4. Con: The US restricts many social freedoms.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Several states in the US still have [anti-abortion legislation](https://qz.com/1627412/these-are-all-the-states-with-anti-abortion-laws-signed-in-2019/).
1.2.4.2. Con: This is a necessity in governance. Many other nations restrict their people's freedoms, often to a greater degree than the US.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Even if one nation may have something worse, it still cannot excuse the case.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Censorship was common in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Soviet_Union).
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: The Unites states [is not innocent of censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) either during the cold war.
1.2.4.3. Pro: During the Coronavirus pandemic, the US placed many [restrictions on civil liberties](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/new-restrictions-on-civil-liberties-during-coronavirus/).
1.2.5. Pro: The [Americans with Disability Act](https://adata.org/learn-about-ada) afforded disabled individuals, whether physically or mentally, accommodations that equalize the playing field. Few countries are as disability-friendly as the United States.
1.2.5.1. Con: This can be harmful to those who had a major disability that is now only a minor disability.
1.2.6. Pro: The US constitution and legal system protects and allows for the provision of fundamental human rights.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Individuals in the United States have a lot of power to enforce their rights and property in court.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: This is reflected by the US being the [most litigious country in the world](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/12/03/why-us-litigious/)(The United States is already the most litigious society in the world. We spend about 2.2 percent of gross domestic product, roughly $310 billion a year, or about $1,000 for each person in the country on tort litigation, much higher than any other country. This includes the costs of tort litigation and damages paid to victims. About half of this total is for transactions costs — mostly legal fees.).
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Contrary to many other countries, winners of lawsuits in the United States have to [pay for their lawyers](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/attorney-fees-does-losing-side-30337.html). This among other things leads to [SLAPP suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation) which actively discourages lots of citizens to go to court and fight for their rights.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: This protects citizens from [incurring excessive legal costs](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/attorney-fees-does-losing-side-30337.html)(Ensuring that people can bring cases and lawsuits without the fear of incurring excessive costs if they lose the case is important. To further this goal, the losing side doesn't usually pay the winning side's attorney's fees. In the United States, the rule \(called the American Rule\) is that each party pays only their own attorneys' fees, regardless of whether they win or lose.) upon losing a case, protecting them from financial disaster and encouraging them to stand up for their rights.
1.2.6.2. Con: The Constitution does not secure the provision of all universal human rights for all ethnic groups in the US.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: It has now been amended to outlaw slavery and men-only suffrage.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: The United States is not perfect in regards to slavery however it has already corrected its wrongs; today, slavery is illegal in the US, and former slaves have civil rights.
1.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The [13th Amendment provides](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiii) that slavery and involuntary servitude may be used as criminal punishment. Thus, slavery is still legal.
1.2.6.2.1.2. Con: The Constitution does not outlaw slavery; it just created extra steps.
1.2.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: The Constitution allows slavery [as a punishment for crime whereof the party has been duly convicted.](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiii)
1.2.6.3. Con: Rich people and corporations have vastly more power and opportunity to enforce their rights and property in court.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: USA has a so called [anti-SLAPP statue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation) defends the small person.
1.2.6.3.2. Pro: Ordinary people are usually the captives of unfair arbitration agreements.
1.2.6.3.3. Pro: Predators like [payday loan outfits](https://www.thebalance.com/payday-loans-315516) and for-profit schools are protected by armies of lawyers, lobbyists, and politically-appointed judges.
1.3. Con: The USA has the highest rate of [mental illness](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/mental-health)(In some countries only 5 or 10% of the adult population has suffered from any mental illness in the past year, but in the USA more than 25% have.) in the first world.
1.3.1. Pro: Approximately [1 in 5 adults](https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers) in the U.S. \(46.6 million\) experiences mental illness in a given year.
1.3.2. Pro: An estimated [26% of homeless adults](https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers) staying in shelters live with serious mental illness and an estimated 46% live with severe mental illness and/or substance use disorders.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Part of those mental illnesses is from military service in wars like Vietnam and Iraq, causing [PTSD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967).
1.3.3. Pro: Serious [mental illness](https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers) costs America $193.2 billion in lost earnings per year.
1.3.4. Con: The link only shows the mental illness diagnosis is higher in the US. It does nothing to show that the actual rate of mental illness is higher.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Higher rates of diagnosis imply a functioning health system, one that allows patients to receive healthcare and a formal diagnosis.
1.3.4.2. Con: The link in the aforementioned parent claim notes, "In some countries only 5 or 10% of the adult population has suffered from any mental illness in the past year, but in the USA more than 25% have."
1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.5. Pro: The USA has a well established and stable political system.
1.5.1. Con: There are undemocratic elements in the US political system.
1.5.1.1. Con: As a whole, the US political system is incredibly democratic. Many important positions in local, state and federal government are [directly elected](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/state-local-government/)(In every state, the Executive Branch is headed by a governor who is directly elected by the people. In most states, other leaders in the executive branch are also directly elected, including the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, the secretary of state, and auditors and commissioners. States reserve the right to organize in any way, so they often vary greatly with regard to executive structure.).
1.5.1.2. Pro: The American political system suffers from [widespread](https://harvardjol.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2019/05/hll102_crop.pdf) gerrymandering which furthers [political polarization](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/07/06/a-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization/).
1.5.1.3. Pro: The United States has one of the [lowest turnout rates](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) in elections among developed countries.
1.5.1.4. Pro: The Presidential election process suppresses the will of the people.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: The Presidential election process allows for both small and large states to have an equal say, ensuring that [no one group becomes political insignificant](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/electoral-college-explained)(Each state is alloc­ated a number of elect­oral votes based on the total size of its congres­sional deleg­a­tion. This bene­fits smal­ler states, which have at least three elect­oral votes — includ­ing two elect­oral votes tied to their two Senate seats, which are guar­an­teed even if they have a small popu­la­tion and thus a small House deleg­a­tion. Based on popu­la­tion trends, those dispar­it­ies will likely increase as the most popu­lous states are expec­ted to account for an even greater share of the U.S. popu­la­tion in the decades ahead.).
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: The President is ultimately elected by the Electoral College, resulting in the [election of presidents not even preferred by the majority of people who voted](https://time.com/5579161/presidents-elected-electoral-college/).
1.5.1.5. Pro: Millions of dollars from [private investors control the US political system](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/magazine/deutsche-bank-trump.html).
1.5.1.5.1. Pro: [A study from Princeton University](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) shows that the opinions of the average American have no significant impact on the policies enacted by the government. The opinions of the donor class are strongly correlated.
1.5.1.5.2. Pro: [American politics suffer greatly from lobbying](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2014/05/02/88917/how-campaign-contributions-and-lobbying-can-lead-to-inefficient-economic-policy/), which does not act in the best interest of the population \(e.g.: cost of medicine and healthcare\).
1.5.2. Pro: There is a deep-rooted respect for the separation of powers of state organs in the USA. This prevents tyrannical government.
1.5.2.1. Con: The respect for separation of powers is partly kept in check by a disposition of political ideologies. If one political belief system gathers a majority in all three branches of government, the opposition is easily squashed or ignored.
1.5.3. Con: The political system in the USA is a two-party system, which has certain [disadvantages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system#Disadvantages).
1.5.3.1. Pro: One of the two main parties is [considered a right wing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/26/opinion/sunday/republican-platform-far-right.html) extremist party by political scientists.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The two political parties tend to have [little ideological overlap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization#:~:text=In%20a%20two%2Dparty%20system,across%20a%20broad%20ideological%20divide.) which is counter productive when it comes to reaching a consensus in congress and leads to polarization.
1.5.4. Pro: The USA was founded on the ideals of [classical liberalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberalism/Classical-liberalism).
1.5.4.1. Pro: In the USA, freedom of speech and expression is protected.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Companies that claim to be public forums actively suppress narratives counter to leadership ideology and censor individuals who oppose their worldview.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The USA enjoys a free market economy.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Having a free market can be a good thing, however the U.S. tends to have too free a market, leading to the exploitation of its workers through low minimum wages and poor benefits.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: The household income of even the poorest 10% of the US population is still significantly higher than the total average household income of most countries.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: The free market in the US is perhaps too free: there are very large monopolies that gouge American customers and can, in the [pharmaceutical](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html) industry, even threaten lives because of dramatic price changes.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Con: The problems of the pharmaceutical industry are more due to corporatism - its control by large interest groups - than the free market.
1.5.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Countries that have more or less completely free markets do not seem to have this problem to this extent.
1.5.4.2.3. Con: Markets are not so free anymore. Corporations have a lot of control over the government.
1.5.4.2.3.1. Pro: [The US is less restrictive on banning chemicals as the EU](http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/regulations/international-laws/)
1.5.4.2.4. Pro: This means it would be a good place to start a business.
1.5.5. Con: The US has become a highly militaristic society.
1.5.5.1. Con: Former President Trump considered veterans to be [weak](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/03/donald-trumps-gaffe-on-veterans-and-ptsd-shows-just-what-an-amateur-he-still-is/) because of their war experience.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The US considers every soldier as a "[hero](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/09/25/are-troops-heroes-americans-britons-and-germans-fe)".
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: Many civilians are socially expected to [thank](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/blog/the-war-within/201711/should-you-say-thank-you-your-service)(When we meet a veteran, does he or she want to be told, “Thank you for your service?” Over the course of the last 15 years, I have heard many opinions on this question from veterans and non-veterans alike. I’ve gotten input from mental health professionals, clergy, and other medical personnel about whether to thank a veteran or active service member for their service to our country. Ultimately, I have heard mixed reviews—some people say that you should say “thank you” to a veteran or current service member; others think you shouldn't.) members of the military for their service.
1.5.5.3. Pro: In the US, many poor people [end up in military service](https://www.bread.org/library/fact-sheet-hunger-and-poverty-military-community) because there is no other choice.
1.5.6. Pro: The USA is a country where most things are under control.
1.5.6.1. Con: The USA has suffered a number of recent constitutional crises.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: The [US Supreme Court](http://a Supreme Court majority perhaps taken unconstitutionally) majority was taken unconstitutionally.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: [The Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/upshot/as-american-as-apple-pie-the-rural-votes-disproportionate-slice-of-power.html) is rurally skewed and does not represent the majority.
1.5.6.2. Pro: More people [immigrate to the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States) than those who leave it. This shows that the US is a popular place for people to want to move to and live in.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: The fact that people are moving in doesn't necessarily mean that the USA is a good country to live in. It just means that it is better than their countries of origin which usually happen to be developing or underdeveloped countries.
1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: Poorer nations are often in the situation that they are in because of US foreign policy. For example, the US-backed [military coup in Honduras](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-president-palace-sb/honduran-troops-surround-presidential-palace-idUSTRE55R15320090628) in 2009 is partially responsible for large-scale migration from that country to the US border today.
1.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: It could be through other factors that Americans don't leave, like maybe they can't and don't know of better \(or better might not exist\), for instance.
1.5.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: Moving is really hard to do, and there may be cultural, monetary, etc. reasons that trump personal, motivational, etc. ones.
1.5.6.2.2. Con: Fewer people are attempting to illegally immigrate to the US than at any time in the past [forty years](https://www.businessinsider.com/border-crossings-arrests-trump-historic-low-data-charts-2018-4). Meanwhile, emigration to Canada from the US, for example, is slightly higher.
1.5.6.2.3. Pro: [USA is still the most popular destination for immigration](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/top-25-destinations-international-migrants).
1.5.6.3. Pro: The government is less corrupt compared to others.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: The US has dropped out of the list of the [25 least corrupt countries](https://thefulcrum.us/Justice/Anti-corruption/government-corruption)(Ten years ago, the U.S. scored 73 and ranked 19th. The high water mark of that span came in 2015 \(with a score of 76, good for 16th\). This year’s report marks the first time in a decade that the United States hasn’t ranked in the top 25, falling to 27th out of 180 countries.).
1.5.6.3.2. Pro: The US is the [27th least corrupt](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/25/politics/us-corruption-perception-index-trump/index.html) country in the world.
1.5.6.4. Pro: Public services in the US aren't just for politically wealthy.
1.6. Pro: The USA has a [multicultural](https://www.londonschool.com/lsic/resources/blog/united-states-land-cultural-diversity/)(The United States of America, due to its immense size and diverse heritage, has one of the most complex cultural identities in the world. Millions of immigrants from all over the globe have journeyed to America since the Europeans discovered and colonised the land back in the 17th and 18th centuries.) society.
1.6.1. Pro: A multicultural setting generally results in tolerance for different cultures, religions and identities.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The US is very accepting of its [Jewish population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States), and as such has provided a relatively safe haven and allowed them to pursue religious practices.
1.6.1.2. Con: Unless there are economic hardships, in which case this accentuates conflict between cultures as people seek to blame easy targets.
1.6.2. Pro: A multicultural environment allows people to experience aspects of other cultures like languages and traditions, that they would otherwise not experience.
1.6.3. Con: Cultural diversity does not necessarily make a country good to live in. It can also lead to social unrest and discrimination.
1.6.3.1. Pro: It might be a multicultural society, but these diverse cultures still face a lot of discrimination and have terrible living standards.
1.6.3.2. Con: Discrimination is perpetuated by learned biases. Many people are able to unlearn these biases. If diversity itself was the root cause of these biases, this would be impossible.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Both conscious and unconscious human cognitive biases influence their perception of race and can be linked to the [perpetuation of racism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mishagajewski/2020/06/29/youre-more-racist-than-you-think-how-your-mental-biases-perpetuate-racism-and-how-to-fix-them/).
1.6.3.2.2. Con: If people are willing to put an effort, they can unlearn their biases through education.
1.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: Racial biases can be [reduced](https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/reducing-discrimination/) by learning more about the truth of different groups.
1.6.4. Pro: The United States of America is a [melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot).
1.6.5. Pro: Multicultural societies [foster dynamism and creative solutions to problems](https://www.charlottestories.com/four-benefits-of-living-in-a-multicultural-society/)(Living in a multicultural society means having direct contact with people with different habits, ideas, and lifestyles. This condition is ideal for creativity and innovation. In a multicultural society, you’re always exposed to new ways of doing things and fresh ways of looking at things. A mix of perspectives, talents, skills, and ideas fosters innovation and makes space for outside-the-box mindsets. And this is easy to notice by looking at all aspects of the American lifestyle, including food, fashion, design, art, entertainment, sports, or professional settings. \n\nLiving in a multicultural society can be an enriching experience. Differences in values, opinions, and lifestyles should serve as inspiration for self-growth rather than being a source of conflict. In a heterogeneous country like the United States, embracing diversity is vital.), despite the frictions that may exist. \([Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand) - esp. during the Timurid period\).
1.6.6. Con: The [power holders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/26/us/race-of-american-power.html) in the United States are relatively homogenous.
1.6.7. Con: American culture instills certain values in its citizens, some of which are harmful.
1.6.7.1. Pro: American culture promotes the value of gun ownership, leading to the [greatest number of civilian firearms per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country) in the entire world.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Most of these crimes are committed using [illegal guns](https://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/), hence the US banning guns would not necessarily address this problem.
1.6.7.1.2. Con: There are [invaluable lives](https://www.investors.com/politics/columnists/how-many-lives-are-saved-by-guns-and-why-dont-gun-controllers-care/) saved due to gun holders on a daily basis.
1.6.7.1.3. Pro: [Amnesty International](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/12/us-gun-control-human-rights-amnesty-international) has recommended that the US passes a sweeping set of gun control measures, including universal background checks, the requirement of a valid license to buy a gun, no gun purchases for those under 21, a ban on certain military-style weapons and ammunition, and the creation of a digitized national gun registry.
1.6.7.1.4. Pro: This results in [tens of thousands of deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/gun-deaths.html) from gun violence every year.
1.6.7.1.4.1. Con: People that want to kill or harm others will do it whether or not they have access to firearms.
1.6.7.2. Con: The American culture instills positive values too, such as a work ethic.
1.6.7.2.1. Con: The "positive work ethic" only serves to help bosses, not the workers.
1.6.7.2.1.1. Con: US culture also instills the process of workers becoming bosses.
1.6.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Yes, but bosses tend to choose those who they can still control, especially under a company takeover situation.
1.6.7.2.1.2. Con: A positive work ethic can help one get things done in or outside of the work environment.
1.6.7.2.1.3. Pro: American culture can [glorify suffering and hardship at work](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/unhealthy-american-work-habits-2017-11), such as working hard at uninspiring jobs for minimum pay, or that your [life should be defined by your work](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/) and not the other way around, whereas it may not be necessary with better support from the state \(e.g.: right to free higher education\) and [better workers' rights](https://www.ituc-csi.org/IMG/pdf/2019-06-ituc-global-rights-index-2019-report-en-2.pdf) such as maternity and paternity leave.
1.6.7.2.1.3.1. Con: Given that the United States is a [capitalist society](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-u-s-is-still-a-capitalist-country/), it makes sense for it to espouse these values.
1.6.7.2.2. Pro: US citizens [donate more time and money](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/america-new-zealand-and-canada-top-list-of-world-s-most-generous-nations-a6849221.html) than any other people in the world.
1.6.7.2.3. Con: Millions of Americans are [over-worked](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604&page=1) and have a much lower quality of life than people in European countries where they are worked much less.
1.6.7.3. Con: Every culture has its own values, you cannot decide which is good and which is bad from an external point of view.
1.6.7.3.1. Con: You can decide on an individual basis which values are good.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: Some values can produce noticeable effects that we can all agree to be bad. For example, the idea that services like healthcare should not be guaranteed by the state causes [several adverse effects](http://several adverse effects) that are bad for public health and the economic prosperity of the middle-lower class.
1.6.7.4. Pro: The US culture promotes materialism.
1.6.7.4.1. Pro: The costs of living in places like San Francisco, New York, and/or Los Angeles are horribly high and result in [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States).
1.6.7.4.2. Pro: Americans are [materialistic](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/consumerism.aspx) and emphasize the importance of large sizes in terms of products or goods like cars. This culture places a drain on resources.
1.6.7.4.2.1. Con: This is not exclusive to American culture.
1.6.7.5. Pro: Racism is deeply entrenched in American institutions and cultural practices.
1.6.7.6. Pro: The USA is particularly susceptible to cults of personality.
1.6.7.6.1. Con: [Cults of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cults_of_personality) are prevalent across the globe.
1.6.7.6.2. Pro: The US goes beyond patriotism to the more harmful nationalism in its unusually prevalent worship of police, military, and even the flag itself.
1.6.7.7. Pro: American culture is [highly nationalistic](https://theweek.com/articles/852114/pledge-allegiance-not-normal), and criticism of the USA is often viewed by Americans as unpatriotic. This behavior is unhealthy and makes political change [a difficult and long process](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/sep/22/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-us-has-oldest-working-national-cons/).
1.6.8. Con: Other countries are multicultural too. For instance, Russia has around [190](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Russia) different ethnicities.
1.6.8.1. Con: The multiculturalism of one country does not take away from another. It is possible for many countries to be multicultural at the same time.
1.7. Con: Economic opportunities within the USA are limited.
1.7.1. Con: Many people emigrate to the US in order to pursue [better economic opportunities](https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/democracy/gutierrez-immigrants-validate-values.html)(Immigrants enter the United States with dreams of a better life for themselves and their families. Rather than posing a threat to our democracy, they reinforce and enrich the values that make America the country it is.).
1.7.2. Pro: The USA favors wealthy individuals and corporations.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The United State's economy is geared towards helping the already rich.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: While not everyone succeeds, social mobility in the United States is very high compared to most others. In general, people are judged less by where they came from and more by their ability and character.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: American culture encourages grit and persistence, while its capitalist structure enables anyone with motivation and skill/talent to be successful.
1.7.2.1.1.2. Con: When American Social Mobility is [compared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States#Current_state) with the social mobility of other first world nations, social mobility in America shows to be lacking. Although Americans may judge people more by their merits, its economic system does not reflect this belief.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Minimum wage is lower in the United States relative to other countries with developed economies.
1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: This is irrelivent when overall economy is ignored and by itself is in no way a means to measure wealth.
1.7.2.1.2.2. Con: [Many developed economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country) do not even have a minimum wage.
1.7.2.1.3. Con: All capitalist economies are geared to helping the already rich.
1.7.2.1.3.1. Con: This is not necessarily true. Germany, for example, is a successful capitalist nation with significantly less income inequality and more focused on the common good than the US.
1.7.2.1.3.2. Con: This is exactly the opposite of [the evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) for all countries.
1.7.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.7.2.1.5. Pro: Taxes are high in the USA for middle class households while the rich routinely get tax breaks.
1.7.2.1.5.1. Pro: The United States imposes taxes on its citizens for income earned anywhere in the world.
1.7.2.1.5.1.1. Con: This is irrelevant to you if you live in the US.
1.7.2.1.5.1.1.1. Con: It's one less option nonetheless. People might change their mind in the future. Having this option is especially important to entrepreneurs.
1.7.2.1.5.1.1.2. Con: You might want to live in the US and still invest money abroad
1.7.2.1.5.1.1.3. Con: It reduces foreign investment in the USA and thus has an important economic impact on all Americans.
1.7.2.1.5.2. Pro: The U.S. federal government engages in wasteful spending of taxes more so than any other nation.
1.7.2.2. Con: Every country's political system favors an "elite" class in one way or the other; the US is no different. Inequality is a fact of life and existence.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: [Inequality is high in the USA](http://www.inequalityindex.com/) compared to most other developed countries.
1.7.2.3. Con: The political system favors the poor by charging them [lower taxes.](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2018/12/10/what-are-the-2019-tax-brackets.aspx)
1.7.2.3.1. Con: Rich minorities are able to simply avoid taxes thanks to "philanthropic" methods like donating to their own charities.
1.7.2.4. Pro: The United States has the highest [economic inequality](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/) of any developed nation \(after taxes\).
1.7.2.5. Con: The wealthy pay significantly higher taxes, so even if they are favored by the system, there is nothing inherently wrong with it; they create opportunities and prosperity for those within the lower classes in the form of goods and services, or salaries, thus, generating economic growth.
1.7.2.5.1. Con: The wealthy tend to pay lower [tax rates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html) than middle income people.
1.7.2.6. Pro: The US ranks very [highly](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/) in income inequality in the developed world, and that inequality is [increasing](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/).
1.7.2.6.1. Con: High-level creative personalities and entrepreneurs may be attracted by the opportunities to overachieve, and society writ large benefits from their contributions.
1.7.2.6.2. Con: Absolute wealth, or even wealth relative to other societies, is more important than internal relative wealth.
1.7.2.6.2.1. Pro: There is no point in having the poor poorer just to ensure the rich are less rich.
1.7.2.6.3. Con: With some exceptions \(nepotism, political corruption\), a philosophy that fosters income inequality is an attribute of a healthy society, wherein the rights of individuals are secure against mob-rule, contracts, intellectual- and other property-rights are enforced.
1.7.2.7. Con: If wealthy people are favoured, then it is a better place to live in for rich people.
1.7.2.8. Pro: A lot of the products that were designed in America are significantly more expensive than what is sold in other regions.
1.7.2.8.1. Pro: Pharmaceuticals developed in the US [cost at least 2-3x more than in Europe](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-u-s-pays-3-times-more-for-drugs/).
1.7.3. Pro: Living in the USA makes a person better at English, which increases their economic opportunities.
1.7.3.1. Con: Many other countries teach English as a second language, leading to similarly high English skills and the same general benefits gained from bilingualism.
1.7.3.2. Pro: English is the [lingua franca](https://www.englishexplorer.com.sg/why-the-english-language-became-the-worlds-lingua-franca/)(The real question now is that if English is considered to be a global language. The answer is probably yes since its reach has gone so far that it has become the world’s commonly used form of language for communication. Long before, English has already been established as the world’s lingua franca. Aside from the fact that it can be easy to learn, it is widely spoken by a lot of people.); it is thus the language of business, and many online communities use it as a common language in order to communicate.
1.7.3.3. Con: It is very possible to live life in a foreign country without speaking the language at more than a basic level.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Immersion is a key factor in [language-learning](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/blog/the-benefit-of-immersive-language-learning-experiences-and-how-to-create-them/)(We are wired to desire emotional and social connection, and when placed in contexts where such connection is only available through a foreign language, our motivation to acquire it increases. This is why learning a language in the country where it is spoken is so effective – it offers an opportunity for complete language immersion. Lots of communicative language lessons aim to mimic such immersion through meaningful context, extensive second language \(L2\) input and emotional engagement.). Living in the US completely immerses a person in the English language.
1.7.4. Pro: USA is a scientific, educational and technological capital worldwide.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Some of the world-renowned institutes that the USA hosts are [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University).
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Google, a multi-billion dollar company was [created within the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) and it's products are used [internationally](https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-big-4-part-2-the-future-of-google-a469483533e9).
1.7.4.2. Pro: America offers many benefits, such as [retirement plans](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/retirement/typesofplans).
1.7.4.2.1. Con: Unless a person is really careful, most of their retirement plans end-up just being [scams](https://scamreport.com/reports/investment-scams/retirement-plan-scams/).
1.7.4.3. Pro: Students flock to American universities from around the world; more than [1 million](https://educationdata.org/international-student-enrollment-statistics#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20total%20number,a%20%2D1.3%25%20decrease%20from%202018) enrolled in US institutions in 2019.
1.7.5. Con: The USA has a good economy.
1.7.5.1. Pro: The US has a high GDP per Capita \(PPP\), ranking [11th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita#Lists_of_countries_and_dependencies) out of 187 countries.
1.7.5.2. Con: Overtime, the purchasing power of money has [fallen sharply in the USA.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/purchasing-power-of-the-u-s-dollar-over-time/)(Money supply \(M2\) in the U.S. has skyrocketed over the last two decades, up from $4.6 trillion in 2000 to $19.5 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe effects of the rise in money supply were amplified by the financial crisis of 2008 and more recently by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, around 20% of all U.S. dollars in the money supply, $3.4 trillion, were created in 2020 alone.)
1.7.5.3. Pro: It ranks among the richest countries in the world, with a gross national income per capita [56,810 dollars](https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GNI-per-capita-Atlas-and-PPP-table).
1.7.5.4. Con: There is a lot of [economic inequality](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/wealth-distribution-income-inequality) in the USA. Weath Gini index is 85.90 and Income Gini index is 37.80. \(0 is no inequality, 100 is complete inequality\).
1.7.5.5. Con: Unlike most superpower economies, [the US economy is not backed by precious minerals like Gold or Silver](https://buygoldandsilversafely.com/gold/what-really-backs-the-us-dollar/#:~:text=Since%201971%2C%20U.S.%20citizens%20have%20been%20able%20to,%E2%80%9Cfull%20faith%20and%20credit%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Government.).
1.7.5.5.1. Con: US Dollar is [fiat money](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/12/06/fiat-currency-what-it-is-and-why-its-better-than-a.aspx). It is not backed by physical commodities such as gold or silver but rather by the government. Most countries in the world moved in the 20th century from commodities to fiat money.
1.7.5.6. Con: The USA has the [highest national debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt#List) in the world.
1.7.5.7. Pro: The U.S. Dollar is [the worlds primary reserve currency](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp) which is a sign of stability.
1.8. Pro: The US offers a better quality of life compared to other countries.
1.8.1. Con: According to some rankings, the US ranks only [20th worldwide](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/rankings/quality-of-life) for quality of life.
1.8.1.1. Pro: 20th is not bad. One would expect better, but the question is: is it good? Out of so many countries, 20th suggests it's quite good.
1.8.1.2. Pro: [Kids](https://www.children.org/global-poverty/global-poverty-facts/facts-about-poverty-in-usa) in the U.S. experience higher poverty rates than most developed nations. Only Greece, Mexico, Israel and Turkey have higher child poverty rates than the U.S.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: That is because the poverty line in the US is about [$24,000](https://www.children.org/global-poverty/global-poverty-facts/facts-about-poverty-in-usa). The international poverty line is [$1.90 a day](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/04/world-bank-forecasts-global-poverty-to-fall-below-10-for-first-time-major-hurdles-remain-in-goal-to-end-poverty-by-2030), which is $693.50 a year \(34.60 times less\).
1.8.2. Pro: US city design is problematic, and lowers overall quality of life.
1.8.2.1. Pro: US city design is too [car-centric](https://www.ft.com/content/27169841-7ee3-481e-919d-41b247e401f6), which causes personal, social and economic issues.
1.8.2.2. Pro: The growth of the suburb has [distanced minority areas from commercial centres](https://www.ft.com/content/27169841-7ee3-481e-919d-41b247e401f6)(New civic planning allowed families to live in larger homes, away from the crime and poverty of inner-city areas. In reality, this often meant constructing broad highways through thriving or burgeoning black or less affluent neighbourhoods to connect commercial parts of the city to new suburban developments, which were often restricted to whites.\n\n“Inner-city slums could be cleared, blacks removed to more distant second-ghetto areas, central business districts redeveloped and transportation woes solved all at the same time — and mostly at federal expense,” wrote historian Raymond A Mohl.), and encouraged [ghettoisation](https://www.nber.org/digest/oct97/rise-and-decline-american-ghetto).
1.8.2.3. Con: Many American cities use the [grid plan](https://careers.snclavalin.com/blogs/2021-10/why-the-grid-system-became-a-part-of-city-design-in-the-us)(Some of the earliest planned cities took on this gridiron layout, where streets intersect at perfect right angles and follow a hierarchy from busy boulevards to residential lanes. In more modern grid systems, town planners will establish a network of arterial and collector roads and then leave it up to subdivision developers to decide how the city takes shape from there.\n\nAround 81% of the US population live in cities and urban districts, and many feature this grid layout, but why was it favoured over other patterns?), which is an efficient and logical way to build a city.
1.8.3. Pro: The USA offers an abundance of vast open lands, wilderness and beautiful landscapes. This is a reason for outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy living there.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm) provides federal protection for large swathes of land, ensuring that [nature is protected and people can enjoy the landscape](https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Park-Service)(National Park Service \(NPS\), agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior that manages and maintains several hundred national parks, monuments, historical sites, and other designated properties of the federal government. It was established in 1916 by an act of the U.S. Congress that was signed into law by U.S. Pres. Woodrow Wilson. The law stipulated that the new service was to “conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and…leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.”).
1.8.3.2. Con: [Pollution is rampant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_in_the_United_States) across the American Landscape.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: The [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.sej.org/headlines/pruitts-epa-verge-regulatory-capture-study-says) has been weakened to the point of regulatory capture.
1.8.3.2.2. Pro: The USA pollutes as much as or even more than most other countries because of the abuse of the use of cars and planes. Europe is much better, for the cars, in [comparison](https://www.planetoscope.com/Avion/109-vols-d-avions-dans-le-monde.html) with the USA. The USA also represents [6 million of the 18 million](https://www.planetoscope.com/Avion/750-nombre-de-vols-d-avions-commerciaux-aux-etats-unis.html) of the flights in the world.
1.8.3.3. Con: Having large areas of open country does not make a country good to live in.
1.8.3.3.1. Pro: Russia is an [immense country](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)(Russia is a land of superlatives. By far the world’s largest country, it covers nearly twice the territory of Canada, the second largest. It extends across the whole of northern Asia and the eastern third of Europe, spanning 11 time zones and incorporating a great range of environments and landforms, from deserts to semiarid steppes to deep forests and Arctic tundra.), but has a low ranking of [international happiness](https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/03/22/where-does-the-u-s-land-on-the-2022-list-of-worlds-happiest-countries/)(The surveys this year’s happiness rankings were based on were conducted well before the invasion. Ukraine and Russia both fall into the bottom half of world rankings for happiness in the 2022 report, with Ukraine at No. 98 and Russia at No. 80.).
1.8.3.3.2. Con: Having many nature areas allows for many opportunities for escape into and connection with nature, [which has distinct happiness benefits](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201403/does-nature-make-us-happy).
1.8.3.4. Con: Not a lot of people choose to live within those lands, namely because of [land ownership taxes](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/03/states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-property-taxes/111375916/).
1.8.4. Con: The US ranks [last](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/#item-start) in terms of life expectancy compared to similar countries.
1.8.4.1. Con: The United States ranks [10th](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/USA) in the UN Human Development Index.
1.8.4.2. Con: The US ranks [37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) in life expectancy, meaning it has a better life expectancy than 80% of the world's nations.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: Even if we live longer than other countries, it's only because we have enough wealth and resources to keep people alive, but not on a sustainable level. There are many people with easily preventable conditions such as obesity, which waste resources.
1.8.5. Pro: The American people have rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to speech and protest.
