Discussion Name: How heavily should governments enforce regulations?

1. Governments should heavily enforce all regulations.
1.1. Con: Excessive regulation forces everyone into a box, undermining innovation.
1.1.1. Con: This is an argument against over-regulation, but not against enforcement.
1.2. Con: Some laws are outdated or flat out wrong. Governments should not enforce these, and instead seek to eliminate them whenever possible. Especially for victimless crimes
1.2.1. Pro: Laws that punish victimless crimes can be actively harmful. For example, [punishing homelessness perpetuates poverty](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/punishing-poorest-how-criminalization-homelessness-perpetuates-poverty-san-francisco), rather than resolving it.
1.2.2. Con: If the executive decides, and not the legislature, which laws are out of date or wrong by not enforcing them, this action would endanger the separation of powers.
1.2.3. Pro: The [Supreme Court](https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/) \(US\) ruled numerous laws invalid and unconstitutional.
1.2.4. Con: If governments can pick and choose what laws to enforce, this risks undermining laws at large.
1.2.4.1. Pro: People may notice that breaking the law does not lead to punishment and break those laws that are not outdated or wrong.
1.2.4.2. Con: People are likely to notice that laws are only not being enforced in cases where those laws are widely considered to be outdated.
1.2.5. Con: Where laws are outdated or wrong, the law should be changed. Up until the point of law being changed, it should still be enforced.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Only if the law is changed by the elected legislature in the official procedure in parliament can the will of the sovereign - the people - be ensured.
1.2.6. Pro: There are laws, such as the drug ban, that do no harm if violated.
1.2.6.1. Con: Drugs cause tremendous amounts of unintended suffering to millions of people. Harsher enforcement of the drug ban would only improve the welfare of states within which this ban was enforced.
1.3. Pro: All regulations and laws must be enforced consistently and equally according to the rule of law.
1.3.1. Pro: By not enforcing regulations in accordance with the law, the government loses its credibility and ultimately its \(moral\) authority.
1.3.2. Pro: The rule of law is a foundational principle of modern legal systems. The undermining of a foundational principle would undermine the system itself.
1.3.3. Con: If the rule of law forces the government to enforce unjust law, it should be replaced by a more ethical principle.
1.3.3.1. Con: In constitutional representative republics, like that of the United States, this process is too long and tedious for it to effect real and immediate change.
1.3.3.2. Pro: In constitutional representative republics, like that of the United States, there is a division of powers that allows for constant retooling of laws via the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
1.3.3.3. Con: There is no universal definition of [justice](https://digitalcommons.salve.edu/pell_theses/38/). A law that some believe to be unjust might be approved by others.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: People cannot be governed if they don't exist. In order to exist people need the ability to secure food, water, clothing, and shelter. Justice would serve a person's ability to secure such things. This justice would be universal.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: This definition assumes that a person's existence is worthy of protection, which is not always the case.
1.3.4. Pro: When a government fails to enforce regulations, they can be sued by the opposition or citizens in a constitutional court.
1.4. Pro: If regulations are designed to secure maximum freedoms for its people, then the government should heavily enforce such regulations.
1.4.1. Pro: A government's one duty is to govern some group of people. Implementing a government that would allow the governed to exercise their own free will to the greatest degree possible is what allows for innovation, new ideas, strong sense of identity, and the most prosperity among the most people.
1.4.2. Con: Not all regulations are designed to secure maximum freedom for its people and therefore the government should not heavily enforce all regulation.
1.4.2.1. Con: As long as regulations in general aim to maximise freedom for the people, all regulation should be enforced, even if there are exceptions to the general rule.
1.4.2.2. Con: People are likely to have different interpretations about which laws maximise freedom and which do not. Thus, the right to determine that should reside with the government.
1.4.3. Pro: Violent offenders of other people would be a diminishing of freedom. It would be reasonable to restrict the rights of those who have abused said rights by inflicting unprovoked violence on others. This would preserve the freedom for the masses while restricting the freedom of the offender.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Violent crime is regulated in a way so that the freedoms of violent criminals are taken away and the freedoms of others are protected. Thus, regulation is not intended to secure maximum freedom for all people.
1.5. Con: Overbearing governments often deflate the natural sense of duty a person might have. Therefore a tempered government is the best to avoid civil unrest.
1.5.1. Con: Conversely, such a tempered government might be seen as weak, encouraging crime.
1.6. Pro: Strong governments are excellent at creating a unified identity among the governed. This results in stronger culture and a greater likelihood in superiority over other nations.
1.6.1. Pro: Maximal liberties for the governed results in governmental impotence. Such governments are unable to achieve what a strong and robust government can.
1.6.2. Pro: Strong government ensures the well-being of citizens.
1.6.3. Con: People [naturally desire freedom](https://www.thebrightpath.com/en/articles/desire-freedom/) and heavy regulation undermines this.
1.6.3.1. Con: People by nature want [security](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecomaford/2013/03/13/the-3-things-all-humans-crave-and-how-to-motivate-anyone-anytime-anywhere/?sh=2a36b0761ad6), especially the absence of violence or violent death, and too much freedom undermines this.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The longing for security and the fear of death, according to [Thomas Hobbes](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27743879), lead people to agree to the social contract and give authority to the government.
1.7. Pro: Regulations are important for the safety of workers and consumers. A lot of regulations are there to prevent injuries and deaths that have happened in the past from happening again.
