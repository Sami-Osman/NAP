1.2.3. Pro: If fully automated factories exist in a city, then all of its citizens could own a share of it after it's built: the equivalent of a UBI vs keeping around useless jobs/bureaucracy just to pay people/acquire taxes.
1.3. Con: Under FALC, even if people were to act on some destructive desires, it would not cause damage, unlike current economic systems.
1.3.1. Pro: If a person wants to steal something, right now a person losing a valuable, expensive item means a long time of working a job to get it back if they can.

1.4.2.1. Pro: The end of bullshit jobs would create vast amounts of free-time for everyone to enjoy
1.5. Con: Since it has 'communism' in the name, people will be opposed to it, due to the [connotations](https://www.theclassroom.com/causes-fear-communism-us-8372.html) the name has with it, even if the type of communism is different.
1.5.1. Pro: FALCs go by the laws of supply and demand as well as a [central plan](https://www.thebalance.com/communism-characteristics-pros-cons-examples-3305589) and would have supply and demand especially distorted where there's no limit on each if it creates a post-scarcity world.

1.6. Pro: People shouldn't prey off of other's weaknesses to boost their own selves, but not bother others in one's pursuit towards getting what one wants and needs. A FALC gets us away from that pursuit, which is prevalent in capitalism.
