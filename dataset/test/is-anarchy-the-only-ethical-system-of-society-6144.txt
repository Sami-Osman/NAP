Discussion Name: Is anarchy the only ethical system of society?

1. Anarchy is the only ethical system of society.
1.1. Con: Many people get hurt in anarchist societies who wouldn't get hurt under a stable government.
1.1.1. Pro: Some people do not know what is best for them. Therefore, it is more ethical for them to be subject to those who know better than to have liberty to do as they please.
1.1.1.1. Con: If some people do not know what is best for them and that can justify a political system, this relativism could be followed to its logical conclusion that those advocating for a government might also not know what is best for them and that another political system \(such as anarchy\) is better justified.
1.1.1.2. Con: People should always have the right to reject interventions that affect them. Being subject to another person negates this right.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In many countries you may now [legally refuse](https://rightsinfo.org/medical-consent-human-rights/) a course of medical or psychiatric treatment that is deemed by professionals to be "what is best for you".
1.1.1.3. Con: By this logic, if there is somebody else who knows better what to do in every area of a person's life, then that person should be that other person's slave. Having more knowledge doesn't justify enforcing the knowledge onto anybody else.
1.1.1.4. Con: What is best for an individual is highly subjective. There is nothing ethical about one individual deciding for another individual what is best for them.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Parents should not aggress against their children; rather, parents should serve only as guardians and providers for their children.
1.1.2. Con: Most of the damage is self-inflicted, whereas in statist society oppressors harm nearly everyone. The freedom to defend oneself against harm puts the ability to avoid harm in the hands of every individual, whereas the state systematically harms almost everyone and leaves them helpless without recourse.
1.1.3. Con: This is irrelevant to the proposition that "anarchy is the only ethical system of society" because "no one getting hurt" is not a premise for rational ethics. In fact, the most important application of ethics is to define what's better when preferences of people are in conflict.
1.1.3.1. Con: "No one getting hurt" is a straw man argument. It is in quotes but no one has stated that it is a reasonable criteria for government to enforce.
1.1.4. Pro: Without a mutually agreed system of ethics administrated by an authoritative government, accessing rights and justice would boil down to violence and needless, wasteful power play.
1.1.4.1. Pro: In case of starvation, people would probably go back to survival instinct and selfish behaviour. An authority would be needed to regulate food supplies.
1.1.4.2. Con: An organized community can have in place a set of rules that are to be followed by everyone, and is universal within that community. These rules will have consequences, and repercussion for the failure to adhere to community guidelines, which would make one accountable per community to their own actions while they stay with that community.
1.1.4.3. Con: There is not necessarily agreement on moral and ethical systems even with government. Jews didn't agree to morality and ethics of Nazi Germany.
1.1.4.4. Con: Assuming that morality and ethics require agreement and authority, and without it boils down to violence, then necessarily unless there is one super-government \(which there is not\), all other governments are immoral and unethical as they're not in agreement.
1.1.4.5. Con: Collections of people who might be weaker separately but united are stronger can force you to follow an agreement you made even without the existence of a government.
1.1.5. Pro: Although government inherently violates the rights of ordinary people, the absence of government would lead to greater violation of rights due to lawless individuals dominating peaceful ones.
1.1.5.1. Con: Highly respected social norms likely pre-dated concepts of states.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Pre-state societies may well have been very [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism).
1.1.5.2. Pro: Anarchy is essentially the legalization of all crimes including murder, theft, rape, human trafficking, illicit drug use, and so on. Without any government or laws in place, people are essentially free to do whatever they want with little to no consequence.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Anarchy is not ethical when alternatives exist. Anarchy is a constant state of threat or conflict. Under anarchy, disputes erupt into violence and people align themselves with the powerful for protection \(think Tribal or Clan Warfare\).
1.1.5.3.1. Con: There are kinds of anarchism, such as [Gandhian anarchism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anarchism/#NonvViolCrim), that do not advocate violence and instead promote unity among political groups as a fundamental tennet.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: In the absence of centralized power, there is a tendency among large social groups to rush in and [fill this gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_vacuum) through the means of force.
1.1.5.4. Con: Right's are first of all not obeyed because of coercion \(like in a state system\) but because they are culturally accepted. In an anarchic culture all people are encouraged to take a stand on their part in society which in general is not wanted in state systems. Therefore working rules would be first of all upheld because of everyone's little action everyday.
1.1.5.5. Con: Any justification for violating the rights of the individual or group on the part of another individual or group claiming to represent the whole is invalid. Under an anarchic system, individuals may form groups for mutual defense against aggression. As long as these groups do not aggress upon others, they are not a form of government any more than a privately hired bodyguard or security firm.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: However, this does not exclude lawless individuals from exercising powerful aggression, defeating lawful, private defensive forces, and creating pseudo-governments \(such as mafias\). Under a government, these groups are easy to combat due to centralized law enforcement.
1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: There is no meaningful distinction between "pseudo-governments" and other governments which employ force and coercion against the general public. The argument is therefore "We must have a lawless government to prevent or fight any rival lawless governments we fear will be more oppressive than the lawless government we have created or chosen."
1.1.5.5.1.2. Pro: Because of the existence of aggressive, oppressive individuals and groups \(governments\), establishing and maintaining an anarchical society may be practically infeasible.
1.1.5.6. Con: Existence of government actually leads to lawless individuals dominating peaceful ones. There are many instances of policemen killing unarmed peaceful citizens. They have privileges that ordinary people don't have. That's unethical and dangerous. In an anarchy, there is no entity \(government\) that'd grant extra privileges to any group of individuals.
1.1.5.7. Pro: Without a government to protect the weak and vulnerable from the tyranny of the strong, there will be no such protection.
1.1.5.7.1. Con: Self-defense, community defense, and private security provide all the protection that is necessary. Charity can provide for this where personal ability fails.
1.1.5.7.1.1. Con: There is no guarantee that people will be charitable enough for the weak and vulnerable to enjoy consistent protection and support.
1.1.5.7.2. Con: Government is itself a strong tyrant that only the very elite are protected from.
1.1.5.7.2.1. Con: Governments follow through on laws they set for themselves. Those laws are applicable to all equally.
1.1.5.7.2.1.1. Con: Laws set for themselves are not a restriction of government.
1.1.5.7.2.1.2. Con: Many laws are contradictory therefore serves better the rich population who can abuse their side of the contradiction better thanks to better paid lawyers.
1.1.5.7.2.1.2.1. Pro: If a worker takes $100 from their employer, they may be jailed. If an employer refuses to pay their worker $100, they may be forced to pay it later.
1.1.5.7.2.1.3. Con: Laws are treating people inequally.
1.1.5.7.2.1.3.1. Pro: Some people and companies get money from government, some don't. Some are required to pay a lot to government, some are not.
1.1.5.7.2.1.3.2. Pro: Small companies are generally taxed a lot and large companies get money from government. Leading to overall dominance of large companies which can dictate prices, because their competition has unfair enviroment set up by government and is effectively prevented from market.
1.1.5.7.2.1.3.3. Pro: Policemen have privilege over ordinary people. If they stop acting according to law, generally they're not punished, unless it's great violation of law \(in some cases, policemen got away even with murders\). If policemen are beating some innoncent person, you cannot stop them, as attacking policemen is a crime and their word means a lot more than word of ordinary person.
1.1.5.7.2.2. Con: Governments provide protection to the weak, such as providing shelters for orphans or the homeless.
1.1.5.7.2.2.1. Con: Many governments have been [apathetic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/the-pandemic-exposes-indias-two-worlds/609838/), at best, towards the plight of the weak.
1.1.5.7.2.2.2. Con: [Historically](https://warisboring.com/when-patton-rolled-tanks-over-veterans-in-washington-d-c/), governments protect the wealthy/ruling class. More money is spent on convincing the general populace to [ignore the needy,](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18835905_10208203877409497_3904457070468809006_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeGj2QVsKI0dc_RCGjMsjXhSN7RZwXN2fgwA2Zkx0YdVZy1nRdLDeg7_cHjuM2McCPQpoWJGwAxL-Gpq06Na5dCRjxXfb2GjWlkD6pm2yr2WRw&oh=62feb00d6cc548eb611a8fef94e7316a&oe=5BDFD3F2) than on actually meeting their needs.
1.1.5.7.2.2.3. Con: The "shelters" are nearly [indistinguishable](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/37019324_10210918906123518_5673545656489213952_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeEsefCxzDCMLW_pVNiAx9_oLAjJl5U8oClSP5gWaFIEJ2AC_GaqXJWK_npSQfu-g6jYuGTZA-ys-3jl_cYrRZWJw36uHgSqCQcYSF-z6Fu2lw&oh=034dea57daf978012f27d04b9a86ecd9&oe=5BA0E44A) from jails or prisons.
1.1.5.7.2.3. Con: Governments can be forced to act by the weak, e.g. in lawsuits.
1.1.5.7.2.3.1. Con: This is only true if the government allows itself to be sued. Historically speaking, many governments have [not allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity#Immunity_of_government_officials) that.
1.1.5.7.3. Pro: Anarchy disallows the equal expression of opinions by both powerful and non-powerful individuals. In anarchy, the position of the powerful is the only position.
1.1.5.7.4. Pro: Without a government, the rich oligarchy would still be in power, but there would be fewer regulations to restrain their reach.
1.1.5.7.4.1. Pro: Rampant capitalism needs government restraint to prevent the formation of monopolies over entire business industries, e.g. [Time Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner) merging with other companies.
1.1.5.7.4.2. Con: Government doesn't prevent oligarchy from arising, it actually helps oligarchies become established and prevents common people from bringing competition to them, by requiring a lot of permissions from government to compete \(which obviously most poor people cannot afford\).
1.1.5.7.4.2.1. Pro: Any kind of new regulation law can completely eradicate small companies and nobody will care. Small companies have to monitor change in legislation and adapt, which mostly destroys their business as it's way too expensive to do so for a small company with a small budget.
1.1.5.7.4.2.2. Pro: When a new regulation is passed, a big company can either prevent its passing by lobbying or corrupting politicians, or it can adapt because of its high budget or its legislative team can find a way to ignore the regulation.
1.1.5.7.4.3. Con: Oligarchy is in power in the status quo, and those regulations are passed by oligarchy preventing small companies from providing competition to big companies. Government is not a shield against big companies, government is actually a sword for big companies to fight small ones.
1.1.5.7.5. Pro: The brutally individualistic landscape of anarchy leads to [Social Darwinism](https://www.allaboutscience.org/what-is-social-darwinism-faq.htm).
1.1.5.7.5.1. Con: [Anarcho-syndicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism) is an example of an anarchic system not subject to vicious [Social Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism).
1.1.5.7.6. Pro: Anarchist societies can leave social minorities vulnerable to mob rule.
1.1.5.7.7. Pro: Anarchy leads to only one possibility. The strong ruling over the weak. Anarchy is the antithesis of ethics not its embodiment. Anarchy is the suggestion that individuals can be relied upon to act ethically. We know this to not be true. Some people will act ethically and some will not. Those that do not act ethically are governed by the their passions and desires. They can and will use unethical means to achieve these and dominate those that choose to act ethically.
1.1.5.7.7.1. Con: There is nothing wrong that people are acting for their passions and desires.
1.1.5.7.8. Pro: Any system of society that bears a high risk of being replaced by a highly unethical system \(e.g. rule of the strongest, totalitarianism\), has to be considered unethical. Any such forms of anarchism have to be rejected as unethical, even if life in an anarchic society were more ethical.
1.1.5.7.8.1. Con: One should not consider systems of society that are premised on voluntary interaction to be less stable than systems of society premised on threats of violent force. The world wars were not instigated by anarchic societies.
1.1.5.7.8.1.1. Con: Yet, an anarchic society has to face the potential of world wars. It is irrelevant, whether an anarchic society is capable of instigating world wars or not.
1.1.5.7.8.2. Con: Anarchic society is more ethical than alternatives because is not premised on violent force. We do not label individuals or groups as "unstable" simply because they are vulnerable to sociopathic violent attacks.
1.1.5.7.8.3. Pro: The [democracy of the Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#Institutional_problems) has to be considered less ethical than a ["streitbare Demokratie"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streitbare_Demokratie), because it has been overtaken by an authoritarian regime.
1.1.5.7.8.4. Pro: In an anarchist society, there is no centralised political authority that can defend against the rise of fascist or authoritarian threats.
1.1.5.7.8.4.1. Con: Fascist and authoritarian threats existed in history thanks to having the chance to control an already existing government. If you have no government, it's harder for the fascist to get any power.
1.1.5.7.8.4.2. Con: When a government exists, there is no political authority that can defend against the rise of fascist or authoritarian threats within the government.
1.1.5.7.8.4.3. Pro: Modern democracies are designed to resist drastic changes in their political system or core values by implementing seperation of power with checks and balances.
1.1.5.7.8.4.3.1. Con: Accepting the logic that power is indeed best separated, then we should separate power completely so everybody has equal power. That system is called an anarchy. That's the best possible check, as it results in maximal separation of power and the only actual perfect balance, as nobody has power over anybody else.
1.1.5.7.8.5. Con: An armed anarchist society with an organized guerrilla would be just as difficult to replace than any other statist solution.
1.1.5.7.8.5.1. Pro: Anarchist society would probably be even harder to replace if we assume that replacing government just requires taking control of the centralized authority whereas replacing anarchy would require forcing every single person to obey \(as there is no centralized authority that would affect them all\).
1.1.5.7.8.6. Con: In reality, it is easier to subvert a society that already has a dominant government. When power is decentralized, it's much harder to dominate and install unethical systems.
1.1.5.7.8.6.1. Pro: The attempt to install [Socialism in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution) resulted in Stalin's dictatorship.
1.1.5.7.8.7. Con: Every single system risks being replaced by a highly unethical one. Anarchy is the only one of those that isn't, itself, unethical, since it's purely voluntary system and nobody is forced against their will to cooperate with the government.
1.1.5.7.8.8. Pro: A perfectly ethical society still faces threats from the inside and outside. It needs to be capable to defend against such threats in order to keep providing an ethical framework.
1.1.5.7.8.9. Con: Law of the strongest is not unethical. it's natural. much more natural than to have someone weak in position of command simply because his progenitors were strong.
1.1.5.7.8.9.1. Con: [Appeal to Nature](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/36/Appeal-to-Nature) is a logical fallacy. Being natural doesn't equate being ethical.
1.1.5.7.9. Con: Police can exist under anarchy too. Police can protect the weak. Any service granted by government is also a service that can work on a free market. Anarchy is by definition a free market, as any limitation of free market would be governing and anarchy is the lack of that.
1.1.6. Con: Governments can [harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity) citizens too.
1.1.6.1. Con: There are at least some situations in which governmental coercion is justified.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Coercion is not by itself unethical. Coercion is used for example in forcing violent criminal offenders in being incarcerated.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Coercion is ethical if and only if it is used to minimize avoidable human suffering.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Governments make laws to ensure that acts like murders and theft do not happen constantly. These acts can be extremely detrimental to other people and hence coercion in this context is important.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Con: You can avoid suffering of other people by donating organs. Thus, by applying this logic, forcing people to donate their organs \(those they can live without\) is ethical. However, it violates the [non-aggression principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle), and the majority of people would consider this unethical nowadays.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1. Con: This is a fallacy argument. It assumes donating organs \(even those they can live without\) would not cause suffering. Any operation would cause suffering and potential suffering down the road, and forced organ donation is not a logical next step of the avoid suffering argument.
1.1.6.1.2.3. Con: One human's suffering isn't enough of a reason to violate human rights of another human being. Coercion is not ethical even if it's used to minimize human suffering.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: If suffering is utilized to ensure that a person does not commit crimes, then it should be acceptable.
1.1.6.1.2.3.2. Pro: Principles based on minimizing suffering allow me to do whatever I like to you provided that the amount by which it makes me feel better exceeds the amount by which it makes you feel worse. Most of us don't really want to live under such an ethic. We want rights over own bodies, our own small patch of ground, the work of our own hands. Rights that aren't conditional on the strength of other people's feelings.
1.1.6.1.2.4. Pro: If a person has a virulent and dangerous disease it seems justified to use force to contain and treat that person, against their will, even though they haven't harmed anyone or initiated aggression.
1.1.6.1.2.4.1. Con: Passively spreading an infectious disease harms people and is a violation of their rights. This is an act of aggression regardless of intent.
1.1.6.1.2.4.2. Con: Containing the infectious person is partially done in self-defense, which is justifiable in anarchy.
1.1.6.1.3. Con: If those situations violate [non-aggression principle \(NAP\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle), then these are not morally justified.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Con: The Non-Agression Principle uses absolute logic. It doesn't allow for weighing risks or lesser evils against each other. The coercion used by government is a potential lesser evil, thus the NAP can't be applied to judge governments.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: Governments are potential lesser evils, because they exist in order to protect their people or a subset of their people from harm.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Government isn't the only entity providing protection to people, but it itself is an entity that does harm people who don't violate NAP. Therefore it is not lesser evil.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Unless we know that it's the lesser evil, its "evil" actions can't be excused.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: If a highly intoxicated person is intending to perform a dangerous action \(e.g. climbing a tree or driving a car\), it's generally considered ethical to restrain that person. They don't grasp the consequences of their actions and could hurt themselves or others.
1.1.6.1.4.1. Con: Coercion is not necessary for the existence of restrictions.
1.1.6.1.5. Pro: Coercion could be justified in situations where you are helping someone take care of themselves. This could include but not be limited to convincing them to take medicine for an illness.
1.1.7. Pro: If we applied anarchism at an individual level, there would be a need to 'always sleep with one eye open' because we could never ensure that our neighbors or friends would always remain at peace with us.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Anarchy is the absence of a higher authority. In the absence of an external authority, a state cannot be sure that today's friend will not be tomorrow's enemy. The same concept could be applied at the individual level.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Anarchistic relationships between states don't lead to all out warfare between states, so it's wrong to think that anarchistic relationships between individuals would lead to all out warfare between individuals.
1.1.7.2. Con: This argument is invalid. We can never ensure that our neightbors or friends will always remain at peace with us no matter of the system we live in.
1.1.7.3. Con: Private security forces exist, and they're more effective and cheaper than government police.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: Speculating about economic outcomes in a complex system should be based on evidence. [This study highlights several examples where the public sector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/) is more cost-effective.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: If a security company is private, it needs to not violate [NAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle). If they had rules that violate NAP, they could easily get into conflict with another security company. Conflicts won't result in battles as it is way too expensive and an economically bad decision.
1.1.7.3.2.1. Con: A big private security company could violate NAP without getting trouble, because smaller company won't take the risk to do anything against them.
1.1.7.3.3. Pro: The difference between government police and private security police is that government has no competition, or motivation to offer good services, and it forces everybody to pay for it. A private company can have competition and strives for profit. Thus it will work hard to optimize its services and be cheaper in order to be picked over its competition.
1.1.7.3.4. Pro: Private security would necessarily be the only ethical solution as it is voluntary and does not force people to pay for it.
1.1.7.3.5. Con: Private mercenaries can be used to displace and coerce people for profit and even violate their human rights. There are modern day examples for this practice, typically disguised as security forces, e.g. [Mexico](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1870057816300221).
1.1.7.3.6. Con: Private security forces are - exclusively - vulnerable to not being paid anymore and resisting security forces. Public security forces have an obligation towards their superior as well as their target or suspect, because they are public.
1.1.7.3.6.1. Con: They have very slight obligation towards public as nobody else is allowed to work as competition and public has to pay them, even when they disagree with them. When people would disagree with private security, they don't get paid by those people. Thus effectively private security forces have more accountability towards public than public security forces as private forces works only as long as people support them, while public security forces works despite of that.
1.1.7.3.7. Pro: Having competition pressures companies to struggle for customers, leading to benefits to the customer, higher quality security forces, and lower prices.
1.1.7.3.7.1. Con: It also encourages companies to accumulate financial and political power and establish monopolies. Hence why in the US average wage has not gone up with inflation for decades.
1.1.7.3.7.2. Con: Having competition pressures companies to struggle for making money, not for customers. Leading to a higher quality security forces on lucrative task, but also to a lowest quality one on non lucrative task.
1.1.7.3.8. Pro: Vast majority of people in prison didn't do morally anything wrong to deserve being there. [Victimless crimes.](https://mic.com/articles/8558/why-we-need-prison-reform-victimless-crimes-are-86-of-the-federal-prison-population#.qjko4MjGy) Police focuses way too much on victimless crimes, and way too little on real crimes.
1.1.7.3.9. Pro: Private security forces would be cheaper than government ones.
1.1.7.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.7.
1.1.7.3.9.2. Pro: Most people wouldn't give willingly their money to prosecute other people for victimless crimes. Those money could be spared or used better.
1.1.7.3.9.3. Pro: Since the private sector cares for profit, it tries to not waste money. Politicians are not motivated to not waste money, as the money they waste is not theirs, they're not held accountable, and can forcibly take more money.
1.1.7.3.9.3.1. Con: Security is something you should invest money into, not something you should use to make money.
1.1.7.3.9.4. Pro: By directly paying the police, customers would save almost [50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Freedom_Day) of resources, that would otherwise have been politicians and bureaucrats' wages.
1.1.7.3.10. Con: Private security forces only protect people which have enough money to pay for it.
1.1.8. Con: An anarchist system isn't necessarily unstable. Political anarchism isn't a state of lawless anarchy.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Anarchy just means laws aren't [centralised](https://theconversation.com/what-is-anarchism-all-about-50373), horizontal structures can allow society to organise.
1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.7.
1.1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.2. Pro: Anarchism allows for coexistence of societies/communities with a variety of organizational, political, and moral concepts - including non-anarchist ones.
1.2.1. Pro: Bolo'bolo describes the coexistence of diverse communities: [bolo'bolo \(nima\)](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/p-m-bolo-bolo#toc23)
1.2.2. Pro: [Panarchy from Max Nettlau](https://www.panarchy.org/nettlau/1909.eng.html) describes how anarchism can coexist with other forms of social organizations.
1.2.3. Con: Anarchy tolerating subsystems without any restrictions is not stable.
1.2.3.1. Pro: As the size of any subsystem is not defined, even starting with small subsystems, some communities/societies will grow more successfully eventually turning into a monopoly.
1.2.4. Con: Whatever system of law applies to relationships between people of different communities is the basis of government. E.g. the govt of the USA is the federal govt. The idea that inter-community government is restricted to ensuring natural rights, and intra-community government is whatever each community wants, is attractive. But that's not anarchy, it's subsidiarity.
1.2.5. Con: Anarchism is antithetical to coexistence, as no systems of consequence exist to keep populations from starting conflict, violently or non-violently.
1.3. Con: A benevolent dictatorship is more ethical than anarchy.
1.3.1. Con: Dictatorships are rarely benevolent, and even more rarely remain benevolent.
1.3.1.1. Pro: There is no factual evidence of countries having a benevolent dictatorship.
1.3.2. Con: The [dictatorship](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dictatorship) itself, by definition, is a form of government in which one person or a small group possesses absolute power without effective constitutional limitations.
1.4. Pro: Anarchy hinders the centralization of power, allowing for a less stratified and more egalitarian society.
1.4.1. Pro: The desire for non-anarchic stability leads humans to invest supreme executive power in a governing class. For instance, kings, popes, emperors, nobles, dictators, etc.
1.4.2. Pro: In order to enforce a legal system, the governing class needs to have a monopoly on violence. This further solidifies the social stratification of the governing class.
1.4.2.1. Con: Under legal systems with equal laws for everyone, where people vote for lawmakers this does not automatically lead to social stratification or a governing class above the people.
1.4.3. Pro: [Studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/freedom-learn/201105/how-hunter-gatherers-maintained-their-egalitarian-ways) suggest that it was precisely this anarchic tendency to ridicule anyone who attempted to assert social stratification that allowed [hunter-gatherer](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hunter-gatherer-culture/) societies to maintain their "fierce egalitarianism".
1.4.4. Con: Currency is power and this would still exist in an anarchy, thus power will still be amassed by whomever acquires large quanta. This retains social strata.
1.4.5. Con: Anarchy significantly impedes the ability of people to engage in large scale cooperative projects by failing to protect property rights. Power immediately concentrates in the hands of anyone who can compel or coerce others into activities under threat of violence or refusal to provide necessities like food or shelter.
1.5. Con: Anarchy is the absence of order.
1.5.1. Pro: Governments create order through courts, military, police, and laws.
1.5.1.1. Con: Government laws are arbitrary. Arbitrary order is antithetical to liberty.
1.5.2. Con: Spontaneous order is a more efficient method for bringing order to society AND is voluntary.
1.5.3. Pro: A government still effectively exists as long as there is order, a chain of command or delegation to leadership, even if you refuse to call it one.
1.5.4. Con: It is unclear whether order is a requisite for an ethical system of society.
1.5.5. Con: [Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy#Political_philosophy) is the absence of political representatives, not the absence of order or systems.
1.5.5.1. Pro: An organizational framework does not necessitate government, just sufficient buy-in from the participants. Anarchy is not the same as chaos or lack of organization.
1.5.5.2. Con: Without a system of rules which govern there is no order.
1.6. Pro: Coercion is unethical and governments are by nature coercive.
1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Maximized individual liberty is most ethical. Therefore, a system in which everyone may do anything they please, except violate the rights of others, is most ethical.
1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6.2.2. Con: It's far from clear that maximised individual liberty is the most ethical state of affairs. Alternative situations with different degrees of liberty may prove more ethical.
1.6.2.3. Con: A person's rights can easily conflict with individual liberty.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: The right to follow your religious beliefs [often conflicts](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/nov/03/conflicting-rights) with the right of others not to face discrimination.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: The pursuit of equality, in order to maximise the liberty of the least well off, often [conflicts](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/gUeuGWflfbfmqpR4OqkYSN/The-conflict-between-liberty-and-equality.html) with the liberty of others.
1.6.2.4. Pro: This is intuitively appealing, the idea that people should be left to do what they want if they don't interfere with the lives of others.
1.6.2.5. Con: In an anarchist society, there cannot be rules which determine what qualifies as the violation of the rights of others. Maximized individual liberty in this case cannot be said to be ethical at all, let alone the most ethical form of society.
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: Ethics and anarchy are incompatible as anarchy would not allow for a formative definition of ethics.
1.6.2.5.1.1. Pro: Most moral frameworks are designed to be universally applicable to everyone in society. Anarchism rejects the very concept of universally applicable principles.
1.6.2.5.1.2. Con: Political power \(ie. a state\) is antithetical to a formative definition of ethics, because the state can make up whatever laws they want. The holocaust was legal. So was slavery.
1.6.2.5.1.3. Pro: Ethics is the order of morality, differentiating between actions that are morally benign, malignant, progressive, and destructive. Yet anarchy is the absence of order.
1.6.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Today the term \[anarchy\] is still synonymous with disorder and chaos.
1.6.2.5.1.3.1.1. Con: This is an appeal to majority \([argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)\). People can think that the lack of government is synonymous to disorder and chaos but that itself isn't enough for it to be correct. People can be wrong and we have evidence of majority being wrong about many things in history.
1.6.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: According to [Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_%28Spinoza%29), ethics is the process of applying reason to the phenomenon of emotions or "passions." "Reason teaches acquiescence in the universal order, and elevates the mind above the turmoil of passion."
1.6.2.5.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.6.2.5.2. Con: An Anarchist society could determine what qualifies as a "violation of the rights of others" using the [NAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle), which defines as agression the violation of one's [natural right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) to life, property and freedom. Those violations can only be executed ethically in defensive means, as in, against someone who has previously violated these rights.
1.6.2.6. Con: There exists no objective standard against which to measure what is most or least ethical. The selection of all such ideals or standards, while not arbitrary, is nevertheless subjective.
1.6.2.7. Con: Not violating the rights of others needs to be enforced by some entity, otherwise the system allows it. This entity would be a kind of government.
1.6.2.7.1. Con: It may very well be private security force, government forces are not necessary for that and are actually less effective.
1.6.2.7.1.1. Pro: Anarchy is flexible and is the best system to converge on rules desired by the people through a free market place of ideas.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: Anarchy believes in [many kinds of equality](http://www.earlhamsociologypages.co.uk/Anarchismequal.doc) by default, whereas other ideologies do not.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Through the substantive rule of law, liberal democracies believe in and promote equality at least as effectively as anarchical societies.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Liberal democracies have adopted an array of [international human rights laws](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-are-human-rights/international-human-rights), with principles of equality running through them.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: The state exists to uphold the power of the upper class and corporations. The state can not be reformed to fulfill a goal that conflicts with its purpose so therefore in order to create a society that would create the best system for everyone the State must be abolished.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Democratic systems among others will often and to different degrees support the national interest including the interests of the majority.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: To get an accurate picture we need to look beyond the national. The benefits liberal-democracies have been able to grant the majority \(such as healthcare or education\) are paid for by the exploitation of the "global south".
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: If we look at what elites are gaining in comparison to what the majority is, this argument looses credibility. As the growing wealth gap between the many and few displays.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.3. Pro: Anarchy supports economic equality.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The collective ownership of the means of production and for the distribution of goods and services in accordance with individual need determines the highest form of economic equality and is possible within an anarchist society.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: "The abolition of the state will help individuals to develop \[...\] economic equality of outcome since only then will all individuals have access to the resources necessary to develop their individuality and hence their individual liberty."
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Goods and services can be exchanged on the basis of their costs \[primarily their labour costs\] excluding any profit which, therefore, removes the possibility of the exploitation of labour.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.4. Pro: Anarchy supports political equality.
1.6.2.7.1.1.1.5. Pro: Anarchy supports social equality.
1.6.2.7.1.1.2. Con: Anarchy, historically speaking, has never been the best system for converging on rules desired by the people. The [countries that top the UN charts](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/17428.jpeg) have fairly large governments.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3. Pro: Anarchies are more effective at dealing with economic externalities than governments.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: Anarchy is good for protecting the environment.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Governmental forces which can combat environmental destruction at the hands of profiteering institutions typically become ineffective at combatting these institutions.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The nature of political campaigning, and its reliance on funds to put certain people in office over others, lays the ground for special interests to undermine environmental policy.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: This is an example of how corruption is used to trade government violent authority in exchange for wealth under the table.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Institutions that exploit the environment can garner [phenomenal wealth](http://fortune.com/global500/), which allows them to dominate the discourse in the government.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.4. Con: Environmental regulation in the Western World has proved effective in improving the natural environment and reducing previous damage.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: British beaches were seriously polluted but have been [improved](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/25/95-of-british-beaches-clean-enough-to-swim-eu-tests-show) over time through governmental interventions.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: The US Environmental protection agency has a history of [success](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-epa-first-40-years/) in restricting known environmental pollutants.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.5. Con: Lobbying works both ways, so environmental groups can also pressure government to increase the effectiveness of environmental bodies.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.1.5.1. Con: This leads to outcomes based on the relative strength of lobbying and not necessarily ethical ones.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Governments often have many other issues to deal with and therefore [fail to pay attention](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/09/world-governments-failing-earths-ecosystems-says-top-conservationist) to environmental protection or prioritize economic growth over it.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Under anarchism, the decision of whether to exploit or protect an environmental feature would be delegated to a body that wouldn't be required by regulations to consider the interests of all groups - yet environmental issues are most effectively tackled when they [are addressed collaboratively](https://phys.org/news/2017-08-kind-collaboration-key-environmental-problems.html) and when regulations and frameworks are put in place to stimulate collaboration.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.2. Con: Under anarchism it's easy to impose externalities on less powerful groups and individuals due to the absence of regulation.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: If a company decided to place a polluting industry close to low-income homes, without a controlling third party like a government the individuals would have no recourse to protect themselves.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The right to damages is not created by government. Private institutions can resolve conflicts more efficiently than government and act as a better recourse. [For instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism#Law_and_order_and_the_use_of_violence), harmed parties can create a claim against the hypothetical company's insurance policy, compliance could then be enforced by powerful voluntary institutions that the harmed individual was a contributor to.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Without a government, companies would not be required to have such an insurance policy.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.2.2. Con: In anarchy, complaints regarding externalities could be handled in discussion, mediation, or civil court between the harmed parties and the group creating externalities. This leads to better resolutions than rules created by the government - an unrelated third party often having conflicts of interest.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Without government there is no framework to require people to participate in the discussion and industries could simply overpower those who resist them.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.3. Pro: The absence of a central authority to enforce a system of property rights gives activists more ability to take direct action in the form of obstruction and property destruction.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Defense of private property rights would be more effective and the consequences more severe under anarchy, restricting the ability of activist through fear of consequences.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: The physical, economic, and political costs of individual implementing severe consequences for the violation of property are substantial when centralised government does not subsidise the use of force with their institutions. Over time ventures and institutions that rely on this would be superseded by ventures and institutions that don't experience resistance in the form of property destruction or obstruction.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: If someone in defense of private property escalates against activists, perhaps to lethal force or excessive injuries, the activists may escalate back. [An RPG system can cost as little as $600](http://www.military-today.com/firearms/rpg_7.htm). Those defending the private property will be fearful of the consequences of escalating the conflict.
1.6.2.7.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Obstruction and property destruction tactics are used by the [Animal Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front) and [Earth First!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_First!).
1.6.2.7.1.1.4. Pro: Not being able to test many different rules before deciding on which one works best is equivalent to guessing the best rule.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5. Pro: For instance, under anarchy, the owner of a large business complex and shopping mall could choose to ban firearms from the premises or create strict rules for carry of firearms. Because all of this land is privately owned, a ban is lawful.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5.1. Con: In an anarchy, gangs or mobs would simply take things they desire from anything resembling a business. Businesses as we know them, cannot exist in an anarchy.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Anarchic systems do not entail a lack of security systems which protect organizations. Groups which enforce security can still exist within anarchy but would be run by cooperative groups rather than the state.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Anarchy is compatible with small enterprises that are workers cooperatives and are collectively run.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5.2. Pro: Those who feel safer under gun control could freely do business here without infringing on anyone's right to self-defense. Likewise, those who prefer self-defense through firearms could choose to do business elsewhere. Businesses within would have the same choice.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5.3. Con: The concept of [private ownership of land](https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/anarchism-and-private-property) is not compatible with anarchism.
1.6.2.7.1.1.5.4. Pro: If the rules established by owners of such a complex are disliked by businesses, fewer businesses will locate there, causing the owners not to be very successful or capable of expanding. Likewise, if the rules are disliked by consumers buying from these businesses, the owners will not be able to attract businesses to rent there due to the rules turning away too many customers. Similarly, if rules meet a niche market, such a location would attract many businesses and customers.
1.6.2.7.1.1.6. Con: There is no guarantee that ideas establish themselves based on the will of the community. People with power will still be able to enforce their ideas with coercion and force.
1.6.2.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: In criminal or lawless areas \(e.g certain parts of Mexico\) you don't see the community mutually converging on ideas. Instead, you see the desires of people being suppressed by a violent minority in possession of power.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7. Con: While anarchy would provide the opportunity for a greater variety of rules, it cannot control which rules become more dominant than others.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.1. Con: Rules become dominant as a function of voluntary acceptance. People are free to choose rules, adjudicators, and enforcement.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.2. Pro: In a given area, only one set of rules/norms can be upheld. Without a centralized authority to determine which norms are to be followed, the result will be "might makes right", which is chaotic and unethical.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.2.1. Con: Government itself is might makes right, thus this argument disproves the implied belief. Anarchy is the lack of government, and government is might makes right; thus, government is unethical.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: In every government there are certain amounts of people who rule over other people. Even in democracy, usually the majority rules over the minority. Some people are forced by might to participate in the democratic system against their will. The majority has more might, thus government is "might makes right" and is unethical.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.2.2. Con: I can decide to not follow a norm if I want, unless some entity prevents me. The only way any other entity can prevent me is by forcing me to do it their way, thus becoming government. As anarchy is the lack of government, it implies that there is no entity forcing me to follow any norms. This way anarchy is actually not "might makes right".
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.7.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.3. Pro: Rules might become dominant due to propaganda campaigns.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.3.1. Con: That's a good argument for anarchy, since in a democracy, propaganda can affect rules that are enforced even on people who didn't fall for the propaganda. In an anarchy those rules are able to be enforced only by people who chose them, which is them acting on their freedom.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.4. Con: A locally established code of ethics which dictates how an individual acts and responds in a given situation helps to determine what sets of rules will be more dominant across communities.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.5. Con: Cooperation from community to community can work to set up a more universal code of law.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.6. Con: It's a good thing that individuals cannot control which rules can become dominant than others. Politicians use laws as tools to harm people for their own benefit.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.6.1. Pro: [War on drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs) is failing for years, it doesn't reduce addiction to drugs, the only thing it reduces is tax payer wage and it helps mafia to keep their drug business. Drugs being legal would eradicate their whole mafia business.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.6.2. Pro: Certain rules limit freedom and are unethical. For example, in most countries you cannot educate your child yourself, but you have to send them into the government controlled education system because the majority wishes so; but instead of sending just their own children there, they also voted that you have to too.
1.6.2.7.1.1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Democracy is used as a tool to limit other people's freedom against their will, thus it's unethical \(even when it does not harm anybody\). Anarchy doesn't allow limiting other people's freedom. You can only limit yours. As it should be.
1.6.2.8. Con: In order to define what constitutes violating someone’s rights, there must be a system or organisation which imposes this rule - something which goes against anarchical beliefs.
1.6.2.8.1. Pro: By this line of reasoning, it is impossible for society to maintain a state of anarchy before reverting back to a governed system, and an attempt to keep it in a state of anarchy is unethical.
1.6.2.8.2. Con: This system goes against anarchical belief only if it violently forces its subjects to cooperate against their will. Private security forces that enforce [NAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle) are not government, and can therefore exist in an anarchist society.
1.6.3. Pro: There are countless historical examples of unjust government coercion.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Many countries have compulsory [military service](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-44646267).
1.6.3.2. Pro: [Ireland's Penal Laws](https://www.law.umn.edu/library/irishlaw/intro) allowed the Protestant Parliament to regulate the status of Roman Catholics, amounting to coercive policies like segregation.
1.6.4. Pro: Individuals do not have the right to coerce others. Therefore, it is also unethical to delegate coercion to others under the label of "government".
1.6.4.1. Con: Coercion is not a negative thing.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: One can coerce their children into a more positive behavior or action. This is not invalid, nor unwarranted. And within parents' rights.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: That's only their children and it's really subjective whether parent should be able to dictate their children what school they need to study etc.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Con: Most people would prefer if they were not forced into anything by other individuals. It's seen as negative thing, because instead of providing arguments and persuading person with reason, you're actually trying to force person to do something using violence. Not only that's unethical, but it's also dangerous as using force instead of reason can be used to support other unethical things.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: Coercion that violates [NAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle) is negative thing. Such coercion is done by government.
1.6.5. Con: There are non-anarchic forms of governance that are non-coercive and thus at least as ethical as anarchy.
1.6.5.1. Con: There are possible other ethical systems of society, the most praised being Democracy.
1.6.5.2. Pro: The ethics necessary for anarchy can also be held in other forms of social organization.
1.6.5.3. Con: It is sometimes necessary to force individuals to do what is right. People are not ethical, honest or right all the time, and this is the problem with democracy today in many countries, as it favours individuals, usually the richest, over the common good.
1.6.5.4. Con: Many anarchists are fine with forms of governance and hierarchy so long as it is actually voluntary for all of those involved. Therefore, the above statement is only relevant for a portion of anarchists, not the political anarchists or anarcho-capitalists.
1.6.6. Con: Coercion is inevitable in any context.
1.6.6.1. Pro: In an anarchic society, coercion will just be privatized. People with power will enact their own rules. A government can minimize the coercion each individual has to suffer.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: Problems with free market economies that result from self interest cannot be solved with an appeal to competition.
1.6.6.1.1.1. Pro: Worker rights and worker safety are only minor concerns in pure capitalism.
1.6.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: A relationship with employers is hardly voluntary. Without an option to opt out of wage labour, and capitalism generally, there isn't a choice to be made. Either you exploit labour or you are labour.
1.6.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It's wrong to say you need to be either an employer or an employee in an anarchy. You're free to be self-sufficient without the need to interact with other people.
1.6.6.1.1.2. Pro: If coercive actions improve service to the customer, but coerce someone else, then a free market economy will force companies to act coercively.
1.6.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Most customers wouldn't support such a behaviour as it would indirectly also hurt people they like. The company which would coerce people would not likely exist for long since most customers wouldn't support such a behaviour.
1.6.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Appealing to supply and demand in order to prevent fraud or coercion presupposes that a majority of consumers can be informed about every single product chain \(or certification agency\) of products they buy. This is an unrealistic expectation.
1.6.6.1.1.2.2. Con: If coercive actions improve government service to majority of customers, but coerce somebody else, then government will continue to act coercively in this manner. This argument is equivalently valid for an anarchy and a government.
1.6.6.1.1.3. Pro: Without a government monopoly on violence, corporations are permitted to using violence.
1.6.6.1.1.4. Pro: Free market economy is a combination of a [Evolutionary Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) and a [Greedy Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm). Both are likely to produce suboptimal results and only produce optimal results under very specific circumstances. Hence ubiquitous, unrestricted appliance is not optimal and there will always be results that need "tweaking".
1.6.6.1.1.4.1. Con: "Tweaking" \(regulating\) market is perfect way how to help huge corporations to create toxic market enviroment in which huge corporation can charge enormous prices for low quality items because they don't need to deal with their competition as their competition is prevented from existing by those "tweaks".
1.6.6.1.1.5. Pro: Real life examples illustrate that appeal to competition cannot solve problems resulting out of self interest.
1.6.6.1.1.5.1. Pro: Competing companies have agreed to [fix prices](http://Competing companies have before.) before.
1.6.6.1.1.5.2. Pro: Climate change can't be properly tackled by the private sector, because the short-term losses outweigh the possible long-term gains on a free market and a few highly pollutant countries or corporations can render any effort futile.
1.6.6.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The government supports large companies that [hurt the enviroment](https://fee.org/articles/government-versus-the-environment) using taxpayers' money. Regardless of whether taxpayers care about the environment, they're forced to support short-term benefit of somebody else at the expense of the environment. In a free market this is not the case.
1.6.6.1.1.5.3. Pro: The American healthcare system doesn't provide health insurance to everyone, when at the same time healthcare is astronomically expensive only to allow for higher insurance discounts.
1.6.6.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Which is outcome of regulation preventing competition to enter drug market and drugs being illegal. If drugs were legal, you wouldn't need to pay so much for medication. Any regulations helps to create oligopolies and monopolies, that's why free market is better sollution than government regulation.
1.6.6.1.1.5.4. Pro: Food labeling and food safety would have much lower standards on a free market, because consumers can't have perfect information.
1.6.6.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: In the majority of countries, the food industry is regulated by the government, in order to improve services and make them more ethical, e. g. [consumer protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection) or [food safety standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety).
1.6.6.1.1.5.4.2. Con: Consumer protection and food safety standard can be done by free market companies using [private certification agencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvxT7fryE3Q&feature=youtu.be).
1.6.6.1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Some private certification agencies are [more trustworthy](https://www.theregreview.org/2014/10/06/lytton-private-certification/) than government entities.
1.6.6.1.1.5.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.2.1.1.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5. Pro: A free market is inadequate to prevent cartel formation, because cartels offer huge benefits to participating companies.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.1. Con: Cartels exist thanks to restrictions. Government is the most effective way to create cartels.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.2. Pro: Mergers and acquisition are common in any market to achieve bigger and bigger shares of a market. The bigger the share, the higher the influence, up to a point where only few companies control a market. Without [competition laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law), it would be a matter of ages, until most markets were controlled by monopolies or cartels.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.2.1. Con: Argument "let's create monopoly to prevent existence of monopolies" doesn't make much sense. Government is a monopoly.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.2.2. Con: Monopolies cannot exist in an anarchy. Government actually helps creating monopolies.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.2.2.1. Pro: In order for true monopoly to be formed and have negative impact on society and economics, the monopoly business have to be sure not only that there is no competition for it, but also that no new competition can be formed. The only way to ensure that, is to abuse legislative system and prevent competition by passing laws that prevent it.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.2.2.2. Pro: Companies like Facebook, which might be considered a monopoly by some, is not true monopoly as nothing prevents its competition to exist. Monopolies that cannot prevent competition are not true monopolies \(Facebook cannot dictate its prices\). Even though there might be no competition to companies like Facebook, they still cannot charge people enormous prices, because then Facebook would've been replaced by competition that might not exist yet, but can exist due to no laws preventing it.
1.6.6.1.1.5.5.3. Con: Breaking cartels by reducing the price even slightly, offers huge benefits as well.
1.6.6.1.1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.5.
1.6.6.1.1.5.7. Pro: Companies with enough power can deny necessary goods to locals, if for some reason the good can be sold more profitably elsewhere, e. g. [Nestlé Water Scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/oct/04/ontario-six-nations-nestle-running-water).
1.6.6.1.1.6. Con: Government not only cannot solve issues arising from self-interest, it also exacerbates those issues.
1.6.6.1.1.6.1. Pro: Company owners can act in their self interest, but so can politicians. At least when company owner do it, people are free to not buy their products. When a politician does it, people are forced by violence to support it \(through taxes\). Therefore solving the self-interest of company owners by appealing to politicians makes no sense whatsoever.
1.6.6.1.2. Con: Private companies earn money only voluntarily, not involuntarily. Thus they're held more accountable than government is.
1.6.6.1.2.1. Pro: Government politicians can waste money and not be held accountable. A private company is not going to waste money and will be trying to minimize ineffectiveness as it's their money they're wasting. This will create an incentive to be more effective so they can provide cheaper services. The government is not encouraged to work well; competition generally is what pressures private companies to be more effective and cheap. The government forcibly prevents any competition with its services.
1.6.6.1.2.2. Pro: In free market society, the minority's opinion matters too. In a democratic government-ruled society you just have to get majority votes, and then you can ignore the minority and act against them using their own money. In a free market society, a company that acts against the will of the minority will not be able to force the minority to pay for it and the minority can actually support its competition instead.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: If government was ruling in food industry too, vegans wouldn't have any option to be vegan and they'd be forced to pay for meat, because majority will parasite on them. This analogy can be applied to any service that democratic government rules over. Lack of government means more freedom for individuals who can choose how to live according to their own ideologies and support only those they agree with.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Under the majority of governments, vegans have the option to be vegan and are not forced to pay for meat. If this is possible in food industry, it can be achieved in case of other services too.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: In the majority of countries, the food industry is not controlled by the government. Similarly, all other industries could be free of government control, which would improve those services and be more ethical.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a government you can have laws that you disagree with but you're paying for them anyway and they're forced on you. A private company cannot force you to pay for their rules or follow their rules as long as it does not violate [NAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle).
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Anarchy \(lack of government\) is established when government has no power \(doesn't exist\). If every service government offers is replaced by free market \(like food industry already is\) then you have no government, thus an anarchy.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Companies' service quality and price are improved when there exist competition to their services, or at the very least people are not forced to pay for them. The government bans competition to its services, thus offering more expensive services of lesser quality, because it doesn't have to deal with competition when there can be none.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.5.4.1.
1.6.6.1.2.2.2. Con: In a parliamentary democracy with proportional representation, minorities are still represented in the parliament and affect decisions. In a free market society, it is conceivable that even majorities could be ignored, as long as they don't have sufficient funds to enact influence.
1.6.6.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Companies ignoring majority of people can and will certainly exist. \(Similarly to vegan restaurants\) But there will also be companies that act in will of majority as that creates demand. Any demand is business opportunity to get rich \(to offer supply\).
1.6.6.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Minorities are represented, but only those who have majority of voices are able to pass laws. Therefore majority decides what happens to minority and their money.
1.6.6.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Being represented when there is voting what to do with your property isn't particulary useful. Similarly when 5 thugs attack a person he's also outvoted, even if they listened what he was going to say. It's immoral to take other people's property and demand how they should live just because group demanding it is larger. Being represented doesn't quite help him.
1.6.6.1.3. Con: Anarchy is basically a collection of private companies, who cannot gain money from taxes nor pass laws on people who disagree with them, so coercion would not be privatized, but rather wouldn't exist at all in this form.
1.6.6.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.2.
1.6.6.1.4. Con: If instead of one great involuntary entity \(government\) there are more smaller ones, living only off voluntary money they gain, it would lead to them having much fewer ineffective and unfair rules than government.
1.6.6.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.
1.6.6.1.4.2. Pro: In a government you can delegate everybody's freedom to the government. In a private company you can only delegate your own freedom, you cannot vote to limit the freedom of anybody else. You should be able to limit only your own freedom, anything else is unethical.
1.6.6.2. Con: Appealing to reason can be an alternative to coercion. This has the added benefit of promoting well-reasoned discussion and actions.
1.6.6.3. Con: Government not only uses physical coercion \(force\) but psychological coercion as well, as [psychological coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion) is threat of force.
1.6.6.4. Con: Assuming coercion other than self-defense and repairing damages is unethical, then government is unethical. And even if there were some entities like this in anarchy, it doesn't render government ethical. Anarchy is the only ideology that doesn't support such coercion, therefore anarchy is the only ethical system.
1.6.7. Pro: People either interact with each other voluntarily or coercively. Governments, by definition, are coercive because they assume ownership over the lives of individuals on the basis that "we are the government". Individuals left to their own devices act to achieve their goals, and do not need to be under the control of involuntary rulers.
1.6.7.1. Con: There is no such thing as voluntary interaction from a societal standpoint, regardless of whether it is anarchy or formal government, because people are unable to withdraw from society itself. Therefore, their relationship with the state and the choices available to them are always, at least to some extent, coercive.
1.6.7.2. Pro: -> See discussion #6835: All human interaction should be voluntary
1.6.7.3. Con: The capability of people to interact coercively creates the necessity for a government. An anarchic community might be temporarily sustainable, but will be replaced by people acting coercively at some point in time. An ethical government should minimize the coercion its people have to suffer.
1.6.7.3.1. Con: The capability of people interacting coercively creates a necessity for security forces. Private police would necessarily be better and cheaper than government police and also ethical.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: Police forces of governments act coercively too, but unfortunately they have more rights than ordinary citizens, rendering them effectively untouchable. With as many rules as government tends to have, those police forces also have no idea about some laws, and tend to act outside of law.
1.6.7.3.2.1. Pro: There are many instances where police acted violently against innocent people, even killing unarmed people. Generally, too many officers try to prevent people from filming them with cameras \(in almost every country where that is legal\) and abuse powers they have and also don't have, but you cannot do anything against them even if they act unlawfully as you'd be jailed.
1.6.7.4. Con: Government is voluntary for those who express their consent by voting, and if a majority vote the same, society as a whole consents to its power.
1.6.7.4.1. Con: Government is not voluntary. You may abstain from voting, but you cannot abstain from being subject to the laws of a government.
1.6.7.4.2. Con: Even if 99% of a society decided to violate the rights of 1% of its members, the rights of the 1% remain violated. Consent only exists at an individual basis. No member of society can decide the will of another.
1.6.8. Con: Claiming that coercion is always unethical assumes that the general population is fully opposed to such coercion. But in many governments coercion is accepted as the price paid for large-scale services such as protection, currency regulation, consistency in infrastructure, and international relations.
1.6.8.1. Pro: Governments are not coercive in nature because the people themselves, under social contract theory, have voluntarily and freely agreed to the existence of a government.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.6.10. Pro: Pure anarcho-capitalism provides more freedoms than government, government by its definition can only limit freedoms.
1.6.10.1. Con: While in theory pure capitalism provides more rights because it is based on total market freedom, in practice unregulated capitalism also [increases inequality](https://evonomics.com/how-capitalism-actually-generates-more-inequality/). This means that in practice pure capitalism makes actually exercising these rights more difficult for many.
1.6.10.2. Con: Governments also stop other individuals and business from infringing on your freedom and rights.
1.7. Con: Government is a requirement for valuable cooperative endeavours that would be impossible in an anarchic society.
1.7.1. Con: What makes one individual cooperate with another is the mutual interest. [It can be seen either in other species](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/cooperation-conflict-and-the-evolution-of-complex-13236526/).
1.7.2. Pro: There will always be collective problems that require collective action. Whatever scale this is on it is a form of government.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Preventing the spread of infectious disease requires at least some collective action and coordination.
1.7.3. Pro: Without a centralized military and consistent foreign policy, anarchist communities will be unable to protect their members from foreign threats.
1.7.3.1. Pro: In the real world, there are other peoples out there concentrated into societies and governments. A people living under anarchy will be defeated and brought into an existing government.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Groups of people have defended themselves from violent neighboring groups effectively through history, often even in spite of support of the opposing factions by governments \(including their own\) without a government structure.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: Insert any guerrilla revolutionary group here. The Taliban, Viet Cong, IRA, and Hezbollah are some modern examples.
1.7.3.2. Con: An anarchist community may be unable to protect itself, but that is not an ethical argument. The anarchist community can still be more ethical than any government.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: If an anarchist community will be unable to protect itself, then implementing anarchism is the same as handing control of the community to a random hostile governing body, which is not ethical.
1.7.3.2.2. Con: Ethical dilemmas should not be blind to reality, otherwise ethics and morality lose all value.
1.7.3.2.3. Pro: A pacifist society is more ethical than a militaristic one, even though the latter is better able to protect itself.
1.7.3.3. Con: Anarchy is capable of building up military structures it needs to defend itself \(e.g. [attackthesystem.com](https://attackthesystem.com/national-defense-and-foreign-policy/)\).
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: If an anarchist country is prosperous then the population can arm themselves. They can institute relevant laws concerning arming civilians with high-grade weaponry which is likely to make them more effective than centralized militaries.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Con: Anarchist societies can have regulated military structures.
1.7.3.3.1.2. Con: An anarchist country might be less effective or non-effective at countering some tactics, technologies, and attack sizes. Perhaps more advanced planes and drones intercept anarchist missles, pinpoint firing location and launch a bunker buster there.
1.7.3.3.2. Pro: While ultimately defeated, the big role the Anarchist movement played in the Spanish Civil War supports this claim. [anarchocommunism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism#The_Spanish_Revolution), [Revolutionary_Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia)
1.7.3.3.3. Pro: Centralized militaries have been defeated by voluntary opposition forces countless times throughout history. There is no reason to believe that anarchist communities could not cooperate similarly.
1.7.3.4. Con: If all societies are anarchist, then no external threats will exist, since no actors will initiate force against anyone else.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: This is way too utopian, since [societies are conflicting](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23043288?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by nature.
1.7.4. Con: The living example of Democratic Confederalism \(a form of a socialist-anarchist system\) in northern Syria \(Rojava\) suggests otherwise. \[source: [Book on Rojava and it's system](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/Revolution-Rojava-Democratic-Autonomy-Womens-Liberation/30572558210/bd?cm_mmc=ggl-_-UK_Shopp_Textbookstandard-_-product_id=COUK9780745336596NEW-_-keyword=&gclid=CjwKCAjwoZWHBhBgEiwAiMN66XMgcYVhcEkW_43uVIrRTPNsHy2ERx1uXJ3LdG4YnHj5Wn-0B5OXyBoCKDsQAvD_BwE)\]
1.7.5. Con: Endeavours can act as rally points themselves. Anything perceived valuable will attract volunteers and their resources.
1.7.5.1. Pro: [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/) is a private company pushing space exploration forwards - area previously advanced solely by governments.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: SpaceX is receiving [government funding](http://qr.ae/TUTglf).
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.5.2.
1.7.6. Pro: Large infrastructure projects like roads, highways, and monuments are beyond the reach of anarchic societies.
1.7.6.1. Con: Coordination among many people is possible without coercive power \(e.g., no one is forced to contribute to Wikipedia or any number of open-source software projects\).
1.7.6.2. Con: Decision-making is actually made more robust by decentralization, since errors do not propagate down a hierarchy.
1.7.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.7.7. Con: Government is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce valuable cooperative behavior.
1.7.7.1. Con: A controlling system/social structure or norm, which might be a government is required for cooperation. Therefore, anarchy can not possibly bring any cooperation as it is, by definition, a lack of any such system or structure.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Ideology can be a motivating force.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: In an anarchical society there is no way of passing the needed ideology on as this would require a system.
1.7.7.2.1.1. Con: Anarchical ideologies could be passed on by word of mouth.
1.7.7.3. Con: A framework must exist to coordinate the efforts of any community or else they will often be at odds with each other. Look at the evolution of warfighting as an example. Modern militaries are not hierarchical just for accountability, they are more efficient that way, meaning fewer lost lives, less resources invested, and more consistent results. If each soldier acted on their own in their own time, they would be free from tyranny, but ineffective compared to other more organized militaries.
1.7.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.7.7.4. Pro: Governments prohibit certain types of cooperation, jobs, and trades.
1.7.7.4.1. Con: Cooperation, jobs and trades can be of coercive nature and can limit the freedom of others. Therefore, it is reasonable to impose these restrictions.
1.7.7.4.2. Pro: There are countries in which government prohibits jobs and trades like [sex work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_law).
1.7.7.4.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #1413: Buying and selling sex should be legal for sex workers and their clients.
1.7.7.4.3. Pro: The government can tax any form of transaction, thus effectively rendering convenient trades inconvenient. For example, you would pay some price and the seller would be willing to sell you their stuff for that price, but neither of you could do the trade because the tax from the transaction would raise the price to a level that one of you would be unwilling to accept, thus effectively preventing you from performing the transaction.
1.7.7.4.3.1. Con: The advantages provided through infrastructure, payed by your taxes, enables a vast amount of trade that would not have been possible without it. The government is enabling the vast majority of trades.
1.7.7.4.4. Pro: In many countries you cannot fire an employee without giving a reason, and those reasons have to be well documented. This makes it extremely hard to fire some employees.
1.7.7.4.4.1. Con: This takes freedoms from organizations and gives freedom to people. Therefore, it is a good policy.
1.7.7.4.4.2. Pro: This fuels racism in some countries in which there exists a stereotype about some race being less hardworking or being criminals. The employer is better off not hiring those people because it'd be hard to fire them and the employer doesn't want to risk the outcome suggested by the stereotype if they were forced to keep these people employed.
1.7.7.4.4.2.1. Con: In this case government is protecting people from racially biased and unreasonable denial of employment. The freedom gained is seen as more valuable than the freedom to express racism.
1.7.7.4.5. Pro: In many countries there is a "minimum wage" prohibiting you from working for less than a certain amount of payment.
1.7.7.4.5.1. Con: The minimum wage protects and thereby frees low wage employees from modern slavery.
1.7.7.4.5.2. Pro: The unfortunate result of the minimum wage is that the employers who can give you enough money \(meeting the minimum wage requirements\) will do that, but those who can't are forced to close their business. It never results in the employee getting more money, it just makes those who don't make enough unemployed.
1.7.7.4.5.2.1. Con: It does result in the employee getting more money when the employer is able to pay the employee and still make a profit.
1.7.7.4.5.3. Pro: There are people who would prefer to be working for less than the minimum wage rather than be unemployed.
1.7.7.4.5.3.1. Con: This can be reduced through training an adequate workforce and does not justify compensation that is inadequate to live with.
1.7.7.4.5.3.2. Con: These people only have this preference because of circumstances beyond their control meaning they must choose between either having nothing or not having enough. The latter is the better option, but neither are desirable.
1.7.7.4.5.4. Con: -> See discussion #3171: The minimum wage is good for the economy.
1.7.7.5. Pro: Cooperation predates government. Therefore, government is not necessary to induce "cooperative behavior."
1.7.7.5.1. Con: Any Cooperation relies on standardization which implies a simple and small proto government tying any cooperation to not being anarchy.
1.7.8. Con: "Valuable" in this context is probably synonymous with profit. At the latest with industrialisation it becomes obvious that fiat money shall not be the prime mover of society, since it is not eatable.
1.7.9. Pro: In anarchy there is nothing to promote responsibility.
1.7.9.1. Con: The individual conscience will always exist to promote responsible behaviour. Only those who lack one tend to need external compulsion to do the right thing. 'Good people don't need laws to do the right thing and bad people don't respect them anyway.'
1.7.9.2. Con: Individuals [assume responsibility of their own volition](https://c4ss.org/content/14711) in any system because people are capable of seeing a need and fulfilling it. Coercion is therefore neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for good behaviour.
1.7.9.3. Con: [Reputation](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/reputation) promotes responsibility in anarchy as well as any other type of society.
1.7.9.4. Con: Government reduces personal responsibility.
1.7.9.4.1. Pro: In a democratic government, one can vote to limit their responsibility and pass it to politicians who will make decisions for them.
1.7.10. Con: Rather than maintaining peace, the very violent history of state warfare, both externally, between states, and internally, by the ruling classes of states on subject classes in the form of class warfare, indicates that perpetual warfare is the default conditions of state as a political formation per se.
1.7.11. Pro: Financial markets cannot exist in an anarchist society, which hurts economic development since businesses cannot easily access capital.
1.7.11.1. Con: Anarchy doesn't prevent those with wealth from providing a positive effect on society.
1.7.11.2. Pro: Currencies are not distributed and backed up with trust.
1.7.11.2.1. Con: Currencies such as gold and silver can be distributed without trust. These are resources that are scarce, take work to produce or obtain, and the materials can be authenticated due to their inherent physical and chemical properties. There are many materials like this and access to enhanced levels of technology increases our ability to use other types of materials as currency.
1.7.11.2.2. Con: All [fiat currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) are distributed and backed up with trust. Other forms of currency, such as [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) do not require trust, they only require sufficient adoption by those engaged in trade.
1.7.11.3. Pro: Banks will not lend out money when they cannot ask for guarantees to get the money back.
1.7.11.3.1. Con: Contract law still applies within anarchy, including the right to choose rules, the right to choose adjudicators, and the right to choose enforcers. There are many methods of insurance and debt collection that do not require government. However, banks do need to be careful about making insurable loans, since the greater the risk, the more expensive the insurance.
1.7.11.3.1.1. Con: Laws may apply in anarchy but because there is no one to enforce them they become meaningless.
1.7.11.3.1.1.1. Con: In the [anarcho-capitalistic society of medieval Iceland](https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-government), the power to create laws came from the support of the people. This suggests these laws were softly-enforceable via public opinion.
1.7.11.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: In medieval Iceland, seats in the [law-making body](https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-government) were for sale, but even once purchased, seat-holders had no power unless they could convince others to support them. This avoided tyranny and injustice.
1.7.11.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The Icelandic people of this time were able to individually, voluntarily, and instantaneously switch the legal system they adhered to because the systems were [totally decentralised](https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-government). It is likely that any laws were far too fluid to be properly enforceable.
1.7.11.3.2. Con: Considering the instability that large scale banking industries produce, as in the cases of The [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) and the many depressions and recessions that led up to it, and also the [financial crisis of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), we may be far better off living within a system that prevents banking and lending services from growing to a large scale.
1.7.11.3.3. Con: Loans would still be made but would only occur between parties that have a high level of trust between each other, as in the case of localized economies. This would have the side effect of forming networks with much higher levels of trust between parties and excluding parties from the network that cannot be trusted. Money is lent on the trust and if the lender loses some money that is a loss that gets absorbed, violence doesn't enter the picture.
1.7.11.4. Con: Anarchy does not prevent agreements between parties, which define the consequences, to be enforced by the aggrieved party, should the terms of the contract be breached.
1.7.11.5. Con: Anarchy enables totally free markets. This enables financial actors to be most beneficial without the hindrances of regulation or taxation.
1.7.11.5.1. Con: Not all versions of anarchism enable free markets, [anarcho-capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism) does. However, all other forms of anarchism see capitalism as an evil just as oppressive as the state and thus oppose both. [Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), [Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky), [Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy), [Kropotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin) etc. would all oppose free markets and support commonly owned wealth because markets are as immoral as the state.
1.7.11.5.1.1. Con: A anarchic society where there is an institution dedicated to prohibiting people from trading voluntarily is simply not anarchic.
1.7.11.6. Con: There is no need for financial markets in a truly anarchistic society in which private property is abolished and the ownership of the means of production is common.
1.7.11.6.1. Con: There are anarchistic systems in which private property is not abolished. For example, [anarcho-capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism).
1.7.11.6.1.1. Pro: Anarcho-capitalists believe that ethically nobody has the right to steal property that other people produced by themselves, and that abolishing private property is also not anarchistic in nature as then you have some rule that has to be enforced on people against their will, thus basically creating government \(entity enforcing laws and forcing people to pay for it against their will\).
1.8. Pro: Governments violate [natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) that all persons possess. In anarchy those rights are realized.
1.8.1. Con: A utopian Communist Government is more ethical than an anarchic society.
1.8.1.1. Con: Communism is itself renowned for some [bad abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity_under_communist_regimes).
1.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.7.5.
1.8.1.3. Con: Utilitarian communism is unworkable unless the vast majority of the population are ideologically committed to the virtues of industry and thrift, that is to say, contributing more than they take in terms of resources unless the resources are inexhaustible.
1.8.1.4. Con: All forms of communism are unethical unless voluntary \(e.g. anarcho-syndicalism, which is still anarchic\) because they violate [private property rights](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/2007-08/communism-computing-china/intelproperty.html).
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.7.1.1.1.
1.8.3. Con: The philosophical concept of natural rights is not supported by science, especially in regards to the evolution of social primates.
1.8.4. Pro: In anarchy one can defend oneself against any threat without being constrained by written rules.
1.8.4.1. Con: In lawless or criminal regions one typically sees an assymmetry in power. A gun or other imagined measures are ineffective against an organized cartel that retaliates brutally.
1.8.4.2. Con: Commonly, fear of crime is [disproportionately high](http://criminology.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-10) compared to the likelihood of being the victim of a crime. If people illogically assess threats, unconstrained self-defense could lead to more unnecessary violence.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.6.7.4.
1.8.6. Pro: Governments use taxation to finance their actions and taxation is theft.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Taxation necessarily means that people need to work additional hours to ensure they make more money than they need in order to make up for economical inequalities that are not inherently their responsibility.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: As a result of this, people who do not work can benefit from welfare systems that they have not worked.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Taxation does not apply to willingly unemployed people and hence only employed people are taxed which results in employed people essentially being punished for working.
1.8.6.3. Pro: -> See discussion #7734: Taxation is theft
1.8.6.4. Con: Taxation is also a way to give those who are less fortunate a chance of a decent life. Hence, it is ethical.
1.8.6.5. Con: Taxation is voluntary because the taxpayers have the right to decline participation in taxed activities.
1.8.6.5.1. Con: [Indirect taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indirecttax.asp), like sales tax, are impossible to avoid.
1.8.6.5.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, governments often intentionally reach beyond acceptable limits. Charging a toll for the use of a road is acceptable if the government owns the road. However, a government taxing a private sale between two individuals is outside its rights.
1.8.6.5.2. Con: Many taxed activities are required to live. For example, earning income enough to eat or owning property for shelter are taxed. There is no alternative.
1.8.6.6. Con: Whether something is considered theft or not is determined by law. As taxation is lawful, it cannot be considered theft.
1.8.7. Con: Without institutions, there is nothing that can define or guarantee natural rights.
1.8.7.1. Con: Goodwill is all that is needed to protect natural rights. The methods governments use to protect them simply subvert natural rights, such as the violence of imprisonment.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: Goodwill doesn't work when societies grow bigger and people lose touch with their "neighbours". What works in small tribes doesn't work when talking about millions of people.
1.8.7.2. Con: This proposition implicitly assumes that this "institution" has to be a state. In fact, most contractual relationships in society are private. This includes the concepts of private property \(50,000 years ago\) and families \(30,000 years ago\) way before the first institutions that slightly resemble states \(8,000 years ago\).

1.8.7.3. Con: There are plenty of state-independent forces that protect an ethical society with natural rights.
1.8.7.3.1. Pro: Because the motivations of morality are a [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology) of [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_morality) [academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics#Motivating_morality) study, the understanding of what motivates ethical behaviour continues to evolve independently of state actors.
1.8.7.3.2. Pro: A reason to be ethical is when being ethical is a default heuristic, as suggested by behavioral psychology.
1.8.7.3.3. Pro: A reason to be ethical is self-interest when ethical societies are perceived as leading to more wellbeing.
1.8.7.3.4. Pro: Two related reasons to be ethical include social pressure and family values.
1.8.7.4. Con: A judiciary system \(private or not\) doesn't constitute a state. States are defined by the monopoly of coercion in a territory. A judiciary system that either is not a monopoly, doesn't have a monopoly on the application of their decisions, or allows people to secede, is not a state.
1.8.7.5. Pro: A state's police force ensures that individuals' property and security are protected.
1.8.7.6. Pro: Nobody knows or can prove what "natural rights" are, or that all people are created "equal". These are very vague and subjective statements and it is best to refrain from using them in a rational argument.
1.8.7.6.1. Con: "[Normative ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics)" is a field that has been rationally studying these issues for over 2000 years, and suggests frameworks for defining natural rights.
1.8.7.6.2. Con: The State predicts that all people are equal and, therefore, must be fitted in laws such as "you shall not smoke or sell weed". There is no way to predict what all people want and, even if it was possible, the information would always be out of date.
1.8.7.6.3. Con: Natural rights are the right to own your body and, in extention, your possessions and treat them as you please, as long as not attacking others.
1.8.7.6.4. Con: The impetus is upon those favoring government to prove an ethical or moral right for one or more individuals to engage in involuntary compulsion over another individual or group. The right to rule is no less an unwarranted assertion than the existence of natural rights.
1.8.7.7. Pro: A state's legal system is essential in interpreting what classifies as natural rights and what to do if an individual's rights are under threat.
1.8.7.8. Con: Institutions do not define natural rights but merely codify them since they exist in nature already.
1.8.7.9. Con: You are free to search for your happiness and others too.
1.8.7.9.1. Pro: Natural rights are the minimum requirements needed for humans to pursue happiness. The individual's pursuit of happiness reveals what these minimum requirements ought to be. Institutional definitions of these requirements are unnecessary.
1.8.7.10. Pro: If there is no state then no single body will have a monopoly on law making and enforcement. This will make it more difficult to protect the rights of individuals. Following Kant, we can accept that state jurisdiction is just even if we do not consent to its jurisdiction because the state is necessary to protect rights and therefore ensure justice.
1.8.7.11. Pro: Under anarchy there can be no central registry of property. Thus, no claim to property can be universally recognized.
1.8.7.11.1. Pro: While participants in society might agree to benignly recognize each other's claims to property, there is no guarantee these agreements will be honored under conflict and no universally recognized judiciary body to resolve conflicts of interest. Thus, conflicts would likely be resolved through direct confrontation.
1.8.7.11.2. Con: Decentralized registries using blockchain technology exist today, making it possible to be universally recognized.
1.8.7.11.2.1. Con: Blockchain may be useful in keeping track of property, but not in enforcing it. Therefore, this does not solve the problem of direct confrontation.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.7.1.1.
1.10. Pro: Humans are [naturally ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage) and anarchy provides them with the freedom to live ethically.
1.10.1. Con: Humans are not naturally ethical; they have diverse impulses including some that are destructive. In anarchism these destructive forces go unchecked.
1.10.1.1. Con: In an anarchist system, everyone is responsible for peacekeeping, meaning that these impulses wouldn't go unchecked.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Anarchism lies on a 100% trust of the human being. This trust is not possible in any society.
1.10.1.3. Con: The [state](http://transformativestudies.org/wp-content/uploads/State-Violence-Social-Control-and-Resistance.pdf) is an inherently violent system of social control that is more destructive than humans without a centralised state.
1.10.1.4. Pro: The history of humankind includes violent events such as the Nazi regime and tribal violence. This suggests that we are not naturally ethical.
1.10.1.5. Pro: Other sociologists \(e.g.: [Thomas Hobbes](https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/)\) describe the human in their natural state to be [aggressive and warlike people](https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/). The only reason they deviate from that path is to save energy by forcing themselves under a strong leader. \(source: Thomas Hobbes and [Georg Simmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel)\)
1.10.1.5.1. Pro: Humans have a long and prominent history of intra-species violence.
1.10.1.5.1.1. Con: The history of intra-species violence is mostly due to people being forced into wars by government entities. The average person does not want war, yet the average person was always forced to pay for it. The existence of government actually allows some people to act more violently thanks to having a higher budget and force over every person in the country.
1.10.2. Pro: Through [evolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/Supplement_2/9015), humans developed a sense of morality as a necessary consequence of their intellectual abilities.
1.10.3. Con: It is difficult to support the claim that humanity has evolved natural ethical facility. History is rife with refutations to that claim. It is more likely that human cultures, admittedly an anti-anarchic structure, devolve, ala the Roman empire, into an amoral dysfunctional political aggregation. Thus, anarchy can be seen in naturally occurring devolution of culture, but such occurrences historically are anything but free or ethical in nature.
1.10.4. Pro: When basic rules of coexistence and respect are internalized and applied in all aspects of life, authority is not needed to impose them through coercion or otherwise.
1.10.4.1. Con: Even if the majority of people could internalize and apply basic rules of coexistence, there are many who cannot. Rules, laws, law enforcement, judiciary and government become necessary.
1.10.4.2. Pro: The majority of humans are intelligent enough to make reasonable decisions regarding our own lives. Government is unnecessary in providing us with our basic needs for we can sustain ourselves. The concept of human conflict is not eradicated with a government, therefore the government is not entirely crucial in terms of resolving dissension.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: Those who are poor or disadvantaged might be forced to starve or be in misery in case governments stop fulfilling their with basic needs \(via welfare\).
1.10.4.3. Con: There are no basic rules of coexistence.
1.10.4.3.1. Pro: There are no basic rules. There are only rules that we agree or disagree on, and this changes over time.
1.10.4.4. Con: In failed states \(and regions in functioning states isolated enough\) the power vacuum of the state is rapidly filled by warlords, gangs and drug cartels who provide the missing services such as education, medical care, police, etc., with varying levels of success. The underlying theme is that such strongmen tend to curtail liberties instead of allowing anarchistic freedom.
1.10.4.5. Con: An example of anarchistic freedom is the early Internet. Unregulated forums and web communities didn't evolve into anarchistic utopias of ethical behavior, but instead into abusive commentary, witch hunting, doxing, spam, malware, and other negative behaviors.
1.10.4.5.1. Pro: Nearly all such unregulated sites turn to more moderation \(community or paid\) to ensure the substance of the site isn't overrun by unwanted content.
1.10.5. Con: Judging by contemporary events, people are not ready for an anarchical system and require education before it can work.
1.10.5.1. Con: Education is largely the effect of practice \("Practice makes perfection"\). Therefore requiring education does not bar society from trying anarchy.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Anarchy is the only absolutely ethical system of society, although this does not mean that the existence of government is always bad; being necessary in intermediary stages of social development.
1.10.5.3. Con: The idea that people should be ready for it leads to the idea that a leader is necessary and people must be controlled, at least for now. But in a democracy, for example, it is people who choose their leader. Someone who is provided with the right to choose a leader can be ready to coexist harmonically in a social environment.
1.10.5.3.1. Pro: Assuming people are not ready to decide what to do with their lives \(anarchy\), but are perfectly capable and ready of deciding what to do with their lives and lives of others as well in a democratic election is rather ridiculous.
1.10.6. Con: Ethics doesn't follow from the laws of nature. It is a construct of sentient actors \(humans\), who decide what is ethical and what is not.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Being ethical because we decide what is ethical is a logical loop.
1.10.6.2. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.10.7. Con: As evidenced by the evolution of different legal systems over thousands of years, human morals are not naturally occurring.
1.10.7.1. Con: Darwin's natural selection would've let only the morally equipped survive as they'd have advantage over the morally unequipped. Thus, morals are natural, not some invention of government etc.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: From Game Theory we know that cooperating is the better strategy. Thus, being moral in the grand scheme of things is better, and natural selection made sure that people with moral systems will survive better in nature than people without.
1.10.8. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.1.
1.11. Con: An anarchist society would not work out in practice.
1.11.1. Pro: All the ethical pros of anarchism are moot if anarchism doesn't work out for long, since the benefits will be so short lived.
1.11.2. Pro: According to [social dominance theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dominance_theory) any human community will naturally follow and develop its own hierarchical structure that defies a completely ungoverned societal structure.
1.11.2.1. Con: Hierarchy does not require a monopoly on force. Within a company, there is a hierarchy while remaining voluntary.
1.11.3. Con: The criteria we use to select our system of self-governance is not predicated on its guaranteed stability.
1.11.4. Con: [Tibet successfully operated under anarchy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2054940?casa_token=G3ZgMoDzgLUAAAAA%3ABiHCH1wH8-Nwyelp4JY8lHBAI44GrhGLDfwf3XslN7aNwE7meNM71Yg6ddf_Id0K6gyxdRHycGCIDM0kiL-bDd3xRvSEO4zGMPSRfZaGgSs1Q-mF1A&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) for two hundred years.
1.11.5. Con: [Frisian operated under anarchy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Frisian_freedom) for 722 years.
1.11.6. Con: The [Republic of Cospaia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Republic_of_Cospaia) operated under anarchy for 385 years.
1.11.6.1. Con: Cospaia's anarchy case cannot be transposed bigger societies because there was still a [council of elders](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Republic_of_Cospaia#/Form_of_government) to take important decisions when needed, and the population was pretty low.
1.11.7. Con: [Ancient Greek Polis](https://www.socionauki.ru/journal/files/seh/2006_1/the_stateless_polis.pdf) was anarchist.
1.11.8. Con: [Auroville’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroville) Indian town has worked under an anarchical system since 1968.
1.11.9. Pro: Anarchy does not value ethics or morality; its fundamental value is, "do what you want, regardless of its effect on others." Lacking a fundamental ethical goal, this system could only work if all the individuals governed by it had internalized the ethical goals.
1.11.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.1.1.
1.11.9.2. Con: The fact that anarchic society would be "like herding cats" doesn't say anything about the moral rightness of anarchy. To illustrate, the fact that cats are impossible to herd doesn't mean it's bad for them, maybe they just don't want to be herded and enjoy their lack of respect for authority.
1.11.9.3. Con: Anarchy has horizontal planning instead of vertical one. This allows a society to still thrive.
1.11.9.4. Con: It's ethical that people should be allowed to do whatever they want if it doesn't hurt or damage other people. In any form of government they're not and only in the absence of government that is possible.
1.11.9.4.1. Pro: Preventing somebody from doing unethical or immoral action can be immoral as well. For example taking drugs might be immoral, but they don't harm anybody else. But if you kidnap that person and lock them up and for you to do it, you also need to force other people against their will to pay for it, that's definately immoral to greater extent.
1.11.10. Pro: There are necessary functions of government. If there was no government, entities or people would surely arise to fulfill those functions. They would become a de facto government, essentially eliminating the anarchist ideal.
1.11.10.1. Con: This argument confuses the definition of ‘no government’ with the often promoted ‘no rules’ or ‘no cooperation’; people naturally organise and cooperate in anarchical systems too.
1.11.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.11.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.1.3.1.
1.11.10.2. Pro: One necessary function of government is to uphold justice. If justice is not upheld, society will tear itself apart. If justice is upheld, that implies an entity with the will and power to enforce the rules, i.e. a government. Thus, the anarchist model will either self-destruct or become obsolete.
1.11.10.2.1. Con: The justice system is run by human beings which are as susceptible to error or corruption as the other human being they are trying to rule over. Through history we see that some of the most unjust acts were sanctioned by governmental justice institutions.
1.11.10.2.2. Con: It's wrong to assume anarchy doesn't have a justice system. Justice isn't dependent on government.
1.11.10.3. Pro: One necessary function of government is national defense. Whatever entity controls the armed forces will have implied control of the population. If such an entity does not exist, the nation will probably not last long. If it does exist, it undermines the anarchist ideal.
1.11.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.11.10.3.2. Con: Armed forces that "control the population" do so by force. Using force to control the population is not [national defense](https://thelawdictionary.org/national-defence/). If the population forms the country, then the population cannot be the enemy of the country and cannot be "controlled" in the name of national defense.
1.11.10.3.3. Con: If this argument was true and anarchy would fall for the reason that it doesn't have enough power to fight off stronger aggressors, then it would also mean smaller countries would fall for the same reason eventually leading to only one country that devoured other countries. Seeing as this is not what happened, we can safely conclude that this argument is wrong.
1.11.10.4. Con: Any good or service is better provided in a voluntary manner by a free market competition, than imposed by a government monopoly.
1.11.10.4.1. Pro: Our government is designed to be inefficient, and produce delays.
1.11.10.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.
1.11.10.4.3. Pro: Governmental structure by itself isn't the issue. The issue is when this structure is forced onto everybody in a violent way. Anarchists tend to criticize being forced into services they often wouldn't want to use.
1.11.10.5. Con: When an individual voluntarily associates with others who provide a good or service, it is not called a [Government](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government) \(nor is it a "de facto government"\) because the person is not [governed](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/govern) by the providers.
1.11.10.5.1. Con: Those provided with a service are governed by the providers. All forms of influence are a governing factor.
1.11.10.5.1.1. Pro: Voluntary association between a providee and a provider is still bound by the governing principal of obligation: I pay, you provide.
1.11.10.5.1.1.1. Pro: The government or governing body in this case would be both the party that provides and the party that receives as both would oversee the "terms of service" \(obligation\). If there is a failure to meet the "terms of service" \(obligation\), the aggrieved party seeks corrective action.
1.11.10.6. Con: There are no "necessary functions of [government](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government)". Legitimate government authority is delegated by individuals to legislators and enforced by agents of the State. Since all legitimate government authority is derived from individuals, the same authority could be provided by individuals, non-profits, corporations, or voluntary entities. Thusly, no legitimate functions of government require a government.
1.11.10.7. Pro: One function of the government is monopolization of aggression, exercise of power. If that is removed, a power vacuum is created which can only be temporary. New powers arise.
1.11.10.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.11.10.7.2. Con: Monopoly on power is actually more harmful than multiple companies offering private security. For example. surely Jews would appreciate if they didn't had to pay Nazi Germany taxes to "protect" them during WWII and they could pay the competition instead.
1.11.10.8. Con: To say that because entities or people naturally arise to fulfill the functions of government holds no bearing as to the ethics of those functions that are fulfilled \(regardless of whether they are fulfilled by a government or otherwise\).
1.11.10.9. Con: If it becomes a government it is no longer a anarchy system. In other words, the possibility that a thing would, at one point, become another thing doesn't make the thing that was in the first place lose its quality \(i.e. being the only ethical system of society\).
1.11.11. Pro: Anarchism is an unproven political system, with very few working examples. We do not know whether it would prove viable in practice.
1.11.11.1. Pro: Times of anarchy tend to be [short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities) and anarchies have so far mostly been surpassed by stable governments.
1.11.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.11.11.1.2. Con: In most cases, anarchist communities were simply shot down by the "stable governments".
1.11.11.1.3. Con: Nazi Germany also surpassed previous German democracy. That doesn't mean that Nazi Germany was ethical.
1.11.11.2. Con: Just because something is unproven doesn't mean it isn't a better system. New systems are unproven by definition.
1.11.11.2.1. Pro: Ending slavery was also an unproven political system at some point, with very few working examples. People did not know whether it would prove viable in practice.
1.11.11.2.1.1. Con: Ending slavery in the United States wasn't a complete overhaul of the governmental and political system. Ending slavery happened within the existing political system, so isn't a close analogy to replacing existing governments with anarchism.
1.11.11.2.1.2. Con: The process of abolishing slavery worldwide and in the US has been a [progressive process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom). It didn't go from slavery everywhere in the US to none after [The Emancipation Proclamation](https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/emancipation-proclamation) or the [13th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution); there were already areas with abolition.
1.11.11.2.2. Con: Anarchism is only a thought experiment of a System with Ideal [properties](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/EmmaGoldman_ANARCHISM_WHATITREALLYSTANDSFOR.pdf). It does not define a way of achieving, a system or lack thereof, that would produce the desired result.
1.11.11.2.3. Pro: Just because a new and unproven system claims to be better does not mean it deserves an opportunity to prove itself.
1.11.11.3. Con: Most human relationships are voluntary nowadays, and all stand as examples of how relationships would exist within anarchy. The opposite is what breaks the norm - it's usually called "crime", unless it's committed by the state.
1.11.11.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.6.1.1.1.1.
1.11.11.4. Pro: Anarchism has been criticized for being largely confined to [philosophical reflection](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anarchism/#AnarInco) and has resulted in very little actual political progress that can be validated.
1.11.11.5. Con: There are several established [anarchist communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy#Lists_of_ungoverned_communities) which have been successfully running for many years.
1.11.11.5.1. Pro: [Zomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zomia_\(region\)) is a geographical region stretching from the Vietnamese highlands and Tibetan plateau to Afghanistan. Zomia is seen by some political scientists, such as Yale political scientist [James Scott](https://libcom.org/library/art-not-being-governed-anarchist-history-upland-southeast-asia), as a rejection of the modern-day state and an example of [an anarchist society](https://anarchyinaction.org/index.php?title=Zomia) in action.
1.11.11.5.2. Pro: [Twin Oaks Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Oaks_Community,_Virginia) is an intentional community of about one hundred people in Virginia.  The community engages in activities such as gardening and making hammocks and pools the resources and money earned. All the bikes, automobiles, computers, and recreational facilities thus purchased are owned by the community, and all items are available for general use.
1.11.11.5.3. Pro: [Freetown Christiania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania) is a self-proclaimed autonomous anarchist district of about 850 to 1,000 residents in Copenhagen. The people in Christiania have developed their own set of rules, independent of the Danish government.
1.11.11.5.4. Con: Thousands of people in a world of billions does not make anything proven.
1.11.11.5.4.1. Con: Statistically speaking, relative sample size is an irrelevant factor. Sound causality, correct statistical model and absolute sample size are needed for generalized statements.
1.11.11.5.5. Con: Anarchy only works in small communities.
1.11.11.5.5.1. Pro: Some traditions of [Indian anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy#Lists_of_ungoverned_communities) posit that such a system would only work in small village communities with very radical decentralization of power.
1.11.11.5.5.2. Con: Establishing small communities where power rests in village republics is preferable to an overarching state institution.
1.11.11.6. Pro: The ethical status of an anarchist system of society depends on the outcomes produced by that system for the people living within it. Since we do not know what those outcomes would be, we don't know whether anarchy would be an ethical system.
1.11.11.7. Pro: Most states do not last long in a [state of Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities) and those that do can hardly be held up as [ethical utopias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy#Examples_of_state-collapse_anarchy). They actually tend to be failed states.
1.11.11.8. Con: There is a good modern example of an Anarchist society: parts of [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936) after the 1936 revolution.
1.11.11.8.1. Con: This [Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936#Criticisms) has been documented to have worked through military coercion into collectivism.
1.11.11.8.2. Pro: George Orwell spoke of this society in [positive terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936#Orwell's_account): "There was much in this that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for."
1.11.12. Con: Whether an anarchist society would work out in practice has no bearing on it being ethical in principle.
1.11.12.1. Con: A degree of pragmatism is essential when proposing politico-moral social models because the end goal is to implement them.
1.11.12.2. Con: The only principle that matters when designing a society is, "Will it be better than the society we currently have?" Non-functional societies are, de-facto, not better.
1.11.12.2.1. Con: If a functional society is actively cruel to its populace, it is unethical and certainly worse than if it were not functional.
1.11.13. Pro: A completely free market \(a.k.a. anarcho-capitalism\) has multiple problems, that can be addressed by government regulation, e.g. a [social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy).
1.11.13.1. Con: Problems are common to all kinds of society. The point of anarcho-capitalism is solving these problems faster and ethically.
1.11.13.1.1. Pro: In contrast to anarcho-capitalism, nowadays we live in modern democratic societies. It's possible to see the high-costs \(the parliamentary costs, for example\) and slow-speed \(a case on judiciary system, for example\) of the decisions taken by these governments. The market can do it faster and responding better to the people's will.
1.11.13.1.2. Pro: Government regulations are coercive against society. A free market gives people the freedom to choose how to live.
1.11.13.1.2.1. Con: Most government regulations are only coercive to the extent that they are designed to protect people or make everyone's lives easier, especially for the vulnerable and minority groups.
1.11.13.1.2.1.1. Pro: People are forbidden from smoking in enclosed spaces because to do so harms others. Protecting others in this way is more important than the smoker's freedom to choose how to live.
