Discussion Name: In politics, the focus should be more on the issue instead of on the politician

1. In politics, the focus should be more on the issue rather than on the politician.
1.1. Con: Politicians are one of the most important agents of change in modern democracies, therefore the focus should be on them.
1.1.1. Pro: Politicians "[aggregate citizen preferences in legislatures, work for the development of their constituencies, and oversee the executive arm of the state](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051418-051214)".
1.1.1.1. Pro: A key element for a healthy democracy is that political parties aggregate citizen voice by creating [political mandates and policies once they form governments](https://www.makingallvoicescount.org/blog/whose-voice-really-counts-machine-politics-citizen-voice-aggregation-emerging-democracies).
1.1.1.2. Con: Politicians are meant to aggregate citizen preferences, but they can [sometimes break their promises](https://theconversation.com/do-politicians-break-their-promises-once-in-government-what-the-evidence-says-127761).
1.1.2. Con: Because politicians are one of the most important agents of change, focus should be on the issue, so that the electorate is able to judge whether the issue is handled correctly by the politician.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Politicians might have to face dilemmas related to their conscience if they think an issue is morally wrong yet voted by the majority.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Edmund Burke, in his victory [speech](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html) upon winning re-election to the British House of Commons in 1774, said that he believed that politicians must assign “great weight” to the wishes of voters, but "[not simply sacrifice their own opinion, judgment or conscience to the will of their constituents](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/august-2019/voters-respect-politicians-who-follow-their-conscience/)."
1.1.2.1.2. Con: With [political campaigns](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/elections/presidential-election-process/persuading-voters-political-campaigns/), politicians persuade voters to vote for their programme, therefore they if successfully chosen, a politician shouldn't face any conscience dilemma if they follow their programme.
1.2. Con: Focusing on the politician will help uncover the characteristics of the individual politician.
1.2.1. Con: Politicians are just performing their job. As with any other job, there should be an important separation between the [professional person and the personal life of the worker.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273895045_The_Professional_the_Personal_and_the_Ideal_Worker_Pressures_and_Objectives_Shaping_the_Boundary_between_Life_Domains)
1.2.1.1. Con: Politicians know beforehand that quality of personal life will reduce while performing the job.
1.2.1.2. Con: The job of a politician is too important for journalists to not look into his/ her personal life too.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: If journalists discover something odd in a politician's personal life, it will not have an impact on society. Therefore the personal life is irrelevant.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: If a politician is a hypocrite in his/ her personal life, it will not have an impact on society.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Since a politician works in the domain of "[public interest](https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/the-public-interest)", journalists need to investigate to avoid corruption.
1.2.1.3. Con: Politicians should be entirely devoted to the job.
1.2.1.4. Con: Politicians also know beforehand that their personal life is strongly related to their professional lives as politicians.
1.2.1.5. Pro: A politician's past or private life [shouldn't be shared for public scrutiny](https://blogs.mprnews.org/todays-question/2009/07/why-should-the-public-care-about-a-politicians-private-life/).
1.2.1.5.1. Con: A politician's private life might be important in the eyes of the voter, to make sure that the politician follows the values they share.
1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: A [Polish homophobic politician](https://www.them.us/story/jozsef-szajer-homophobic-politician-resigns-after-getting-busted-covid-gay-sex-party-hungary) had to resign after being caught in a gay sex party.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: When a politician's past is important within a political campaign, it can lead to lies in order to rewrite that past under a better light.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: According to experts in political science, politicians use "[more self-justifications and deceive in larger ways, and with more consequences.](https://nypost.com/2016/04/17/finally-science-shows-that-politicians-are-lying-liars-who-lie/)"
1.2.2. Pro: The characteristics of a politician are needed to fit to a certain degree with norms and values of voting citizens
1.2.2.1. Con: Those characteristics can be [falsely portrayed to attract a certain type of voter.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/07/11/a-short-history-of-campaign-dirty-tricks-before-twitter-and-facebook/)
1.2.2.2. Con: [Party identification](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/instructors/setups2008/background/party-id.html) might have a more important role than the characteristics of a politician when it comes to influencing the vote according to certain values.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Focusing on the politician can help understand the [ethics and morality](https://www.rollcall.com/2019/04/04/does-the-content-of-their-character-still-matter-in-the-2020-race/) with which they are likely to rule with.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: The degree of ethics and morality a politician implements in his governing decisions can be concluded from the debate about issues alone.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: In the [2018 Ipsos MORI Veracity Index](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-11/veracity_index_2018_v1_161118_public.pdf), only 19% of a representative sample of a 1001 British adults trusted politicians to tell the truth, therefore focusing on politicians is important.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Con: Lack of trust is sometimes created by politicians denigrating their opponents. Therefore less focus on politicians can actually regain trust in politicians.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: 19 % of British adults who trusted politicians is a very low percentage. But it is more relevant to know what the actual percentage of politicians telling the truth was. If this percentage is very high, focusing on politicians is not necessary.
1.2.2.3.2.3. Con: Lack of trust in politicians is sometimes the result of social media persuasion.
1.2.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: It seems that "[engaging with messages on social media can have a deleterious effect in \[political\] trust](https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Trustful-Voters-Trustworthy-Politicians-A-Survey-Experiment-on-the-Influence-of-Social-Media-in-Politics.pdf)".
1.2.2.3.2.4. Pro: According to the Washington Post, [Donald Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims during his presidency](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/), hence the importance on focusing on politicians when voting.
1.2.2.4. Pro: The perceptions of elected politicians are important because they [help people gauge if a politician can be trusted or not](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/11/23/6-perceptions-of-elected-officials-and-the-role-of-money-in-politics/).
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Even if a politician could be trusted because of the perceptions they have caused, their party could choose not to follow what they promised.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: A politician represents a party, therefore if a politician is trusted, the trust is also deposited in the ability of the politician to make sure that their party follows what they promised.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: [Disagreement between politicians and their parties](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2017.1359013) can easily happen.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Politics are often [considered a “dirty” word related to power struggle and deception](https://eera-ecer.de/ecer-programmes/conference/22/contribution/40285/), therefore if a politician can be trusted, citizens would be more likely to support her/him.
1.3. Pro: Debating the issue, rather than debating the individual, will more likely contribute to a sufficient solution.
1.3.1. Pro: When a politician tries to focus on the opponents personal deficiencies, he/she could hide his/her own shortcomings in his/her point of view.
1.3.2. Pro: Yes, this concept is recognized: focus on the argument, neglect the "messenger"/debater. Not doing so and attacking someone instead of focusing on his argument is called "[ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)" and is more often than not fallacious.
1.3.3. Pro: The most adequate way to do so implies a new way to govern, enabling citizens to decide instead of merely delegate to politicians, for example thanks to the [citizens' initiative referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_initiative_referendum_\(France\)).
1.3.4. Con: When voters focus more on the issue, and less on the politicians themselves, it could lead to elected politicians who are less capable to govern due to their lack of skills.
1.3.4.1. Con: This is not so likely, taking in account that adequately participating in a debate, and being able to defend your own point of view, already indicates the possession of certain skills.
1.3.4.2. Con: When voters focus more on the issue, they will be able to recognize which politicians support their viewpoint.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Being politician is also about having [charisma](https://kentkroeger.medium.com/charisma-some-politicians-have-it-but-how-do-we-know-8f2a6f823510) and contacts so changes can happen quicker and more easily.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Focusing on charisma could lead to an increasingly individualistic society, because [the more a culture is individualistic the more it values its leaders' charisma](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-11003-004).
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: If A implicates B, B does not have to implicate A. If an individualistic society values its leader's charisma more, it does not imply that when a leader becomes more charismatic, the country becomes more individualistic.
1.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: An exceedingly individualistic society could be dangerous, because [people wouldn't think for the common good when voting politicians](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/intro_text/Chapter%2010%20Political%20Philosophy/Group_vs_Individual_Interest.htm), instead they would just focus on their personal gain.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: [Because Mahatma Gandhi was very charismatic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/07/20/leadership-where-does-charisma-come-from/?sh=6e30efea6963), his efforts in leading the entire Indian nation to independence were successful.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: A politician's charisma can be misleading.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: Focusing on charisma can be dangerous, because with social media, politicians can easily build an "[Instagram-ready personal brand](https://www.fastcompany.com/90334160/pete-buttigieg-debuts-a-radical-new-approach-to-campaign-branding)" which might not show the real personality.
1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: Populism heavilly depends on charismatic politicians.
1.4. Pro: When a debate focuses on personal sufficiency, the voter is less capable to make an informed voter’s decision.
1.4.1. Con: In order to make an informed voter's decision, voters should be looking at more than one single source of information.
1.4.1.1. Con: In order to make an informed voter's decision, it is of the upmost importance to look at the most relevant and important sources of information. Personal sufficiency is relatively less important and relevant than other sources.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Checking multiple sources is an essential part in order to make an informed voter's decision since some [news source might have corporate bias](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-to-find-credible-information-about-the-election-and-avoid-getting-duped)(Check multiple sources. When a friend shares a story, especially one labeled "exclusive" or "never seen before," Google it to see whether other sites are covering the story. According to Zimdars, "Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event.").
1.4.2. Pro: Spectators of the debates between politicians are likely to observe a lot of skills embedded in the way the politician is debating. Further discussion about these personal skills will not be necessary.
1.4.3. Con: The politician's view is not very important, as politicians are meant [to defend the party's position](https://reputationtoday.in/political-spokesperson-job/), not their individual position.
1.4.3.1. Con: The politician commonly implements the parties position in his/ her individual position. So, saying that the politician's view is not important implicates that the party's view is not important.
1.4.3.2. Pro: According to Pew Research Center, [partisanship](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/in-a-politically-polarized-era-sharp-divides-in-both-partisan-coalitions/) seems to be the biggest factor in voting behavior.
1.4.4. Pro: In order to better [understand modern politics](https://blog.oup.com/2017/12/understand-politics-networks-groups-individuals/), the focus should be put on groups, not on individuals.
1.4.5. Pro: Voters are less likely to discover the politician’s view on the matter when personal sufficiency is discussed.
