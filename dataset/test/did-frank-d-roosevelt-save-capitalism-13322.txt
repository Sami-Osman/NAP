Discussion Name: Did Frank D. Roosevelt save capitalism?

1. Franklin D. Roosevelt's policies saved the U.S. capitalist system.
1.1. Con: FDR preserved the US economic system by introducing anti-capitalist elements into American socioeconomic policy.
1.1.1. Con: If FDR's policies saved the US capitalist system by introducing some anti-capitalist elements temporarily, then it is still correct to say that he saved the system.
1.1.1.1. Con: If he used anti-capitalism to mitigate the damages of capitalism, then he didn't save capitalism but instead saved its victims.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The US capitalist system emerged as the [strongest in the world](https://www.history.com/news/post-world-war-ii-boom-economy)(Driven by growing consumer demand, as well as the continuing expansion of the military-industrial complex as the Cold War ramped up, the United States reached new heights of prosperity in the years after World War II. Gross national product \(GNP\), which measured all goods and services produced, skyrocketed to $300 billion by 1950, compared to just $200 billion in 1940. By 1960, it had topped $500 billion, firmly establishing the United States as the richest and most powerful nation in the world.) after FDR's tenure, so it is difficult to argue that any anti-capitalist elements had a significant effect.
1.1.1.3. Con: There is an important distinction to be made between 'saving' something and 'preserving' it. For example, a cancer patient can extend their life through various treatments, but the cancer might still kill them eventually.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Whether or not the US capitalist system eventually gets replaced has no bearing on FDR's role to save the system during the 1930-40s.
1.1.2. Pro: FDR's creation of the [Social Security system](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/social-security-act)(Roosevelt, however, borrowed a page from Europe’s economic security rulebook and took a different approach. He proposed a program in which people contributed to their own future economic security by contributing a portion of their work income through payroll tax deductions.) is inherently anti-capitalist by forcing workers to contribute a portion of their wages to the government.
1.1.2.1. Con: Social Security type programs [exist](https://ww1.issa.int/country-profiles) in most of the world's countries, including capitalist countries. Thus, there is nothing inherently anti-capitalist about it.
1.1.3. Pro: Many of FDR's programs were [struck down](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-franklin-roosevelt-clashed-with-the-supreme-court-and-lost-78497994/) by the Supreme Court for involving unconstitutional overreach of the federal government into the US capitalist system.
1.1.3.1. Pro: One of the New Deal's largest programs, the National Industrial Recovery Act \(NIRA\), was [invalidated](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/when-fdrs-blue-eagle-laid-a-supreme-court-egg)(The Court also struck down the NIRA as an unconstitutional delegation of Congress’s powers to the executive branch, under what is known as the “non-delegation doctrine.” The Court said the NIRA gave the Roosevelt administration too much power to control the economy through the use of the fair practice codes.) by the Supreme Court in 1935 for giving the executive branch too much power over the economy.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The NIRA [lost public support](https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/new-deal/national-industrial-recovery-act-of-1933/)(Under the supervision of the NRA, several hundred industry codes were rapidly enacted, but public support soon diminished. The codes tended to increase efficiency and employment, improve wages and hours, prevent price cutting and unfair competition, and encourage collective bargaining. However, they also tended to raise prices and limit production. Businesses found the codes burdensome.) soon after its implementation due to excessive regulations and was seen as one of the failures of the New Deal.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The NIRA was responsible for creating the Public Works Administration, which [completed](https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/new-deal/national-industrial-recovery-act-of-1933/)(Nevertheless, the PWA did oversee an enormous number and variety of public works projects, including schools, hospitals, post offices, courthouses, roads, bridges, water systems, and waste treatment plants. Its two most prominent projects were the construction of the Triborough Bridge in New York City and the completion of the Boulder \(now called the Hoover\) Dam on the Colorado River in Arizona. Ultimately the PWA completed more than 34,000 projects around the country.) several thousand construction projects across the country.
1.1.3.2. Con: This was more a consequence of the [conservative majority](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-fdr-lost-his-brief-war-on-the-supreme-court-2)(By 1937, Roosevelt had won a second term in office, but the makeup of a conservative-leaning Supreme Court hadn’t changed since he took office four years earlier. There were four Justices –nicknamed the “Four Horsemen”: ,” Justices George Sutherland, Pierce Butler, James McReynolds, and Willis Van Devanter—who were conservative enough that their votes against most New Deal plans were expected. A fifth justice with conservative leanings was the Chief Justice, Charles Evans Hughes, who also narrowly lost the 1916 presidential race to the Democratic incumbent, President Woodrow Wilson.) on the Supreme Court who sought to oppose FDR's policies on principle.
1.1.4. Pro: FDR was a [democratic socialist](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-socialism-speech-216071).
1.1.4.1. Con: FDR repeatedly [denied](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/16/democrats-socialism-fdr-roosevelt-227622/)(That vision included one truly insistent message: He was not a socialist.\n\nThough he never used the term socialism in his speech, Roosevelt’s anger at those who accused him of ideological motivations, of applying an economic theory that was anathema to the United States, exploded from the lectern. In line after line, the fiery president defended his actions as pragmatic responses to the real, glaring needs of a changing society.) being a socialist and viewed such political ideologies as a hindrance to pragmatic governance.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: FDR was open to considering policies on [all sides](https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/our-view-was-fdr-really-a-socialist-no/)(FDR was not an ideologue; not a red, not a convinced socialist. He was not even so much a deep thinker as a happy warrior with an agile mind, a generous spirit and a common touch. But he had socialists in his inner circles and took their advice because, in 1932, it was sound. He was not adverse to conservative ideas, either, and entertained many of them; about the ideals of free enterprise, for example. The New Deal was not socialist in the sense that it hoped to replace capitalism. It was a liberal program to bandage capitalism until it cyclically recovered.) of the political spectrum and was likely to choose those which would best serve the interests of the country on a particular issue.
1.1.4.2. Pro: FDR managed to implement many of his policies through [unconventional leftist approaches](https://www.hoover.org/research/how-fdr-saved-capitalism), such as encouraging radical leftist groups and supporting labor unions.
1.2. Con: The US capitalist system would have survived with or without FDR's policies.
1.2.1. Pro: Vested interests in American politics and business would have ensured that capitalism remained the country's economic system.
1.2.1.1. Pro: America's [powerful and wealthy industrialists](https://online.maryville.edu/business-degrees/americas-gilded-age/) would have used their considerable influence to ensure that capitalism was maintained if the system was significantly threatened.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Any system other than capitalism would have been in violation of America's constitutionally derived [economic rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_economics).
1.2.1.3. Con: With millions of Americans [unemployed and facing extreme poverty](https://www.american-historama.org/1929-1945-depression-ww2-era/great-depression-poverty.htm)(During the Great Depression massive numbers of Americans lived in poverty. The people who lived in poverty had been denied an income sufficient to meet their basic needs. During the Great Depression over 12 million Americans became unemployed and, at its peak, over 12,000 people were being made unemployed every single day. And there were few welfare or relief systems before 1935. People are defined as living in poverty when they are denied an income sufficient for their basic needs. 'Basic Needs' are defined as food, water, clothing and shelter. Mass unemployment, debt and homelessness all were featured in Great Depression Poverty.) during the Depression, a grassroots uprising against the government and economic system could have been possible.
1.2.2. Con: Many political and economic revolutions throughout history have taken place in seemingly stable societies. The same could have happened in America in the 1930s.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The Russian Revolution [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution) centuries of tsarist traditions in a few years by the masses who were unhappy with their living conditions, just as much of America was during the Depression.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The Iranian Revolution occurred as a reaction to [dissatisfaction](https://www.britannica.com/event/Iranian-Revolution)(In addition to mounting economic difficulties, sociopolitical repression by the shah’s regime increased in the 1970s. Outlets for political participation were minimal, and opposition parties such as the National Front \(a loose coalition of nationalists, clerics, and noncommunist left-wing parties\) and the pro-Soviet Tūdeh \(“Masses”\) Party were marginalized or outlawed. Social and political protest was often met with censorship, surveillance, or harassment, and illegal detention and torture were common.) with the existing government, and many Americans were similarly angry at the US administration's handling of the Depression prior to FDR's tenure.
1.2.2.3. Con: There is no historical evidence that a revolution was imminent in America, even at the height of the Depression.
1.2.3. Con: FDR's predecessor, Herbert Hoover, was [extremely inept](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/spotlight-primary-source/herbert-hoover-great-depression-and-new-deal-1931%E2%80%931933)(But Hoover refused to involve the federal government in forcing fixed prices, controlling businesses, or manipulating the value of the currency, all of which he felt were steps towards socialism. He was inclined to give indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, but he refused to use federal money for direct aid to citizens, believing the dole would weaken public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteerism to raise money. Hoover’s opponents painted him as uncaring toward the common citizen, even though he was in fact a philanthropist and a progressive before becoming president. During his reelection campaign, Hoover tried to convince Americans that the measures they were calling for might seem to help in the short term, but would be ruinous in the long run. He asserted that he cared for common Americans too much to destroy the country’s foundations with deficits and socialist institutions. He was soundly defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.) at handling the Great Depression and could have destroyed the US economic system with his policies.
1.2.3.1. Con: Some historians have [argued](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/hating-on-herbert-hoover)(It’s unlikely that any President elected in 1928, even Roosevelt, would have been returned to office in 1932. The magnitude of the economic disaster was just too great to be politically survivable.) that Hoover's reputation has been unfairly maligned, as the Depression was too great a crisis to overcome in a few years.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Hoover's violent handling of the [Bonus Army](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bonus-Army) situation was a blow to him politically and increased hostility to the government.
1.2.4. Pro: Capitalism is the natural economic system of human civilization. It will become the natural order with or without the influence of any single politician.
1.2.4.1. Con: The example of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#Communist_Party), which transitioned from a dynastic to a socialist form of government, suggests otherwise.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: China only pursued socialist policies under the dictatorial regime of Mao Zedong before his successor [significantly opened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform) China's economy to market forces.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Mao Zedong's policies were [disastrous](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/chinas-great-leap-forward/)(From 1960–1962, an estimated thirty million people died of starvation in China, more than any other single famine in recorded human history. Most tragically, this disaster was largely preventable. The ironically titled Great Leap Forward was supposed to be the spectacular culmination of Mao Zedong’s program for transforming China into a Communist paradise. In 1958, Chairman Mao launched a radical campaign to outproduce Great Britain, mother of the Industrial Revolution, while simultaneously achieving Communism before the Soviet Union. But the fanatical push to meet unrealistic goals led to widespread fraud and intimidation, culminating not in record-breaking output but the starvation of approximately one in twenty Chinese.) for the Chinese economy and people, resulting in tens of millions of deaths.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Today, China is nominally communist, but [in practice](https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/china/954989/is-china-capitalist)(The Chinese Communist Party “still describes ‘the realisation of communism’ as its highest ideal”, and maintains that China is not a capitalist state, said the WSJ. But in practice, its leaders “have long embraced capitalist methods and encouraged entrepreneurship”.), it is a capitalist nation.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba#Economy) is another example that shows that capitalism is not natural nor necessary.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: Cuba is a poor and dictatorial country that has recently begun to [open their economy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55967709) to market forces.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Capitalism is what emerges when human-crafted restrictions and regulations are withdrawn, which suggests it is the natural order of things.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: This seems to suggest that human-crafted restrictions are unnatural by virtue of their being human-crafted. Humans are products of nature, and so is what they create.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: That which humans create is artificial. That which is artificial is not natural.
1.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: The concept of 'natural' does not exist when talking about an economic system. Capitalism is a social construct.
1.2.4.2.1.2.1. Con: As a social construct, every economic system is made by human choices and interests. For this reason, Roosevelt can be considered the savior of capitalism.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: When [restrictions on property rights](https://www.parachutelaw.co.uk/news/property/how-to-remove-restriction-on-property) are removed, it allows for capitalism to flourish in the real estate sector.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: Property rights are themselves human-crafted restrictions.
1.2.4.2.2.2. Con: Limitations can be and are often imposed on property rights through capitalistic market forces.
1.2.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: Indigenous people are often [dispossessed](https://aboriginalhistoryofyarra.com.au/3-dispossession/)(Wurundjeri dispossession of land took place not just through displacement, but also through disconnection. Land was sold, bush was cleared for the creation of roads and buildings, and wetlands were drained.) of land and resources for the sake of capitalistic endeavors.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Capitalist structures had been in place around the world for [hundreds of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism) before Roosevelt. Many of these would likely have endured without his influence.
1.2.4.4. Con: Capitalism has only [existed](https://www.britannica.com/topic/capitalism) for a couple of centuries. That is not nearly enough time to determine whether or not it's humanity's "natural economic system."
1.2.4.5. Con: "Capitalism" is a meaningless word often misused to describe an immeasurably complex system of markets and regulations.
1.2.4.5.1. Con: Capitalism has a [clear definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp) that is in common use today.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: Capitalism is an obscure, abstract, amorphous and ultimately incoherent term.
1.2.4.5.2.1. Pro: Capitalist ideologues tend to define "free markets" as a precondition of capitalism. However, the idea of a "free" market is [false](https://www.thebalance.com/america-is-not-really-a-free-market-economy-3980689), since all markets are planned at some level.
1.3. Pro: FDR's policies prevented the spread of communism in America.
1.3.1. Con: The Communist Party of the USA \(CPUSA\) [grew dramatically](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Communist-Party-of-the-United-States-of-America) throughout Roosevelt's time in office and was largely supportive of New Deal policies.
1.3.1.1. Con: The Communist Party's membership [peaked](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Communist-Party-of-the-United-States-of-America)(Its membership reached its peak of 85,000 in 1942, just as America entered World War II; the CPUSA had rallied enthusiastically in favour of a Soviet-American war effort against Nazi Germany.) in 1942 at just 85,000 members, making it an extremely fringe political movement.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The New Deal encouraged the CPUSA to [push for policies](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/the-communist-party-in-the-30s-the-depression-and-the-great-upsurge/) that they once believed to be impossible to achieve in America.
1.3.2. Pro: Without FDR's interventionist policies, capitalism would have been blamed for causing the Great Depression, making it more likely that Americans would seek alternative economic systems.
1.3.2.1. Pro: FDR's [first "fireside chat"](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-gives-first-fireside-chat)(Roosevelt began that first address simply: “I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking.” He went on to explain his recent decision to close the nation’s banks in order to stop a surge in mass withdrawals by panicked investors worried about possible bank failures. The banks would be reopening the next day, Roosevelt said, and he thanked the public for their “fortitude and good temper” during the “banking holiday.”) was largely responsible for preventing a run on banks that could have bankrupted the US economy.
1.3.2.2. Pro: FDR's [Fair Labor Standards Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938) created several labor rights laws that improved working conditions and made workers less likely to turn to communist ideas.
1.3.2.3. Con: Capitalism needs to be regulated in order to be a viable system. FDR did not do enough to ensure that the US would regulate capitalism effectively.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: FDR was limited by political concerns, including [conservative Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Democrat#1932%E2%80%931948:_Franklin_D._Roosevelt_and_the_New_Deal_coalition) in his own party, which prevented him from enacting more radical legislation.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: FDR enacted more regulations and changes to the US social and economic system than any president, including a number of massive changes in his [first hundred days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_100_days_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt%27s_presidency).
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: Capitalism in the US is incredibly [dysfunctional](https://www.dailygamecock.com/article/2018/06/americas-problem-with-capitalism) today due to lack of regulations.
1.3.3. Con: Communism does not spread because it does not work.
1.3.3.1. Con: The USSR suggests that communism does indeed spread.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: One of the reasons that the USSR [collapsed](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021716/why-ussr-collapsed-economically.asp)(After experiencing a catch-up period with attendant high growth rates, the command economy began to stagnate in the 1970s. At this point, the flaws and inefficiencies of the Soviet system had become apparent.) was because its economy could not compete with capitalism.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: At its height, the USSR covered a [significant portion](https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union)(At its greatest extent, between 1946 and 1991 \(the figures and descriptions given below refer to this period\), the U.S.S.R. covered some 8,650,000 square miles \(22,400,000 square kilometres\), seven times the area of India and two and one-half times that of the United States. The country occupied nearly one-sixth of the Earth’s land surface, including the eastern half of Europe and roughly the northern third of Asia.\n\nThe U.S.S.R. extended more than 6,800 miles \(10,900 kilometres\) from east to west, covering 11 of the world’s 24 time zones.) of the earth's habitable land area.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: The USSR was not a true communist state.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: Some experts have argued that the USSR was never properly communist, but instead employed a form of "[state capitalism](https://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/chronicle/archives/02/10-11/economics.html)(Under a true communist system, says Resnick, the workers would control all aspects of production and decide how any surpluses are used. But in the wake of the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks imposed a layer of state managers to operate industry in the name of the people. That system, which Resnick and Wolff call "state capitalism," actually ceded decisions about the use of profits to government officials.)" in which the state, rather than the people, controlled resources and industry.
1.3.3.1.3.2. Pro: The USSR was more socialist than communist.
1.3.3.1.3.2.1. Con: The ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union was [created](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Communist-Party-of-the-Soviet-Union)(The Communist Party arose in opposition to both capitalism and the socialists of the Second International who had supported their capitalist governments during World War I. The name communist was specifically taken to distinguish Lenin’s followers in Russia and abroad from such socialists.) to explicitly separate themselves from capitalist and socialist movements.
1.3.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: The USSR had an official state policy to pursue "[socialism in one country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_one_country)".
1.3.3.1.3.2.3. Con: Socialism is an initial phase of communism.
1.3.3.1.3.3. Con: This is an example of the "[no true Scotsman](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-no-true-scotsman-fallacy-250339)" fallacy.
1.3.3.2. Con: Ideas do not need to work in order to spread \(consider religions or conspiracy theories\), so this does not follow.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Communism's [failure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/11/07/lessons-from-a-century-of-communism/) throughout the 20th century in diverse cultures and populations is evidence that it does not work.
1.3.3.4. Con: Communism, if applied correctly, can work.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: This cannot be proven because real attempts at communism have always been thwarted by imperialism.
1.3.3.4.2. Con: There is no historical evidence for this.
1.3.3.4.3. Pro: The central [doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs) of "to each according to their need, from each according to their ability" is the only sustainable way to uphold productive forces without counter-revolutions either seizing or destroying them.
1.3.3.4.3.1. Con: This doctrine discourages productivity by incentivizing individuals to minimize their ability and maximize their need.
1.4. Pro: FDR saved capitalism by helping defeat fascism.
1.4.1. Con: America's role in defeating fascism was largely down to factors outside of FDR's control.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Until [Pearl Harbor](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States/World-War-II), America was not directly involved in World War II, which afforded it the luxury of time and relative safety to provide support to the Allies.
1.4.1.2. Con: FDR's approval for the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) guaranteed that America would have eventually won the war by having a [monopoly](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-united-states-presents-the-baruch-plan)(In August 1945, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, becoming the first and only nation to use nuclear weapons during wartime. The successful use of the bombs not only ended World War II, but also left the United States with a monopoly on the most destructive weapon known to humankind.) on nuclear weapons.
1.4.1.3. Pro: US losses during World War II were [small](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) compared to those of the Soviet Union, who were most responsible for defeating fascism in Europe.
1.4.2. Con: Some of the means FDR used to fund WWII were not capitalist, such as the introduction of [war bonds](https://collections.digitalmaryland.org/digital/collection/mdwp/id/193/).
1.4.2.1. Con: There is nothing inherently anti-capitalist about buying or selling war bonds.
1.4.2.2. Pro: War bonds are more indicative of a [mixed economy](https://www.thebalance.com/mixed-economy-definition-pros-cons-examples-3305594), as opposed to a purely market based economy.
1.4.3. Pro: Fascism, had it been allowed to spread, would have been harmful to the US and global capitalist systems.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Global fascism would have lowered the world's economic potential due to its egregious treatment of peoples of different [races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism_and_racism) and religions.
1.4.3.2. Con: It is possible that the US could have eventually made a deal with fascist regimes in Europe had they stayed out of the war.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The US has a long history of [allying](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/americas-most-awkward-allies-103889/) with undemocratic, authoritarian rulers. It is possible that they would have done the same with fascist European regimes too.
1.4.4. Pro: Fascist regimes did not pursue capitalist economic systems.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Franco's fascist regime in Spain pursued a policy of [autarky](https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Francos-Spain-1939-75)(These difficulties were increased by Franco’s misguided policies of autarky, which aimed at economic self-sufficiency through the state control of prices and industrial development within a protected national economy cut off from the international market. The national income fell back to the levels of 1900, as industrial production and agricultural output stagnated and real wages dramatically fell. The near-famine years of the 1940s witnessed the rise of the black market and misery in rural areas that caused migration to the shantytowns of the cities.) that ruined the nation's economy in the early years of his rule.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Fascist regimes in Germany and Italy were antagonistic to true capitalism, instead pursuing a type of "[state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_fascism#State_capitalism)" or "[corporatism](https://fee.org/articles/economic-fascism/)."
1.4.4.3. Pro: The Japanese [economy](http://www.grips.ac.jp/teacher/oono/hp/lecture_J/lec09.htm)(In the 1930s, political and intellectual thinking gradually shifted from economic liberalism toward more economic control under state management. There were many reasons for this, including: \(i\) influence of Marxism; \(ii\) apparent success of USSR; \(iii\) Showa Depression; \(iv\) the idea that deflation was worsened by excess competition; and \(v\) disappointment with politicians and political parties. Many considered that the days of the US-style free market economy were over and from now on, state control and industrial monopoly would strengthen the competitiveness of the national economy.) during the Shōwa era became increasingly state controlled as the military dictatorship consolidated their power.
1.4.4.4. Con: Most fascist regimes were not around long enough for their economies to mature. It is likely that some of them would have pursued a form of capitalism in the long term.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: The vast majority of [fascist movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fascist_movements) last only a few years.
1.4.5. Con: The defeat of fascism allowed [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_\(1979%E2%80%931985\)#/media/File:Cold_War_Map_1980.svg) to take over a large portion of the world for the duration of the Cold War.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Given that the Cold War started just after the end of FDR's tenure, if anything, FDR set capitalism up for its first real opposition.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: FDR and Churchill did not do enough to prevent the USSR from [taking over](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zt8ncwx/revision/5) Eastern Europe at the end of the war.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: At the Yalta Conference, America and Britain [conceded](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/yalta-conf)(The Americans and the British generally agreed that future governments of the Eastern European nations bordering the Soviet Union should be “friendly” to the Soviet regime while the Soviets pledged to allow free elections in all territories liberated from Nazi Germany.) that states bordering the Soviet Union should be "friendly" and believed that Stalin would allow free elections there.
1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: This action [tarnished](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/yalta-conf)(Alarmed at the perceived lack of cooperation on the part of the Soviets, many Americans began to criticize Roosevelt’s handling of the Yalta negotiations. To this day, many of Roosevelt’s most vehement detractors accuse him of “handing over” Eastern Europe and Northeast Asia to the Soviet Union at Yalta despite the fact that the Soviets did make many substantial concessions.) FDR's legacy at Yalta and weakened the West's hand in the Cold War.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: The USSR was in a [much better position to negotiate](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/yalta-conference)(By February 1945, as Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin gathered again at Yalta, an Allied victory in Europe was on the horizon. Having liberated France and Belgium from Nazi occupation, the Allies now threatened the German border; to the east, Soviet troops had driven back the Germans in Poland, Bulgaria and Romania and gotten within 40 miles of Berlin. This put Stalin at a distinct advantage during the meeting at the Black Sea resort) near the end of the war, especially at the Yalta Conference, as they were much closer to capturing Berlin than the Americans or British.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: FDR was [dead](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-dies) prior to the start of the Cold War, so it is difficult to blame him for actions that occurred after his death.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: The Soviet Union [existed](https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union)(The U.S.S.R. was the successor to the Russian Empire of the tsars. Following the 1917 Revolution, four socialist republics were established on the territory of the former empire: the Russian and Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republics and the Ukrainian and Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republics. On December 30, 1922, these constituent republics established the U.S.S.R.) prior to FDR's terms in office and were already ideologically opposed to capitalism.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Communism is more antithetical to capitalism than fascism is.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Fascist economics often [incorporated elements](https://home.heinonline.org/blog/2020/07/capitalism-socialism-or-fascism-a-guide-to-economic-systems-and-ideologies/)(In terms of economics, fascism incorporates elements of both capitalism and socialism. Fascist economists advocate for self-sufficiency and individual profit, but promote government subsidies of corporations. Fascist economics thus supports a blend of both private and public ownership over the means of production—there is an emphasis on private profit, but at the same time, the national interest is ultimately more important.) of both socialism and capitalism, while communism is almost diametrically opposed to capitalist ideas.
1.4.5.3. Con: Today, the [vast majority of countries](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm) take part in the global market and deploy some form of capitalism, suggesting that Cold War communism was an aberration in the global economic system.
1.5. Con: FDR was partially responsible for setting up the [Bretton Woods system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system), which laid the groundwork for the problems capitalism faces today.
1.5.1. Pro: Many of the institutions and economic concepts founded under the Bretton Woods system had harmful side effects.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The Bretton Woods system resulted in unequal economic development.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: The IMF and World Bank [provide funding](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/ar/2020/eng/what-we-do/lending/)(About $91 billion in financing to 80 countries, including $11.3 billion to 48 low-income countries since the onset of the pandemic in late March and as of September 15, 2020.\n\nOut of this lending*, the IMF channeled $30 billion \(equivalent to SDR 21.2 billion\) in financing to 69 countries through emergency lending facilities.) that help developing countries, reducing inequality.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The rules embedded in the Bretton Woods institutions are protectionist, asymmetrical and impede balanced economic development. \([p.118-120](https://www.athensjournals.gr/law/2018-4-2-1-Igwe.pdf)\)
1.5.1.2. Pro: The Bretton Woods system is responsible for harmful environmental effects.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: The World Bank has continued to [fund](https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2019/06/what-are-the-main-criticisms-of-the-world-bank-and-the-imf/#_Toc10127397)(In terms of its direct lending, the Bank’s investments in fossil fuels have been criticised for undermining climate goals – with the Bank continuing to fund a considerable number of fossil fuel projects in the years after the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2015, which saw countries jointly commit to limit average global temperature rise to “well below 2°C” relative to preindustrial levels) fossil fuel projects that undermine climate goals.
1.5.1.3. Con: Regardless of side effects, Bretton Woods led to a period of immense economic growth and rise in standards of living.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Since the Bretton Woods system's institutions were formed, the proportion and overall number of people living in extreme poverty has [decreased](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#the-number-of-people-in-extreme-poverty-over-the-past-two-centuries).
1.5.1.3.2. Con: The Bretton Woods system is not solely responsible for these benefits, as other factors, such as [technological innovations](https://www.thoughtco.com/fifties-to-nineties-inventions-4144741), played a large role.
1.5.2. Con: FDR did not attend the [Bretton Woods conference](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/wwii/98681.htm), and [died](https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/death-of-the-president) less than a year later, before most of the system was operational. Therefore, his influence on the Bretton Woods system is minimal.
1.5.2.1. Con: The original idea for the Bretton Woods system [originated](https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/july/bretton-woods-conference)(The genesis of the 1944 conference dates back to the Atlantic Conference in 1941, but by early 1942 more detailed plans were being developed with the ideas from Harry Dexter White a Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and John Maynard Keynes an advisor to the British Treasury being the two major competing schools of thought.) from the Atlantic Conference in 1941, which FDR did attend.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The [fourth and fifth points](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/atlantic-charter)(Fourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity;\n\nFifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security;) of the Atlantic Charter laid the groundwork for further cooperation on the international trade liberalization that Bretton Woods would later codify.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The Bretton Woods system didn't become fully functional until [1958](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bretton-woods-created)(In 1958, the Bretton Woods system became fully functional as currencies became convertible. Countries settled international balances in dollars, and US dollars were convertible to gold at a fixed exchange rate of $35 an ounce. The United States had the responsibility of keeping the price of gold fixed and had to adjust the supply of dollars to maintain confidence in future gold convertibility. The Bretton Woods system was in place until persistent US balance-of-payments deficits led to foreign-held dollars exceeding the US gold stock, implying that the United States could not fulfill its obligation to redeem dollars for gold at the official price. In 1971, President Richard Nixon ended the dollar’s convertibility to gold.), thirteen years after FDR's death.
1.5.3. Pro: The system of international financial institutions, including the IMF and World Bank, were results of Bretton Woods. These are the kinds of global institutions that populists are [protesting](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-g20/imf-global-finance-leaders-fret-over-populist-backlash-idUSKCN12629J) against today.
1.5.3.1. Con: The protests of populists do not delegitimize the efforts that these institutions have made to improve living conditions for people around the world.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The World Bank is responsible for [funding projects](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund-annual-report-2019/trust-fund-achievements) that have made tangible contributions to improving the lives of many people.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Opponents of the IMF [charge](https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Monetary-Fund/Criticism-and-debate)(Opponents of the IMF argue that the loans enable member countries to pursue reckless domestic economic policies knowing that, if needed, the IMF will bail them out. This safety net, critics charge, delays needed reforms and creates long-term dependency. Opponents also argue that the IMF rescues international bankers who have made bad loans, thereby encouraging them to approve ever riskier international investments.) that the organization encourages reckless spending habits by bailing out banks that have made bad investments.
1.5.3.3. Pro: [Criticisms](https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2019/06/what-are-the-main-criticisms-of-the-world-bank-and-the-imf/) of the IMF and World Bank are multifaceted, and include biased decision making, under representation, and undermining democratic institutions.
1.5.4. Con: The crisis of modern capitalism arose in the [1970s](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp) when productivity and wages were decoupled as the industrial and financial spheres were separated.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The recession of the 1970s brought about the end of the Bretton Woods system when the US [abandoned](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/122215/bretton-woods-system-how-it-changed-world.asp)(In a final attempt to keep the system alive, negotiations took place in the latter half of 1971 that led to the Smithsonian Agreement, by which the United States agreed to devalue the dollar against gold by approximately 8.5% to $38 per ounce and other countries offered to revalue their currencies relative to the dollar.13\n\n But despite these revaluations, another run on the dollar occurred in 1973, creating inflationary flows of capital from the U.S. to the Group of Ten. Pegs were suspended, allowing currencies to float and bringing the Bretton Woods system of fixed-but-adjustable rates to a definitive end.) the gold standard.
1.6. Pro: FDR's [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) revived the American economy and restored its capitalist tradition.
1.6.1. Con: The New Deal actually prolonged the Great Depression.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The New Deal contributed to the [1937-1938 recession](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1937-38) that saw unemployment rise back up to 20 percent and GDP shrink 10 percent.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The recession was more likely caused by a [temporary reversal](https://voxeu.org/article/what-caused-recession-1937-38-new-lesson-today-s-policymakers)(But when the Roosevelt administration began to worry about the potential for higher inflation, the Treasury Department decided to sterilise all gold inflows starting in December 1936. In essence, its new gold holdings were held in an inactive account rather than with the Federal Reserve, where it would have become part of the monetary base and money supply. Thus, instead of allowing the monetary base to grow with the inflow of gold, the monetary base was essentially frozen at its existing level.\n\nThe economy faltered in the spring of 1937 and tanked in the autumn of 1937. In February 1938, having realised its error, the Treasury ended its policy. In April 1938, the Treasury implemented its exit strategy and began desterilising its inactive gold holdings. The economy began to recover in June 1938.) of New Deal policies rather the New Deal itself.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: This 'recession within the Depression' was the result of [poor choices](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1053/roosevelts-recession-a-historical-and-econometric-examination-of-the-roots-of-the-1937-recession)(The years 1937 and 1938 should have been defined by continued recovery from the nation’s worst economic collapse. For reasons to be explored, overly optimistic policymakers and outspoken and disagreeing economists made key mistakes leading to the Recession. Confusion, a lack of theories, and ideological barriers jointly contributed to the downturn.) by the Roosevelt administration's economic advisors.
1.6.1.2. Con: The New Deal's [currency devaluation and monetary expansion](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression/Sources-of-recovery)(Given the key roles of monetary contraction and the gold standard in causing the Great Depression, it is not surprising that currency devaluations and monetary expansion were the leading sources of recovery throughout the world\[...\] Britain, which was forced off the gold standard in September 1931, recovered relatively early, while the United States, which did not effectively devalue its currency until 1933, recovered substantially later.) policies helped the US overcome its reliance on the gold standard at the time.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Most of the jobs created by the New Deal were temporary, and in May 1939, unemployment in America was still over [20%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304024604575173632046893848).
1.6.1.4. Con: Without FDR and the New Deal, the effects of the Great Depression would have been even worse.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: This is conjecture based on [alternate history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history) speculation.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: The [monetary contraction](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression/Causes-of-the-decline)(This rise in the currency-to-deposit ratio was a key reason why the money supply in the United States declined 31 percent between 1929 and 1933. In addition to allowing the panics to reduce the U.S. money supply, the Federal Reserve also deliberately contracted the money supply and raised interest rates in September 1931, when Britain was forced off the gold standard and investors feared that the United States would devalue as well.) that exacerbated the Great Depression would have been more prolonged had it not been for the New Deal.
1.6.2. Con: World War II, not the New Deal, ended the depression.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Massive war spending was what solved the unemployment crisis and [doubled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal#World_War_II_and_full_employment) the gross national product.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: The [unemployment rate](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/great-depression-great-recession/), which had previously stood at 25%, fell to 1.2% in 1944 due to industry development driven by WWII.
1.6.2.2. Con: The Great Depression [ended in 1939](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression)(Great Depression, worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939.), two years before America entered World War II.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: GDP was already [above](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression/Sources-of-recovery)(World War II played only a modest role in the recovery of the U.S. economy. Despite the recession of 1937–38, real GDP in the United States was well above its pre-Depression level by 1939, and by 1941 it had recovered to within about 10 percent of its long-run trend path. Therefore, in a fundamental sense, the United States had largely recovered before military spending accelerated noticeably.) the pre-Depression level in 1939, indicating that the war played only a minor role in reviving the US economy.
1.6.2.3. Con: World War II greatly [increased](https://fee.org/articles/what-ended-the-great-depression/)(In truth, building tanks and feeding soldiers—necessary as it was to winning the war—became a crushing financial burden. We merely traded debt for unemployment. The expense of funding World War II hiked the national debt from $49 billion in 1941 to almost $260 billion in 1945. In other words, the war had only postponed the issue of recovery.) the national debt, which would have created another form of economic instability had the US not ended the war in a position of such [enormous power](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/new-global-power-after-world-war-ii-1945).
1.6.3. Pro: By ensuring that America's poorest had access to basic needs, such as housing and food, the New Deal created the safety net needed for people to pursue capitalist endeavours.
1.6.3.1. Con: Poor people may have less of an incentive to pursue capitalist endeavors if the state props them up.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: The economy grew while unemployment and [suicide rates](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0904491106)(Of six causes of death that compose about two-thirds of total mortality in the 1930s \(Fig. 4\), only suicides increased during the Great Depression. Suicide mortality peaked with unemployment, in the most recessionary years, 1921, 1932, and 1938.) dropped significantly following the New Deal, indicating that people became empowered and incentivized to thrive.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: The state plays a [foundational role](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/what-role-does-government-play-capitalism.asp) in economic activity. Capitalism can't exist without the state somehow enabling it.
1.6.3.1.3. Pro: Excessive [unemployment benefits](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/hospitality-labor-shortage)(In March 2021, the U.S. congress passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which would make $1400 stimulus payments per person to 90% of households, plus an additional $300 per week to those receiving jobless benefits. The unemployment benefits, along with other subsidies, seem too tempting for people to trade off for work.) have been partially blamed for the lack of workers in some countries following the Covid-19 pandemic.
1.6.3.2. Pro: The [Tennessee Valley Authority](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/history-of-the-tva) \(TVA\) provided electricity to huge swaths of America by building 16 hydroelectric dams between 1933 and 1944.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: The energy provided by TVA projects helped [increase](https://livingnewdeal.org/glossary/tennessee-valley-authority-tva-1933/)(The TVA played a critical role during World War II, its huge electricity supply used to produce raw materials for munitions, fertilizer for food production, and aluminum for aircraft. The TVA also provided the electricity and the secret site for the development of the atomic bomb at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.) America's industrial output during World War II.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: The TVA was more akin to socialism than capitalism, in that it [hurt electrical companies' business](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tennessee-Valley-Authority)(The most controversial activity of the TVA is the production and sale of electric power, which has been resisted by privately owned power companies. The TVA contracts with municipalities and cooperatives to supply wholesale power for distribution and has joined with them in purchasing the facilities of privately owned electric-utility companies in the region. These purchases have established an integrated power service area in which the TVA is the sole supplier of power.) by providing cheaper, state run power.
1.6.4. Pro: New Deal policies had a profound and lasting effect on the US socioeconomic system.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The [Emergency Banking Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Banking_Act) in 1933 helped stabilize the banking system and laid the groundwork for rebuilding the economy.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The [Workers Progress Administration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Works-Progress-Administration) built 650,000 miles of roads; 125,000 public buildings; 75,000 bridges; 8,000 parks; and 800 airports, helping to modernize America's infrastructure.
1.6.4.3. Con: Many of the so-called "[alphabet agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_agencies)" started during the New Deal failed.
