Discussion Name: How should Europe deal with refugees from Africa and the Near/Middle East?

1. What is the EU's best strategy to deal with refugees coming from Africa and Near/Middle East?
1.1. The EU should ensure a safe way to Europe for any refugees seeking asylum there.
1.1.1. Con: The EU does not have the resources to keep refugees safe along their entire route to Europe.
1.1.1.1. Con: There are other ways than "guarantee of global presence" to ensure a safe trip.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If the EU cancelled their [EU Directive 2001/51/EG](https://www.equaltimes.org/want-to-stop-refugees-from-dying?lang=en), refugees could come to Europe by planes, rather than taking the dangerous voyage via sea.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Travelling on planes is not only safer, but would also be [cheaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO0IRsfrPQ4) for the refugees.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This could increase the risk of terrorism and plane attacks as violent extremists may have the same access to the planes by falsely presenting themselves as asylum seekers. This could prioritize the safety of refugees above the safety of the nations.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The link between refugees and terrorism is [tenuous at best](https://www.cato.org/blog/syrian-refugees-precationary-principle).
1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Asylum seekers can be legitimately granted transportation to the country of refuge via plane. Violent extremists may have reason to present themselves as seeking asylum, because they otherwise would not even be granted a place on a flight to the country that they are targeting.
1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Everyone who gets on a plane is required to go through security screening. Regardless of how a passenger presents themselves, security threats will still be assessed, preventing terrorist attacks from occurring.
1.1.1.2. Pro: In order to ensure the safety of refugees, the EU would need a presence across all of the countries in which refugees are both coming from and travelling through.
1.1.2. Pro: The EU should apply its Temporary Protection [Directive 2001/55/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32001L0055) to all war refugees.
1.1.2.1. Con: The minimum protective measures spelled out in the directive are lower than national standards which makes the direction essentially useless as it becomes not applicable.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The directive does not spell out automatic social welfare benefits or access to housing but limits this to cases "if necessary".
1.1.2.2. Con: War refugees are already included in the wording 'mass influx'. The directive does not specify any reasons for refugees.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The Directive applies not only to persons already in Europe, but also contains provisions which permit the entry of displaced persons into Europe. Under Article 2\(d\), the Directive can apply to a spontaneous movement of a large number of people from a particular country or region or an assisted evacuation into Europe; and under Article 8\(3\), states should facilitate the entry of eligible persons into their territory, including, for example, by the issuance of visas.
1.1.2.4. Pro: It would not [require](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/high-time-for-europe-to-offer-temporary-protection-to/) a status determination procedure \(other than to establish that the person was a member of the designated group\) as is normally necessary for refugee status, which would reduce the time and resources needed to process beneficiaries of protection.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: It will be a long and difficult process to grant protected status to refugees because the directive requires the [council](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2014/545697/EPRS_ATA%282014%29545697_REV1_EN.pdf) to complete a lengthy voting procedure, and evaluate whether the conditions of a "mass influx" of refugees justifies granting protections.
1.1.2.5. Pro: The [programme](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/cynthia-orchard-dawn-chatty/high-time-for-europe-to-offer-temporary-protection-to) would be coordinated across Europe, promoting more equitable responsibility-sharing amongst European countries and the aim would be to process significantly higher numbers of people in need of protection, giving more people the refuge they so desperately need.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: A common policy for handling and processing refugees is a core part of the directive. Further development of the directive would likely enhance cohesion of EU policies.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: The [directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32001L0055) states that a common policy on asylum is "a constituent part of the European Union's objective of establishing progressively an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately seek protection in the European Union."
1.1.2.6. Con: The involvement of UN organizations as specified in [Art. 3 \(3\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32001L0055) will burden the administration with additional coordination effort.
1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Sometimes, member states acting on their own are more influential, such as the [decision](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/05/refugees-travelling-from-hungary-can-enter-germany-and-austria) by Merkel to accept the refugees from Hungary.
1.1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.1.
1.1.2.8. Con: The ability to apply for asylum combined with the arbitrary distribution of refugees will create unfair results since asylum acceptance rates [differ](https://www.euronews.com/2017/09/26/fact-check-how-many-refugees-has-each-eu-country-taken-in) across the EU.
1.1.2.9. Pro: War refugees are likely to enjoy only temporary protection as they flee armed conflicts.
1.1.2.9.1. Pro: The war refugee status granted by the directive, and the protection that status entails, may be mutually exclusive with asylum seeker status - so any protection is necessarily temporary.
1.1.2.10. Con: The definition of 'war' is highly contested. It is better to regard any mass influx under this directive as it is. The specification was meant with war in mind but is broader also including natural disasters as reason.
1.1.3. Pro: Refugees should be allowed to file an application for asylum at all EU agencies abroad.
1.1.3.1. Con: Applicants would be in danger during the application process, since the reason they're asking for asylum is the danger in their home country.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: If they are asking for asylum they are already in danger. Therefore they are not in any more danger than they already were.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: The application process can be improved to accommodate some measure of privacy to prevent further risks.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: The EU is currently attempting to [speed up](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180423IPR02320/meps-support-reforms-to-speed-up-assessment-of-asylum-requests-in-the-eu) their asylum request process.
1.1.4. Pro: Preventing an extremely dangerous journey to European grounds with smugglers could save a lot of lives.
1.1.4.1. Con: Many refugees will still wish to travel to the EU due to the [economic opportunities](http://fortune.com/2018/06/23/europe-migrants-eu-immigrants/) it has.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: This is not an argument against camps. Those who are rejected in camps and decide to try the journey are those who are rejected in Europe now. So in both cases, we have some people who are in a EU illegally. There may be a debate what to do with those, but that has nothing to do with camps in Africa.
1.1.4.2. Con: There will still be illegal immigrants which the EU must deport.
1.1.5. Con: EU is not obliged to protect all refugees seeking asylum.
1.1.5.1. Pro: There are no countries in the world that have an established system of financial budget for ensuring a safe way for those who seek refuge in these countries. It is a responsibility of asylum seekers to look after themselves in these situations.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: This would be very expensive and societies should not be forced to pay for the failure of other societies to make a livable society.
1.1.6. Con: Offering a safe path would only aggravate issues, as many more people will take the chance to emigrate to the EU.
1.1.6.1. Con: Refugees undertake their life-threatening voyage not because chances are provided to them, but because they cannot stay where they are. So better transportation would only help make the journey safer and not encourage people to leave, if they are not threatened.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: According to [UNHCR](https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/what-is-a-refugee/), The UN Refugee Agency, a refugee is “someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence.” Refugees may also be fleeing unlivable conditions caused by natural disasters.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: There [are a number of countries](https://www.worldvision.org/refugees-news-stories/forced-to-flee-top-countries-refugees-coming-from) experiencing conflict and disaster where millions of people are "forcibly displaced."
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: UHCR leadership has [stated](https://www.unhcr.org/europe-emergency.html), “The simple truth is that refugees would not risk their lives on a journey so dangerous if they could thrive where they are.”
1.1.6.2. Pro: If skilled workers leave middle-income countries, it may have a damaging effect on the economy of the country which they leave.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Many skilled workers who leave their home countries send money home in the form of [remittances](https://migrationdataportal.org/themes/remittances). This reinvestment actually has a beneficial impact on the country that they left.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: "The [World Bank](https://www.knomad.org/data/remittances) estimates that international remittances to low- and middle-income countries have increased by 8.5 per cent in 2017, reaching USD 466 billion \(Ratha et al., 2018\). This sum is estimated to grow by 4.1 per cent to reach USD 485 billion in 2018. These funds largely outnumber Official Development Assistance." according to the [Migration Data Portal](https://migrationdataportal.org/themes/remittances).
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: [Brain drain](http://mo.ibrahim.foundation/news/2018/brain-drain-bane-africas-potential/), which is the emigration of skilled nationals, results in a depletion of skilled human resource in the countries of origin. For example, the African Union estimates that over 70,000 skilled workers emigrate from African countries each year - reducing Africa's potential labor force and constraining long term economic growth.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: Skilled workers likely benefited from public education in their home country, but once they leave, will no longer pay taxes or otherwise compensate the country for the cost of their training.
1.1.6.3. Pro: States in the EU may not have the capacity to safely receive additional asylum-seekers.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Many countries along the [path](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/refugee-crisis) migrants travel have been overwhelmed by the massive number of people seeking safety.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The [economies](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/29/italy-could-be-the-next-greece--only-much-worse.html) of Greece and Italy are currently performing badly leaving less money to contribute to the refugee crisis.
1.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: Many [asylum facilities](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/08/1018112) in Greece are [overcrowded](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-strapped-greece-struggles-with-flood-of-refugees-1440921228) and [poorly equipped](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/how-greece-fumbled-refugee-crisis), resulting in camps unable to provide [necessary medical care and protection](https://abcnews.go.com/International/feel-life-empty-refugees-suffer-mental-illness-greek/story?id=53724038).
1.1.6.3.1.3. Con: The European Commission offers [emergency support funding](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/humanitarian-aid/emergency-support-within-eu_en) to Member States whose own response capacities are overwhelmed by urgent and exceptional circumstances, such as the sudden influx of refugees. The assistance is coordinated with NGOs and the UN.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.3.
1.1.7. Pro: Allowing an organised safe passage to Europe would help the EU process refugees better.
1.1.7.1. Pro: This would also resolve the issues of registration, as refugees could be registered before or on the journey.
1.1.7.2. Pro: An organised safe passage allows to register asylum seekers easier.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Controlling and supervising new refugees coming to society would help to prevent illegal activities including terrorism or crimes.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: Control and supervision \(surveillance\) is likely to lead to intimidation and alienation, which is more likely to lead to [radicalization](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/19/british-muslims-driven-to-extremism-alienated-at-home).
1.1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Treating people well and accepting them may be more likely to lead to successful integration.
1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Canada](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/25/world/canada/syrian-refugees.html) developed a pilot program for private citizens to assist in resettlement of refugee families from Syria, with some success.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: An organized registration system could help refugees assimilate to the society by providing a safety net and offering resources to help them understand existing habits and culture.
1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Requiring that immigrants adopt and follow social habits stifles healthy expressions of diversity.
1.1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: A migrant following the norms of the society they join is not limiting the diversity but showing respect to values that are established and create good foundation for integration.
1.1.7.2.2.1.2. Con: Compulsory education to help refugees understand the target country social norms and help them adapt is not the same as enforcing the social norms on them. Therefore, it does not restrict diversity or integration.
1.1.7.2.2.2. Pro: Norway has given refugees classes on [western norms](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-refugees-given-classes-on-sexual-norms-a6803666.html) in a bid to help assimilation.
1.1.7.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.1.1.1.
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: Having monitoring and predetermined locations to send refugees to would prevent the separation of refugee's families and social exclusion.
1.1.7.2.4. Pro: A registration is a prerequisite to pass penalties if refugees breaks the law.
1.1.7.3. Pro: EU countries would also have better visibility on who each person is which would address security concerns.
1.1.7.4. Pro: This would make it possible to administer exact statistics of how many refugees are coming.
1.1.7.5. Pro: This would make it easier to distribute the refugees between the EU-member states \(once a distribution system will be implemented\).
1.1.8. Pro: Safe passage to the EU would reduce the dangers currently faced by refugees.
1.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.8.2. Pro: This would instantly cut off the [smugglers](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/world-human-smuggling-170123122824101.html)' business which often [exploits](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-34183454/migrant-crisis-the-syrians-exploited-by-people-smugglers-in-turkey) refugees.
1.2. The EU should call for a global solution to enforce a worldwide distribution system to accommodate asylum seekers.
1.2.1. Pro: The EU should enforce a distribution system between all member states to accommodate asylum seekers.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The [Dublin-Procedure](https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/opinion/why-are-we-not-reforming-the-dublin-regulation-yet/) has to be amended because it burdens the EU-border-states excessively strongly by making them responsible for processing asylum claims.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Non border states such as Hungary are also [unable](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/migrants-stream-into-austria-swept-west-by-overwhelmed-hungary) to cope with the large number of refugees.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Hungary is also unwilling to cope with refugees at all, because of its current government. \([theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/15/refugee-crisis-hungary-launches-border-crackdown-live-updates); [voanews.com](http://www.voanews.com/media/video/2986874.html)\)
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: The EU border states [voluntarily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation) joined the Dublin agreement which was essentially a separate contract between sovereign countries and not enshrined in the EU structure in the beginning.
1.2.1.1.4. Con: Geography and the proximity of these states to conflict zones and migrant routes is the reason for this issue, not the Dublin Procedure.
1.2.1.2. Con: Enforcing such a distribution system will be met by extensive resistance from EU members.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The EU has previously had to [sue](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42270239) Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic at the European Court of Justice for refusing to take in asylum seekers. They will likely also reject this policy.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Italy has previously [refused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/italy-refugees-salvini-refuses-coastguard-ship-docks-diciotti) to take in more refugees, it is unlikely that they will agree to take in more.
1.2.1.3. Con: Border states expecting most refugees should have the anticipated capacities. When those governments don't spend the money appropriately others should not have to bear that burden.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Money from the EU came in in big amounts for decades. These states had plenty of time to adapt their structures.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: These countries were not adapting their structures to the refugee crisis, but for an internal economical growth.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: The refugee crisis is not a decade old yet. EU cannot backtrack investments into its border states that were already allocated in the spent budgets of these countries.
1.2.1.3.1.3. Con: This does not make them automatically responsible to take in refugees.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Greece already got a lot of money from other EU members which is [spent poorly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/how-greece-fumbled-refugee-crisis).
1.2.1.4. Pro: If in all EU member states the standards regarding accomodation and processing \(and depending on the living costs of each country, also social benefits\) were comparable, it would be easier to distribute the refugees equally.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: One of the reasons why most of the refugees currently want to come to Northern Europe is, that countries such as Germany or Sweden offer way [higher standards](https://www.undispatch.com/the-four-best-countries-for-refugee-resettlement/) of asylum than countries such as Hungary or Greece.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Safety is the main concern of refugees, as such differing standards are only a secondary motivation to choose a destination country.
1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.
1.2.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.2.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: It is not right, that refugees get treated differently regarding accomodation and processing, depending on which EU country they apply for asylum.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: A solution to this would be to treat them according lowest standard of all countries.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Equalization of asylum standards is the necessary precondition for a functioning EU-wide distribution system.
1.2.1.5. Con: The [EU-Directive 2003/9/EG](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:031:0018:0025:EN:PDF) and the [EU-Directive 2005/85/EG](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:326:0013:0034:EN:PDF), defining minimum standards regarding accommodation and the procedure for grating the right of asylum, are sufficient.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: The standards regarding accommodation and processing still differ on an extensive level, this shows that the EU-Directives' minimum standards are insufficient.
1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: An important verdict is "M.S.S." \(21.01.2011\) in which the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) decided, that some of the asylum standards in Greece were transgressing regulations of the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\). \([hudoc.echr.coe.int](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&id=001-103050&filename=001-103050.pdf&TID=nubefaxeep)\)
1.2.1.5.1.2. Con: Minimum and approved standards can differ. Minimum defines lowest possibility, each country should be free to apply more advanced features at their own desires and costs.
1.2.2. Con: If a global solution is sought it should tackle the source of the problem, why they flee, not the symptom.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Since global agreement is difficult to reach the energy should be used to find sustainable solutions.
1.2.2.2. Con: Re-establishing peace in the affected areas will take much more time than the countries affected by mass migrations or the refugees themselves can tolerate.
1.2.2.3. Con: This can be done in addition and isn't excluded by helping those refugees who exist now.
1.2.3. Pro: Countries like the UAE or Qatar are [rich enough](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/28/richest-countries-world-2018-top-25/38429481/) to pay for many refugees.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia is much closer to Syria than the EU. And it has a lot of money and is not taking in one single refugee.
1.2.4. Pro: It is not fair and also impossible for the EU to solve the refugee problem on it's own. The rest of the world has to engage in the process as well.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Global solutions for global problems are more likely to be successful.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Working together allows there to be much more resources to solve this issue.
1.2.4.2. Con: The numbers show that European countries [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refugee_population) among the ones with fewer refugees than others.
1.2.5. Con: Politically it would be extremely difficult to convince non-EU countries to take in refugees they see as the EU's own problem.
1.2.5.1. Con: Australia has been [willing](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/09/australia-to-accept-an-extra-12000-syrian-refugees-and-will-join-us-led-air-strikes) to take in refugees.
1.2.5.2. Con: [Brazil](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/syrians-refuge-brazil-latin-america-war-refugees) is currently taking in refugees as well.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Considering that Brazil is not a rich nation, there is no economical excuse that wealthier countries shouldn't help.
1.2.5.3. Con: The EU has a lot of influence over other countries. With the right incentives, these would accept refugees.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: The EU currently pays states such as [Turkey](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-turkey/eu-to-offer-turkey-more-cash-for-syrian-refugees-before-erdogan-meeting-idUSKCN1GP1K7) to house refugees.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Under the [Trump Administration,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/trump-refugee-cap/570049/) the US lacks the political willpower to resettle refugees.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: The US recently [reduced](https://www.rescue.org/article/why-should-america-take-more-refugees-get-facts-refugee-cap) the number of refugees it will allow into the country.
1.2.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.6. Pro: The US has a duty to help solve this problem.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The US should take in refugees because they have the resources to do so.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: There are many people who live in [poverty](https://www.nap.edu/read/13497/chapter/11#171) and are in need of help, who already live in the US.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: The US is one of the [richest](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/28/richest-countries-world-2018-top-25/38429481/) countries in the world.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: Just because private citizens across the nation have wealth does not mean the government has the necessary resources to help.
1.2.6.2. Pro: The American government bears a lot of the blame of the [Syrian civil war](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/syria-civil-war-explained-160505084119966.html) and the creation of [ISIS](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq) which led to the conflicts refugees fled from.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: The US didn't do very much in Syria. It was much less involved than states such as [Russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/syria-civil-war-explained-160505084119966.html).
1.2.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.
1.3. The EU should work on projects which aim to keep refugees from wanting to travel to the EU.
1.3.1. Pro: The EU could establish refugee camps near conflict zones in order to provide safe accommodation for refugees who would otherwise travel to Europe.
1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.3.1.2. Pro: This would mean less administration effort in European countries as we wouldn't have to deport people anymore.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: This would be balanced by the costs necessary to run these camps.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Housing refugees in nearby camps in the region is a more cost efficient solution.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: It is up to [10 times cheaper](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syrian-refugees-will-cost-ten-times-more-to-care-for-in-europe-than-in-neighboring-countries-a6928676.html) to house a refugee in a camp in Jordan than it is to house a refugee in Germany.
1.3.1.4. Con: There is no need for camps. Refugees can seek asylum at several embassies present in those countries.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Refugees [cannot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum) seek asylum at the embassies of many countries. In order to obtain asylum they must be within the EU.
1.3.1.4.2. Con: Embassies cannot accommodate the inflow of the refugees. They neither have the necessary space nor the necessary workforce to manage this.
1.3.1.4.3. Con: The priority of embassies is their country citizens. They cannot put the rights of the refugees above their citizens' rights.
1.3.1.4.4. Pro: The EU is currently planning to [implement](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/world/20181031STO18177/humanitarian-visas-a-right-to-be-heard-without-risking-your-life) an EU humanitarian visa system to allow refugees to apply to come to the EU from abroad.
1.3.1.5. Con: These states are not EU member states. Therefore, EU does not have a right to decide on the establishment of camps within their borders without their agreement and collaboration.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: Their collaboration can be gained by economic subsides or by economic contracts which are more convenient for them.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.1.
1.3.1.6. Con: Refugee camps can promote [smuggling](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/smugglers-profit-as-serbia-s-refugee-camps-reach-capacity-1.2921322) and [crime](https://abcnews.go.com/International/chaos-crime-trials-running-syrian-refugee-camp/story?id=19521964) which can harm refugees.
1.3.1.7. Pro: The proximity of these camps makes them a more practical option for refugees.
1.3.1.7.1. Pro: Nearby refugee camps allow refugees to travel home easier once conflict ends.
1.3.1.7.2. Pro: This would make the journey easier and safer for women, children and elderly people.
1.3.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.1.
1.3.2. Pro: EU should organize ways for refugees to stay in their country safely and work to improve the situations within these countries.
1.3.2.1. Con: Building up a politically and especially economically stable system in the poor African countries will cost the EU money.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Also economic refugees cost the EU money. The less there are coming, the less it costs. Thus it might be profitable for the EU investing in long-term solutions.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Not building up a stable system in poor African countries might cost the EU even more in the future as the [climate change](https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_climate_driven_migration_in_africa) will lead to even more economic refugees.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: If done properly, currently poor African countries could thrive and eventually become important trade partners in the future.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: While desirable, in the short-medium term this would give more people the necessary money needed to embark the journey towards Europe.
1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If you improve the economic and social situation in their home countries, they will be less likely to want to leave as refugees in the first place.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Under the Marshall Plan, the US did this with Germany, Japan, and their European allies as well as their former adversaries. This not only avoided the social unrest the Treaty of Versailles created with reparations after WWI, but it also made Japan and Germany into successful and peaceful world economic powers allied with the United States in the process.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Helping to overcome the systemic problems regarding education, health, and human rights that migrants face in their own countries is the key to solving the economic refugee problem in the long run.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: These projects will likely take a long time to implement, in the short term people will still travel to the EU.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: A UN report found that [70%](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/824794/migrant-crisis-refugee-Italy-Libya-UN-figures-Mediterranean-boat-crossing) of those who make the journey across the Mediterranean to Europe do so for economic reasons.
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: [Education](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/why-education-is-the-key-to-development/) is regularly cited as being key to development.
1.3.2.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.2.
1.3.2.4. Con: It's not a EU problem so the regions affected need to sort it out themselves.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: It becomes an EU problem when refugees flood the borders of EU countries. This claim is false because it is clearly already a EU problem.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Fixing the conflicts within these regions would stop the need for refugees to flee.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: Improving the situation in Syria would allow refugees to return home.
1.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: Over [5.6 million refugees](https://www.unhcr.org/syria-emergency.html) have fled the conflict in Syria.
1.3.2.5.1.2. Con: The U.N says that [250,000 refugees](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/250000-refugees-return-syria-2019-181211134022694.html) could return to Syria in 2019.
1.3.2.5.1.3. Con: The Syrian civil war is [largely over](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/23/the-syrian-war-is-over-and-america-lost/), with the government calling for citizens to [return home](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syrian-government-calls-refugees-return-home-n888791). There is no need to get involved in this situation.
1.3.2.5.1.3.1. Con: Many refugees fled Syria to escape [conscription](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syrian-government-calls-refugees-return-home-n888791), they will not return out of fear of reprisal by the state.
1.3.2.5.1.3.2. Con: The Syrian government only [wants](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/401638-when-assad-asks-syrians-to-come-home-heres-what-he-really-means) Syrians who were loyal to the government to return home.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Fixing the issues related to terrorism and political unrest in Africa will prevent people from needing to flee their homes and come to Europe.
1.3.2.5.2.1. Pro: Nigeria's problem with [terrorism](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/boko-haram-nigeria-famine-hunger-displacement-refugees-climate-change-lake-chad) causes hundreds of thousands of people to be displaced and forced to flee.
1.3.2.5.2.2. Con: Less than [3%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/boko-haram-nigeria-famine-hunger-displacement-refugees-climate-change-lake-chad) of Africa's refugees are in Europe.
1.3.2.5.2.3. Pro: UN funding related to solving the refugee problem in Africa is currently [61%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/boko-haram-nigeria-famine-hunger-displacement-refugees-climate-change-lake-chad) underfunded.
1.3.2.5.2.4. Pro: Migration from Sub-Saharan Africa to Europe has [increased](http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/) since 2010.
1.3.2.5.2.5. Con: The EU already [invests heavily](https://www.africa-eu-partnership.org/en/stay-informed/news/eu-allocates-eu659-million-support-peacekeeping-somalia) in peacekeeping in Africa and it has not stopped refugees travelling to Europe.
1.3.3. Pro: Countries within Europe, should legally purchase land in North Africa or in the Middle East and help build a new nation for refugees.
1.3.3.1. Con: Purchasing massive amount of land can disrupt local economies because of the sudden increase in demand for land.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In any given area when the demand rises for land the price will go up as well because supply is fixed.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: In a sparsely populated area, payments to the few inhabitants who will be affected can be used to offset their increased cost of living, assuming they intend to stay in the newly formed nation.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Chinese buying land on the Korea island of [Jeju](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/phone/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=216747) has made it nearly impossible for local residents to own a house because of the steep price increase.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: The inhabitants of Jeju were not compensated to offset these new costs, it is not inevitable that this will always be the case.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Should these refugee states become highly successful, their close proximity to family and friends in their old nations will generate a positive influence on the region. Neighboring peoples will see what can be accomplished in lands like their own, by people like themselves.
1.3.3.3. Con: Purchasing a land in Africa is revisiting the colonial times.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Refugees would not necessarily be better off if they exchanged their current problem \(where to settle and find a home\) for an older deep-seated problem \(the experience of colonialization\) that has existed for centuries.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: The [long-run effects of colonization](https://voxeu.org/article/long-run-effects-scramble-africa) have destabilized many post-colonial countries and caused civil wars and unrest.
1.3.3.4. Pro: There have been instances where private people bought land and then with the help of established nations, founded a new one, most notably [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine).
1.3.3.5. Con: There are no countries currently advertising large plots of their state for sale.
1.3.3.6. Con: Purchasing land for refugees to settle could displace the peoples who currently live there, in effect, creating a new group of refugees seeking a home.
1.3.3.7. Con: There is no legal or administrative process to start a new country. [Starting a country](https://foreignpolicy.com/2008/02/26/how-to-start-your-own-country-in-four-easy-steps/) would require global recognition and legitimacy which is difficult to acquire.
1.3.3.7.1. Con: [South Sudan, Kosovo, and other countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/09/16/the-9-newest-countries-in-the-world/?utm_term=.8e5ba1cbf178) have acquired territory and declared independence over the past few decades - proving that it is possible to start a new country.
1.3.4. Con: Refugees who travel to Europe are often [extremely desperate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/11845205/Why-do-refugees-and-migrants-come-to-Europe-and-what-must-be-done-to-ease-the-crisis.html). If they believe the EU will be a safer location for them, they will still travel there.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.4. The EU should take measures to shut down its borders to prevent refugees from entering Europe.
1.4.1. Pro: The EU should close down its borders and build defense facilities to prevent illegal immigration. This would deter refugees from making the journey to Europe.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Investing in surveillance and defense is much cheaper than taking care of the refugees.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The European economy needs more foreign workers in the long run. Thus taking care of refugees now will be a good investment, as in the future as they will be able to work and contribute to the economy.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: It would be much more efficient and cheaper to recruit skilled workers from higher-income and middle-income countries that already have higher education facilities in place.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Workers are needed from low income countries in order to meet labour demands.
1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Workers from low income countries often do [jobs](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-two-faced-migration-reality-immigration-positives-negatives/) within developed countries that citizens within these states do not wish to do.
1.4.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: These workers often help to meet [labour gaps](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/the-truth-about-wages-and-immigration-emerges-at-last) within specific industries.
1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: Refugees [contribute](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/evidence-shows-that-refugees-contribute-to-the-economies-of-their-new-homes-10499122.html) more to society than they cost. Their arrival would not jeopardize Europe.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Due to the massive [size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_border_of_the_European_Union) of the borders of Europe, this is likely to be extremely expensive.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: It is [estimated](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/10/25/border-checks-are-undermining-schengen) that the reintroduction of EU borders would cost over €20 billion in construction costs and €2 billion annually in operating costs.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Reintroducing borders across the EU has been [estimated](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/10/25/border-checks-are-undermining-schengen) to cost €20 billion; and housing refugees in Germany alone cost over [€20 billion](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-refugees-spend-20-billion-euros-2016-angela-merkel-crisis-budgets-middle-east-north-africa-a7623466.html) in 2016.
1.4.1.2. Con: Not helping starving or persecuted refugees is immoral.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: European states currently already help refugees by giving [billions](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/funding-evaluations/funding-humanitarian-aid_en) in humanitarian aid.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War) of people have died due to the conflict in Syria. Refusing to allow these people to seek safety in Europe will cause more to die.
1.4.1.3. Con: Increasing border security would aggravate issues we are currently facing with immigrants.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Border walls make the journey more [dangerous](https://www.msf.org/push-backs-violence-and-inadequate-conditions-balkan-routes-new-frontier) for refugees by forcing them to rely on smugglers.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Increased border security forces refugees to live in cramped unsafe [camps](https://news.osu.edu/europes-refugee-crisis-explains-why-border-walls-dont-stop-migration/) near the border.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Europe cannot take in any more refugees than it already has.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: The [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/europe-emergency.html) has indicated it believes Europe is capable of taking in more refugees, calling upon 15 countries along Mediterranean routes to offer an additional 40,000 resettlement places, which will complement already existing commitments.
1.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
