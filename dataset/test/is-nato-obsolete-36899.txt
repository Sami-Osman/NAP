Discussion Name: Is NATO obsolete?

1. NATO is obsolete.
1.1. Pro: NATO has not managed to form a coherent strategy to combat terrorism, the great threat of the modern era.
1.1.1. Pro: Since there are disagreements on strategies and priorities for NATO countries when dealing with terrorism, it has been difficult to form a coherent strategy to combat it.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The US espouses an offensive approach which requires the mass mobilization of resources to attack terrorists. However, many European countries wish to take a defensive approach whereby they want to deal with the [root causes](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2004/08/01/refining-nato-s-role-in-combating-terrorism/index.html) of terrorism instead of using violence.
1.1.2. Con: NATO has taken sufficient actions to deal with the threat of terrorism.
1.1.2.1. Pro: At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, NATO leaders decided to provide support to the fight against [ISIL](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_131724.htm).
1.1.2.2. Con: NATO's attempts to combat terrorism have primarily been through military engagement and drone strikes. This is ineffective, and actively harmful to the cause of combating terrorism.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: NATO drone strikes have been accused of creating anti-American sentiment and enabling terrorists to [recruit more easily](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-usa/pakistan-parliament-committee-demands-end-to-u-s-drone-strikes-idUSBRE82J08320120320) from besieged populations.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Drone strikes have been notorious for targeting people based on very weak evidence, implying that many of the 'successful' kills achieved through these programmes are not terrorists, but probably [innocent people](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush).
1.1.2.3. Pro: NATO has taken several actions to combat terrorism in Afghanistan.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: After the 9/11 attacks NATO invoked [Article 5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm). By 4 October 2001, in response to requests by the United States, Allies agreed to take [eight measures](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2004/08/01/refining-nato-s-role-in-combating-terrorism/index.html) to expand the options for fighting terrorism.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: NATO launched attacks on [Al-Qaeda and the Taliban](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2004/08/01/refining-nato-s-role-in-combating-terrorism/index.html) in Afghanistan.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: NATO took lead of the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force \([ISAF](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_77646.htm)\) in Afghanistan. ISAF’s primary objective was to enable the Afghan government to provide effective security across the country and develop new Afghan security forces to ensure Afghanistan would never again become a safe haven for terrorists.
1.1.3. Con: At the Chicago Summit, NATO leaders endorsed [new policy guidelines](https://inss.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/inss/Strategic-Perspectives-13.pdf) on counter-terrorism, which focus on improved threat awareness and enhanced engagement with partner countries and other international actors.
1.1.4. Pro: Since all NATO member countries do not see terrorism as a big threat, it has been difficult to form a coherent strategy to combat it. \([p.5](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/128562/rp_66.pdf)\)
1.1.5. Pro: The hurdles in intelligence sharing make it difficult for NATO to effectively combat terrorism.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Many NATO member countries are [distrustful](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/70086) of one another and, hence, hesitant to share data.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: After the USA leaked sensitive [intelligence](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/25/uk-police-stop-passing-information-to-us-over-leaks-of-key-evidence) about the Manchester bombing, the UK stopped sharing evidence from the investigation.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: It was found that the NSA had [tapped](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/nsa-tapped-german-chancellery-decades-wikileaks-claims-merkel) the phone calls of Germany's Chancellor, Angel Merkel, creating distrust between Germany and the USA.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Trump leaked [sensitive intelligence](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-russia-israel-intelligence-share-isis-mossad-spies-sergei-lavrov-kislyak-us-a8071086.html) to Russia which was provided by Israel. If the USA could reveal information given to it by one of its closest allies, NATO member countries have reason enough to be distrustful of the USA.
1.1.5.1.4. Con: This is not a generally true phenomenon. Many NATO members engage in [bilateral intelligence sharing](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/70086) with each other, implying that there is space for the creation of further trust and sharing.
1.1.5.1.5. Con: Many NATO member countries are part of the extended groups of intelligence pacts called the '[Five Eyes](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/understanding-five-eyes-concept/)', 'Nine Eyes', and 'Fourteen Eyes' implying that they are comfortable with multilateral intelligence sharing.
1.1.5.2. Con: NATO is actively working on improving its intelligence production and sharing mechanisms.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: In 2017, NATO established a new [Joint Intelligence and Security Division](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/10/29/a-new-era-for-nato-intelligence/index.html) to improve the quality and utility of the intelligence provided to all major leaders.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: However, these improvements are driven by a fear of a more [assertive Russia](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/10/29/a-new-era-for-nato-intelligence/index.html), not as a means of combating terrorism.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: In [2017](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_144083.htm), NATO agreed to establish a new terrorism intelligence cell.
1.2. Con: NATO is essential for the security of its members as China is becoming more powerful.
1.2.1. Con: China does not pose any military threat to NATO member countries.
1.2.1.1. Con: Unlike many NATO member countries, China possesses [nuclear weapons](https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/china/nuclear/).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: China is [estimated](https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/) to possess 320 nuclear warheads. In comparison, the USA alone possesses over 5000. Given this, China is highly unlikely to ever use its warheads.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Not many NATO countries have nuclear weapons of their own, but all of them are protected by them since they are under the [nuclear umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella#NATO) of NATO's nuclear powers.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: China also has a nuclear ally in the region, [Pakistan](https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/pakistan/nuclear/), for support.
1.2.1.2. Con: China has become a great military power.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: China has a weak military compared to some NATO member countries.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The People's Liberation Army \(PLA\) lacks military experience compared to NATO.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: China conducted a patrol with a [nuclear missile submarine](https://thediplomat.com/2014/01/chinas-deceptively-weak-and-dangerous-military/) and ended up compromising its [stealth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2019/10/16/chinese-nuclear-submarine-involved-in-incident-in-south-china-sea/#3f42af9491b7).
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The PLA has [never fought a real war](https://www.businessinsider.com/retiring-chinese-general-reveals-chinas-greatest-military-weakness-2018-6).
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The PLA engaged in a minor naval skirmish with Vietnam in [1988](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/anniversary-03132018160914.html).
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: The PLA last fought a major conflict nearly 40 years ago, when the Vietnamese military defeated the Chinese invasion in [1979](http://www.historynet.com/sino-vietnamese-war-1979.htm).
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.3. Con: Since neither the USA nor China have fought a major war against an [equally capable](https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/11/chinas-military-has-no-combat-experience-does-it-matter.html) military since World War II, the PLA's general lack of fighting experience is insignificant.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.3.1. Con: However, the US military has still been involved in significant conflicts such as the [Gulf War](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/persian-gulf-war) and the [war in Afghanistan](https://www.britannica.com/event/Afghanistan-War) in the past few decades. The PLA has no similar experience.
1.2.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Military experience is not always necessary for success.
1.2.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Prior to the First World War, the [British Army](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/fog-war-chinas-military-battle-ready-12418) was continuously engaged in various colonial wars. In spite of this, it was consistently defeated and routed by the German Army in the early stages of the conflict.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Chinese military hardware and tactics are outdated compared to NATO.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: China is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council never to have [built](https://thediplomat.com/2014/01/chinas-deceptively-weak-and-dangerous-military/) an [aircraft carrier](https://thediplomat.com/2014/01/chinas-deceptively-weak-and-dangerous-military/).
1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: In a time where air travel is accessible and widely-used, China's armies are still reliant on [railway tracks](https://thediplomat.com/2014/01/chinas-deceptively-weak-and-dangerous-military/) for mobilization.
1.2.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: It is foreseeable that this is about to change since China [invests heavily](https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/02/2002127082/-1/-1/1/2019_CHINA_MILITARY_POWER_REPORT.pdf) \(p. 41\) in the modernization of its air lift capacities.
1.2.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Chinese military technologies are rapidly improving as it is [hacking](https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-military-power-surpass-the-us-faster-than-you-think-2019-8#1-the-chinese-government-is-hacking-its-way-to-new-technology-1) and stealing existing US technologies.
1.2.1.2.1.2.4. Con: China is [developing tactics](https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-military-power-surpass-the-us-faster-than-you-think-2019-8#1-the-chinese-government-is-hacking-its-way-to-new-technology-1) focusing on the ability to strike first and decisively in a conflict, taking advantage of the USA's tactical weaknesses in this regard.
1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: China's active [military size](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/military-size-by-country/) is greater than that of the USA, UK, and France put together.
1.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Troop numbers are hardly decisive in today's warfare since armies don't clash in open battle anymore.
1.2.1.2.1.4. Con: China has a strong focus on [capacity concealment](https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-military-power-surpass-the-us-faster-than-you-think-2019-8#4-china-hides-its-hand-4), implying that its military capacity is far greater than is apparently visible.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: According to the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/paf/projects/us-china-scorecard.html), China has by now reached parity with or even an advantage over the US armed forces in some dimensions of two likely scenarios in which the two countries might clash military.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: These two scenarios - as well as the military balance in that context - are hardly relevant for NATO since they are about armed conflict surrounding Taiwan and islands in the South Pacific, and thus far away from NATO's geographic focus.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: NATO's focus has proven to be varied, as the organization has intervened in non European theatres such as the [Middle East](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/Middle-East/EN/index.htm).
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: China has the world's [second-largest](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true) military budget. That puts it out of every other country's league, none of which spend even a third of China's budget on their military.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Furthermore, China's military power - in terms of spending - continues to grow [at about 5-7% per year](https://chinapower.csis.org/military-spending/). Over the course of the last decade, its military spending has therefore doubled.
1.2.1.2.3.2. Con: At the same time, the United States still spends [more than twice as much](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true) on its military. China, therefore, might be a great power, but it is still outclassed.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: It has been [argued](https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/asiapacific-regional-security-assessment-2019/rsa19-07-chapter-5) that China is "starting to emerge as a true cyber superpower".
1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: While China's cyberwar capacities may be rapidly developing, it still [lacks behind the US](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7249/j.ctt17rw5gb.19?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) in this area.
1.2.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The USA is still the market leader in the AI industry as [40%](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/global-artificial-intelligence-landscape-including-3465-westerheide/) of all AI companies are based inside it.
1.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: After having launched [5G services](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50258287), China has started research into developing [6G mobile networks](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/china-starts-6g-development-having-just-turned-on-its-5g-mobile-network.html).
1.2.1.2.4.3. Pro: China is aggressively developing [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/01/14/china-artificial-intelligence-superpower/#702532592f05) systems.
1.2.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: China has invested a lot of money in developing Artificial Intelligence.
1.2.1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: The Chinese government has set up a [$30 billion](https://www.techinasia.com/report-chinas-government-establishes-30-billion-vc-fund) venture capital fund to support technological innovation in the country.
1.2.1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: Beijing is building an intelligence development park which would cost around [$2 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-artificial-intelligence/beijing-to-build-2-billion-ai-research-park-xinhua-idUSKBN1ES0B8).
1.2.1.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: Tianjin has committed to invest [$16 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ai-tianjin/chinas-city-of-tianjin-to-set-up-16-billion-artificial-intelligence-fund-idUSKCN1II0DD) in developing its local AI industry.
1.2.1.2.4.3.2. Pro: China has developed AI that can [present news](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46136504) as well as a professional news anchor can.
1.2.1.2.4.3.3. Pro: Data analysis conducted by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence found that China's share of authorship of the top [10%](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02360-7) most-cited papers on Artificial Intelligence has increased.
1.2.1.2.4.3.4. Con: China's slow rate of economic growth could hinder its ability to invest in Artificial Intelligence.
1.2.1.2.4.3.4.1. Pro: Many countries are unable to pay back [loans](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/chinas-loans-causing-hidden-debt-risk-to-economies.html) taken from China. This could slow down economic growth for China and, going forward, limit its ability to invest in AI.
1.2.1.2.4.3.4.2. Pro: China's [trade war](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charleswallace1/2019/08/09/trade-war-hurting-chinas-economy/#7fbfe0714035) with the USA has significantly harmed its economy.
1.2.1.2.4.3.4.3. Pro: In 2019, China's economy grew by [6.1%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp-instantview/instant-view-chinas-economic-growth-slows-to-6-1-in-2019-near-30-year-low-idUSKBN1ZG092). This is the slowest it has grown in the past 29 years.
1.2.1.2.4.3.4.3.1. Con: This number may be lower than in the past, but has to be seen in a [larger context](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=60703). Not a single OECD member country had this rate of growth in 2019; most didn't even reach half of it.
1.2.1.2.4.3.4.4. Con: Even though China's economic growth has slowed, it is still the [second largest economy](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/) in the world, by far leading the third. In comparative terms, it still has the capacity to invest more in AI than almost any other country.
1.2.1.2.5. Con: China's build up of military capabilities are not in itself a sufficient reason to label them as a threat.
1.2.1.3. Pro: NATO countries are bound together in an alliance and have friendly relations with countries all over the globe. China, on the other hand, is [a lonely country](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ZUhhLwg85YEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=China+Goes+Global&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwii89OdvarpAhXOUN4KHbkHCesQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=lonely%20friends&f=false) without friends and allies.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The USA has hostile relations with [Iran](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3045253/china-and-iran-relationship-built-trade-weapons-and-oil) whereas China has strong relations with it based on their military and economic cooperation.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: China is considered to be a [strong ally](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-north-korea-relationship) of North Korea whereas NATO countries have a history of hostile relations with it.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: NATO countries have levied military and economic [sanctions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/history-north-korea/) on North Korea.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: China has [pressurized](https://thediplomat.com/2019/01/chinas-plan-to-break-off-us-allies/) many US allies to side with it, instead of the USA, on various issues.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: China has been successful in convincing some [Southeast Asian countries](https://thediplomat.com/2019/01/chinas-plan-to-break-off-us-allies/) to side with it, instead of the USA, on the South China Sea disputes.
1.2.1.3.4. Pro: Even the few partners China has do not entirely trust it.
1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: There have been increasing concerns over the disproportionately [high benefits](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/03/08/china-pakistan-friends-not/) China is expected to yield \(in comparison to Pakistan\) from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor \(CPEC\), and the [debt](https://www.dawn.com/news/1488046) that it may plunge Pakistan into.
1.2.1.3.4.2. Pro: Large scale Chinese immigration into Russia and a possible dip in arms trade between the two countries has made Russia grow [distrustful](https://thediplomat.com/2011/06/china-looms-over-russia-far-east/) of China.
1.2.1.4. Pro: NATO and China have mutually cooperated in the past and, therefore, are likely to do so in the future.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: NATO and China conducted [military dialogues](http://natowatch.org/newsbriefs/2018/nato-and-china-restart-military-staff-staff-dialogue) in the past and have resumed them since 2018.
1.2.2. Pro: Leading scholars of international relations stress the potential for future conflict between China and the US.
1.2.2.1. Pro: John Mearsheimer [predicts that](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2016/03/10/crouching_tiger_john_mearsheimer_on_strangling_china_and_the_inevitability_of_war_109127.html) the competition between China and the United States is likely to become more intense and has the potential to cause war.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Graham Allison [has argued](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/) that the current setup of a rising power confronting a ruling power has in the past oftentimes resulted in warfare.
1.2.2.3. Con: Conflict does not necessarily imply war. As other scholars, such as Randall Schweller and Xiaoyu Pu, [have argued](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254925258_After_Unipolarity_China's_Vision_of_International_Order_in_an_Era_of_US_Decline). China's attempts to undermine and discredit the American world order might merely be a prelude to the emergence of a new balance of power.
1.2.2.4. Con: Scholars of international relations have a track record of [failing to predict](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/ideas/2010/03/understanding-the-end-of-the-cold-war/) major international events, for example the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Their predictions should be taken with a grain of salt.
1.2.3. Con: NATO further isolates China, [contributing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/02/06/it-looks-like-the-u-s-really-does-want-to-isolate-russia-and-china/#fa117d61dd76) to hostile relations.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Military alliance means hostility between China and any NATO member is a threat for every NATO member. This unnecessarily strains relations between otherwise neutral nations.
1.2.4. Pro: In a [survey](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-204sp#summary) of assessments from numerous US government agencies, Chinese expansionism and the challenge it poses are listed as one of the top-emerging threats for the US.
1.2.4.1. Con: A threat to the US does not equal a threat to NATO as a whole. Due to its size and global role, the US has a status quo to defend and may attract ire and challenges in unique ways.
1.3. Con: Many NATO non-member states have a strongly positive perception of the organization, implying that it continues to be relevant.
1.3.1. Pro: Of the thirty member countries, [almost half](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52044.htm) joined after the end of the Cold War, and thereby after NATO lost its original purpose and came to be criticized as obsolete, implying that it has an enduring relevance.
1.3.2. Pro: Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently participating in NATO's [Membership Action Plan](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37356.htm) and thereby preparing for formal accession talks.
1.3.3. Con: The majority of countries that want to join are in Eastern Europe, directly at Russia's doorstep and consequently fearful of invasion. NATO remains irrelevant and obsolete for all other nations.
1.3.3.1. Con: NATO does not have to be relevant to all nations in order to be important. The fact that it is of importance in preventing Russian aggression in Eastern Europe alone is enough for it to not be obsolete.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: If anything, this shows that NATO is still relevant to its original purpose of halting Soviet \(now Russian\) takeover in Europe.
1.3.3.2. Pro: This is particularly problematic since the bulk of NATO military personnel and funding comes from the [USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/each-nato-countrys-financial-contribution-to-the-military-alliance.html), which has far closer ties to Western Europe than it does with Eastern Europe.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: However, after the USA's large contribution, it is [Eastern European](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/each-nato-countrys-financial-contribution-to-the-military-alliance.html) countries such as Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia which spend the most \(as a percentage of their GDP\) on military expenditure.
1.3.4. Con: The fact that non-member countries want to join does not preclude that NATO has become obsolete for current member countries - and it is their perspective that matters here.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Existing members have expressed their interest to [withdraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_NATO) from NATO.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: None of the listed countries officially seeks to withdraw at the moment or has significant support among lawmakers or the public in favor of that step.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The accession of new members, such as those from the Balkans, has [been interpreted](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=cRzfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=NATO+membership+%22international+prestige%22&source=bl&ots=Tsr2bEcf8_&sig=ACfU3U1ICnKQi3eiXb8Cf9YL4RNkF34nMA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjbporky6DpAhWy-GEKHTpwC7gQ6AEwBXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=NATO%20membership%20%22international%20prestige%22&f=false) as a means of gaining international prestige. This factor hardly matters for existing members.
1.3.5. Pro: [South Korea](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_171177.htm) and NATO signed a comprehensive partnership programme in 2019, vowing to promote political dialogue and cooperate on many mutual issues of global security.
1.3.6. Con: Many non-member states also have negative views of the alliance.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Countries such as Belarus, Serbia, Moldova, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan see NATO more as [a threat](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203819/nato-members-eastern-europe-protection.aspx) than as a protector.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: These countries have no reason to see NATO as a protector since the alliance has no obligations and never made commitments towards them.
1.3.6.2. Con: Many of the countries with negative views of NATO are part of the Russian sphere of influence. Given Russia's past with NATO, it would be strange to expect its allies to think well of the organization.
1.3.6.3. Pro: A poll held in [Afghanistan in 2010](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-poll/nato-not-winning-afghan-hearts-and-minds-poll-idUSTRE66G0D820100717) found that 68% of Afghans believed that NATO forces did not protect them, with 59% actively opposing a new NATO military offensive.
1.3.7. Pro: [Georgia](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/west-georgia-nato/586225/) and [Ukraine](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/does-zelenskyys-ukraine-still-want-to-join-nato/) have been hoping to join NATO for years; the latter even wrote this desire into its constitution.
1.4. Pro: Member countries have made clear through their actions that they care little about NATO.
1.4.1. Pro: European members of NATO have shown repeatedly that they care little about combat-readiness and are not prepared to live up to their practical obligations to the alliance.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Throughout NATO's intervention in Libya from 2011 on, the European members were [in many areas reliant](https://shape.nato.int/resources/site631/saceur/documents/daalder_stavridis_final.pdf) on the US for their participation, for example to have access to refueling airplanes and targetting information.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Even NATO's then-Secretary General [emphasized this](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_85119.htm?selectedLocale=uk) when he spoke in 2012 of "significant shortfalls in a range of European capabilities".
1.4.1.2. Pro: The armed forces of Germany, the third-largest NATO member country, are [largely incapable](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/germany-s-military-has-become-a-complete-joke) of effective combat operations and have been described in a German parliamentary investigation as being in a "[dramatically bad](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43134896)" state.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The armed forces of France, the fourth-largest NATO member country, suffer from chronic equipment failures with [half](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/16/ground-force-half-frances-military-planes-unfit-fly/) of all planes and [two thirds](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/07/17/chronic-but-solvable-why-is-the-majority-of-french-military-helos-immobilized/) of helicopters unfit for operations.
1.4.1.4. Con: Since [Russia's capture of Crimea](https://www.hoover.org/research/europe-alert-dangers-it-faces) in 2014, European countries have come to realize the dangers they face and have moved towards becoming more battle-ready.
1.4.1.5. Con: The election of [Trump](https://www.hoover.org/research/europe-alert-dangers-it-faces) has led to European countries adopting more battle-ready mindsets.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis' '[Four Thirties](https://news.usni.org/2018/08/30/mattis-says-natos-four-thirties-force-structure-shows-political-strength)' initiative, which commits to the capacity to produce thirty air squadrons, naval ships, and combat battalions within thirty days, has been signed on to by all NATO members.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Fears of a vacuum of American political and military leadership under Trump have spurred European nations towards self sufficiency.
1.4.1.5.3. Con: In spite of this, no European country has seriously taken a step towards re-arming. These measures exist in abstract decisions, not meaningful military development.
1.4.2. Pro: In 2006, member countries agreed on spending at least 2% of their respective GDP on defense. Since then, almost all NATO members have [not even come close](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/the-two-nato-targets-which-countries-are-hitting-the-mark/) to this target and shown no signs of improvement.
1.4.2.1. Pro: In 2018, only [4 out of 28](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/09/nato-is-seen-favorably-in-many-member-countries-but-almost-half-of-americans-say-it-does-too-little/) member countries contributed at least 2% of their respective GDP on defense.
1.4.2.2. Con: In 2018, NATO's Secretary-General said that member countries have increased [burden-sharing](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/06/07/nato-members-have-turned-a-corner-in-defense-spending-stoltenberg-says/) as well as their defense budgets.
1.4.3. Pro: Member countries agreed in 2006 that at least 20% of their respective defense expenditures should go towards the development and the acquisition of equipment. [Hardly any member countries](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/the-two-nato-targets-which-countries-are-hitting-the-mark/) have hit that target since then.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In 2016, only [5](https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/15/news/nato-spending-countries/) \(The USA, Greece, Poland, Estonia and the UK\) out of 28 NATO members met the target.
1.4.4. Con: At a conference in 2020, [NATO's Secretary General](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_172906.htm?selectedLocale=en) pointed out that member countries are actually contributing more than ever before to NATO.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The USA has increased its [military presence](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_172906.htm?selectedLocale=en) in Europe, contrary to fears that it is pulling out.
1.4.4.2. Pro: There are [NATO battlegroups](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_172906.htm?selectedLocale=en) in the eastern part of the alliance for the first time in history.
1.4.4.3. Con: Many of the accomplishments celebrated in his speech were not of NATO's member states, but also of [NATO partners](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_172906.htm?selectedLocale=en) such as Australia.
1.4.5. Pro: The Trump administration has made clear through various statements and actions that it considers NATO "[obsolete](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/donald-trump-times-bild-interview-takeaways/index.html)" and that it is [unwilling to explicitly commit](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/trump-declines-to-affirm-natos-article-5/528129/) to its alliance obligations.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Donald Trump has suggested that the United States [pull out](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html) of NATO.
1.4.5.2. Pro: The Trump administration has decided to significantly cut its contribution to NATO's budget from [22% to 16%](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/27/politics/trump-nato-contribution-nato/index.html).
1.4.5.3. Con: The Trump administration's concerns were primarily about the distribution of the alliance's budget - this concern has been [present on and off](https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/global-challenges/lloyd-nato-still-relevant-in-a-dangerous-world.html) throughout NATO's history, even during the height of the Cold War. Therefore, it probably is not as big of a problem as it seems to be.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: Barack Obama, too, [complained](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/) during his time in office about free riding partners who contribute little and "aggravate me".
1.4.5.4. Con: These statements cannot be read as representative of a coherent and persistent attitude towards NATO. President Trump himself emphasized this in 2017 when he [stated](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/13/us/politics/trump-policy-reversals-quotes.html) that "It’s no longer obsolete.”
1.4.6. Con: France, more than 40 years after leaving, [re-joined](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7948133.stm) the NATO military command in 2009. This indicates that France does care about NATO, and more so than in the past.
1.4.7. Con: The public in member countries generally has a [favorable opinion](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/02/09/nato-seen-favorably-across-member-states/) of NATO.
1.4.7.1. Pro: In a 2017 survey conducted across 12 NATO countries, an average of [61%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/09/nato-is-seen-favorably-in-many-member-countries-but-almost-half-of-americans-say-it-does-too-little/) supported the alliance.
1.4.7.2. Con: In a survey, [48%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/09/nato-is-seen-favorably-in-many-member-countries-but-almost-half-of-americans-say-it-does-too-little/) of Americans said "NATO does not do enough to help solve world problems". This shows that they are unsatisfied with NATO's performance.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: This does not preclude a favorable opinion of NATO in the US: As the [cited article](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/09/nato-is-seen-favorably-in-many-member-countries-but-almost-half-of-americans-say-it-does-too-little/) argues, six in ten Americans see it in a positive light.
1.4.7.3. Pro: Since all of them are democracies, this implies that these countries do actually care.
1.4.7.4. Con: A favorable perception does not necessarily mean that NATO has not become obsolete for practical matters.
1.5. Pro: The reasons for which NATO was created no longer exist.
1.5.1. Pro: NATO was created as a defense against the [Soviet Union](https://www.futurity.org/is-nato-obsolete-1493682/), which no longer exists.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Not only does the Soviet Union not exist anymore, but some countries that [emerged out of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union#Union_Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union) are now members of NATO, that is: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: This does not imply that NATO is obsolete but rather the opposite since the three Baltic countries today face [persistent agression and interference](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2779.html) from Russia.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The perception of NATO in the three Baltic countries [has been described](https://warontherocks.com/2019/10/the-breakaways-a-retrospective-on-the-baltic-road-to-nato/) as that of an "existential necessity".
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Beyond that, with [Georgia](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/west-georgia-nato/586225/) and [Ukraine](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/does-zelenskyys-ukraine-still-want-to-join-nato/), two other former Soviet Republics are actively trying to join NATO.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Both countries rather point to the ongoing relevance of NATO since they have been victims of Russian aggression in the recent past.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: According to the Georgian government, Russia continues to [effectively occupy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/russia-is-still-occupying-20percent-of-our-country-georgias-leader-says.html) 20% of the country's territory.
1.5.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: In 2014, Russia [annexed](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/annexation-crimea-masterclass-political-manipulation-190315174459207.html) the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and has since integrated it into the Russian Federation.
1.5.1.2. Pro: A large chunk of the former Soviet Union today has even quite close relations with NATO. With the exception of Russia, the countries that emerged out of [all former Soviet Republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union#Union_Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union) are today considered [as partners](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/51288.htm) by NATO.
1.5.1.3. Con: NATO's purpose is not tied to the existence of the Soviet Union, but to threats to transatlantic security. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, these threats continue to exist.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: [The North Atlantic Treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm), which marks the legal basis of NATO, does not mention the Soviet Union; it rather refers to defense against any armed attack on a member country as the purpose of NATO.
1.5.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.5.1.4. Con: Even though the Soviet Union does not exist anymore, Russia continues to pose a threat. NATO acts as a necessary deterrent to Russian aggression.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Russia continues to be a military great power.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Russia is one of the few countries that possesses [nuclear weapons](https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/russia/nuclear/).
1.5.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Russia has comparable nuclear technologies to and actually possesses [more warheads](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat) than the United States.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The difference in the number of nuclear warheads possessed by Russia and the USA is [negligible](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat) enough for it to impact their decisions about going to war with one another.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If a nuclear war between Russia and the United States broke out, it would be extremely devastating for both countries. Therefore, they have an incentive to avoid conflict.
1.5.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Russian navy has acquired new Borey-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines \([SSBNs](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/03/project-955a-borei-a-ssbn-to-reinforce-russian-navy-pacific-fleet/)\).
1.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: According to Michael Kofman of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, "By [2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40428132), Russia had reorganised its armed forces from a Soviet-era mass mobilisation based army into a permanent standing force."
1.5.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: [Standing armies](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Bk7wAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=Standing+armies+tend+to+be+better+equipped,+better+trained,+and+better+prepared+for+emergencies,+defensive+deterrence,+and+particularly,+wars&source=bl&ots=U6DXQN24yt&sig=ACfU3U2Ii7tDU0sYZYHDqXdC30yLKiIb9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ-OejtqLpAhV7C2MBHQ1qD_8Q6AEwC3oECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Standing%20armies%20tend%20to%20be%20better%20equipped%2C%20better%20trained%2C%20and%20better%20prepared%20for%20emergencies%2C%20defensive%20deterrence%2C%20and%20particularly%2C%20wars&f=false) are better equipped, better trained, and are more war-ready than other armies \(p. 64\).
1.5.1.4.1.3. Pro: Russia's military is able to cause a [significant amount](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40428132) of damage to a technologically superior NATO in a high-intensity conflict.
1.5.1.4.1.4. Pro: Russia continues to have the world's [fourth largest military](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.TOTL.P1?most_recent_value_desc=true), with more military personnel than in any NATO member country.
1.5.1.4.1.4.1. Con: The United States, a member of NATO, has an advantage over Russia since it has the [third largest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264443/the-worlds-largest-armies-based-on-active-force-level/) military in the world in terms of the number of military personnel.
1.5.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Russia has more [tanks](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-says-it-has-more-tanks-any-nation-world-705599) than any other country.
1.5.1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: After the end of the Cold War, most European countries reduced their [tank capabilities](https://www.dw.com/en/the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-russias-military/a-43293017) since they were not effective at combating guerilla and terrorist groups. If NATO were to have a ground war against Russia, NATO would be at a great disadvantage.
1.5.1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: The number of tanks Russia possesses \(approximately 20,000\) is higher than the number of tanks possessed by [all NATO countries combined](https://www.theweek.co.uk/the-week-unwrapped/104574/nato-vs-russia-who-would-win).
1.5.1.4.1.5. Con: Russian combative military equipment is largely outdated.
1.5.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: The last destroyer Russia acquired was back in the [1990s](https://asiatimes.com/2019/06/russia-is-still-the-weakest-of-the-great-powers/).
1.5.1.4.1.5.2. Pro: A significant amount of Russian military equipment is still upgrades of [Soviet-era weaponry](https://asiatimes.com/2019/06/russia-is-still-the-weakest-of-the-great-powers/) and not the latest state of the art weaponry.
1.5.1.4.1.5.3. Con: Russia has unveiled a new modern tank, the [T-14 Armata](https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/42688), one of the few 4th-generation tanks in the world.
1.5.1.4.1.5.4. Con: Russia is in the process of developing the [Sukhoi Su-57](https://zeenews.india.com/india/russia-offers-sukhoi-su-57-the-5th-generation-stealth-fighter-to-iaf-yet-again-2218434.html), a 5th-generation stealth fighter, in collaboration with India.
1.5.1.4.1.6. Con: Russia is lacking in areas of modern surveillance by having outdated [radar and satellite reconnaissance](https://www.dw.com/en/the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-russias-military/a-43293017) technology.
1.5.1.4.1.6.1. Pro: Russia has to rely on an [Israeli license](https://theintercept.com/2019/07/16/syria-war-israel-russia-drones/) to produce surveillance drones.
1.5.1.4.1.7. Con: Russia lacks capabilities in numerous areas.
1.5.1.4.1.7.1. Pro: The Russian military is comparatively weak in terms of [force projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection). It has a [single aircraft carrier](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-russia-doesnt-or-have-many-aircraft-carriers-115196) which has suffered from repeated breakdowns and failures.
1.5.1.4.1.7.1.1. Con: This rationale [is flawed](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/no-russia-doesnt-need-aircraft-carriers-126231). Russia doesn't need aircraft carriers to pursue its immediate interests and to be a threat; instead, it can rely one some of the world's best submarines.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: No other major country has in recent decades been as aggressive as Russia and engaged in de-facto territorial conquest.
1.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.2.
1.5.1.4.3. Con: Russia is far less powerful and wealthy than NATO's major members.
1.5.1.4.3.1. Pro: Data has shown that, in 2016, NATO's military spending was greater than Russia's by almost [12 times](http://natowatch.org/newsbriefs/2017/nato-military-spending-over-12-times-more-russia-2016-sipri-data-shows).
1.5.1.4.3.2. Pro: In [2017](https://www.euronews.com/2018/05/02/nato-military-spending-continues-to-dwarf-that-of-russia), Russia spent 4.3% of its GDP on defense. In contrast, the United States spent nearly 10 times as much.
1.5.1.4.3.3. Pro: Its [economy](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/) is smaller than those of Italy and Canada and less than half the size of Germany's.
1.5.1.4.3.4. Con: Although Russia does not have a large economy, it is able to exert a [greater political influence](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/04/28/why-russia-is-economically-weak-and-politically-strong/) on the world than most NATO member states.
1.5.1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Russia was able to interfere in the [2016](https://time.com/5825061/senate-report-russia-interference/) presidential elections of the United States, widely considered to be the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world.
1.5.2. Con: Other political alliances are constantly evolving in terms of their aims and collective goals. NATO's relevance should not considered to be bound to its founding aims.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The [European Economic Community](https://www.britannica.com/topic/European-Union/Creation-of-the-European-Economic-Community) was amalgamated into the European Union, in spite of the fact that the latter was much more than a purely economic union.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The United Nations, an organization dating back to the mid-20th century, adopted the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html) as late as 2015.
1.5.2.3. Con: Unlike these other alliances, NATO was a military alliance formed in response to a specific geopolitical moment - there is no meaningful purpose to it existing past the end of said moment.
1.5.3. Pro: NATO was created to fend off armed attacks. This threat does not exist anymore.
1.5.3.1. Pro: There has been no war in Western Europe or the United States since 1945.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The [United States](https://www.gettysburgflag.com/history-of-american-wars) and [Western European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe#Ongoing_conflicts) countries have fought wars after 1945. Therefore, they need to be prepared for them.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: Europe has seen long periods of relative peace before, for example the century [between the Napoleonic Wars and the First World War](https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/peaceful-war-was-the-19th-century-a-time-of-relative-peace/). History shows that these periods don't necessarily predict the future, and that the conflict and violence that follow can be worse than ever before.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: The peace experienced in Europe in the past century is [incomparable](https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/peaceful-war-was-the-19th-century-a-time-of-relative-peace/) to the peace of the 19th century - in that time, Europe went through the Crimean War, the Wars of Italian Unification, the Wars of German Unification, the Prusso-Austrian war, and the German-French wars.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The recent past as well as the present state of the world suggest that major war is [highly unlikely](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=AfaVqo2-ff0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dangerous+Times?:+The+International+Politics+of+Great+Power+Peace&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioj6-_w6DpAhUBfnAKHVH-CTQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Dangerous%20Times%3F%3A%20The%20International%20Politics%20of%20Great%20Power%20Peace&f=false). Today, warfare in its classic sense has become "[obsolescent, if not obsolete](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00223433030405001)".
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Today, armed conflicts take place predominantly within states, whereas conflicts between states [have largely vanished](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Dupuy%2C%20Rustad-%20Trends%20in%20Armed%20Conflict%2C%201946%E2%80%932017%2C%20Conflict%20Trends%205-2018.pdf) since NATO was created.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: Conflicts between states and within states cannot be clearly separated anymore.
1.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Russia's intervention in Ukraine from 2014 onwards came [in the form of](https://theconversation.com/dont-call-it-a-civil-war-ukraines-conflict-is-an-act-of-russian-aggression-46280) an instigated rebel uprising and civil war there.
1.5.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many international rivalries between countries - such as the US and China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia - now operate in the form of [proxy wars](https://dailytimes.com.pk/280097/understanding-proxy-wars/), where these powers fund and support local groups rather than directly militarily intervening in conflicts.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: Research in 2016 found that countries have begun to spend more on their militaries and [upgrading them](https://warisboring.com/after-years-of-military-decline-the-world-is-now-re-arming/), implying that they do not believe that conventional warfare is necessarily obsolete.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: Since the cost of war is high, people are unlikely to re-elect governments that go to war. Therefore, governments have an active incentive to avoid war.
1.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: Wars tend to have devastating [economic costs](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/2180/economics/economic-impact-of-war/). Therefore, states are unlikely to go to war.
1.5.3.2.3.2. Pro: An alarmingly high number of [people](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human), both soldiers and civilians, tend to die in majors wars.
1.5.3.2.3.3. Con: The fact that no US President has ever [lost](https://medium.com/\@wsonn/no-u-s-president-has-ever-blown-re-election-during-wartime-7648e5413638) re-election during wartime means the people wanted to support their presidents during wartime.
1.5.3.2.3.4. Con: Many authoritarian regimes, such as North Korea, are not democracies. Therefore, they have no threat of re-election.
1.5.3.2.3.4.1. Con: There is only a degree to which dictators can disregard public will. Otherwise, they run the risk of an [uprising](https://www.google.com/search?q=dictators+are+resilient+to+public+pressure&oq=dictators+are+resilient+to+public+pressure&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l3j69i60l3.7217j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) against them.
1.5.3.2.3.4.2. Pro: Dictators are able to stop the application of public pressure by using force to suppress [protests](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-to-topple-a-dictator/).
1.5.3.3. Con: The fact that [global military expenditures](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion) have been rising for more than two decades indicates that warfare remains a latent possibility. Otherwise, countries would not continue to prepare for it.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: This rise in expenditure is also [spread across](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion) multiple powers in different continents - the USA, China, India, and Russia being prominent examples - implying that the possibility of war is global.
1.5.3.4. Con: Animosity between countries could and has led to armed attacks.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: The United States and Iran have had a hostile relationship which has led to armed attacks between the two.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: The USA and Iran are fighting a [proxy war](https://globalsecurityreview.com/yemen-iran-proxy-war/) in Yemen.
1.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: Iran-backed militias attacked the [US embassy](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/26/politics/rocket-hits-us-embassy-compound-baghdad/index.html) in Baghdad.
1.5.3.4.1.3. Con: In 2020, the United States has expressed interest to carry out [negotiations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51043559) with Iran in order to maintain peace.
1.5.3.4.1.4. Pro: The American withdrawal from the [Iran nuclear deal](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-withdrawal-iran-nuclear-deal-has-been-vindicated-ncna1003091) illustrates the degree of suspicion and the volatility of relations between the two countries.
1.5.3.4.1.5. Con: In spite of this handful of attacks and high tensions, the US and Iran have not actually engaged in open war.
1.5.3.4.1.6. Pro: Concerns of a possible armed conflict between the United States and Iran arose as the United States killed an [Iranian General](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/after-soleimani-killing-iran-us-tension-shifts-to-new-level/1718766) in Iraq.
1.5.3.4.1.6.1. Con: It was unlikely that the killing of Soleimani would lead to escalation since Iran has a [history](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/03/iran-loses-its-imperial-strategist-093175) of not aggravating conflict against tough-minded, unpredictable presidents like Donald Trump.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: Tensions between the USA and North Korea could escalate and lead to armed conflict.
1.5.3.4.2.1. Pro: North Korea has threatened to use nuclear weapons against the USA in the [past](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35741936). This gives the USA a justification to attack North Korea in [preemptive self-defense](https://www.e-ir.info/2016/09/03/preemptive-self-defense-customary-international-law-and-the-congolese-wars/).
1.5.3.4.2.2. Pro: The USA has accused North Korea of conducting [cyber attacks](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2020/04/16/US-warns-North-Korean-cyberattacks-threaten-financial-system/5021587001193/) against many countries, including the USA, to fund their weapons program. In retaliation, the USA could use force against North Korea.
1.5.3.4.2.3. Pro: North Korea has warned the USA that there will [severe consequences](https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-us-running-out-of-time-to-restart-talks-2019-11) if the USA continues joint military drills with South Korea.
1.5.3.4.2.4. Con: President [Trump](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2020/02/03/479798/approach-north-korea-problem-2020/) has consistently indicated that he wants to have good relations with North Korea. It is unlikely that tensions will spiral into conflict.
1.5.3.4.2.5. Con: The closeness of [China](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-north-korea-relationship) to North Korea \(both geographically and diplomatically\) makes it unlikely that the United States will seek conflict.
1.5.3.4.3. Con: In recent years, animosity between countries has never led to open war. At most, it has led to minor skirmishes and strikes. Hence, the scale of violence has not been very high.
1.5.4. Con: NATO's role evolved after the end of the Cold War.
1.5.4.1. Pro: NATO's role in 1991 was considered to be to 'preserve the strategic balance in Europe.' \([p. 6](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/reportch1.pdf)\)
1.5.4.2. Pro: NATO attempted to foster stability in Europe after the Cold War through programs such as '[Partnership for Peace](http://origins.osu.edu/article/natos-new-order-alliance-after-cold-war/page/0/1).'
1.5.4.3. Pro: President Trump has floated the possibility of expanding NATO to include the [Middle East](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-nato/trump-floats-expanding-nato-to-add-middle-east-idUSKBN1Z82D4).
1.5.4.4. Con: The evolution of NATO's role indicates that it no longer has any true identity, and has just become a catch-all organization that adapts to the whims of its powerful members.
1.6. Con: NATO is critical to preserving peace in Europe.
1.6.1. Pro: Europe has gone from being one of the [most violent](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/mattis-right-heres-nato-not-obsolete) areas in the world to among the least violent since the creation of NATO.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Only two significant incidences of violence have occurred since the creation of NATO - the [1974 Turkish occupation](http://www.rulac.org/browse/conflicts/military-occupation-of-cyprus-by-turkey) of Cyprus, and the [civil war](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17632399) following the break up of Yugoslavia in the early 90s.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: In the case of Yugoslavia, NATO was instrumental in preventing the spread of the war and in halting a potential [genocide](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/mattis-right-heres-nato-not-obsolete).
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: NATO's [bombing](https://balkaninsight.com/2013/03/25/number-of-victims-of-nato-bombing-still-unknown/) of Yugoslavia killed thousands of people and destroyed civilian infrastructure.
1.6.1.2. Con: The pacification of Europe can be explained through a variety of other developments, besides the existence of NATO.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: The European Union has been much more significant than NATO in making its member countries interdependent, in providing them with a shared interest in maintaining peace, and in tightening relations among them.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: European integration and the European Union have been interpreted as a "[solution to war](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066105050138)" and as a means of assuring European countries of each other's commitment to maintaining peace.
1.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: The European Union, just like NATO, is - among other things - a defensive alliance. An attack on one member country obliges all other members countries to come to its aid, as enshrined in the [Treaty on European Union, Article 42/7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012M/TXT&from=DE).
1.6.1.2.1.3. Pro: The maintenance of peace is seen as one of the [norms](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=316064) that underpin the European Union and an inherent expression of peaceful intent. The same cannot be said about NATO since it has an [inherent connection](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/02/nato-matters-but-the-eu-matters-more/) to the idea of war.
1.6.1.2.1.4. Con: NATO and the EU [cooperate](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/28286/eu-nato-cooperation-factsheet_en) on so many issues and have such a heavy overlap in membership that trying to credit one to the exclusion of the other is an impossible exercise.
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: Peace in Europe can also be attributed to the region's economic and trade integration, to the subsequent interdependence of its countries, and the idea of a "[capitalist peace](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122913?seq=1)".
1.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: European countries are important [trading partners](http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=5034) of one another. To secure their trade, European countries have an incentive to ensure their trading partners do not go to war.
1.6.1.2.2.2. Con: Much of this trade integration was only possible because the threat of war was reduced by the existence of NATO.
1.6.1.2.3. Con: None of these other developments are [as direct as NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/opinions_170606.htm) has been, acting as it did as a political alliance which promised to preserve peace and prevent conflict. All other developments rest upon the bedrock of this foundational alliance.
1.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: The predecessor of the EU, the European Economic Community, was comprised entirely of [NATO member states](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/07/16/strengthening-eu-nato-relations/index.html).
