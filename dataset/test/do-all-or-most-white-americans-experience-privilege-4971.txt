Discussion Name: Do all or most White Americans experience privilege?

1. All or most White Americans living in the U.S. today experience privileges exclusive only to whites.
1.1. Con: White Americans, too, experience disadvantages because of their skin color.
1.1.1. Con: The disadvantages that white Americans experience in some areas because of their skin color are outweighed by the large privileges they experience in general.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Scientific studies have shown that dark skin is negatively stereotyped as being associated with low education [\(Evidence for Skin Tone Memory Bias\)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244013516770) as well as with greater liklihood of criminality [\("Bad" is Black Effect\).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27856725)
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Indians have dark skin and this is not the stereotype for Indians.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Other social cues such as dress and speech can strongly correlate education and skills. This goes much further beyond race and can be used to judge whites as well. The difference is, blacks and latinos are far more likely to demonstrate a certain dress and communication skills due to culture.
1.1.2. Pro: White pride is considered shameful while African American or Latino pride is praised.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The lack of main stream media coverage of the [Black Power Militia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S01Mb5F1bik) indicates African American pride is praised.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: There's an overwhelming number of examples where the mainstream media [villifies black dignity](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-news-tucker-carlson-black-lives-matter-poison_n_5efeda0ec5b612083c59df1c?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGVXtrjgAUBFz2NBGf818NTD4ht-mY4LN6BLoRrhUmlIZZqcJRURrDAtKfv9orVH4c-n-YYuOrmxLU5uIFDc9oY6FHkWZmQw26a5vLZf-f5e-gOCMUn9uWcd3-XJucnlRK7WmDNIRb4YTTKlDTqbsFhLqzk-_UexDC73uw6ufncD), much less even black pride.
1.1.2.2. Con: That's because white pride makes no sense. What is white culture? What are you proud of? [African Americans have a very specific culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture#:~:text=African%2DAmerican%20identity%20was%20established,African%2DAmericans'%20ancestral%20culture.) of music, visual art, dance, etc. Its not African culture because many aspects of their culture originated here, within the black community here. Latino is an ethnicity which also directly relates to culture. White is simply a race with no real cultural background. American pride is reasonable. Irish pride is reasonable etc. But white pride is just nonsensical
1.1.2.3. Pro: The '[It's OK To Be White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_OK_to_be_white)' campaign received a negative reaction from the university in which it was based and in the media.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The explicit purpose of the campaign was to provoke outrage, thereby further inflaming race relations in the US. It was rejected against that background.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: It has always been ok to be white, and by pretending the opposite, the campaign created a false equivalence with the people who do actually suffer racial discrimination.
1.1.2.4. Con: African-American/Latino pride is different from White Pride, as for centuries they have been shamed about their heritage while white/European heritage was celebrated. African-American pride celebrates the fact that after centuries of racism and slavery, they are allowed the freedom to express their culture.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: Historically, American society has at times attacked some "white" cultures as well: [Freedomfries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_fries#:~:text=Freedom%20fries%20was%20a%20politically,fries%20in%20the%20United%20States.) [German Americans](https://www.history.com/news/anti-german-sentiment-wwi)
1.1.2.5. Con: Non-white Americans are proud of their accomplishments *within the context of* predominantly white control of American power structures. Within that context, "white pride" is not only seen as bragging about the control, it also implies that white Americans are satisfied with \(proud of\) the [violent methods their ancestors used](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-shocking-savagery-of-americas-early-history-22739301/) to achieve the control.
1.1.2.6. Con: Even the most "white" cultures like English or Nordic people freely express cultural pride without backlash or shame. People shame white pride because "Whiteness" itself is arbitrary, as demonstrated in different times and places where Italian, Irish or Latin people have been considered "white" or "not white". Unlike geographical, family, historic and cultural groupings, one can't accept "whiteness" and "White pride" without accepting a racist point of view to define it.
1.1.3. Pro: Some jobs and scholarships one is excluded from simply due to being white. Here is just one [example](http://www.free-4u.com/affirmative_action_scholarship1.htm).
1.1.4. Pro: Some whites say they also [experience racism](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/24/559604836/majority-of-white-americans-think-theyre-discriminated-against).
1.1.5. Pro: When white people do not implicitly agree with a belief of someone of another race, they are easily called "racist."
1.1.6. Con: The advantages received by white people can often be so minute that it's difficult to realize that they're even there.
1.1.6.1. Con: This concedes the point that white people receive discrimination based on their skin color.
1.1.7. Pro: White Americans are oftentimes excluded from conversations about race.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Minorities get a pass, socially, for racism, e.g. black comedians in white face, while asserting they cannot be racist.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Prominent black comedians like Dave Chappelle, Eddy Murphy, and the Wayans Brothers have exhibited white face to caricature white people without the public disapproval one might expect from a white actor portraying a minority.
1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: Chappelle & Murphy's white face jokes targeted racists, not white people in general, as shown by their success with an audience of all colors. That comedy relies not on makeup but on the understanding of our society's history, and if there were no racism, black or white face would just be uncontroversial costumery. Black face is offensive to people who understand racism, minstrelsy, and negative stereotypes they've perpetuated where white face tells a different story.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: "White-face" is a bad example of socially acceptable racism because it lacks the historical requisites and context. For example, although there are many Jewish people who identify as white \(and Jews are considered by many to be white\), portrayals of Jewish people with exaggerated noses are still problematic because it does have that historical context, i.e. the Holocaust. It might still be considered offensive, but public backlash has - in part - a historical basis.
1.1.7.1.3. Pro: Hit Netflix shows like “[Dear White People](https://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/film-become-tv-series/)” addresses all whites and portray them as racist and privileged.
1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: "Dear White People" is [not a good counterexample](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/02/09/dear-white-people-trailer-sparks-backlash-netflix-faces-claims/) because there are many examples of backlash against the show. Thus, it does not refute the claim that historical basis plays a role in how likely the public is to be outraged at a depiction, and does not support the claim that depictions of white-face are immune to criticism.
1.1.7.1.3.1.1. Con: This article pertains to the trailer and to a minority of those who find it racist. Since it’s actual release, “dear white people” has become a critically acclaimed hit on Netflix and espouses ideology commonly held by millennials.
1.1.7.1.3.2. Con: White privilege \(arguably, implying racism\) is the thesis argument of this whole discussion, so the intellectually neutral interpretation that show's perspective, which is described in the parent, is that it might be right.
1.1.7.1.3.3. Con: The point of the show is to portray common examples of white privilege and racism, but most of the white characters are not disadvantaged by their privilege being called out, or even vilified for it. The non-white characters are also flawed in their own ways, and carry on friendships with most of those white characters who have benefited from racism and privilege.
1.1.7.1.3.4. Con: This is just one show among thousands, and almost all of them represent white people uncontroversially.
1.1.7.1.3.5. Con: The show has white people who all benefit from privilege and from racism, but this includes several very sympathetic white characters \(a boyfriend, a father\) who most people would not consider racist.
1.1.7.1.4. Pro: Although the Wayans Brothers movie “[White Chicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Chicks)” portray specific characters in white face as a disguise, the name implies its “valley girl” stereotype applies to most young white women. If a “Black Chicks” movie was made, in which two white men put on black face, there would be an uproar.
1.1.7.1.4.1. Con: "White Chicks" is about the privilege that white people are privy to - wealth, culture and relationships with other races. This is \(loosely\) explored throughout the movie and is a comment on the societal differences between African-American culture and white American culture.
1.1.7.1.4.2. Con: "White Chicks" is a comedic movie with the target market of an African-American audience. Black comedians frequently use the 'stupidity' of white culture in America to produce comedy that other black people will enjoy. For some people it is a way to fight back against the racism that they experience every day and that their ancestors experienced. However, if white comedians used black face to create comedy targeted at white people, it would be racist due to the historical significance.
1.1.7.1.5. Con: Blackface has a much longer history of propagandizing stereotypes of blacks in order to deny them equal rights in voting, employment, etc. "White-face" is only a reaction to satirize the practice. They are not remotely the same in terms of impact.
1.1.7.1.5.1. Pro: Blackface was used [historically](http://nmaahc.si.edu) to ridicule people of colour. Black comedians using whiteface now is not as offensive, as it is a comment on the continuing racism that is prevalent in American society.
1.1.7.2. Con: Needing to "walk on eggshells" around racial topics is not a form of real disadvantage. It could only affect people in liberal parts of the country, not conservative parts. It's anecdotal, and does not adversely effect social, political, or economic outcomes for White Americans.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Being shunned from discussion on racial topics is not only discriminatory by definition, it drives the “white privilege” myth by silencing whites who are not privileged.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: "Walking on eggshells" is not the same as "being shunned." Walking on eggshells describes the convention to be precise and careful in discussions about race. For example, if you say "minorities are poor because they're lazy," you have not "walked on eggshells" if you say "the culture surrounding certain members of minorities discourages academic success," you have been precise.
1.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Not allowing certain people to speak about a topic that pertains to them allows for myths to perpetuate, because there's no guarantee that people will be there to refute them.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Whites are [routinely shunned](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/03/why-no-long-talking-white-people-review-race-reni-eddo-lodge-racism) or barred from discussions of race and accusations of privilege.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: White people routinely participate in such discussions, and are only shunned if they [disregard the opinions](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/03/why-no-long-talking-white-people-review-race-reni-eddo-lodge-racism) of people who experience racism.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: Whites can often [lack empathy](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/06/racial_empathy_gap_people_don_t_perceive_pain_in_other_races.html) during race discussions.
1.1.7.3.3. Pro: Minorities often observe [white fragility](https://medium.com/s/story/how-white-people-handle-diversity-training-in-the-workplace-e8408d2519f) from Whites during race discussions, making progress in understanding difficult or nearly impossible.
1.1.7.4. Pro: It is common to dismiss contributions on the basis that because the person is not black or Hispanic etc., that person cannot fully comprehend the ethnic minority experience. If that were true, a person of color could not possibly understand the white experience in order to assert that white privilege exists.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: Being a member of the racial group is necessary to understand the discussion about race.
1.1.7.4.1.1. Con: White Americans can empathise with the racism faced by people of colour, particularly because the topic is prominent in the media.
1.1.7.4.1.2. Pro: For example, it is hard to understand why being called a derogatory name for that group is insulting if you have not encountered it used in an upsetting or threatening way.
1.1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: Anti-racist activism has included white people, who gain a greater understanding of racism through their involvement.
1.1.7.4.1.2.2. Con: A white American can use their own experience of racism \(e.g. being called a 'honky' or not being eligible for scholarships based on race\) to understand the racism ethnic minorities face.
1.1.7.4.2. Pro: 'Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race' is a [highly influential](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/03/why-no-long-talking-white-people-review-race-reni-eddo-lodge-racism?) book that suggests black people should not talk to white people about race if they have different opinions about extent or severity of racism.
1.1.7.5. Con: This blanket claim can be rejected by example. White people, for example [Bill O'Reilly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/12/21/bill-oreilly-becomes-spokesman-for-white-america/?utm_term=.d35e14ead203), share their opinions all the time.
1.1.7.6. Con: Not all white people think and act the same when it comes to race.
1.2. Con: There are no policies or laws that directly favor white Americans over others.
1.2.1. Pro: White Americans are excluded from certain programs - such as diversity initiatives - whereas minority members, independent of their social and economic status, have access to them.
1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Corporations invest in those programs even though they are [ineffective](https://theconversation.com/tech-companies-spend-big-money-on-bias-training-but-it-hasnt-improved-diversity-numbers-44411) in achieving their goal. Thus it makes no sense from a market perspective but must be motivated by ideology.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: It's less motivated by ideology and more motivated by the desire to maintain a positive public image to ensure profit margins and share prices don't plummet - corporate institutions tend to invest in whatever training programmes are popular at the time.
1.2.1.3. Con: A diversity program is just one more gateway to more important things that are already inclusive of white people \(for various reasons described throughout this discussion\). People want to get hired, not specifically to be a "diversity" hire, and the trend is that white people are still getting hired, getting into school, etc.
1.2.2. Pro: There are affirmative action laws that discriminate by race in favor of people who are not white or Asian American. Arguably this is for the benefit of society, but disadvantages individuals nonetheless.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Black university applicants receive a [230 point bonus](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html) on their SAT score compared to whites. Asians are penalized 50 points.
1.2.2.2. Con: White Americans occupy a disproportionate share of powerful positions in the US.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: White journalists and decision-makers are over-represented in the media.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: At major newspapers like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, white journalists and leaders are [over-represented](https://googletrends.github.io/asne/?filter=race&view=0) in relation to the demographics of the outlet's audience. Barely any newspapers have a representative staff.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: This disparity is not a result of discrimination, nor does it show that it encourages discrimination. If white Americans happen to have better qualifications and merit, then it will lead to these results.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: Statistics show that [African Americans and Latinos](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tgb.asp) achieve poorer academic results and pursue positions for which Affirmative Action is deemed necessary less frequently.
1.2.2.2.4. Con: A higher percentage of whites in positions is not a bad thing if they are performing their job well.
1.2.2.2.5. Con: No one has suggested that the NBA needs to institute Affirmative Action policies, despite [75](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_NBA)% of its players being black.
1.2.2.2.6. Con: Asians make up a large percentage of STEM and upper-level positions
1.2.2.2.7. Pro: [Three out of four](http://fortune.com/2017/06/09/white-men-senior-executives-fortune-500-companies-diversity-data/) senior executives at American Fortune 500 companies are white. In relation to the work force as a whole, they are therefore over-represented by 15%.
1.2.2.2.7.1. Con: This is not an unequivocal sign of white privilege. Asian executives are also over-represented [by 10%](http://fortune.com/2017/06/09/white-men-senior-executives-fortune-500-companies-diversity-data/).
1.2.2.2.8. Pro: American politics features white people to a disproportionate extent.
1.2.2.2.8.1. Pro: White people are over-represented in Congress [by almost 20%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/24/115th-congress-sets-new-high-for-racial-ethnic-diversity/) in relation to their share among the population.
1.2.2.2.8.2. Pro: As of 2018, of the 50 American governors, [47 are white](http://governors.rutgers.edu/on-governors/us-governors/fast-facts-about-american-governors/).
1.2.2.2.9. Pro: At American tech giants like [Google](https://diversity.google/commitments/), [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/02/facebook-diversity-numbers.html) and [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/growingtogetherattwitter.html), white Americans - together with Asians - make up a disproportionate share of the workforce.
1.2.2.2.9.1. Con: This is an argument against the idea of white Americans being uniquely privileged. Within America's tech giants, Asian Americans are over-represented while white workers are not.
1.2.2.3. Con: When discussing affirmative action policies, we have to think in general terms. Unfortunately, it is not feasible for a given college/university to look at every individual student's case. This means that students \(in some capacity\) must be "simplified." Most simplifications are based on standardized test scores. Data shows that Black & Hispanic students generally perform worse on these tests \([racial bias in tests](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/11/the-bias-question/302825/)\). Affirmative action helps mitigate this racial bias.
1.2.3. Con: The entire history of policy in the United States has favored whites over people of color. Even in the modern day, when overt discrimination is illegal, de facto discrimination is still systematized.
1.2.3.1. Con: This thread is about the modern day. There are no longer discriminatory laws or policies. There are many laws and policies which make discrimination illegal.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: History affects the present: if someone is discriminated against in the past, it affects their future due to how society perceives them and their lack of past success.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Discrimination in the past which prevented minorities buying property as easily as white Americans mean they are less likely to inherit assets at the same level as white people because their ancestors had fewer assets to pass down.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: If discrimination in the past was a major factor, then all formerly marginalized groups should still be disadvantaged. However Asian Americans, who have been arguably more marginalized in more recent history, have the [highest](https://www.financialsamurai.com/income-by-race-why-is-asian-income-so-high/) average household income.
1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Immigrants from Asia are presumably the wealthiest [from their respective countries.](https://www.financialsamurai.com/income-by-race-why-is-asian-income-so-high/)
1.2.3.1.2. Con: There are plenty of discriminatory policies still in place. And lax enforcement of anti-discrimination laws exacerbates the problem.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Schools are still [largely segregated](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/06/schools-are-more-segregated-today-than-during-the-late-1960s/258348/), just for different reasons than in the past.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Housing is [still segregated](https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2018-04-20/us-is-still-segregated-even-after-fair-housing-act).
1.2.4. Con: There are [long-practiced informal policies](https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2016/systemic-racism-is-real) that advantage white Americans in important areas such as housing, lending, education and law enforcement.
1.2.4.1. Pro: It has been shown that if two CVs are submitted to a company with identical qualifications but one with a 'white' name and the other with a ‘black’ name, the white sounding name will [get the job offer](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/jalen-ross/black-name-resume-50-percent-less-likely-get-respo/) more frequently.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: A name is a strong indicator of one’s upbringing. Many names are considered lower-class, and suggest growing up in a hostile environment and culture. This does not have anything to do with skin color.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Aside from class and culture, a name can also indicate the education level of your family. It doesn’t make it right, but it does not have to do with racism.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Names reflect class. Names like “Billy Bob” or “Jeb” are also often over-looked. This is a class issue, not race.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Black students are three times more likely to be suspended than white students, [even when their infractions are similar](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-discipline-snapshot.pdf). Overall, black students represent 16% of student enrollment and 27% of students referred to law enforcement.
1.2.4.3. Pro: People of color are told about and shown [fewer homes and apartments](http://www.demos.org/blog/9/5/14/top-10-white-families-own-almost-everything) than whites.
1.2.5. Con: Even without discriminatory laws, decision-makers can find other pretexts to bring about racially unjust outcomes.
1.2.6. Con: Poor white, first-generation college students are provided extra benefits along side of federally-protected minority groups through the [TRIO programs](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/triomcnair/eligibility.html). These programs actively recruit and advantage white students.
1.2.6.1. Con: TRiO programs are not just for white people, they serve low-income and first-generation college students, and [in recent history have served more minorities](http://www.pellinstitute.org/downloads/trio_clearinghouse-Racial_and_Ethnic_Diversity_in_the_FTP.pdf).
1.2.7. Con: White students are [disproportionately advantaged](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/6/20/admissions-docs-legacy/) by "legacy" student policies. These "legacy" students' families had access to college when many people of color were barred from attending these colleges.
1.3. Pro: Non-whites are systemically excluded from power-holding institutions.
1.3.1. Con: The number of non-whites in American government is [increasing every new election period](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/24/115th-congress-sets-new-high-for-racial-ethnic-diversity/).
1.3.1.1. Con: A rising trend of nonwhites in government is not counterevidence against White Privilege. The number of nonwhites in US government has in general been rising since the beginning of the nation even during periods, when White Privilege was legally protected. A rising trend of nonwhites would be evidence at the most, that White Privilege is waning.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The share of non-white members in the legislative assembly rose from [0% in 1619](https://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/the-first-legislative-assembly.htm) over [2.4% in 1875](https://history.house.gov/People/) to [22.4% in the 116th US Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/116th_United_States_Congress) as of 2019.
1.3.1.3. Con: This does not invalidate the parent argument.
1.3.2. Pro: About 60% of Americans identify as white, yet [about eight in ten](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/these-two-graphics-show-the-lack-of-diversity-in-the-house-and-senate.html) members of Congress are white.
1.3.2.1. Con: In the House of Representatives, the share of Black members [is about equal](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/22/black-americans-have-made-gains-in-u-s-political-leadership-but-gaps-remain/) to Black American's share of the country's total population.
1.3.2.2. Con: Congress is not necessarily representative of all institutions. In [about half the state legislatures](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/15/902811982/black-representation-in-politics-is-poor-nationwide-except-in-state-houses), the share of Black members is on the level or above the Black share of the population.
1.4. Pro: White Americans are privileged because they do not experience the ramifications of [racial trauma](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-american-tragedy-the-legacy-of-slavery-lingers-in-our-cities-ghettos/) that continue to affect Black Americans.
1.4.1. Pro: Despite the signing of [four civil rights acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act) prior to the 60's \(when civil rights were indisputably still an issue\), and the civil rights acts [that followed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act), discrimination and privilege are still a relevant issue. Legislation does not end white privilege on its own; it merely removes the legal endorsement of it.
1.4.2. Pro: European slavery \[1508-1888\], and The "Indian Wars" [\[1609–1924\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars) show that non-white exclusion was the norm even prior to the founding of the US. [Racial segregation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/03/21st-century-segregation-divided-race) persists today.
1.4.3. Pro: [Disenfranchisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenfranchisement_after_the_Reconstruction_Era) after the US Civil War, and racial gerrymandering \[[2017 in NC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting_in_North_Carolina#Cooper_v._Harris_\(2017\))\] aimed to keep non-whites from effectively exercising their right to vote, weakening their chances of attaining a political office. Today, there are [disproportionately few nonwhite lawmakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/these-two-graphics-show-the-lack-of-diversity-in-the-house-and-senate.html).
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.4. Con: Slavery was abolished by President [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/dec18/slavery-abolished/) - a White man.
1.4.5. Con: All White Americans should not be judged for the actions of some White Americans who contributed to racial oppression.
1.4.6. Con: Historically, the roles that White people and people of color have played in oppressive contexts are not as straightforward as commonly depicted.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Many White people, including White Americans, were [enslaved in North Africa](https://news.osu.edu/when-europeans-were-slaves--research-suggests-white-slavery-was-much-more-common-than-previously-believed/) between 1500 and 1800 AD. Given that both White people and people of color have both played the roles of oppressor and the oppressed in different contexts, categorizing all White Americans as "privileged" would be a hasty overgeneralization.
1.4.7. Pro: Unlike White Americans, Black Americans live with the traumatic repercussions of centuries of slavery, which was perpetrated by White Americans.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Dysfunctional behavior profiles that are prevalent among Black people are attributable to an underlying condition - [post-traumatic slave syndrome](https://www.joydegruy.com/post-traumatic-slave-syndrome), caused by centuries of slavery.
1.5. Pro: White Americans enjoy a more positive relationship with the police compared to people of other ethnicities.
1.5.1. Pro: The disparity between white and black Americans on average is evident. Black and White people [commit drug crimes at similar rates, yet black Americans are arrested 10x more for the crime](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/vortex.pdf).
1.5.2. Con: According to [this study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/04/27/this-study-found-race-matters-in-police-shootings-but-the-results-may-surprise-you/?utm_term=.2df77d0902c7), police take longer to make the decision to shoot a black suspect vs a white one.
1.5.2.1. Con: Evidence does not support this claim. On the contrary, there is [significant evidence](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/data-police-racial-bias) that shows bias against minorities.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Even in the presence of racial bias within the justice system, increased police presence would be warranted among higher crime areas, which, regardless of bias, would result in a higher rate of accidents in police shootings.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: That there are 18 studies cited points to a deeper problem. Such circular thinking would still result in more innocent AA people being shot unnecessarily.
1.5.3. Pro: While police brutality does affect people of all races, it does disproportionally target black and hispanic Americans.
1.5.3.1. Con: Every piece of evidence offered does not take into account the fact that classism is the major factor.
1.5.3.2. Con: The studies offered do not mention non-whites such as Indians, Asians, or Jews. It does not separate any data by income either. The evidence offered does not tell the whole story.
1.5.3.3. Con: This is a result of the lower crime rates among white Americans, not of skin color per se. Relative to their share among the total US population and compared to white Americans, Black Americans [commit a disproportionate share of crimes](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/tables/table-43) and are, therefore, disproportionately likely to get in trouble with the police and make negative experiences with law enforcement.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: There is actually [little correlation](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campaign-zero-debunks-police-killings-myth_us_5678c575e4b014efe0d6a2cd) between police abuse and crime levels.
1.5.3.3.2. Pro: Of the American population, 8% have a felony conviction and 3% have ever been to prison. Among Black Americans, these shares stand [at 33% and 15%](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-017-0611-1).
1.5.3.3.2.1. Con: This statistic could be [a result of](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/) police stopping black Americans' vehicles more often than other groups, searching their vehicles more often, arresting them more often and convicting them more often.
1.5.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Some studies show that among Americans driving at high speeds, black Americans [drive](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/nyregion/study-suggests-racial-gap-in-speeding-in-new-jersey.html) [at a higher speed](https://www.city-journal.org/html/racial-profiling-myth-debunked-12244.html) than whites.
1.5.3.3.3. Pro: Black Americans have a higher crime rate because they are more likely to be convicted of crimes then whites are for committing the same crimes. It is harsher treatment of black Americans by police and our criminal justice system that creates negative experiences between Black Americans and police.
1.5.3.3.3.1. Pro: White people are more likely to deal drugs, but black people are [more likely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/?utm_term=.694c9a42ba3f&noredirect=on) to get arrested for it.
1.5.3.3.4. Con: Crime rates are [correlated](https://financesonline.com/how-income-inequality-affects-crime-rates/) with economic factors more consistently than with abstract individual choice.
1.5.3.3.5. Con: Overwhelmingly, this is the result of the "drug war." White people are just as [likely, if not more so,](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/rates_of_drug_use_and_sales_by_race_rates_of_drug_related_criminal_justice) to use illegal drugs \(total and per capita\), yet the police spend their time in black neighborhoods looking for trouble. You can't become part a crime rate statistic when no police are there. Drug use and arrest stats by race
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.5.3.3.
1.5.5. Pro: Black Americans are [more likely](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/upshot/surprising-new-evidence-shows-bias-in-police-use-of-force-but-not-in-shootings.html) to be touched, pushed, handcuffed, threatened with guns as well as attacked with pepper spray and batons than white Americans in police encounters \(though they are not more likely to be shot\).
1.5.5.1. Con: Black Americans disproportionately live in poor areas which tend to have higher crime rates. Policing high crime areas means lots of interactions compared to safer areas. Also, poor areas tend towards broken families which means strong trends in physical violence and non-compliance with authority like police.
1.5.5.2. Con: [For every 10.000](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/upshot/surprising-new-evidence-shows-bias-in-police-use-of-force-but-not-in-shootings.html) stop-and-frisk, police are physical with blacks at a rate of 22%, and whites at a rate of 18%. These figures are well within what would be expected given racial differences in crime rates, likelihood to resist arrest [\(85% more likely\)](https://www.wnyc.org/story/resisting-arrest-black-white/) and hostile attitudes towards police \(just or unjust\).
1.5.6. Pro: James Comey, during his time as director of the FBI, [explicitly spoke](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/hard-truths-law-enforcement-and-race) about the "hard truths" of racial bias in American law enforcement.
1.5.7. Pro: According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the chance of being threatened with force, experiencing force, or even experiencing excessive force during a police encounter is [significantly higher](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/punf0211_sum.pdf) for Black Americans and Hispanics than for White Americans.
1.5.8. Pro: Many southern police forces were formed in order to track and [capture runaway slaves](http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-people-police). This rooted racial bias persisted after the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) outlawed discrimination based on race, and is often still seen today.
1.5.9. Con: [More](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/) [white people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/) are killed by police than any other race in the United States.
1.5.9.1. Con: White people make up [66.3%](http://statisticalatlas.com/United-States/Race-and-Ethnicity) of the population while black people make up [12.6%](http://statisticalatlas.com/United-States/Race-and-Ethnicity). It makes sense for the largest racial group in country to be more represented in racial statistics.
1.5.9.2. Con: [27%](http://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.diversityinc.com/data-police-disproportionately-killed-black-people-2017.amp) of people killed by police were black, despite the fact that black people only make up [12.6%](http://statisticalatlas.com/United-States/Race-and-Ethnicity) of the population.
1.5.9.2.1. Con: Yet, despite this, [African Americans make up](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-21) 53% of the arrests made in 2016 \(most recent available\) for Murder or non-negligent Manslaughter. 54% percent of robbery, 29% of rape, 33% of aggravated assault, 37% of violent crime, and 27% of arrests overall. All of these crimes carry a high likelihood to be met by force from Police officers.
1.5.9.2.1.1. Con: African Americans are often segregated into ghettos with more crime, less education, less resources, and [distrustful police](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/8/13/17938186/police-shootings-killings-racism-racial-disparities). Not to mention a history of discrimination and slavery. Crime is a predictable outcome in this environment.
1.5.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Continued Systemic Housing Discrimination](https://thinkprogress.org/federal-judge-guts-the-nationwide-ban-on-housing-discrimination-ad8a166dc397/) is usually the method by which modern segregation is perpetuated.
1.5.9.2.1.2. Con: [Studies repeatedly point to a biased justice system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/09/18/theres-overwhelming-evidence-that-the-criminal-justice-system-is-racist-heres-the-proof/?utm_term=.2a6d2b1a9658). This would be a predictable cause of the higher rate of arrest, and ultimately says nothing about African Americans' propensity towards crime, unless these biases are directly accounted for.
1.5.10. Pro: [Three out of four of Black Americans](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/HTML%20Reports/law-enforcement-and-violence-the-divide-between-black-and-white-americans0803-9759.aspx) report police violence as 'extremely or very serious problem' while only 20% of White Americans do.
1.5.10.1. Con: Opinions are not necessarily a correct reflection of reality.
1.5.10.1.1. Pro: These opinions are simply not supported [by the evidence](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/07/14/ignorance_of_facts_fuels_the_anti-cop_movement_131188.html).
1.5.10.1.1.1. Con: The study cited in the parent found no racial bias in police use of lethal force \(shooting\). [The study did however find that](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22399.pdf), after controlling for civilian behavior and other variables, "blacks are 21 percent more likely than whites to be involved in an interaction with police in which at least a weapon is drawn."
1.5.10.2. Con: Contributing to this factor is the high rate of violence in the African American community. Police have a statistically higher threat in these areas and more force is necessary.
1.6. Pro: White children experience privilege in school.
1.6.1. Pro: White Americans have the privilege of learning about American history, first and foremost, from the perspective of their own ancestors.
1.6.1.1. Con: Black history is [popular](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/publications/teaching-the-movement-2014/executive-summary) as a subject in public schools.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The Black History Month leads to special attention on the subject.
1.6.1.2. Pro: There have been reports of teachers engaging in questionable teaching activities, such as mock slave auctions, slavery math problems or slavery games \([King, p. 16](https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_810117014.pdf)\).
1.6.1.2.1. Con: "Questionable" is subjective. Many would argue these practices are an excellent way to learn history and empathy for slaves.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: Whether seen as a negative or positive, these are seldom practiced in schools.
1.6.1.2.3. Con: These reports provide merely anecdotal evidence that should not be used to generalize.
1.6.1.2.4. Con: Anecdotal evidence cannot be used to reflect society as a whole.
1.6.1.3. Pro: School curricula is often whitewashed.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: In curricula in fifteen American states, the Civil Rights Movement receives [little attention](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/publications/teaching-the-movement-2014/executive-summary); in five it is not covered or supported at all.
1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: Other studies emphasize that teachers across all fifty states generally consider Black History "as influential in understanding the complexity of U.S" \([King, p. 15](https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_810117014.pdf)\).
1.6.1.3.2. Con: In Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Mississippi, and Rhode Island, schools are legally obliged to teach Black history in school \([King, p. 16](https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_810117014.pdf)\).
1.6.1.3.3. Con: There is no "White" history class or month. American school history class is mostly about overall American or World history. There is no bias toward "white-ness" inherently within the taught material.
1.6.1.3.4. Pro: Some textbooks are whitewashed, for example the geography textbook [World Geography](http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article38697888.html) which describes the slave trade as 'immigration of workers'.
1.6.1.3.4.1. Con: The publisher has [apologized](https://daily.jstor.org/racism-history-textbooks/) for authorizing the description.
1.6.1.3.4.2. Con: One example does not prove that 'some textbooks' do this.
1.6.1.3.5. Pro: [The treatment of Native Americans](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1185828?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) is not extensively included in history textbooks.
1.6.1.3.6. Pro: Only 8-9 percent of class time is spent on Black American history \([King, p. 15](https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_810117014.pdf)\).
1.6.1.3.6.1. Con: That is a large percentage devoted to black history considering many factors including population, and the unchanging conditions of slavery for 400 years.
1.6.1.3.6.2. Pro: African-Americans were an enormous part of America's complete history and culture. The invention of jazz \(which ultimately led to rock, and pop\) completely changed the world, and African-Americans were one of the first discriminated cultures who led the way for other minorities to fight for their rights \(eg figures like Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass and Nat Turner\).
1.6.1.4. Con: There are other avenues for non-white people to learn about their history.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: There is an increasing number of museums dedicated to Black American history, such as the [National Museum of African American History and Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu).
1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: Slavery has received disproportionately little attention in the public sphere. America has "[more Holocaust museums](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/13/the-u-s-has-35000-museums-why-is-only-one-about-slavery/?utm_term=.7369685922f9) than Israel, Germany and Poland combined" - yet only a single one dedicated to the issue of slavery.
1.6.1.4.1.2. Con: This is only due to the fact that black history was not taught or acknowledged in the first place, and still leaves students of colour feeling left out of the curriculum.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Recent pop cultural trends give space to Black American history, for example in the forms of [12 Years a Slave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Years_a_Slave_\(film\)), [Selma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_\(film\)) and [Malcolm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X_\(1992_film\)).
1.6.1.4.3. Pro: History and culture is not only taught in history class. Latin American culture is taught in Spanish classes and many other cultures are taught in art classes.
1.6.1.4.4. Pro: In today's information age, any knowledge can be acquired at the click of a button.
1.6.1.4.4.1. Pro: Schools have the internet and free time. They also have projects with open topics or about family history.
1.6.1.4.4.2. Con: This does not refute the claim that whites have a unique privilege in schools.
1.6.1.4.5. Pro: Libraries are free to all and allow anyone to educate themselves about different periods of history.
1.6.1.4.6. Con: This does not refute the fact that white people are privileged by virtue of learning about their history in school, while non-white people have to search for it themselves.
1.6.2. Con: Many teachers have [modified their curriculum](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8706323/college-professor-afraid) based on the fear of being accused of racism.
1.6.2.1. Con: A few niche cases does not mean this is a general trend.
1.6.3. Con: The students that behave better and achieve more academically tend to be favored, no matter their race.
1.6.3.1. Con: Teachers have the power and control in schools to allow racial bias in their classroom.
1.6.3.2. Con: Many schools are [still segregated](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/06/schools-are-more-segregated-today-than-during-the-late-1960s/258348/), limiting opportunities
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: People of colour are [more likely](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/) to be in poverty than their white counterparts, and with local taxes determining the [public school funding](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/), minority schools are generally less well funded than white ones.
1.6.3.3. Con: This doesn't mean that students of colour don't experience racism and prejudice in school.
1.6.4. Pro: [Black students are more likely to be suspended for the same behavior.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/black-children-are-more-likely-to-be-disciplined-than-white-kids-for-the-same-behavior-2019-10-16)
1.6.4.1. Pro: Even the preschoolers are [suspended](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/21/292456211/black-preschoolers-far-more-likely-to-be-suspended) more often than their non-Black counterparts.
1.6.4.2. Con: This does not mean that punishment was not justified, nor does it mean that whites children's misbehavior was overlooked.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: The parent is an example of the '[affirming the consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent#:~:text=Affirming%20the%20consequent%20is%20the,formally%20as%20or%2C%20alternatively%2C%20.)' logical fallacy
1.6.4.2.2. Con: These studies looked at punishments for the same offense. That does imply bias was applied, both pro-white and anti-black.
1.6.4.2.2.1. Con: Not all acts within the same category are equally naughty. E.g. It is worse to steal a pencil case full of stationary than it is to steal a single pencil, although both wrong-doings could be categorised as theft.
1.6.4.2.2.1.1. Con: This logic works both ways. white children \(or Southern Pakistani for that matter\) could be stealing whole pencil cases and black children individual pencils. This is just a nitpick.
1.6.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Measurement flaws that affect more than one group are still flaws, and they thus affect how seriously we should take the results.
1.6.4.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Such alleged "measurement flaws" do not actually undermine the conclusions of the study.
1.6.5. Pro: Most teachers are white, and they tend to favour white students due to [implicit biases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/black-students-teachers-implicit-racial-bias-preschool-study).
1.6.5.1. Pro: Of the teachers in elementary in secondary schools, about 80% are white. This is disproportionate: only about half the students are white \([ED, p. 5, 6](https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/highered/racial-diversity/state-racial-diversity-workforce.pdf)\).
1.6.5.2. Con: There is currently [no implicit bias test](https://qz.com/1144504/the-world-is-relying-on-a-flawed-psychological-test-to-fight-racism/) with any scientific credibility. Even those that have persisted in spite of the literature have [zero associations](https://osf.io/b5m97/) between bias and actual behavior.
1.6.6. Pro: [Margaret Hagerman](https://www.emptywheel.net/2018/07/29/white-kids-growing-up-with-privilege-in-a-racially-divided-america-by-margaret-hagerman/) wrote extensively about racial divisions in classrooms.
1.7. Pro: Racial stereotypes shape how African Americans, Latinos and other ethnic minorities are viewed. White privilege is the advantage of not being subject to those stereotypes.
1.7.1. Con: The [opioid epidemic](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-deaths-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) affected whites more than other races, due to [stereotypes](https://www.pharmacist.com/article/drug-overdoses-propel-rise-mortality-rates-young-whites) [that protected](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/science/drug-overdoses-propel-rise-in-mortality-rates-of-young-whites.html?_r=0) other races. "Studies have found that doctors are much more reluctant to prescribe painkillers to minority patients, worrying that they might sell them or become addicted."
1.7.2. Con: Three stereotypes that affect white people negatively: White men are weak or ineffective \(cuckoldry\), white women are cold-hearted and uncaring, white people aren't cool and lack social awareness. These stereotypes affect social status, relationships, cultural merit, and self esteem which all can have severe effects on happiness and life outcomes.
1.7.2.1. Con: These stereotypes are fairly minor, and pale in comparison to the powerful institutions that would block minority community access to education, credit, fair courts, and civil interactions with police.
1.7.3. Con: Everyone is affected by stereotypes that are harmful so to use that as an argument neglects the context of those on an individual level. Such as every south white man being a bigot
1.7.4. Pro: For generations, Asians have been [stereotyped as unclean](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/the-long-history-of-racism-against-asian-americans-in-the-u-s). The entrenchment of this idea in public discourse was evidenced by how easily anti-Asian narratives re-emerged when Covid-19 broke out.
1.7.5. Pro: Diversity training in the 1980s and 90s discovered that whites were perceived as "strong, providers, protectors, and leaders" while blacks are rather described as "lazy, looking for a handout, uneducated, and whiners" \([Anand and Winters, p. 361](http://www.wintersgroup.com/corporate-diversity-training-1964-to-present.pdf)\). This illustrates how whites from all classes are perceived as superior.
1.7.6. Pro: There are fewer negative stereotypes about white people.
1.7.6.1. Pro: In some non-white cultures, whiteness is privileged as a sign of beauty, affluence, or intelligence. This gives white people attempting to interact with people of that culture an advantage over darker peoples. There are fewer cultures where darkness is privileged.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: Preference among blacks for lighter skinned blacks does not inherently mean the the preference is for someone as light as a white person.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.7.6.2. Con: Many stereotypes have nuggets of truth. If, in general, white people behave better, that is not the result of privilege but of actions.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: White privilege is a real thing and is a result of white people as a group behaving better and thereby shaping people priors.
1.7.6.2.1.1. Con: Rewards based on positive behavior or habits are not a result of privilege.
1.7.6.3. Con: There are many types of white people who have negative stereotypes attached to them: [White Trash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_trash), [Yuppies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuppie), etc.
1.7.7. Pro: While there may be differing advantages between social classes for white people, their skin color gives a social advantage to all of them because the general reaction to their skin colour is more positive because of societal indoctrination.
1.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.7.7.2. Con: The public reaction to an individual is still a class issue. More white Americans are likely to dress appropriately and speak well versus African Americans or Hispanics. If a person of colour were dressed appropriately and spoke proper English and a white person did not, it would be the person of colour who would be favored.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: 'Appropriate' dress and speech patterns are an example of white privilege because they are deemed such by white Americans. This proves that non-whites are discriminated against for being themselves, even if this might potentially be minimized if they adopt 'white mannerisms'.
1.7.7.3. Con: Asian Americans benefit from an assumption that they are academically successful. This is not counted as a form of racial privilege.
1.7.7.3.1. Con: Asians do not have privilege. The success of Asians are the result of upbringing which any a person of any race can practice.
1.7.7.3.1.1. Pro: Asians lack the capital to constitute a privileged group. Instead, success can be seen in terms of merit. Isolating Asians as successful ignores the success of other groups too. [Nigerian Immigrants are also successful,](http://www.chron.com/news/article/Data-show-Nigerians-the-most-educated-in-the-U-S-1600808.php) just like Asian immigrants because of work ethic and not inherited capital. Just because you're successful doesn't mean you have privilege. Instead, being successful without effort / merit is a component of being privileged.
1.7.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Asians do indeed have capital. [On average](http://affirmativeactionreform.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/race-or-income-debate.html?m=1), Asians have a higher household income than the race in question.
1.7.7.3.1.1.2. Pro: Asians are proof that one group can be oppressed in the past and succeed today. We tend to focus on black slavery, yet the Chinese were enslaved and there are Japanese Americans living today who were forced into interment camps. The legacy of oppression does not last as long as many say.
1.7.7.4. Pro: Men with stereotypically 'black-sounding' names are more likely to be imagined as physically large, dangerous and violent based only on [knowledge of that name](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/black-sounding-names-study_us_561697a5e4b0dbb8000d687f).
1.7.7.5. Pro: Black boys as young as 10 may not be viewed in the same light of childhood innocence as their white peers, but are instead [more likely to be mistaken as older, be perceived as guilty and face police violence if accused of a crime](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/03/black-boys-older.aspx)
1.7.8. Con: Being the privileged oppressor is a negative stereotype when applied generally, especially to white people who are otherwise disadvantaged \(i.e. poor white people and LGBT white people\).
1.7.8.1. Con: This stereotype does not erase the privilege, even if it somewhat balances it, and recognizing privilege is not the same as assuming one has an active role in it, ie., being an oppressor.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Although many people do differentiate between different classes of white people \(racists vs. oppressed subgroups\), there are many more who gladly stereotype all white people as well off and racist even when they are not.
1.7.9. Pro: The entire framework on which we base the "norm" in the United States is white and euro-centric, and as a result everything that follows is seen as "other". That itself is an example of privilege.
1.7.9.1. Pro: White skin is considered positive by the media and in popular culture.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: Non-white people are prominent in the media industry: Oprah Winfrey, Steve Harvey, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Tyler Perry, LeVar Burton, James Earl Jones and Wendy Williams are all celebrities, and there are major TV shows such as Blackish and How to Get Away with Murder starring a diverse cast.
1.7.9.1.1.1. Pro: 6 of the [Top 10 songs in 2016](http://time.com/collection-post/4575319/top-10-best-songs-2016/) were sung by black Americans/groups containing black Americans.
1.7.9.1.2. Pro: On [dating apps](https://qz.com/149342/the-uncomfortable-racial-preferences-revealed-by-online-dating/) white men have the highest response rate among women.
1.7.9.1.3. Con: Many whites are cast as ugly or as villains.
1.7.9.2. Pro: In the arts and literature, characters which are originally not conceived of as being white are often depicted by white actors. Examples in recent films include [Ghost in the Shell](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/), [Aloha](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243974/), [Cloud Atlas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), [Noah](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1959490/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), and [The Passion of the Christ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/?ref_=nv_sr_1). There are fewer examples of non-white actors taking on roles written as or intended to be white.
1.7.9.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that skin color was the deciding factor. It is more likely that the skills of the actor played a major role.
1.7.9.2.2. Con: There are examples of entertainment which has done the opposite. For example, the musical [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_\(musical\)), female [Peter Pans](https://www.autostraddle.com/15-ladies-who-played-peter-pan-from-nina-boucicault-to-alison-williams-253416/), [Kingpin](http://www.toptenz.net/10-non-white-actors-played-previosly-white-characters.php), and the female [Ghostbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_\(2016_film\)) movie.
1.7.9.2.3. Con: Biblical stories have long been circulated throughout Europe. In many black churches, these characters are depicted as black.
1.7.9.2.4. Con: Bollywood mainly features actors of Indian descent. This is not taken to suggest that Bollywood is racist.
1.7.9.3. Pro: Children's books and TV shows predominantly feature white characters. The disproportionate number of white characters mean they are viewed as the norm.
1.7.9.3.1. Con: No one person can read all these books or watch all these shows. There are plenty of shows and books to choose from by any particular race, and they are available on demand.
1.7.9.3.2. Con: Modern children's books and book stores feature much diversity. There are many beloved children's books featuring minorities, for example [Ezra Jack Keats' books](http://www.ezra-jack-keats.org/section/ezras-books/).
1.7.9.3.3. Con: PBS has been highly diverse for decades. Reading Rainbow, Sesame Street, [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_\(1999_TV_series\)), [The Electric Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Company), to name a few.
1.7.9.3.4. Pro: In a [study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/08/characters-in-childrens-books-are-almost-always-white-and-its-a-big-problem/?utm_term=.971ca15048ee) of 3,600 kid's books, 3% of main characters were black, 2% Asian and Pacific American, \<2% Latinos, \<1% Native American.
1.7.9.3.4.1. Pro: There are people of colour writing books, but publishing companies are [controlled by](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/69653-why-publishing-is-so-white.html) white editors.
1.7.9.3.4.2. Con: The concepts and lessons in these stories are not contingent on race.
1.7.9.3.4.2.1. Con: Where minorities barely feature, their specific experiences - which can be quite different from those of white Americans - most likely don't feature either. In that sense, the content of books can be contingent on race.
1.7.9.3.5. Con: Being the predominantly featured race of characters does not necessarily give privilege.
1.7.9.3.5.1. Con: It does however affect self-esteem. Seeing more of one's own race in TV shows [boosts self-esteem](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650211401376), while seeing less decreases it.
1.7.9.3.5.2. Pro: One can draw inspiration from someone of any race or gender. To do otherwise is racist.
1.7.9.3.5.3. Pro: Prevalence of one race in the media does not mean they are privileged: as characters of a certain colour could be predominant yet also be depicted in negative way.
1.7.9.3.5.4. Con: Predominantly being featured is an effect of privilege. The ownership of production and publishing companies is held predominantly by whites.
1.7.9.3.5.4.1. Con: The race of ownership does not inherently dictate the race of characters and authors of the books they accept.
1.7.9.3.5.4.2. Con: One of the most influential figures in the promotion of children’s literature in the modern era is [LeVar Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeVar_Burton), an African American.
1.7.9.3.5.4.3. Pro: Despite white people only making up [73.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) of the US' population, they make up [82%](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/69653-why-publishing-is-so-white.html) of working book editors in the publishing industry.
1.7.9.3.6. Con: -> See 1.7.9.3.4.2.
1.7.9.4. Con: The population of the U.S is indeed predominantly white, meaning that this framework would be representative and rational.
1.7.9.5. Pro: [More than three quarters](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216) of Americans count as white. This majority population makes "white" the norm.
1.7.9.6. Pro: Common phrases like "[person of color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color)" apply only to non-white individuals. This indicates that "white" is the norm and that "color" describes exclusively deviations from that.
1.7.9.7. Pro: White privilege means you never even know you have it. We have been taught that white is pure, black is evil, other, suspect. Judas is painted as dark and swarthy in European art. White folks frolicking on island vacations. We are convinced that we are entitled to all that the world has to offer. These symbols, some subtle, some blatant, inform us that being white means more freedom, more access to resources, more justice, and more social acceptance than anyone else.
1.7.10. Con: The concept of white privilege is a stereotype to which all white people are being held.
1.7.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.7.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.7.10.3. Pro: All else being equal, many would favour those they feel are disadvantaged in a situation such as hiring or giving aid.
1.7.10.3.1. Pro: Recently, job openings at the [Democratic National Committee](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/11/02/dnc-white-males/) were requested not to be forwarded to white males, because of the perception they were in the majority on the team.
1.7.10.3.2. Con: Experiencing privilege means one is oftentimes not even in the situation of requiring aid in the first place. Thus, experiencing privilege is still better than being disadvantaged.
1.7.10.4. Con: The reality of privilege is more significant than any disadvantage that comes from general awareness of this privilege.
1.7.10.4.1. Pro: It has been well-known for decades that white Americans are economically better off then Black Americans and Latinos, yet this discrepancy shows [no signs of abating](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/); in some areas it is even growing. White Americans can hardly be said to have any economic disadvantage relative to other groups.
1.7.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.2.
1.7.11. Pro: Hiring practices [privilege white people](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs) and discriminate against persons of color, as various studies show, even when controlling for other factors.
1.7.12. Pro: Unless there are indicators showing that a white person is poor, a white person is assumed to be either middle class or moderately wealthy, and is often treated better as a result of that assumption.
1.7.12.1. Con: This isn't exclusive to white people; any race can hide their socio-economic status and be treated differently because of it.
1.7.12.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.7.
1.7.13. Pro: Blacks and Hispanics are often stereotyped as being poor, and poor people are usually not trusted and treated with suspicion.
1.7.14. Con: Stereotypes exist for every group in this country, whether it's based on gender, race, religion, etc.. You can't claim that whites are the only group not subject to stereotyping, it simply isn't true.
1.7.14.1. Pro: There was a New York Times [bestseller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_White_People_Like) called "Stuff White People Like" that detailed dozens of stereotypes about white people.
1.7.14.2. Con: While there are stereotypes associated with whiteness, these aren't nearly as negative as those associated with being a person of colour.
1.7.14.3. Pro: A member of a Labour Party advisory panel claimed that ["all white people are racist".](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/loreal-paris-labour-party-transgender-munroe-bergdorf-dawn-butler-racist-charlottesville-a8230891.html)
1.7.14.4. Con: Stereotypes for minorities usually carry worse real world consequences in employment, housing, etc, than for whites.
1.7.14.5. Con: In a majority white place \(i.e. most of America\) white people are not often stereotyping each other.
1.7.14.6. Con: Not all stereotypes are the same in terms of the effect they have on the people's lives: some negative stereotypes are more likely to result in material harm.
1.7.14.6.1. Pro: Black men are seen as stronger and larger than white men [of the same size](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/black-men-perceived-stronger-threatening-1.4022277) which contributes to their treatment at the hands of [police.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01057/full)
1.7.15. Pro: Contemporary racism is much more subtle than it was in the Jim Crow era. Many people do not consider themselves racist, yet [subconsciously](https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-subtlety-of-contemporary-racism) they are prejudiced against minorities.
1.7.16. Con: Racial stereotypes are subjectively valued. Is it so great as a man to be viewed as harmless? Which is often the case for white men. Not all white men identify with the role of a provider for his family.
1.8. Con: In general, any advantages white Americans have are a result of their personal choices, not privilege.
1.8.1. Pro: Arguing that privilege and disadvantagement are not the result of personal choices creates and helps to sustain that certain people are born victims, thereby reproducing a lack of ambition, inactivity and disadvantagement itself.
1.8.1.1. Con: If privilege and "disadvantagement" are real aspects of society, it's still necessary to acknowledge the problem instead of trying to cover it up, if only to maintain an accurate picture of reality.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Through measures such as [bonuses on SAT scores](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html), members of minorities are told that they deserve additional support, independent of what they actually achieve \(for example in terms of SAT scores\).
1.8.1.2.1. Con: Historically, [minorities were barred from attending most elite colleges](https://newrepublic.com/article/121382/forgotten-racist-past-american-universities), at all. Many argue such small bonuses only help to level the historical playing field.
1.8.1.3. Con: Claiming a group has privilege does not infer that other groups are incapable of making gains, only that they have farther to go.
1.8.2. Con: The personal choices available to an individual are a product of circumstances, too. Even good or bad personal choices are therefore not fully dependent on the individual alone.
1.8.3. Con: Tebow kneels at an NFL game and is praised. Kaepernick kneels at an NFL game and is vilified. They made the same personal choice.
1.8.3.1. Con: They did not make the same choice, one knelt on the sidelines, the other knelt during the National anthem, where it is generally accepted by all Americans to stand with your hand on your heart. As a result, some Americans viewed the act as disrespect.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: Many Americans view the right to dissent and protest itself as patriotic, no matter the circumstances. Thus for some the criticism was seen as a convenient proxy for silencing protest against [police brutality against blacks](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-08-15/police-shootings-are-a-leading-cause-of-death-for-black-men).
1.8.4. Con: The systemic denial of various services and rights to people of color throughout the history of America has resulted in various advantages for white Americans that are not a result of their personal choices including but not limited to better access to more resources and better services.
1.8.5. Con: A white person who is the descendant of slave owners will [more often](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-average-black-family-would-need-228-years-to-build-the-wealth-of-a-white-family-today/) hold wealth privilege that is not the result of any of their own personal choices.
1.8.5.1. Con: The overwhelming majority of white people did not own slaves, and are not descendants of slave owners. To conflate a small group with “all white people” and then assign privilege to the larger group based on a much smaller group is intellectually dishonest.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Whites [largely benefited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_for_slavery_debate_in_the_United_States#cite_note-29) from US slavery.
1.9. Pro: White people have better average living standards than most other ethnic groups in America.
1.9.1. Con: Not all white people. And the success or privilege of upper-class white Americans does not get extended to the rest of white America.
1.9.2. Con: [Asian](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/) and Arab americans, on average, have better living standards than whites in the US.
1.9.3. Pro: Past injustices perpetrated by white people against people of other ethnicities continue to benefit white people today.
1.9.3.1. Pro: These crimes reduced the availability of social goods and capital for black people and enhanced the availability of those same goods for whites.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Various structural political policies over the history of the United States have systemically affected the ability of non-white families to accumulate generational wealth - an integral aspect of escaping poverty in the US.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: Credit scores are not racist: minorities can and have accumulated generational wealth.
1.9.3.2.2. Con: Generational wealth is neither a necessary component for acquisition of wealth or income nor do all white Americans possess it.
1.9.3.2.3. Pro: Drug policies have targeted black neighborhoods.
1.9.3.2.3.1. Con: Many of these policies targeted white hippies as well. [Nixon's war on drugs](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/22/11278760/war-on-drugs-racism-nixon), for example.
1.9.3.2.4. Pro: Black neighborhoods have been [redlined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) and systematically denied services such as mortgages, insurances and credits.
1.9.3.2.4.1. Con: One cannot necessarily generalize from the bad examples that have attracted public attention. America, after all, has thousands of banks, most of which do not engage in redlining.
1.9.3.2.4.2. Con: Skin color isn't necessarily the only or the decisive factor at play here.
1.9.3.2.5. Pro: Funding to black schools has [decreased](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/public-school-funding-and-the-role-of-race/408085/).
1.9.3.2.5.1. Con: School closures are due to financial issues, not race. Unless there are zero white children that attend these schools, these school closures effect white Americans too.
1.9.3.2.6. Con: Crime is the largest deterrent for economic growth in these areas. Crime is committed by its inhabitants, not the system.
1.9.4. Pro: The wealth and income of white American households is [significantly higher](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/24/news/economy/blacks-whites-inequality/) than the wealth of Black and Latino households and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
1.9.4.1. Pro: The median wealth of white households is [10x higher](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/01/how-wealth-inequality-has-changed-in-the-u-s-since-the-great-recession-by-race-ethnicity-and-income/) than the median wealth of black households
1.9.4.2. Con: White people are not the only economically privileged group in America. [Asian-Americans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/), for example, have an even higher income than white Americans on average.
1.9.4.2.1. Pro: The media household income for whites in 2016 \(last date available\) is $65,041, while for Asians that number is $81,431, nearly $16,000 higher. [Income and Poverty in the United States: 2016](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/demo/P60-259.pdf)
1.9.5. Pro: The rate of home ownership is [significantly higher](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/24/news/economy/blacks-whites-inequality/) among white Americans than among Black Americans and Latinos, and the unemployment rate and the poverty rate are much lower.
1.9.5.1. Pro: A major campaign called [red lining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) sought to deny black families access to gov backed loans denying home ownership for generations
1.9.6. Con: Socio-economic factors such as poverty and homelessness can sometimes negate any privilege / unearned advantage a person might have due to the color of his skin.
1.9.6.1. Pro: [Income inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States) is growing in the US, which negatively affects many white Americans as well.
1.9.6.1.1. Con: Inequality in itself is not the problem as long as everybody has sufficient means to live a life according to their needs and desires.
1.9.6.1.2. Con: Even though inequality is growing, the wealth of white families [is growing](http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/). In contrast to that, the wealth of non-white families is stagnant. Even if growing inequality affects white Americans, it therefore affects them far less than non-white Americans.
1.9.6.2. Con: -> See 1.7.7.
1.9.6.3. Pro: Many white Americans are struggling: [17.3 million](http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-statistics.html) are under the poverty line.
1.9.6.3.1. Con: This represents 8.8% of white Americans overall. Among Black Americans and Hispanics, the share of those living in poverty stands at [more than twice that](http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-statistics.html).
1.9.6.3.2. Con: The [average household income](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9) of white Americans is about is $55k while Black Americans only stand at $33k. This means Black Americans are more likely to live impoverished.
1.9.6.3.2.1. Con: The difference in household incomes can be explained with the fact that [many more](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35,18/10,11,9,12,1,185,13/432,431) Black Americans live in single-parent households compared to other Americans.
1.9.6.3.2.1.1. Con: These correlations with poverty are caused by it moreso than they are the cause of it.
1.9.6.4. Pro: Working-class white Americans do not have attention paid to their problems because they are assumed to be privileged, and therefore do not have a positive outlook on their lives in America.
1.9.6.4.1. Pro: The book [Hillbilly Elegy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy) illustrates well how poor white Americans are stuck in cycles of poverty without support from society.
1.9.6.4.1.1. Pro: The author J.D. Vance was accused of [white privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy#Reception) effectively discrediting his personal life story.
1.9.6.4.2. Pro: White working-class voters often vote against their economic self-interest \(e.g. Kentucky is [solidly Republican](https://www.270towin.com/states/Kansas) and is largely [poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income) and [white](https://www.270towin.com/states/Kentucky)\) for the Republican Party, partly because the Democratic Party [appears not to appeal to them](https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-the-democrats-lost-the-white-working-class-1501908264).
1.9.6.4.3. Con: The entire establishment is focused on working class white Americans, and supports them rather than penalizes.
1.9.6.4.3.1. Pro: The current opioid epidemic \(ostensibly a white issue\) is considered a health problem whilst the 80s crack epidemic \(more black issue\) was a criminal problem \([source](https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2018.5a14)\).
1.9.6.5. Pro: [Anyone](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/01/americas-rural-schools/422586/) can be affected by [lack of education opportunities](http://work.chron.com/educational-discrimination-workplace-23553.html), especially in rural areas.
1.9.6.6. Con: By pointing out that "sometimes" poverty and homelessness can negate privilege, you are actually accepting that privilege is real the other side of "sometimes".
1.9.6.7. Pro: There exist, for example, black people who grow up in wealthy families and experience more opportunities than the average American. To say that someone who grows up in a difficult environment is privileged due to his or her skin color is senseless.
1.9.6.8. Con: Privilege should be considered in isolation and with all other things people equal - it's not appropriate to compare a homeless white person with a black doctor. Compare a white and black doctor, or a white and black homeless person.
1.9.7. Pro: Even when controlling for income, [black children](https://nyti.ms/2GGpFZw) face a steeper both to climb up the income ladder, and if their parents are middle class or wealthy, they face a steeper climb then their white counterparts to to stay in middle and upper classes. Since results control for income of parents, I see no explanation other than racism.
1.10. Pro: White Americans have the exclusive privilege of generally seeing America in a more positive light.
1.10.1. Con: Feelings of optimism or pessimism in regards to your country have nothing to do with privilege; they are merely personal opinions.
1.10.1.1. Con: Whites would have more concrete examples of favorable treatment from which to draw from than non-whites would. It would at the very least be an informed opinion.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.9.6.4.
1.10.3. Pro: America looks less racially discriminatory to white Americans. Compared to Black Americans, a [much lower share](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/28/the-black-white-and-urban-rural-divides-in-perceptions-of-racial-fairness/) of them beliefs that Black Americans are treated worse in public life, for example by the police, courts, schools and in restaurants.
1.10.3.1. Pro: White Americans generally see the justice system and the police in a [more positive light](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/HTML%20Reports/law-enforcement-and-violence-the-divide-between-black-and-white-americans0803-9759.aspx) than Black Americans and Hispanics, having trust in them and believing in their fairness.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: The fear of or anger at police can make black men react irrationally around police, becoming a self-fulfilled prophecy of police violence.
1.10.3.1.2. Con: Higher crime rate in communities of color rationally would lead to more police presence in that community. This can lead to the perception of racial discrimination when in reality it is due to higher crime rates.
1.11. Pro: White Americans are in a privileged situation simply because they are the majority.
1.11.1. Con: Majority does not necessarily mean privilege or a step up. In certain aspects, majority power is [specifically and intentionally limited.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority)
1.11.2. Con: In large cities and metro areas, whites are [not the majority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_U.S._cities_with_non-white_majority_populations) and, thus, not in a privileged situation in those areas.
1.11.2.1. Con: Whites in large cities still hold a racial majority among the country's \(and likely state's\) population, thus retaining legal and cultural privileges even within diverse metro populations.
1.11.3. Con: In the US, as a democracy, [it is inevitable that the social and economic systems that govern a system](http://www.umassmedia.com/opinions/democracy-white-privilege/article_2134396c-57b3-11e9-af80-c7d900fdcb23.html) are designed to support and assist the majority, white people. Thus white privilege is inevitable in the US.
1.11.4. Con: In many parts of the country non-hispanic whites are actually a minority. Examples include Atlanta, Houston, all of South Texas and more.
1.11.4.1. Con: This changes nothing about privilege at the national level.
1.11.5. Pro: It is only natural that white Americans experience privilege as a result of this majority status as the human brain is [hardwired for tribalism](https://medium.com/rsa-journal/tribalism-is-a-double-edged-sword-271bea488b1b). Race is one of the most easily distinguishable way for sighted people to separate themselves into tribes, and people tend to favor their tribe as a rudimentary Darwinian survival mechanism.
1.12. Con: Privilege is [complex](http://mediasmarts.ca/diversity-media/privilege-media/forms-privilege); [other factors](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/conversations-diversity/hazards-checking-white-privilege) can outweigh the effects of skin color on privilege.
1.12.1. Con: Although privilege for the individual is complex, [studies on demographics data from large groups of people](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20181211/281479277501298) do still indicate specific negative trends among certain racial groups, that should not be ignored.
1.12.2. Pro: One's gender identity and sexual orientation have a big influence on privilege.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Sexual and romantic orientation can lead to terrible consequences for individuals. [LGBT](https://wgntv.com/2018/05/23/brutal-beating-of-portland-state-university-student-may-have-been-hate-crime/)+ people are beaten and killed regardless of color, [poly](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201707/polyphobia) people are fired and lose their kids with no legal protection and [no discrimination law](https://www.morethantwo.com/blog/2013/10/the-cost-of-being-in-the-poly-closet)s.
1.12.2.2. Pro: [Gender discrimination](http://time.com/5191419/women-leading-fight-equality-sexual-harassment/) affects [salary](https://iwpr.org/issue/employment-education-economic-change/pay-equity-discrimination/) as well as other aspects of life: [17,700,000](https://metoomvmt.org/)+ women have been sexually assaulted in the past 10 years.
1.12.3. Pro: Health and biological factors unrelated to race are greater predictors of privilege than skin color.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Physical appearance and fitness can substantially affect privilege.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: While these arguments may likely be true in some or all respects they are irrelevant in this discussion as they do negate or disprove white privilege.
1.12.3.1.2. Pro: In certain cases, a person's appearance \(clothes, vehicle, etc.\) can offset any unearned advantage or disadvantage they get due to the color of their skin.
1.12.3.1.2.1. Con: These people would still have privilege relative to people of color with similar signifiers of status.
1.12.3.1.2.2. Con: Specific cultures/races have different clothes to represent their culture \(i.e headresses, jewellery, etc.\) which people can base their prejudice and bias off.
1.12.3.1.2.3. Con: In many cases, the assumption of a disconnect between skin color and class derived by vehicle or property has led to the conclusion that the person of color is an inappropriate user of the item, i.e. a thief or invader. This shows a more deep seated lack of privilege due to race.
1.12.3.1.3. Pro: [Good looks](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-much-is-being-attractive-worth-80414787/) can have a substantial impact not only on finding partners but on [employment opportunities](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/08/27/the-line-of-beauty) and [politics](https://www.macleans.ca/society/science/the-mysterious-power-of-attractive-people/).

1.12.3.2. Pro: Intelligence is a natural-born [cognitive privilege](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/34905/) that invisibly provides incredible benefits, while [learning disabilities](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jul/14/discrimination-learning-disabilities) hold people back.
1.12.4. Pro: Social factors are more likely to determine one's privilege than race.
1.12.4.1. Pro: A person's perceived or actual cultural and religious affiliations materially impact their privilege, irrespective of their race.
1.12.4.1.1. Pro: Being part of the [main-stream religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_privilege) gives many advantages to its members that are [independent of](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/23/us/louisiana-school-prayer-lawsuit/index.html) other privileges in the area of faith.
1.12.4.1.2. Pro: Someone with white privilege but a [southern accent](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/04/study-finds-students-with-southern-accents-often-discriminated-against-in-colleges/) or [who is foreign](http://www.dispatch.com/article/20140808/NEWS/308089819) \(including European\) faces their own discrimination struggles.

Pro: [Healthy family structure](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-privilege-can-even-stem-from-basic-family-stability_us_59cbe21fe4b02ba6621ff9ba) adds a lot of benefits, and studies about the [negative impact](https://www.babygaga.com/15-negative-ways-kids-from-broken-homes-get-affected/) of broken homes are everywhere. No race is inherently more or less capable of having a healthy home, and the impact on children \(future-adults\) are intense.
1.12.4.2.1. Con: [Policies incentivizing mass incarceration](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/geographyofpoverty-big-city) can negatively affect minority family structure through no fault of their own.
1.12.4.3. Pro: White Americans are more privileged than other races only in some parts of the U.S. Where there is no white majority, no clear privilege exists.
1.12.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.
1.12.6. Con: A privilege may exist even if it is not the most dominant factor in a person’s life. That is to say that if a white person and a person of colour come from otherwise \(close to\) identical backgrounds, then any benefit the white person receives solely due to the colour of their skin, must be considered white privilege. Thus a person can be underprivileged and still experience white privilege.
