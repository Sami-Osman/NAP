Discussion Name: Can Man-made Climate Change Be Reversed?

1. Man-made climate change can be reversed.
1.1. Pro: Any significant drop in the population of mankind, including extinction, resulting from climate change or other factors could eliminate major factors sustaining climate change.
1.1.1. Pro: When human activity is significantly reduced, ecosystems/environments and waterways can heal quickly.
1.1.1.1. Pro: During the first phase of the global coronavirus pandemic when many populations were under lockdown there were [positive effects](http://during the first phase of the global coronavirus pandemic when many populations were under "lockdown."during the first phase of the global coronavirus pandemic when many populations were under "lockdown.") on the environment.
1.1.2. Pro: As populations drop the use of fossil fuels will plummet, possibly to the point where we will only need renewable energy.
1.1.3. Pro: As populations drop our reliance on cattle for food could disappear, resulting in a massive drop in methane output.
1.1.4. Pro: Part of population drop could be a reduction in habitable land areas, and conflict for those areas could result in nuclear war and thus nuclear winter, which would [lower temperatures](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00794-y).
1.1.5. Pro: Population drop could result in forests growing/spreading again, resulting in CO2 being removed from the atmosphere.
1.1.6. Pro: Population drop could result in us, now forewarned, being able to expand again in a more environmentally friendly manner.
1.1.7. Con: Human nature doesn't change. We'd still ignore all good sense in a mad dash for power, land, and convenience, and end up roughly where we are now.
1.1.8. Con: A significant drop in the human population cannot be ethically achieved, as it would mean killing people.
1.1.9. Con: Non-Anthropogenic sources of Greenhouse Gasses have already been pushed over some tipping points; and as such it's plausible that long-term warming can be sustained even with a large decrease \(or cessation\) of anthropogenic emissions. If climate change results in the extinction of humanity, it will be far past the point where humans are the primary contributors.
1.1.10. Con: The world's richest 10% produce 50% of global CO2 emissions and the poorest 50% produce only 10% of emissions. One could do away with the poorest 90% and the world would still end up seeing globally catastrophic climate impacts.
1.2. Pro: Improving education will help to reverse climate change.
1.2.1. Pro: As education levels, and thus employment, increase for women, [family size decreases](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/05/07/childlessness-falls-family-size-grows-among-highly-educated-women/)(The more education a woman has, up to a bachelor’s degree, the less likely she is to become a mother.). Over time, the overall global population will decrease, reducing climate change.
1.2.2. Con: With improved education comes [higher income](https://www.qs.com/what-effect-does-education-level-have-on-wealth/), which leads to more consumption, which contributes to climate change.
1.2.3. Con: Capitalism's relentless pursuit of growth is the greatest impediment to adequately addressing climate change. Improved education won't change the primary profit motives.
1.2.4. Pro: Educating people about the impact of climate change has already resulted in positive changes to the environment. Spreading this education globally can only add to this effect.
1.2.4.1. Pro: [More societies](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/21-countries-reducing-carbon-emissions-growing-gdp/) are focusing on consuming less, thus reducing waste that [contributes](https://deq.nc.gov/conservation/recycling/recycling-climate-change) to carbon emissions.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: The entire developing world \(and close to 6 Billion people\) are demanding more energy and material goods in order to improve their quality of life. 2 Billion people in the developing world reducing their consumption can not equal the increased demands of 6 Billion.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Humanity has long-term difficulties in assessing consequences and mass-transitioning to reverse global warming. Simply greed, convenience, and short-term gain win out over thoughtful preservation of resources.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Germany uses [hydrogen \(from water\) to power tour boats](http://earthtechling.com/2012/10/german-river-touring-boat-uses-clean-fuel-cell-technology/).
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Veganism grew [500% since 2014](https://www.livekindly.co/demand-vegan-food-140-percent-5-billion-value/).
1.2.4.1.5. Con: Changing a culture is difficult as people prefer to preserve traditions instead of losing them.
1.2.4.1.6. Pro: Cultures can inspire other cultures to adopt the changes once the concept is proven.
1.2.4.1.7. Pro: Once a culture makes a decision, it forces \(in a sense\) everyone else to bend towards that decision or be left out. Then more people will decrease the Earth's temperatures whether or not they agree with that.
1.2.4.1.8. Pro: Cultural changes requires minimal effort on the individuals end, allowing for a quicker transfer towards sustainability. For example, if a culture decides to change their electricity to renewable sources, people will not need to change their lifestyle at all to experience the new electrical system.
1.2.4.1.8.1. Con: Actual sustainability requires large scale global degrowth; which will have meaningful impacts on peoples lived experience and quality of life. Few personal automobiles; little recreational air travel; no fast fashion; major dietary changes; major career changes for many people; economic shift away from capitalism and growth; etc.
1.2.4.1.9. Con: Most cultures use so little resources that to use even less would not make sense or be feasible.
1.2.4.1.9.1. Pro: Climate change already is taking place where people's resources are taken away. Once that happens, people don't adapt really - they just disappear or go to where there are resources until those are used up too. So it doesn't work that way 100%.
1.2.4.1.10. Con: Some cultures won't be able to, like islands that face rising tides, as they need to use whatever resources are left to save themselves.
1.3. Con: Economic forces make reversing climate change extremely challenging.
1.3.1. Con: Small changes in consumers behavior have a great impact on the actual free market economy and will force big corporation to shift to the new consumers trends
1.3.1.1. Pro: Advancements in social networking and business technologies makes it possible for consumers to organize like never before. It can be done on scales above and beyond labour organization, and that can be wielded to pressure corporations and hold them accountable for their effects on the climate. if electronic means of unifying concerned consumers voices is wielded and supported very widely, it will be transformative for global capitalism.
1.3.2. Pro: Uncontrolled capitalism seems to be pushing us past every threshold scientists calculate.
1.3.2.1. Con: A capitalist society will still address climate change because environmental investments can make financial sense.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: It is possible and all money spent on an energy transition would pay off up to seven times: all new jobs created by the energy transition will significantly outweigh the jobs lost in fossil fuel. It is only a matter of how fast this will be done. Some data here: [Decarbonize!](https://www.paulstephenborile.com/2019/03/decarbonize/)
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: "Functional" actions in place will allow relative easy transit: changing the economics of making money from creating pollution towards making money cleaning it. All this can happen by passively shifting the economics system without changing what is in place \(i.e. 'cracking' it\), but instead creating a new direction as we proceed forward. That will eventually do better than what came before it.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Financing engineering companies can lead to more jobs while not cracking-up economies by coming up with working solutions at a small and large scale through [reducing waste and curving its costs](https://www.hbf.co.uk/fileadmin/documents/technical/Sustainability/WRAP_A_blueprint_for_reducing_waste_and_cutting_costs.pdf) enough to generate a profit.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A good example of the benefits of building on engineering that makes costs reduce and therefore improving profits is renewable power generation \(see [director's introduction](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Jan/IRENA_2017_Power_Costs_2018.pdf)\) where now the cost for renewable technologies are dramatically low enough to where it's profitable.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The capitalistic system creates inefficiencies. Negative effects occur due to this, such as unnecessary: resource use, waste, and pollution.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The supply and demand system makes suppliers guess at what people want instead of actually making what they want. Products get made that should not and products that should be made do not exist, leading to waste and inabilities for people to combat their personal effects on the environment.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: This is not how the supply and demand system works. Entrepreneurs and workers don't "guess" what people want, they look at the market's [price signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal) function of money, which signals increases and decreases in supply and demand, and produce more of what is more demanded and less of what is less. They try to offer the market a product, and if people don't want it, they won't buy it, and the company will go bankrupt unless the government bails it out. Companies who doesn't make what they want die.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: If a company makes a product that no one wants, then that product \(along with the resources to make the product\) go to waste \(with the exception of recycling, repurposing...\)
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Advertisements create an interest for items that use unnecessary resources.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Products like [coffee pods](https://bibium.com/bibium-news/environmental-impact-of-using-coffee-pods/https://bibium.com/bibium-news/environmental-impact-of-using-coffee-pods/) become on trend and they are actually harming to environment, and still people blindly buy them thinking the are convenient.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: The disposable economy part of capitalism is especially detrimental, in that it invokes avoidable and preventable behaviors by customers that heavily contribute to pollution and wasting of resources in order to continuously turn a profit.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: [Gillette's business model](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04t8k2l) is based on this concept.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Pro: Since capitalism fosters a wasteful, resource-heavy process, pollution will continue to overshoot until a more eco-friendly system replaces it.
1.3.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Capitalism's wasteful, avoidable behaviors include: 1\) buying a new item instead of repairing/replacing bad parts, 2\) not reusing, and 3\) buying seemingly better products instead of improving what's on-hand. A sustainable economic system where items are bought once and improved when needed would be more eco-friendly.
1.3.2.2.4. Con: Unneccessary waste is not so much due to the market free economy as the government putting restrictions on what they're allowed to sell or not.
1.3.2.2.4.1. Con: Regulations are much more about protecting employees and the environment. They can increase the costs of production, but it's often a desirable trade off to the citizens.
1.3.2.2.5. Con: A market free economy is built on what the consumers want, so the "unneccessary" pollution is in that case mostly due to the consumers wanting stuff that requires "unneccessary" pollution. Same with "unneccessary" resource use.
1.3.2.2.5.1. Con: Most products are created because an entrepreneur thinks people will buy it. We don't generally want things that aren't invented yet.
1.3.2.2.6. Pro: Capitalism fosters competition where those who do not participate or at high enough levels get looked down upon. Thus, entities are pushed to waste to stay relevant.
1.3.2.2.7. Pro: The wealthy use immense amounts of resources for their lavish lifestyles and creature comforts.
1.3.2.2.8. Pro: Laissez-faire capitalism works, but it's not what we have. By definition there should be no tax breaks, subsidies, or tariffs, as these skew the market and foil competition. The U.S. is drowning in all three.
1.3.2.2.9. Pro: "Too big to fail" is an outrage to any true capitalist, and it keeps getting worse. Regulations adopted after the 2007 collapse have been largely gutted.
1.3.2.2.10. Pro: Adam Smith, while advocating free markets, also had some stark [warnings.](https://machineryofpolitics.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/adam-smith-on-the-crisis-of-capitalism-2/)
1.3.2.3. Pro: Other economic systems, such as a [resource-based economy](https://www.kialo.com/transitioning-to-a-resource-based-economy-rbe-is-the-most-sustainable-way-for-humanity-to-continue-to-survive-3580/3580.0=3580.1/=3580.1), are better for reversing climate change.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: In what has been termed the [economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem), Mises showed \(in his books "Socialism", "Human Action" and others\) that an economic system without money cannot effectively allocate resources, as the [price signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal) function of money disappears along with the money itself. They simply have no means of economic calculation of which to use where the resources will go. They will need an incredibly large amount of information to know what will go where, which is unattainable by anyone.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Destroying the economy and the ability to effectively allocate resources to "reverse" climate change is not a solution where the means justify the ends.
1.3.2.3.1.2. Con: It is not that difficult to track demand in other ways. Supermarkets do this when scanning barcodes to track demand. We can easily track demand for goods without money by looking at the sum total use for a product that is being tracked with their barcodes.
1.3.2.4. Con: It is also a rational possibility that the gap in overshoot limits will narrow. As seen with the [Clean Air Act](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/progress-cleaning-air-and-improving-peoples-health#pollution), pollution has lessened as the US economy has grown.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Even though it is an improvement, most of the issues with greenhouse gases/pollutants stem from CO2 and methane. Neither of which are addressed.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Looking at chemical reactions, [Hess's Law for methane](http://slideplayer.com/slide/6231387/20/images/12/Hess%E2%80%99s+Law+Problem+Example+1.jpg) produces the greenhouse gases water vapor and CO2.
1.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: Another reaction shows how CO2 mixes with water to make [carbonic acid](http://www.21stcentech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Carbonic-Acid-ocean.jpg), which is what causes ocean acidification.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: The Clean Air Act does not make sense, since it cannot, in essence, get rid of all greenhouse gases without causing harm. With the [O3 + CO -\> CO2 + O2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100655a002) equation, the Clean Air Act may be the cause of rising CO2 levels, as it focuses on the equation's 1st half and neglects the 2nd half. Neither side is a win-win. O3 helps/CO harms vs O2 helps/CO2 harms. The 2nd side is better though, as it removes an extra greenhouse gas and nourishes plants/humans.
1.3.2.5. Con: Capitalism contributing to climate change implies that socialism would decrease greenhouse gases, as it's centralized and not profit-based, which is more [aggrandizing an agenda](https://www.theepochtimes.com/the-end-game-of-climate-change-socialism_2692791.html) rather acknowledging that capitalism is not the problem, but how we utilize it is.
1.3.2.6. Con: Taxing processes that produce CO2, and giving tax breaks to processes that save energy and remove carbon from the air \(e.g. planting trees\) is simple and effective. All that is needed is the political will.
1.3.2.6.1. Con: A tax on fuel is a tax on practically everything that is shipped. Political will's unnecessary, because the tax causes enough of an economic shift to lower consumption in of itself.
1.3.2.6.1.1. Con: A tax on fossil and climate change driving fuels would lead to alternative shipping methods with a lower climate impact.
1.3.2.7. Pro: The [tragedy of the commons](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243.full) is being played out on a global scale due to unchecked capitalism by individual countries.
1.3.2.7.1. Pro: The individual incentive of countries around the world is to allow their citizens and businesses to continue to exceed greenhouse gas emissions targets. The lack of a strong international enforcement mechanism ensures that individual countries will not be willing to incur costs to address climate change.
1.3.2.7.2. Pro: A global economic growth of 0.5% per year is sustainable. However, it's unrealistic, as no country would want to participate that level, as it'll slow down their economy.
1.3.2.8. Con: The government can change it by spending the tax payer's money environmentally and not spending it on other liabilities.
1.3.2.8.1. Con: Governments don't all have as much to spend as companies, so their own expenditure can only have a limited effect, particularly if regulation is not in place.
1.3.2.8.2. Pro: For example, currently the United States spends more on their [country's defense](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/campaigns/military-spending-united-states/) than the environment. If more spending can be focused on the environment, progress can be made in this area.
1.3.2.9. Con: Capitalism can utilize its eco-friendly principles to combat pollution, and if optimized properly, can reverse climate change instead of creating it.
1.3.2.9.1. Pro: Capitalism is based on supply and demand. When people demand certain item, it will be produced. If there is no demand then supply is removed and production stopped. Applying this knowledge could lead towards pollution reduction and climate change reversal.
1.3.2.9.1.1. Pro: [Artificial scarcity](https://www.utne.com/economy/artificial-scarcity-zm0z15uzsau) happens in a capitalistic society. If utilized, people can buy less of products, which leads to fewer products created overall and less pollution generation as a result.
1.3.2.9.1.1.1. Con: Artificial scarcity does not take away the fact that there might be stores of a product that are not released to consumers. The destruction is already done before the artificial scarcity is created.
1.3.2.9.2. Pro: Products can be made to remove pollution and the production of it to reverse climate change.
1.3.2.9.2.1. Pro: Some products can turn trash into products, so landfills can decrease its size.
1.3.2.9.2.2. Pro: Products can absorb greenhouse gases to eliminate their effects on the climate.
1.3.2.10. Pro: Humanity can't slow down the rate that it is polluting fast enough for the effects to be remedied.
1.3.2.10.1. Pro: There are too many humans, and we are still growing.
1.3.2.10.2. Con: Every nation on Earth \(except the US\) are treating climate change seriously \(i.e. war-like manner\) through joining/pledging to the [Paris Accord](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/paris-climate-agreement-everything-you-need-know).
1.3.2.11. Con: Capitalism involves both supply and demand. If people demand green energy, capitalists will seek to provide it and profit from it.
1.3.2.11.1. Pro: [Sixty percent](http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/stakeholder_trends_insights/sustainable_brands/survey_60_americans_resolving_more_env) of Americans are leaning towards a more environmentally friendly lifestyles. Future generations are likely to follow suit in greater numbers.
1.3.2.11.1.1. Con: Regardless of what people say they want, the [evidence](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/co2-emissions-reached-an-all-time-high-in-2018/) suggests they are very much unwilling to or incapable of putting their money where their mouth is.
1.3.2.11.2. Con: Many people feel unsure about the idea of radically changing the economy *before* we can start reducing fossil fuel use. Better to reduce fossil fuels and in the process of doing that, free market fundamentalism may wither away.
1.4. Pro: Sustainable efforts show promise for reversing climate change.
1.4.1. Pro: Wildlife conservation efforts are having a [positive impact](https://wildnet.org/protecting-wildlife-the-untapped-solution-to-the-climate-crisis/) on climate change.
1.4.1.1. Con: Biodiversity continues to decline as we further exacerbate the ongoing mass extinction event.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Expanding their native land through better agricultural practices and restoration methods can encourage population growth.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Shunning practices that harm endangered populations help \(such as the exotic pet market\).
1.4.1.4. Pro: Donating to organizations/sanctuaries that help wildlife can help.
1.4.2. Pro: On a small scale, biomimicry shows promise for supporting climate change reversal efforts. The impact would be powerful if applied on a [larger scale](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/activity-database/rainwater-harvesting-system-to-reduce-climate-change-vulnerability).
1.4.3. Pro: According to researchers, [repurposing CO2](https://today.tamu.edu/2021/11/10/repurposing-carbon-dioxide-may-be-key-to-net-zero-emissions/)(the researchers said one of the advantages of this chemical process is that depending on which transition metal is used, copper or nickel for example, different products can be made. The carbon dioxide can be repurposed for making a variety of carbonaceous products, such as propanol for medicines or ethanol for fuels, whose value and versatilities are much more significant.) may reduce carbon emissions to a net zero.
1.4.3.1. Con: So far, most CO2 repurposing schemes generate [more emissions](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2308935-most-schemes-to-capture-and-reuse-carbon-actually-increase-emissions/) overall.
1.4.3.2. Pro: For instance, [Biochar can be used to sequester](https://www.google.com/search?q=biochar+for+carbon+sequestration) unlimited amounts of atmospheric carbon, and it makes good topsoil allowing carbon-neutral desert land to become carbon-negative biochar-producing land, and the "wood liquor" extracted from the biomass could be refined into gasoline. Of course, [ramping up to the point where biochar sequestration is sequestering thirty gigatonnes a year](https://e360.yale.edu/features/refilling_the_carbon_sink_biochars_potential_and_pitfalls) would require massive, distributed, investment, perhaps unification of humanity towards this purpose.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Biochar is [not the best idea](https://e360.yale.edu/features/refilling_the_carbon_sink_biochars_potential_and_pitfalls) as it involves burning of matter, which requires energy, could possibly larger problems on a large-scale \(where is all the matter going to come from to sustain the practice?\), and takes a lot of effort to get started \(massive plants because no one has built it on a large-scale\).
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: The [making of biochar](http://www.biochar.info/index.cfm?view=52.2&lan=en) is self feeding because it uses the synthetic gasses that comes off of waste wood as it is being heated in the absence of oxygen. The synthetic gas that is released during the process \(called pyrolysis\), is highly flammable and provides more than enough heat to perpetuate the process \(the extra synthetic gas can be used to generate bio-renewable-electricity\). Since the plan is to use waste wood, it makes sustainable use of forest industry biomass waste.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: Biochar involves the [removal of oxygen](https://permaculturenews.org/2010/11/18/beware-the-biochar-initiative/) from the atmosphere, which is the opposite of what the world needs, especially in times of deforestation.
1.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: A more sustainable effort would be to chip wood and bury it underground, as it uses less resources and steps than biochar.
1.4.3.2.1.4. Con: Chipping wood and burying it underground has no benefit for soils and can actually be detrimental for plants as it robs nitrogen from soil.   Conversion of waste forest products into biochar for soil enhancement has long term soil benefits, which include drought tolerance.  Carbon captured from the atmosphere through photosynthesis that is buried in this manner is resilient to decomposition and is therefore considered by the UNFCCC as a method of both climate change mitigation and adaptation.
1.4.3.2.1.5. Con: The making of biochar does not consume oxygen... it is a pyrolysis process that is performed in the absence of or near absence of oxygen and therefor does not involve "burning" or results in very little "burning" of wood.  Moreover, the introduction of biochar into soils actually increases plant productivity, which contributes to more production of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.  All good for the planet's atmosphere.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Biochar is not necessary if plant matter for it is used instead as ground cover to protect topsoil from losing CO2.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: [Biochar is an excellent method of carbon sequestration.](http://www.airterra.ca)
1.4.3.2.4. Con: Biochar could create issues if not done correctly. Proactive measures should be taken to avoid these issues, otherwise biochar efforts may become counterproductive.
1.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: Biochar could create air pollutants, like [PAHs and dioxins](http://biochar.international/the-biochar-opportunity/biochar-production-and-by-products/), if heated at too high of temperatures.
1.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: Not all biochars are equal, as [some are more productive than others](https://e360.yale.edu/features/as_uses_of_biochar_expand_climate_benefits_still_uncertain). Some biochars may be counterproductive if they take more effort to make than use.
1.4.3.2.4.3. Con: Clearly, we are in an early state, and so biochar needs to be carefully researched and developed.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Energy conservation will create much new work which will pay for itself in energy cost savings.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Renewable energy requires a completely new, very extensive industry around energy storage.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Modes of energy storage include \(1\) Potential energy \(water and solids \(2\) thermal \(e.g. molten salt\) \(3\) hydrogen \(4\) compressed gas.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Far reaching changes to the way we run our economy and society will be required to put us on a sustainable path.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: The economic changes required for sustainability are based on three axioms: \(1\) It is impossible to expand forever into a finite space \(2\) it is impossible to take forever from a finite resource \(3\) everything on the surface of Earth is interconnected.
1.4.3.5.2. Pro: Societal changes require everyone to cooperate, at every level of society: Individual, family, community, business, Government, nations and international institutions.
1.4.3.6. Pro: Ocean fertilisation by adding iron and other nutrients can produce blooms of phytoplankton that can capture CO2, but it needs to be carefully researched so that the blooms form in places where down-welling will take them to the deep ocean.
1.4.3.7. Pro: This requires first, energy conservation, second, a big transition to renewable energy, and third, development of means to sequester CO2 from the air.
1.4.4. Pro: Some measures focused on improving the health of humans are shown to positively impact climate change.
1.4.4.1. Pro: For instance, walking and cycling instead of using the car promotes health by increasing exercise and reducing air pollution.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Eating more vegetables and less meat will promote health and reduce our greenhouse emissions.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Even if everyone was vegan \(when combined with other efforts\), then the climate would likely still rise by about [1C](https://www.motherjones.com/food/2019/04/meat-beef-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions-hamburger-plant-based-impossible-burger-mushrooms-vegetarian-vegan/).
1.4.5. Con: There is still time, as there's about [20 years left](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html) before the global situation is 'not controllable by humankind' anymore.
1.4.6. Con: The only proof available shows that we can reduce our impact on climate change, but not reverse it.
1.4.6.1. Pro: [CO2 can be taken from the air](https://www.fastcompany.com/40421871/this-machine-just-started-sucking-co2-out-of-the-air-to-save-us-from-climate-change) and/or given a new use, which reduces the greenhouse effects of it.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: [Bhutan is a carbon-negative country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lc_dlVrg5M) and hopes to help others succeed as well towards this.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: Emission certificates or new laws may help to reduce CO2 emission.
1.4.6.1.4. Pro: [Atmospheric CO2 can be used to synthesize proteins for human consumption](https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/protein-powder-made-from-microbes-electricity-co2-water.htm). This could reduce the massive CO2 amounts generated by agriculture by not needing to grow food.
1.4.6.1.5. Pro: [No-till farming](http://www.aksik.org/sites/default/files/media/image/2017-04/ag-conv-call-out-posters-Final_Page_1.jpg) could prevent CO2 loss in topsoil that plants directly put there from the air.
1.4.6.1.6. Pro: Some [materials absorb 1,000 times more CO2 than trees](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-30/artificial-tree-part-solution-climate-change-these-guys-think-so) and could become artificial trees themselves.
1.4.6.2. Con: Paradoxically, we must hope that there is some degree of truth in the claims of the climate contrarians.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Statistics and trends are showing that [climate change is irreversible](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903).
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: The biodiversity loss cannot be recovered if animals go extinct. Animals that're unknown to mankind will not have their DNA documented somewhere to restore them from such fate.
1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: If animals are able to [adapt quickly to rising global temperatures](https://theconversation.com/how-australias-animals-and-plants-are-changing-to-keep-up-with-the-climate-74247) then they will be able to recover when climate change is reversed.
1.4.6.3.1.2. Pro: [Evolution cannot keep up with climate change](https://gizmodo.com/evolution-can-t-keep-up-to-the-blistering-pace-of-clima-1789302795).
1.4.6.3.1.3. Pro: By our actions, many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gases that make up our atmosphere have been altered. Climate change-caused extinctions are permanent, so it follows therefore that we cannot wind back the clock.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: Certain activities are creating even higher demands on resources than ever before.
1.4.6.3.2.1. Pro: Fracking releases methane into the atmosphere, a greenhouse gas that is [86 times worse than CO2 at trapping heat](https://thinkprogress.org/methane-leaks-erase-climate-benefit-of-fracked-gas-countless-studies-find-8b060b2b395d/).
1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro: Cryptocurrencies demand tacks onto current electricity usages. For example, [Bitcoin uses as much energy as Denmark](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoins-insane-energy-consumption-explained/)
1.4.6.3.2.3. Pro: The world's population is increasing, creating an even greater demand on resources. This is accelerating global warming, not slowing it down.
1.4.6.3.2.3.1. Con: The millennial generation is having less children than generations before \([past the 'replacement level'](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/millennials-say-no-to-kids-population-replacement-level-turns-negative/article/2640743)\)
1.4.6.3.3. Pro: The Earth's temperatures will continue to rise. At the very least the rate will [level off but never go down](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-07/scenariotempgraph_0.jpg).
1.4.6.3.4. Con: Greenhouse gases were drastically higher when the dinosaurs walked, and earth survived just fine. Climate change can always be reversed, the question is simply how much effort over what period of time.
1.4.6.3.4.1. Con: Earth survived, but the dinosaurs didn't. Interestingly, climate change from one or another cause may have played a part in the dinosaur extinction. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event)
1.4.6.3.5. Con: A change of lifestyle, society, and massive tree planting can reverse climate change.
1.4.6.3.6. Pro: More Amazon Rainforest is destroyed every year \([20k sq. mi.](http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm)\) than is recovered \([9k sq. mi.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rainforests/tropical-rainforests-are-regrowing-now-what-idUSTRE50B5CY20090112)\). At this rate, the rainforest will not recover fast enough to reverse the damage.
1.4.6.3.6.1. Con: We can plant much more trees.
1.4.6.3.6.1.1. Pro: Not only do they capture CO2, but also they cool our cities, provide their own microclimate and even create rain clouds, provide us with forage for some of our animals, wood for our structures \(new trees can grow in the places that old ones have been felled\), provide food and medicines and finally they nurture our spirits.
1.4.6.3.7. Con: There's [statistical evidence](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html) that shows that climate models don't always match reality and that climate models cannot always predict the climate with any certainty. Climate science is still in it's infancy.
1.4.6.3.7.1. Con: [Eunice Foote](https://qz.com/1277175/eunice-foote-proved-the-greenhouse-gas-effect-but-never-got-the-credit-because-of-sexism/) of upstate NY discovered CO2 was a greenhouse gas in 1856.
1.4.6.3.7.2. Con: Climate modeling is a tricky post-part of the physical science of measuring and studying. We know what's happening and why, but making projections is complex.
1.4.6.3.7.3. Con: A warning that burning coal could adversely effect our climate was published in New Zealand in [1912](https://www.businessinsider.com/newspaper-in-1912-linked-coal-to-climate-change-2018-8).
1.4.6.3.7.4. Con: [Satellites](https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/exploring-the-planets/online/solar-system/earth/orbit.cfm) went up starting in 1972 to study our environment. There are now many international orbiters that study Earth. More are planned.
1.4.6.3.7.5. Con: Aspects on how climate can be influenced \([volcanic activity](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Volcano), [albedo](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/5484/earths-albedo-in-decline), [energy budgets](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance), [carbon cycle](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle), etc.\) have been studied in great detail, which helps with prediction and do match reality.
1.4.6.3.7.6. Pro: Statistics and trends only reflect, but don't display the full extents of reality [enough to give us a complete picture](http://thingswedontknow.com/articles/climate+change). So by their perspective, it's irreversible. If we look at everything available past statistics and trends \(like innovations or political/social will\), we can see our true possibility of reversing it there.
1.4.6.3.7.6.1. Pro: Statistics provide and post-, not a pre-perspective \(indicating what's happening and will happen instead what we can do about it before, during, and after to prevent/reverse it\). So if we use common-sense logic instead, we can be proactive in our behaviors instead so the statistics with warnings never show up.
1.4.6.3.7.6.1.1. Pro: The climate is likely [hysteretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis) in nature. In other words, "reversing" climate change by simply "undoing" what we have done may not actually work. Predicting possible hysteretic effects on the climate is difficult due to the inherent mathematical instabilities observed in [Lorenz-like systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system), such as the climate.
1.4.6.3.7.7. Pro: Statistics and trends are like news, telling what happened after it took place. The damage already done is irreversible, \(i.e. can't be undone\), but that doesn't mean we can't stop its [effects](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/butterfly%20effect) from further damage, nor counteract it \(with an equivalent improvement\). They just say that effects of the event they measured are irreversible, not that it can't be reversed overall.
1.4.6.3.8. Pro: Seafloor spreading, continental drift, volcanism, solar cycles and water vapor transmission must be understood and controlled first. Human factors have little influence on these trends concerning the long term climate.
1.4.6.3.9. Pro: With entropy, all efforts to restore the atmospheric gas balance will still leave a lot of the changes to the world for a very long time. Mitigation might be all we can do at this point, rather than being able to fully reverse it.
1.4.6.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.7.6.1.1.
1.4.6.3.9.2. Pro: “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same water and he is not the same man.” [Heraclitus](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/117526-no-man-ever-steps-in-the-same-river-twice-for), 500 BC 'Reversing' is just an abstract term, a common perception in linear, hierarchic thinking which has caused these great misconceptions & confusions. In real life, nature or climate there is not such thing as going back in time or returning to the same; there is just progression, evolving into a new day ahead and this with or without us.
1.4.6.3.9.3. Pro: Even with the best theoretically possible technology to control the planet's conditions \(i.e. orbital shades, algal engineering, aerosol spraying, genetically modified plants, etc.\), none can be deployed quickly enough or at sufficient scale to halt the process.
1.4.6.3.9.3.1. Pro: It could be possible to deploy sulfur burning at high altitude in aircraft fuel. Quantity similar to a large volcanic eruption has had a temporary cooling effect on the planet. The high sulfur coal burning of the industrial revolution may have had some similar side effects. Sulfur doesn't simply reverse the effect of increased CO2 however.
1.4.6.3.10. Con: Physicist [Stephen Hawking](https://futurism.com/stephen-hawking-we-are-close-to-the-tipping-point-where-global-warming-becomes-irreversible/) warns that we are close to the tipping point, but climate change can be reversed if the human race acts now.
1.4.6.4. Pro: The Paris Agreement's [main goal](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) is to limit global warming to achieve a 'climate neutral' world by mid-century. If there was proof that climate change could be reversed by their efforts, it is likely that doing so would be the aim, not neutralizing it.
1.4.6.4.1. Con: The United States, [one of the](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions) largest emitters, [left](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/4-reasons-trump-was-right-pull-out-the-paris-agreement) the Paris Agreement. Even though we [recently](https://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-climate-agreement-11611254971) came back in, some countries not able to follow through on worldwide climate action shows that documents like the Paris Agreement aren't sustainable: because countries might withdraw at any time from anything, thereby negating everything they worked for and more. This weakness is its failure. Until documents solidify worldwide effort, not much can get done.
1.4.7. Con: There is not enough concern about climate change to reverse it.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Because climate change also occurs [naturally](https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/causes-climate-change) over time, [many](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/12/strong-winds-climate-change-have-failed-move-opinions-many-americans/) believe attempts to reverse it are worthless.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Many people in authority, with influence over the public opinion, do not believe in climate change.
1.4.7.3. Pro: [Political bias](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/12/strong-winds-climate-change-have-failed-move-opinions-many-americans/)(Democratic concern about climate change has grown, but Republican concern has shrunk) makes it impossible for people to come together on the issue of climate change, thus creating a stalemate.
1.5. Pro: Technology provides solutions for reversing climate change.
1.5.1. Con: Technological solutions only work if humans agree to using them. Since many humans [resist](https://www.bentley.edu/news/heres-why-people-resist-new-technologies) technological change, our ability to reverse climate change is difficult to gauge.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Telecommuting is an underplayed, technological advanced option that could [curb climate change](https://www.lifewire.com/how-telecommuting-is-good-for-the-environment-2378101), if not reverse it. Instead, workers are still forced to actually show up at an office, when it isn't necessary.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Telecommuting is an option that can help, but is ignored by the workforce by forcing employees to work in office when their job can be done remotely. Therefore, even with technological advancements, humans are not taking full advantage of it to reverse climate change.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: This is a denial of climate reality by companies who could [easily remedy this](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-02-16/telecommuting-is-growing-but-still-not-unanimously-embraced) situation by implementing telecommuting.
1.5.2. Pro: Humans are making major advancements towards atmospheric modification that suggest we will be able to alter the climate, and thus reverse negative changes.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Humans are, in fact, quickly learning methods of positively impacting climate for the better. More effort is needed to raise this awareness amongst Earth's near 8 billion humans. Sites [AirTerra Canada](https://www.airterra.ca/) will have a better chance of accomplishing this.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Even if was true that humans are quickly learning methods to potentially reduce their carbon footprint, the extent to which many have to change their lifestyles discourage many from taking the methods into practice.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Oil, for instance, is by all denominators the most effective energy resource we have, and it is difficult and will take a long time to try to become independent from it and completely substitute it and other fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.
1.5.2.2. Con: Though humanity has proven itself capable of utilizing natural resources and controlling how much they take out and how they use these resources, the market's demand for energy cannot be as easily controlled, and this demand restricts how much fossil fuels can be controlled as it's reduction below the demand would lead to economic and political instability. For demand of energy to change, people's lives and habits would need to change, which is very difficult to make people do.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Market forces are already at work as solar energy technologies prices fall. Once renewable energy is cheaper than fossil carbon, renewable provision will increase greatly.
1.5.2.3. Con: The cause of climate change is the combination of the human attempt to control the environment through artifice and the twin explosions of population and improved quality of life; we cannot reverse climate change because we cannot decide to quickly starve everyone of the benefits of industrial production while using the diverted and declining resources to create sustainable systems.
1.5.2.4. Con: Thus far, humans are not able to modify the atmosphere enough to create significant improvements in the climate.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: The process for large scale modification has yet to be proven. Without testing on a larger scale, there is [no way](https://www.livescience.com/geoengineering-the-weather)(Currently, the one factor that could make space geoengineering so successful is also the one that could create the greatest failure — the scale. In contrast to choosing an aspect of the weather to change on Earth, which enables precise changes to be made, altering the weather from space focuses on the entire planet. \n\nThese large-scale adjustments can't be properly tested until the mission is launched for real. And nobody can know for sure how the planet would respond to a sudden cooling and reduction in light.) to know if these advancements can work.
1.5.2.5. Con: Because we don't know how exactly man-made climate change started \(the more we find out, the more we realize we don't know, as it's long before anyone living on Earth was born, such as with the [mammoths](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/article/future-woolly-mammoth/)\) compared to what the baseline temperature was then in proportion to each event, we don't have enough information to make an adequate decision to fix it.
1.5.2.5.1. Con: In response to a\) The [evidence is now incontrovertible](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) with regard to "how exactly climate change happened", which immediately leads to b\) we know very clearly what things to do to slow it down and many things that would reverse the extra CO2 and NH3 in the atmosphere i.e. [Limiting the Magnitude of Future Climate Change](http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/Limiting_Report_Brief_final.pdf).
1.5.2.5.2. Con: Just because we don't know for sure that trees and other long lived plants can solve the problem, we do know for absolute certain that they will absorb lots of the CO2 we've produced, especially if we plant millions and millions of them. That's enough reason to get started doing at least that right now.
1.5.2.5.3. Con: Not knowing enough is not a justification for inaction. Big interests play this card all the time, let's not buy it.
1.5.2.5.4. Con: It is possible to get the knowledge needed if we can get to a point where we can work within our means by decreasing the immensity of what's happening \(like not contributing to climate change further and also reversing some of the effects that already took place\) to where it's close enough to allow for working on a solution.
1.5.2.6. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.9.3.
1.5.2.7. Pro: Global warming could change into global cooling under the right circumstances, some \(but not all\) of which we understand and can control, the rest fluctuating without any effort from us.
1.5.2.8. Con: To perfectly remove manmade climate change from existence 100% is practically impossible, due to all the details involved and the current limitations of humans.
1.5.2.8.1. Pro: Manmade climate change may exist past the boundaries that humans have traveled to \(maybe in the universe or inside the planet\). Being able to get to places we haven't before to reverse climate change is infeasible and impractical, if not impossible.
1.5.2.9. Pro: Weather modification technology is making [substantial advances](https://now.northropgrumman.com/storm-control-with-weather-machine-technology/) toward more precise weather manipulation, making it possible to prevent specific environmental changes.
1.5.3. Pro: New technologies are also coming on stream that can capture and fix gaseous CO2.
1.5.3.1. Con: As of 2021, the [carbon capture, utilisation and storage \(CCSU\) industry](https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-industry-and-transformation)(Despite new projects coming online in 2020 and a large number under development, CCUS in industry and fuel transformation is not on track to reach the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario level of almost 1 150 Mt CO2 per year by 2030 \(370 Mt CO2 per year in industrial applications and 775 Mt CO2 per year in fuel transformation\).) is not on track to reach its net zero emissions target by 2050.
1.5.3.2. Con: [Technological Carbon Capture and Sequestration is highly energy and space inefficient.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41247-020-00080-5)("at the scale of 1 Gt removal, the volume of CO2 would require a pipeline infrastructure that exceeds the current global oil handling infrastructure." \n\n"To capture 1 gigatonne of CO2 \(1 GtCO2, just one-fortieth of current global CO2 emissions\) would need nearly twice the amount of wind and solar electricity now produced globally. "\n\n"to remove 1Gt of CO2 using solar-powered DAC would require a land area ten \(10\) times the size of the state of Delaware."\n\n"Public policy decisions are being finance-driven, not science-driven") To sequester 1 Gt of CO2 would require pipeline infrastructure equal to that of todays global oil infrastructure. Energetically, it only makes sense to power DAC and CCUS after we've transitioned off of fossil fuels.
1.5.4. Pro: [Technology](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/6_Technologies_NASA_is_Advancing_to_Send_Humans_to_Mars) makes it possible for humans, the contributors of climate change, to leave Earth and colonize space. With less humans, fewer resources will be used, giving Earth the opportunity to heal.
1.5.4.1. Pro: If anything, space mining \(such as asteroids\) could reduce the need to mine Earth. This is beneficial as [mining is a massive consumer of the world's water supply](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wateruse-diagrams.html).
1.5.4.2. Con: Earth's temperature won't change just because we leave \(due to non-human factors, pre-destruction, etc.\); therefore, relocating to another planet alone would not resolve climate change.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: The earth have been the "victim" of climate changes way before the humans and might have more way after. More science research is needed to "predict" the future of climate change if we leave.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: The climate change that was started by humans will still continue regardless of whether humans are on Earth or not \(because the temperature-rising factors are already set in motion: like ice melting\).
1.5.4.2.3. Pro: If people leave Earth then they will not give themselves a chance to potentially reverse its effects.
1.5.4.2.4. Con: Humans are the biggest influence on climate change at the moment and them leaving is best for Earth's future.
1.5.4.2.4.1. Con: More research should be done to see if people leaving Earth will make an impact on climate change. Humans might be the biggest influence now but the consequences of them leaving Earth is not determined. The claim that it is "best for Earth's future" can't therefore be made.
1.5.4.2.5. Pro: Climate change was [not started by](https://www.kialo.com/the-earth-have-been-the-victim-of-climate-changes-way-before-the-humans-and-might-have-more-way-after-more-science-8337.58?path=8337.0~8337.1_8337.292_8337.364_8337.48-8337.57_8337.58) humans.
1.5.4.3. Con: Leaving Earth requires a consequent amount of resources that will likely cause more damage.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: To prevent the population from increasing, shuttles would have to continuously remove people from Earth. The continuous shuttling causes a continuous drain on resources.
1.5.4.4. Con: The population that remains on Earth will grow again and reproduce the same scenario as before.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: The number of people added to the world is about [a million per day](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: Any space left on Earth due to someone leaving might be filled by up by a new population.
1.5.5. Con: Climate change is accelerating \(due to [feedback loops](https://www.climatecommunication.org/climate/climate_feedbacks/)\) past what humanity has the technical capacity to reverse. We might be able to slow it down, but reversing it isn't feasible with current technology.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Positive feedback loops are [already](https://www.decodedscience.org/melting-permafrost-arctic-tale-two-feedbacks/57919) well underway.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: [Ice \(white/transparent\) reflects sunlight](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=40932) \(as white light reflects and black light absorbs\) out of Earth, which keeps Earth cooler. The more ice melts, the more light gets absorbed and heats Earth \(less white surfaces; earth is less reflective than ice\).
1.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: One of the reasons that the light absorbs more comes from [beautiful snowflakes melting into goopy-looking ones, which accelerate ice melting in Greenland](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=76916). These new ice crystals make the ice sheet darker \(due to their roundness and clumping together\).
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: Melting permafrost releases carbon and methane \(greenhouse gases\), which traps more heat, causing [more](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/13/methane-release-from-melting-permafrost-could-trigger-dangerous-global-warming) permafrost melting/release of greenhouse gases.
1.5.5.1.3. Pro: Plants cannot live in too high of CO2 conditions. Thus, the forests that decrease CO2 levels would instead go away because of the increase in it, thus causing a loop.
1.5.5.1.4. Pro: When ice sheets melt, the water causes glaciers to slide off faster.
1.5.5.1.5. Con: As [trees get older, they absorb more CO2](http://science.time.com/2014/01/15/study-shows-older-trees-absorb-more-carbon/) \(which defies prior convention\).
1.5.5.1.6. Pro: [More swimming pools](http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/06/19/california-pool-construction-in-drought-could-hit-highest-level-since-2007/) are being built as climate change heats up the Earth.
1.5.5.1.6.1. Pro: People swim in the oceans less \(due to climate change\), which [increases the demand for indoor swimming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319347675_Impact_of_Climate_Change_on_the_Preferred_Season_for_Outdoor_Water_Activities).
1.5.5.1.6.1.1. Pro: [Sunscreen chemicals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-set-to-become-first-state-to-ban-sunscreen-with-chemicals-harmful-to-coral-reefs/) from swimming affect coral reefs.
1.5.5.1.6.1.2. Pro: Transitioning to swimming pools does not remove the climate-related sources that cause oceans to be difficult to swim in. The action just provides a band-aid and not a solution to the problem.
1.5.5.1.6.1.3. Pro: Oceanic recreational activities decline.
1.5.5.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Divers are less likely to [dive without coral reefs](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:axkzlufcnm0J:www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/PDF/sutt3583/sutt3583.pdf+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), which causes a feedback loop of its own \(the more the ocean acidifies, the people become aware of/take action on the changes - as they partake in less outdoor activities\).
1.5.5.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: People [perceive](https://climateinterpreter.org/content/ocean-acidification-effects-humans) that with ocean acidification, the ocean is less possible to swim in.
1.5.5.1.6.1.3.3. Pro: [Surf breaks go away](http://www.beachapedia.org/Climate_Change) with climate change, removing people's ability to surf.
1.5.5.1.6.1.3.4. Pro: [Beaches get eroded](http://www.beachapedia.org/Climate_Change) with climate change. When this happens, people are less likely to go to the beach and swim.
1.5.5.1.6.1.3.5. Pro: [Algae blooms](http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/scientists-work-predict-and-prevent-algae-blooms) make swimming difficult.
1.5.5.1.6.1.4. Pro: Toxic and hazardous chemicals are overtaking oceans.
1.5.5.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Some beaches are getting [polluted](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-dirty-dozen-12-most-polluted-beaches-in-the-us-2009-7).
1.5.5.1.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: People can get [ill](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/open-water-a-future-of-polluted-swimming/) from them.
1.5.5.1.6.1.4.2. Pro: [Plastic](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/open-water-a-future-of-polluted-swimming/) is taking over oceans.
1.5.5.1.6.1.5. Con: These issues are being worked on through various [methods](http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/how-you-can-help-ocean).
1.5.5.1.6.2. Pro: This is a feedback loop, because construction and maintenance causes the Earth to heat up more. Then, as the Earth heats up more, people's demand for swimming pools goes up.
1.5.5.1.6.2.1. Pro: Swimming pools use lots of water to create \([tens of thousands of gallons](http://www.texasthestateofwater.org/screening/pdf_docs/texas_water_facts/facts3.pdf)\) and more to maintain.
1.5.5.1.6.2.2. Pro: The construction and maintenance requires resources \(concrete, chemicals...\), land \(potentially of forests and reflective sand of beaches\), and water \(which gets strained with global warming\). These contribute to climate change.
1.5.5.1.6.2.3. Pro: This is seen in [California](http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/06/19/california-pool-construction-in-drought-could-hit-highest-level-since-2007/), with their drought.
1.5.5.1.6.2.4. Pro: Swimming pools cause environmental destruction, especially if they are removed, such as the [one connected to the ocean in Hawaii](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-improbable-technology-of-swimming-pools-built-in-the-ocean/371368/).
1.5.5.2. Con: If we do not at least try, we will not succeed at reversing climate change.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: The most severe possibilities suggest that we're wasting our time.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: All projections have a margin of error, which in some cases give us some agency.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: Sometimes little actions are enough to lead to bigger actions. "Nipping in the bud" issues helps to prevent them from becoming bigger. If issues are too big, nipping little parts of the whole prevent so much, that this could lead to reversals little seen with no help at all.
1.5.5.2.3. Pro: If small actions are taken, they build momentum and support that climb to higher individuals. Sometimes it just takes one person to change \[the mindset of\] the world
1.5.5.3. Con: We could identify the mechanisms driving climate change by which these feedback loops operate and break their cycle. Then we would have a chance of slowing/reversing climate change by controlling the mechanisms behind it.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: The feedback loop of melting ice caps reducing the amount of sunlight reflected to space \(causing further melting\) could be broken by building man-made reflective surfaces to break the feedback cycle.
1.5.5.3.1.1. Pro: Replacing roofs and pavements with [more reflective versions](https://physicsworld.com/a/reflective-roofs-and-pavements-could-fight-climate-change/#:~:text=Replacing%20roofs%20and%20pavements%20with%20more%20reflective%20versions%20could%20lower%20global%20temperatures%20by%20up%20to%200.07%C2%A0%C2%B0C%2C%20equivalent%20to%20a%20reduction%20in%20carbon%2Ddioxide%20emissions%20of%20about%20150%C2%A0billion%20tonnes.) could lower global temperatures by up to 0.07 °C, equivalent to a reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions of about 150 billion tonnes.
1.5.5.3.2. Con: Those feedback mechanisms are massive, widely dispersed and in some cases well out of our reach, e.g. deep polar methane clathrates, permafrost zones etc. We have no technologies that would come close to controlling them unfortunately at this moment.
1.5.5.4. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.5.5.5. Con: 'Points of no return' have lost all credibility since they are constantly changing, being pushed out. [Failed Tipping Points](http://www.climatedepot.com/2016/09/21/history-keeps-proving-prophets-of-eco-apocalypse-wrong/)
1.5.5.5.1. Con: There have been hundreds of predictions. Cherry picking a few false ones is not a valid argument.
1.5.5.5.1.1. Pro: [Study debunks idea that older models were inaccurate](https://www.science.org/content/article/even-50-year-old-climate-models-correctly-predicted-global-warming).
1.5.5.6. Con: Nature has the capability to keep the climate in check and reverse damage caused by people through [negative feedback mechanisms](https://www.reference.com/science/feedback-mechanism-29d813cb24ba73d9) that keep the climate in balance.
1.5.5.6.1. Pro: Though [warming is resuming](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/), this [statistic](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html) shows that when there is man-made climate change, the temperature stays for the most part neutral. So, we can reverse climate change if we change our actions \(like be eco-friendly\), as nature's forces do the rest will bring to turn the neutral line into a negative slope.
1.5.5.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5.5.6.1.2. Con: The "Pause" was part of the natural variation of the temperature record caused in part by a series of cooling La Nina events.
1.5.5.6.2. Pro: Earth experiences a [circular orbit](https://www.thoughtco.com/milankovitch-cycles-overview-1435096) around the Sun right now, which causes a rise in global temperatures \(due to equal sunlight year-round\)...However, according to [Milankovitch cycles](http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/natural-cycle#section-11), when the orbit becomes more elliptical \(around 100k yrs from now\), less sunlight throughout the year will cause the climate to cool.
1.5.5.6.2.1. Con: Distance to the sun is way less relevant than atmosphere composition. For instance, Venus is way hotter than Mercury, even though it's way further away from the sun.
1.5.5.6.3. Con: Nature cannot keep up with the climate change because of the acceleration humans has created changes much faster than ever seen before.
1.5.5.6.3.1. Pro: The vegetation and fauna thus cannot keep up and will die. - This changes ecosystems and will therefore affect humans.
1.5.5.6.4. Pro: Changes in the Sun's activity could reverse some of the effects of climate change.
1.5.5.6.4.1. Con: Based on total solar irradiance \(TSI\) [we should be in a cooling period based on the sun's activity](https://www.skepticalscience.com/should_earth_be_cooling.html).
1.5.5.6.4.2. Con: Nature is working against the climate at times, as the Sun is getting bigger and hotter every year, causing the Earth to eventually \(in about 1 billion years \([1](https://phys.org/news/2015-02-sun-wont-die-billion-years.html), [2](https://usm.maine.edu/planet/sun-getting-hotter-if-so-why-will-earth-eventually-become-too-hot-life)\)\) be too hot to live on \(when the Sun becomes a white dwarf that eventually burns out\) \([1](https://www.universetoday.com/18847/life-of-the-sun/)\). To rely on nature to keep the climate in check does not make sense in this regard.
1.5.5.6.4.2.1. Con: The probability is that the human species has gone extinct within a billion years \(About 1/14 of the current age of the universe\), and if they haven't, they have most likely already developed the technology to travel beyond the solar system to an earth-like planet somewhere else, which has a different star than the sun, thus making the heat of the sun irrelevant for our survival.
1.5.5.6.4.2.2. Con: The sun has a 22-year solar cycle; its output fluctuates, but its impact on the climate is very [small](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/effect-of-sun-on-climate-faq.html).
1.5.5.6.4.2.3. Con: The development of the modern scientific age has occurred over the last 400 years, and we're now building quantum computers. 1 billion years gives us 2 and a half million more 400 year periods. That's a lot of time for science to get better.
1.5.5.6.4.3. Con: Man-made climate change progresses much faster than changes in Sun activity or distance to the Sun. Human activities would likely reverse any improvements made by the Sun.
1.5.5.6.4.4. Pro: The [Maunder minimum](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/7122/chilly-temperatures-during-the-maunder-minimum) is an example of such times.
1.5.5.6.4.5. Con: Such events are only temporary and rare. The climate issues can come back after the end of those events.
1.5.5.6.4.5.1. Con: People can use these temporary changes in their favor by combining it with their own efforts to tip the scale.
1.5.5.6.4.5.2. Con: Even if "temporary" \(which can be a long time when we are at the scale of the universe\) the climate change would've been reversed. Therefore, yes it can be reversed.
1.5.5.6.5. Con: This is the first time man has affected the climate. There is no history to say nature can resolve it, as [temperatures keep rising](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page2.php).
1.5.5.6.5.1. Con: In fact, there is a risk of a threshold change to a "HotHouse Earth" state, whereby the existing negative feedback loops no longer function to keep us in interglacial cycles. [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810141115](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810141115)
1.5.5.6.6. Con: The cooling effect is not enough to prevent warming from happening. With more plant growth from greater CO2, the cooling from them is between[0.3 globally](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/cooling-plant-growth.html), whereas the warming is about [1.94C](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/cooling-plant-growth.html), so not near enough.
1.5.5.6.7. Pro: The ocean conveyor belt can protect the Earth from climate change warming the planet.
1.5.5.6.7.1. Pro: Due to the [ocean conveyor belt](https://serc.carleton.edu/eslabs/carbon/6a.html), excess CO2 in the atmosphere gets absorbed by the ocean and stays there for hundreds of years, which keeps the CO2 in the air from warming the planet.
1.5.5.6.7.2. Pro: With global warming, the ocean conveyor counteracts it by playing a role in [global cooling](https://www.livescience.com/3751-global-warming-chill-planet.html) from it.
1.5.5.6.7.3. Con: In response to increasing greenhouse gases, the AMOC is projected to decline between 0% to more than 50% over the 21st century. So, no the "ocean conveyor" or AMOC is unlikely to stop, slow down and certainly not reverse climate change.[Observations, inferences, and mechanisms of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: A review. American Geophysical Union](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015RG000493)
1.5.5.6.8. Con: If humans destroy the negative feedback mechanisms that nature typically has \(which we have\), then it won't be able to keep the climate in check anymore.
1.5.5.7. Pro: Policy makers have vested interests \(industry money\) to ignore signals of overshoot and straining sinks. Action will be taken too late, and then we will have no way to prevent the feedback loops.
1.5.5.8. Con: The past has shown how dramatically technological advancements can shift. This means a resolution for feedback loops may be in the near future.
1.5.6. Con: With every year of inaction, there are fewer tools that we could work with to counteract climate change as well as more damage that's irreversible.
1.5.7. Pro: The world is transitioning away from the industrial age and towards a technological age where unlimited products could be produced without using resources \(a.k.a. [post-scarcity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klQ7bb8bBsQ)\). Combined with removing the damage and sources of it, a net negative impact could provide a reversal.
1.5.7.1. Con: [Scientists have discovered that a lot of the byproducts of our burning of fossil fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/features/air-pollutions-upside-a-brake-on-global-warming) -- namely aerosols -- are actually having a cooling effect on the environment.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Some aerosols, however, are clear and remove protective layers from the atmosphere \(such as [CFCs and the ozone layer](http://theozonehole.com/cfc.htm)\), so those would increase the radiation sent to Earth instead of keep it away.
1.5.7.1.2. Con: Aerosols might block out light, but the light that does stay gets [trapped and accumulates](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EKETQwzX9g4/VaPlHfItgKI/AAAAAAAABAk/oqyPocZQNkw/s1600/GreenhouseEffect.jpg). That is why the temperature trend is a rise instead of a fall. Remove the aerosols and the world can cool.
1.5.7.1.3. Con: Chemicals can have a warming or cooling effect, depending on which atmospheric level it's located \(like [ozone](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/greenhouse/ozone-profile-lrg.en.png)\). So there may be a cooling effect on the environment, but it's not where humans are located. Like ozone, [CO2](http://web.archive.org/web/20180404194309/https://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/strato_cooling.asp) allows for stratospheric/ionospheric cooling, but warmer surface levels.
1.5.7.1.4. Con: The [0.5-1C](https://e360.yale.edu/features/air-pollutions-upside-a-brake-on-global-warming) is a lot, but if the world has a hard time keeping the Earth under [2C](https://e360.yale.edu/features/air-pollutions-upside-a-brake-on-global-warming), even1C isn't going to keep the Earth from warming.
1.5.7.2. Con: There is currently [no meaningful evidence of decoupling between industrial production and ecological damage.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901120304342)("the evidence does not suggest that decoupling towards ecological sustainability is happening at a global \(or even regional\) scale."\n\n"the claim that the economy can grow while at the same time the “environmental bads” diminish needs further support"\n\n"In the absence of robust evidence, the goal of decoupling rests partly on faith.")
1.5.7.3. Con: [Mineral resources are becoming more scarc](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41247-016-0004-x)e; a major issue for any plan to address climate change that involves large scale construction and/or production of new good.
1.6. Con: Human populations continue to grow exponentially, making it impossible to reverse man-made climate change.
1.6.1. Con: Population growth is [not exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth#:~:text=The%20UN%20Population%20Division%20report,time%20of%20close%20to%20zero.).
1.6.2. Con: The world's richest 10% produce 50% of global CO2 emissions and the poorest 50% produce only 10% of emissions. So long as the richest significantly reduce their emissions, to be more in line with the global average, then it'd be possible for global population to grow \(for a while longer\) without an increase in global emissions.
1.6.2.1. Con: This is only plausible if the poorest 50% also choose not to increase their consumption/emissions. Since we're already emitting far, far too much, we need a net global reduction every year until global net negative emissions are reached. If developing countries continue to increase their emissions and consumptions; it won't result in a global net reduction even if the top 10% reduce their emissions year/year.
1.6.3. Con: Without a significant population, humans might not be able to perform such significant technological and large-scale procedures as developing a global climate control system, which in fact went into experimental phase recently in [one country](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/view/65553).
1.6.3.1. Con: A truly global climate control system seems way beyond current levels of understanding as well as global coordination that a large population can handle.
1.6.3.2. Con: It's not the population that is required, but general access to resources and technology. A global control system would greatly benefit from AI and automation technologies.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: People need to be replaced, which is difficult to sustain.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: People are prone to 'human error', so this would make a climate control system not have that issue.
1.6.3.2.3. Pro: AI is much cheaper to implement and improve upon.
1.6.3.2.4. Con: AI may be taken advantage of, as seen in the movie [Geostorm](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981128/).
1.6.3.3. Con: The number of people is not as necessary as the number of skilled people for developing and managing climate control systems.
1.6.3.4. Pro: On such a massive scale, it may require people from around the world to monitor it.
1.6.4. Con: Raising [education levels](http://blogs.worldbank.org/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data) and [employment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376695/) for women can effectively control population.
1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.6.5. Con: Carbon free energy production works no matter how many people use it.
1.6.5.1. Con: There is currently no carbon free energy; and there are significant resource bottlenecks in building out low-carbon energy to global scales.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Resources such as nuclear or large hydroelectric [generate no carbon emissions](https://www.mcecleanenergy.org/mce-news/whats-the-difference-between-carbon-free-renewable-energy/#:~:text=a%20resource%20that%20generates%20no%20carbon%20emissions%2C%20such%20as%20nuclear%20or%20large%20hydroelectric).
1.6.5.1.1.1. Con: Nuclear power generates around 12 grams of CO2/KWh and hydro electricity is around 24 grams of CO2/KWh.
1.6.5.1.1.2. Pro: The US Energy Information Administration [claims that](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/nuclear-power-and-the-environment.php#:~:text=Nuclear%20power%20reactors%20do%20not%20produce%20direct%20carbon%20dioxide%20emissions) Nuclear power reactors do not produce direct carbon dioxide emissions.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: The carbon footprint of renewables and nuclear is orders of magnitude lower than fossil fuels. And the International Energy Agency has shown that it's possible to generate 90% of the world's electricity by 2050 from renewables [https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050)
1.6.5.1.2.1. Con: The IEA Net-Zero-By-2050 plan required no new coal plants or oil and gas fields approved as of 2021 and beyond. As of August 2022 there are multiple new coal plants and dozens of new oil and gas fields approved.
1.6.5.1.2.2. Con: The [IEA Critical Minerals Report](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions) casts doubt on the availability of resources required to meet a net-zero goal.
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: [There are significant mineral resource shortages](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions)("lithium, graphite, nickel and rare-earth metals would explode, rising by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900% and 700%, respectively, by 2040."\n\n"“A typical electric car requires six times the mineral inputs of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired power plant,”\n\n"“It has taken on average over 16 years to move mining projects from discovery to first production.” Start tomorrow and new ETM production will begin only after 2035."\n\n"“Mining and mineral processing require large volumes of water”"\n\n"Energy use per pound mined is even trending up"\n\n" a quadrupling of mineral requirements for clean energy technologies by 2040. An even faster transition, to hit net-zero globally by 2050, would require six times more mineral inputs in 2040 than today") involving [key minerals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300926?) if we hope to expand low-carbon energy to global scales.
1.6.5.2. Pro: It can be scaled up as the population grows.
1.6.6. Pro: Although most humans continue to consume and waste resources despite the negative impacts of climate change, implementing population control as a solution is unethical.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Experts theorize that without significant human involvement, carbon emissions and the temperature would gradually [decrease](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/can-we-slow-or-even-reverse-global-warming)(With no further human influence, natural processes would begin to slowly remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and global temperatures would gradually begin to decline).
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: A severe drop in human population \(global flu outbreak, 60-80% die\), or halting of current economic system would remove a lot of the man-made harm caused within a relatively-short period on the world's ecological time scale.
1.7. Con: Some man-made damage is already irreversible.
1.7.1. Pro: There are many aspects of climate change that are considered unavoidable and irreversible. "Characteristics of ocean and cryosphere change include thresholds of abrupt change, long-term changes that cannot be avoided, and irreversibility \(high confidence\). Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation, ice sheet and glacier mass loss, and permafrost degradation are expected to be irreversible on timescales relevant to human societies and ecosystems." IPCC SROCC 2019
1.7.2. Con: Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
1.7.2.1. Pro: An irreversible rise in sea levels could be mitigated by adapting planning regulations, urban design, and building methods.
1.7.2.2. Con: Many aspects of climate change are unavoidable and irreversible on human timeframes. Irreversible means irreversible.
1.7.2.3. Con: Oceanic warming and acidification is [irreversible](https://www.interacademies.org/statement/iap-statement-ocean-acidification#:~:text=Ocean%20acidification%20is%20irreversible%20on%20timescales%20of%20at%20least%20tens%20of%20thousands%20of%20years%3B). This can not be mitigated through other actions.
1.7.3. Pro: [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/16/is-it-too-late-to-prevent-climate-change/)(the effects of human activities on Earth's climate to date are irreversible on the timescale of humans alive today) states that the damage done to the climate by greenhouse gases to date is irreversible.
1.7.4. Pro: A [report](https://www.ciel.org/news/new-ipcc-report-confirms-increasing-and-irreversible-damage-from-climate-impacts-intolerable-risks-of-overshooting-1-5c/) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) confirms that irreversible damage has already happened to natural ecosystems.
1.8. Con: Past and current attempts to reverse man-made climate change have already been unsuccessful.
1.8.1. Con: Many successful ideas require multiple attempts before they are viable.
1.8.1.1. Pro: NASA has experienced many [failed attempts](https://astronomy.com/news/2020/12/nasas-failures-robotic-space-missions-that-didnt-go-as-planned) to explore space before succeeding. The same is quite possible for the solution to reversing man-made climate change.
1.8.1.2. Con: Unlike other ideas, climate-related solutions could end up being counterproductive if multiple attempts to create a viable strategy are so resource intensive that they exacerbate the climate crisis.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Green technologies often do not mitigate the climate crisis but merely replace one injustice for another; [mining the minerals](https://thewire.in/environment/the-idea-that-green-technology-can-help-save-the-environment-is-dangerous)(But as it happens, the idea that ‘green technology’ can help save the environment is dangerous because it glosses over the alternatives’ ills. In a bid to reduce the extraction of hydrocarbons for fuel as well as to manufacture components for more efficient electronic and mechanical systems, industrialists around the world have been extracting a wide array of minerals and metals, destroying entire ecosystems and displacing hundreds of thousands of people. It’s as if one injustice has replaced another.) needed to develop green technology, for example, can lead to resource depletion and human displacement.
1.8.2. Pro: Reversing climate change to mandate and enforce strict methods requires a level of cooperation between world governments that could not realistically be achieved.
1.8.2.1. Con: The UN has repeatedly demonstrated the levels of international cooperation required.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: The [Montreal Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) stopped the ozone hole growing over Antarctica, and was the first [unanimiously ratified international agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol#cite_note-12).
1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: This treaty was signed very quickly for an international treaty, with only 14 years lapsing between a basic scientific research discovery \(1973\) and the international agreement signed \(1985 & 1987\).
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: The UN achieved the [Paris Agreement](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35073297), achieving consensus and specific agreements among nearly 200 countries for the first time in history.
1.8.2.1.2.1. Con: [Not a single major country](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/world/climate-pledges-insufficient-cat-intl/index.html)(None of the world's major economies -- including the entire G20 -- have a climate plan that meets their obligations under the 2015 Paris Agreemen) is on track to fulfill the Paris Agreement.
1.8.2.1.3. Con: 26 United Nations Climate Change Conferences \(COPs\) and greenhouse gas emissions have only continued to rise.
1.8.3. Pro: Voluntary resource consumption avoidance is promoted as climate change help \(like veganism, no fossil fuels, etc.\), yet is temporary or makes matters worse: exploitative people will take the resources that those who care \(and improve society\) avoid. Until society touts the opposite, introduces/uses alternatives, block resources access, etc., no progress will be made.
1.8.4. Pro: The implementation of the [Kyoto Protocol](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-emissions-turning-point/)(COP3 in Kyoto, Japan, ends with the adoption of the first international climate change resolution, known as the Kyoto Protocol. The agreement ultimately fails to have any meaningful impact on global emissions, which continue to rise and even accelerate.) in 1997 had little impact on global emissions. Decades later, we still have not achieved success.
1.8.4.1. Pro: The Kyoto Protocol has [major flaws in its CO2 accounting from bioenergy.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091022141126.htm)(if uncorrected, undermine efforts to reduce greenhouse gases by encouraging deforestation.)
