1.1.5.1. Con: A [study](https://nature.berkeley.edu/classes/es196/projects/2001final/Hoehn.pdf) showed that while storm water filters and remediation techniques are already used in California, there exist more cost-efficient alternatives that could be used instead.
1.1.6. Con: It will be difficult to persuade people to drink recycled water.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Even though recycling systems are in place in many locations, [people tend not drink recycled water.](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/10/recycled-water)
1.1.6.2. Con: The commonly made association between water and sewage can be deconstructed.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: People can be educated on how water is recycled and why the filtration process means recycled water is safe to drink.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: According to one survey, when respondents were asked whether they were willing to drink cycled water, [38% said they were willing and 49% were uncertain](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/10/recycled-water).
1.1.6.3. Con: In a 2013 poll conducted for the Guardian, [63%](https://theconversation.com/its-public-attitudes-to-recycled-sewage-that-need-better-treatment-not-the-water-29735) of respondents said they would drink recycled sewage water.
1.1.7. Pro: Prevent drains from draining into the ocean, i.e. water reclamation.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Drain water effluent is an abundant source of water that is generally [co-located](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stop-flushing-water-down-the-drain-excerpt/) with population centers. This can fulfill water needs of many people without incurring high transportation costs.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Effluent water can be passed through a power plant as a [source of coolant](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stop-flushing-water-down-the-drain-excerpt/).
1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: [Austin, Texas](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stop-flushing-water-down-the-drain-excerpt/), has set up an extensive purple-piping network that brings effluent from the wastewater treatment plant to downtown Austin, where it is available for cooling.
1.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: In [2010](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stop-flushing-water-down-the-drain-excerpt/), there were already 46 power plants in the U.S. that used reclaimed water for cooling tower makeup.
1.1.7.1.1.3. Pro: [Nuclear power plants at Palo Verde in Arizona](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stop-flushing-water-down-the-drain-excerpt/) use the municipal wastewater from Phoenix and other cities nearby as injected pressure at geothermal fields and as boiler feed-water.

1.1.7.1.3. Pro: The effluent water can be used within buildings for non-potable purposes, such as [toilet flushing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stop-flushing-water-down-the-drain-excerpt/).
1.1.8. Con: The wastewater plants can't be placed everywhere, as the reverse osmosis filters need a minimum water level to work and without a large population for that, it kind of stops working.
1.1.9. Con: Recycling wastewater is a nice idea, but using composting toilets would remove the intermediary needs of filtering the water by just not needing to use it.
1.1.10. Con: Recyling water [may not be suitable for the climate](https://sciencing.com/pros-cons-of-recycling-water-5502383.html).
1.1.10.1. Pro: Recycling wastwater [uses up a lot of energy.](https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/water/articles/recycled-drinking-water)
1.1.10.1.1. Con: Other strategies of improving the supply of water might use more energy than recycling wastewater.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Strategies for increasing water supply such as desalination, which involves treating seawater by reverse osmosis to make it suitable for drinking, uses [more energy](https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/water/articles/recycled-drinking-water) than recycled wastewater.

1.1.14. Pro: Water recycling is [usually conducted locally](https://www.bettermeetsreality.com/pros-cons-of-water-recycling-reuse-reclamation/). This provides more control over the water than water that is sourced externally.
1.2. Increase our supply of water.
1.2.1. Con: Industry will use up the extra water for profit.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Bottled water companies, which use the extra water and sell it at high prices, [swim in profits](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/2007/11/29/bottled_water_companies_just_swimming_in_profits.html) at the expense of the general public.
1.2.1.2. Con: If people can make money off of green initiatives of saving water to increase the water supply, even if the people saving water don't benefit from it, then there will be a profit motivation to saving water and will encourage even the top wealthy people to join in on saving water.
1.2.2. Con: It is [expensive](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/climate/water-pipes-plastic-lead.html) to create pipelines.
1.2.2.1. Con: The potential negative repercussions are dangerous, and expensive to fix.
1.2.3. Pro: This could be done by importing water from other states.
1.2.3.1. Pro: There are already a few established water-import mechanisms from other states to Southern California. They can be expanded to import more water.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The State Water Project \(SWP\) includes a 444-mile-long aqueduct that [carries water](https://dpw.lacounty.gov/landing/wr/watersupply/importedWater.cfm) from the Delta through the San Joaquin Valley to Southern California.
1.2.3.2. Con: Importing water has a lot of [associated costs](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-true-price-imported-water-2010aug06-story.html).
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has experienced that the price of importing water has risen more than [96%](https://www.ocregister.com/2012/04/15/imported-water-prices-up-96-percent-since-2006-2/) since 2006.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Transporting water in large quantities from other states will require costly investments in transportation facilities.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Water transportation facilities will have to secure against contamination, increasing overall costs.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: A survey conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that water systems might need [$12.1 billion in investment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248879997_Cost_Models_for_Water_Supply_Distribution_Systems) to protect against microbiological contamination.
1.2.3.3. Con: Given that the climate is not improving, this would be a costly and unsustainable solution .
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: As climate change leads to global warming, water supply will become a more scarce thing in other states as well. This will make it increasingly expensive and more difficult to import water.
1.2.3.4. Con: California should have an independent water supply instead of mooching off of other states that are also just trying to survive.
1.2.4. Pro: Grab it from the air or synthesize it.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Given that Southern California enjoys [humid weather](https://www.pe.com/2019/09/03/hot-and-humid-weather-will-linger-through-thursday/), it will be easy to extract water from humid ambient air via [atmospheric water generators \(AWG\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_water_generator).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Due to the continuous water cycle, the possibility of using air to produce water is promising.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Water vapor amounts to about "[10,000 billion litres in the bottom kilometere of air around the world](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/manufacture-water1.htm)." The replacement of water every few hours as part of the water cycle ensures the possibility of continuous extraction.
1.2.4.3. Con: Air-to-water generation machines are expensive and not widely available.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The AquaMagic machine, which produces purified water from air, costs about [$28,000 per unit](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/manufacture-water1.htm).
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The Whisson Windmill costs about [$43,000 per unit](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/manufacture-water1.htm).
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Many affordable variants of the the device are also available.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: Atmospheric Water Generator in India, an indigenous and inexpensive machine, produces drinking water at an [affordable price of Rs 2 per litre](https://www.thebetterindia.com/147303/atmospheric-water-generator-hyderabad-news/).

1.2.4.4. Pro: Devices that can generate clean drinking water out of thin air have the possibility of [producing large amounts of water](https://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/waterseer-can-produce-11-gallons-day-clean-drinking-water-air.html). This can fix the water shortage in Southern California.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Each unit of WaterSeer is said to be able to produce up to [11 gallons per day](https://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/waterseer-can-produce-11-gallons-day-clean-drinking-water-air.html), even in arid regions.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Skysource/Skywater Alliance's creation, called "WeDew," can produce at least [2,000 liters of water per day from each unit](https://www.businessinsider.com/device-that-harvests-water-from-air-wins-xprize-2018-10), which would satisfy the needs of a hundred people daily.
1.2.5. Pro: Planting trees helps the ground retain water better as well as creating micro-climates with humidity and rain.
1.2.6. Pro: Use balls \(like what was used in LA\) to cover reservoirs to prevent water evaporation from them.
1.2.7. Pro: One strategy to increase the supply of water is by [building dams](http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/gcsen/CRM_Water_Strategies_Increase_Supply.php).
1.2.7.1. Con: Not only is it expensive to build dams, but the project ends up costing much more than expected costs.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: The average cost overrun of dams is [56%](https://www.internationalrivers.org/economic-impacts-of-dams). This means that when a dam is predicted to cost $1 billion, it ends up costing $1.56 billion.
1.2.7.2. Con: Hydroelectric mega-projects such as dams have large scale [environmental costs](https://news.mongabay.com/2018/11/mega-dam-costs-outweigh-benefits-global-building-spree-should-end-experts/).
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: The dam wall itself [blocks fish migrations](https://www.internationalrivers.org/environmental-impacts-of-dams), which completely separates spawning habitats from rearing habitats.
1.2.7.2.2. Pro: The dam storage area [traps sediments](https://www.internationalrivers.org/environmental-impacts-of-dams), which are critical for maintaining physical processes and habitats downstream of the dam.
1.2.7.2.3. Pro: Dam reservoirs in tropical areas, due to their slow-movement, serve as [breeding grounds](http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/sijpkes/arch374/winter2001/dbiggs/enviro.html) for mosquitoes, snails, and flies.
1.2.7.2.4. Pro: Construction and operation of dams increase noise pollution in the area. \([p. 47](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325224066_Evaluating_Negative_Environmental_Impacts_Caused_by_Dam_Construction)\)
1.2.7.2.4.1. Pro: With the introduction of machinery and devices used for construction of the dam during the construction phase, the noise level in the region increases sharply. \([p. 47](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325224066_Evaluating_Negative_Environmental_Impacts_Caused_by_Dam_Construction)\)
1.2.7.2.5. Pro: The construction of a dam itself can contribute to the [degradation of its catchment](https://theconstructor.org/structures/environmental-impacts-of-dams/236/).
1.2.7.2.5.1. Pro: Degraded catchments can result in [erratic water flows](https://theconstructor.org/structures/environmental-impacts-of-dams/236/), threatening the safety of the dam.
1.2.8. Pro: The [frequent droughts](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/uoa-wda011020.php) in Southern California indicate that the current supply of water is insufficient.
1.2.9. Con: Increasing water supply will not address the issue of wasteful water use.
1.2.9.1. Pro: If water supply increases, each individual may start to use more water, which may mean that the impact of the increase becomes negligible.
1.2.9.2. Pro: Following the end of one of California's drought emergency, [wasteful water use](https://www.scpr.org/news/2018/04/02/81967/californians-go-back-to-wasting-as-much-water-as-b/) became common again.
1.2.9.3. Con: Increasing water supply and reducing water usage are not mutually exclusive. Both solutions should be implemented together.
1.2.10. Con: The supply of water cannot be increased indefinitely because fresh water is a [finite resource](https://www.thegreenage.co.uk/tech/water-as-a-finite-resource/).
1.2.10.1. Pro: Fresh water makes up [under 3%](https://blog.harnrosystems.com/how-much-water-on-earth-is-drinkable) of all water on Earth.
1.2.10.2. Pro: [65%](https://blog.harnrosystems.com/how-much-water-on-earth-is-drinkable) of drinkable water is tied up in glaciers.
1.2.11. Pro: This would plan for the needs of a growing population.
1.2.12. Pro: Systems could be implemented to capture and use rainwater.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Rainwater collection by residents for there own uses \(like they're given a filter or it's embedded into homes to make that possible\).
1.2.12.2. Pro: [Most rainwater in California is wasted](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-rainwater-lost-wet-winter-california-20190220-story.html).
1.2.12.3. Pro: In 2019, there was a [record amount of rain](https://www.dailynews.com/2019/03/07/rain-and-rainfall-records-keep-falling-in-southern-california/) Southern California.
1.2.12.3.1. Pro: In [2019](https://www.dailynews.com/2019/03/07/rain-and-rainfall-records-keep-falling-in-southern-california/), Riverside experienced 12.53 inches of rainfall, compared to 4.25 inches in 2018.
1.2.12.3.2. Pro: Santa Ana produced [16.64 inches of rain](https://www.dailynews.com/2019/03/07/rain-and-rainfall-records-keep-falling-in-southern-california/) in 2019 compared to just 2.66 inches of rain in 2018.
1.2.13. Pro: Water supply can be increased if methods are developed to tap into the [drinkable water frozen in glaciers and icebergs.](https://www.industrytap.com/tapping-90-of-earths-fresh-water-frozen-in-glaciers-and-icebergs/2607)
1.2.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.
1.2.13.2. Pro: The bottled water brand, [Iceberg Water](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024601/the-wild-world-of-iceberg-harvesting-scams-schemes-and-startups), extracts water from icebergs across the world.
1.2.14. Con: Extra water will used up, and not be conserved as the population grows. More is needed.
1.3. Reduce usage.
1.3.1. Con: The shortage is extensive and needs focused work, not stopgap solutions.
1.3.2. Con: It is difficult to effectively regulate water usage without significantly restricting people's fundamental freedom and right to access necessities.
1.3.2.1. Con: Encouraging the reduction of water use would not apply to necessities but toward wasteful uses of water.
1.3.3. Pro: Reduce unnecessary and wasteful water consumption.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Providing education about water sourcing/treatment on the best methods, analysis, usage, etc. to get children/adults to appreciate and value the little water they have and find better methods to acquire water would be simple, easy, and feasible for reducing water consumption.
1.3.4. Pro: [Moving people out](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/31/california-drought-worsens-may-have-to-migrate-people.html) of Southern California is something that has support behind it by experts.
1.3.5. Pro: Farming could done more efficiently \(like [vertically](https://www.kialo.com/vertical-farming-is-the-future-of-agriculture-7487) instead of horizontally and on the basis of air \([aeroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroponics)\) instead of water \([hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics)\) and soil\).
1.3.6. Con: [www.kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/in-california-residents-were-told-to-save-water-due-to-a-drought-and-the-response-was-so-good-that-the-reservoir-31294.322?path=31294.0~31294.67_31294.201_31294.243_31294.322). So even if we try to save water, it won't work
1.3.7. Pro: Using filtered tap water instead of disposable water bottles saves on water used to make the bottle \(which is 3x more than tap water, plus a bottle of oil\).
1.3.8. Con: There is only so much that can be reduced.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Water is essential for a number of regular activities such as showering, washing the dishes or doing the laundry.
1.3.9. Pro: Reducing water use is the most cost-effective method for increasing water availability in Southern California.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Residents of Southern California can make [small lifestyle changes](https://www.easyturf.com/2016/07/14/ways-reduce-water-bill-southern-california/) to reduce their water usage.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: [80%](https://www.easyturf.com/2016/07/14/ways-reduce-water-bill-southern-california/) of water usage in Southern California is attributed to outdoor use. Reducing the frequency of using water in outdoor activities like frequent car washing can reduce consumption.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: Residents who have gardens can invest in [mulch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch) to reduce how much water their plants need. Mulch [helps plants retain more water](https://www.easyturf.com/2016/07/14/ways-reduce-water-bill-southern-california/), and reduces the amount of water required by flowerbeds.
1.3.9.1.1.2. Pro: With lawn and garden maintenance attributing to nearly [60%](https://www.easyturf.com/2016/07/14/ways-reduce-water-bill-southern-california/) of household water use n Southern California, residents can start investing in artificial turf, which requires little to no water.
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: Residents can install effective plumbing in their homes to reduce the volume of water used.
1.3.9.1.2.1. Pro: Replacing normal toilets with ones that [use a fraction of the water per flush](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-water-efficiency-standards-20170831-story.html) to get the job done will help reduce water wastage.
1.3.9.1.2.2. Pro: Household leaks use up to [16 gallons of household water each day](https://www.easyturf.com/2016/07/14/ways-reduce-water-bill-southern-california/). Ensuring regular plumbing checks and maintenance will help conserving water resources for future.
1.3.10. Con: It is unlikely that a large number of people can be persuaded to reduce their water usage.
1.3.11. Con: As the [population of Southern California increases](https://calmatters.org/environment/2019/05/future-of-california-water-supply/) there are likely to be shortages even if water usage decreases.
1.3.11.1. Pro: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Southern California increased by [over 82,000](https://www.pe.com/2018/03/21/how-and-why-southern-californias-population-grew-so-much-in-one-year/) between 2016 and 2017.
1.3.12. Pro: Reduce-reuse-recycle: this is the most efficient manner of increasing supply. No costs other than "getting the word out."
1.3.12.1. Pro: It is also a green choice, that helps for the better
1.3.12.1.1. Con: This solution relies on individual behaviors, instead of addressing the collective problem.
