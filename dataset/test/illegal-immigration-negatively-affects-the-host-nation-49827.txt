Discussion Name: Illegal immigration negatively affects the host nation.

1. Illegal immigration negatively affects the host nation.
1.1. Con: Immigration increases the diversity of a society.
1.1.1. Pro: Diversity tends to produce a [greater variety of perspectives and ideas in society.](https://www.wonolo.com/blog/6-benefits-of-having-a-diverse-workforce/)
1.1.2. Con: Immigrants, illegal or otherwise, could pose threats to societal diversity, if they espouse regressive attitudes toward women and other marginalized communities.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Anti-LGBT sentiments appear to be more pronounced among [migrant communities](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/imre.12113) in Europe.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Immigrants often migrate from [poorer countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration#cite_note-1) to richer countries, and poorer countries tend to have higher [gender parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Parity_Index).
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The implicit ascription of a lower socioeconomic status to immigrants is rooted in [stereotypes](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/25/1/tay040/5056445).
1.1.3. Pro: Donald Trump's anti-immigration policy has been regarded as an attack against [diversity](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/02/23/donald-trumps-real-target-is-not-illegal-immigration-but-diversity).
1.1.3.1. Con: The way a person's political adversaries interpret their words and actions does not always reflect reality.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: A person's political opponents have a motivated interest in seeing that person's words and actions interpreted in the most negative way possible.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: In politics, it is often easier to win popularity by misrepresenting one's opponents, than it is to win solely on the merits of one's own opinions. Therefore, people should get their perspectives on the opinions and goals of a given political figure by consulting that person's supporters rather than their opponents.
1.1.4. Con: Diversity that naturally exists within a society should be protected and preserved, but diversity as an end goal and outcome that justifies illegal immigration lacks substantiation.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Cultural diversity can lead to ideological diversity and pave the way for more conflict.
1.1.4.2. Con: Cultural diversity facilitates [innovation](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/immigration-beneficial-or-detrimental-to-the-host-country)(At a macro level, diverse societal norms, customs, and ethics can nurture technological innovation, the diffusion of new ideas, and so the production of a greater variety of goods and services.).
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Cultural diversity can also highlight incompatibilities between cultures, creating conflict between immigrants and the native culture.
1.1.5. Pro: Cultural diversity, in turn, has a positive effect on the [economy](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/immigration-beneficial-or-detrimental-to-the-host-country).
1.2. Con: Due to the difficulties involved in illegal immigration the process ends up selecting dynamic and driven individuals who if allowed to work will become successful members of society and contribute greatly to the host country.
1.3. Pro: Illegal immigration threatens the security of a nation.
1.3.1. Pro: While illegal immigrants themselves tend to commit crime at a low rate, the cartels and criminal gangs that smuggle people here also smuggle drugs, as well as even more inhumane forms of human trafficking such as sex slavery. These criminal gangs commit violent crime at an astronomical rate compared to the general population.
1.3.2. Con: Illegal immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than the native population.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [Fear of deportation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/undocumented-immigrants-are-half-as-likely-to-be-arrested-for-violent-crimes-as-u-s-born-citizens/) has been cited as a factor that explains the surprisingly low crime rates reported among illegal immigrant communities.
1.3.3. Con: Illegal immigration merely underscores the loopholes that render a nation vulnerable by granting easy access to those who enter or remain in a country without the required permits.
1.3.4. Con: Illegal immigrants pose [little to no risk](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis#notes)(\[T\]he chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year while the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an illegal immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year.) to the security of a nation or its citizens.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Threats to national security due to illegal immigration appear to be a [perception](https://www.e-ir.info/2013/08/24/is-immigration-a-threat-to-security/)(Mueller \(2006\) argues that the threat of terrorism by either national or immigrant terrorists has been highly exaggerated \(4\). Likewise, a study on immigration and terrorism in Spain by Saux \(2007\) maintains that the connection between illegal immigration and terrorism is a constructed rather than objective reality \(p.63\).) rather than reality.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: This perception may be attributable to the fact that ethnic minorities are [incarcerated](https://www.cato.org/blog/new-research-illegal-immigration-crime-0)(Another reason could be that native‐born Americans who have the same ethnicity as recent immigrants might have a much higher incarceration rate, so the respondents to these surveys lump them in together and conclude that immigrants boost the crime rate.) at higher rates, even when they are no more likely to commit crimes than their counterparts.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: This perception may be attributable to distorted [media](https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1332&context=hcoltheses) reports of crimes committed by immigrants, which perpetuate harmful narratives about these communities.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Claims that illegal immigration threatens national security are often [politically motivated](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/undocumented-immigrants-are-half-as-likely-to-be-arrested-for-violent-crimes-as-u-s-born-citizens/) and not substantiated by data.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: A similar sentiment is shared among the general public. Specifically, [Republicans](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/06/28/shifting-public-views-on-legal-immigration-into-the-u-s/)(Republicans are divided over whether undocumented immigrants are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes: 42% say they are more likely to commit serious crimes, while 46% say they are not. A large majority of Democrats \(80%\) say that undocumented immigrants are not more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes.) are more likely to associate illegal immigration with crime than their Democratic counterparts.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: While the percentages reported for Republicans and Democrats do differ, a [majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/06/28/shifting-public-views-on-legal-immigration-into-the-u-s/) of the surveyed Republicans \(46% vs. 42%\) did not believe that illegal immigration increases crime.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Media narratives of crimes committed by immigrants render them a political [bargaining chip](https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1332&context=hcoltheses).
1.3.5. Con: Illegal immigration is [not significantly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9125.12175) related to violent crime and, even when it is, the direction is negative.
1.3.5.1. Con: Immigrants themselves commit crime at a relatively low rate. But the criminal gangs that traffic people here also smuggle drugs and sex slaves, and account for a large percentage of domestic crime.
1.4. Con: Illegal immigrants reduce crime rates.
1.4.1. Pro: Studies show that areas with high populations of illegal immigrants [have reduced crime rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Relationship_between_illegal_immigration_and_crime) as compared to other areas.
1.4.1.1. Con: The total crime committed in the US by illegal immigrants who don't come to the US at all is zero. Any crime committed by illegals is more crime than would have happened if they had not come at all.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Conversely, "increasing [deportations](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2020/0817/Why-do-Americans-think-more-immigration-means-more-crime-audio) in areas with a lot of unauthorized immigrants didn’t reduce local crime rates."
1.4.2. Con: In the US, [64% of all federal arrests](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/non-citizens-account-64-percent-all-federal-arrests-justice-department-n1045286) involved people who were non-citizens and those who had violated immigration laws.
1.4.2.1. Con: It is not fair to include immigration violations in the percentage of federal arrests, because citizens cannot be charged with some of these crimes \(aiding/inciting still possible but probably relatively rare\). What we need to know is the rate of convictions *per head* of the illegal immigrant population, and the same for the legal immigrants.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The very act of illegal immigration is a crime.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Members of the criminal cartels that run the human trafficking on the black market are the largest source of these crimes. While it's true that most illegals don't personally commit many violent crimes, the black market that gets them here is a huge source of violence.
1.4.3. Con: The very fact that illegal immigrants choose to enter or remain in a country illegally rather than through stipulated procedures implies that they may have little regard for the law.
1.4.3.1. Con: Illegal immigrants often enter or remain in a foreign country to [escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration#Reasons_for_illegal_immigration) their own countries, which may have been ravaged by war, poverty, or other humanitarian crises.
1.4.3.2. Pro: In the US, illegal immigrants arrested by the ICE have, on average, [four](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/illegal-immigrants-arrested-fy-2020-had-average-four-criminal-convictions-or-charges) criminal convictions or charges against them.
1.5. Pro: Illegal immigration negatively affects the economy.
1.5.1. Pro: Illegal immigration [costs](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-fair-study--illegal-immigration-costs-116-billion-annually-300526595.html) an estimated $116 billion annually, while illegal immigrants only pay around $16 billion per year in total taxes.
1.5.2. Con: Illegal immigrants contribute to the economy by paying [taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States).
1.5.2.1. Con: If they work under the table, they aren't paying federal, state or local income tax, and their employers aren't paying payroll taxes on their wages.
1.5.2.2. Con: If they are using fake ID's to work above board, they are almost certainly also using those same identities to draw welfare and every other program they would qualify for as citizens. Since the bottom 40% of earners in the country have a negative net tax burden \(meaning they take more from social programs than they pay in total taxes\), and the vast majority of illegal immigrants fall into that income bracket, illegal immigrants are a net drain on taxpayer dollars despite what they may be paying.
1.5.2.3. Con: Since they do not own homes, and typically live in very low-rent housing, they don't pay enough in property taxes from mortgages or rent to pay the additional costs incurred by the school systems to educate their children, especially when there's the added burden of providing ESL classes and accommodations to those students above and beyond what native citizens need.
1.5.3. Pro: Illegal immigrants are a burden on tax-payer money since they utilize the benefits and resources of the country they've migrated to.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Illegal immigrants consume benefits that are worth more than [$100 billion per year](https://www.foxnews.com/us/the-cost-of-illegal-immigration-migrants-cost-us-taxpayers-billions-a-year).
1.5.3.2. Con: In 2010, illegal immigrants contributed a net positive sum of $12 billion to a retirement trust fund. \([p. 3](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf)\)
1.5.4. Con: Overall, illegal immigration has either a [negligible](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/multimedia/illegal-immigrations-effects-us-economy-and-policy) or [positive](https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2144&context=honors_research_projects) impact on the economy.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Beyond local effects, less-strict immigration barriers, which would reduce illegal immigration rates, will enhance the global economy and reduce global [poverty](https://freit.org/WorkingPapers/Papers/Immigration/FREIT432.pdf)(\[F\]reeing migration into rich nations would reduce global poverty by at least 40% and as much as 66%.).
1.6. Con: Undocumented workers benefit the economy.
1.6.1. Con: Illegal immigration costs $116 Billion annually. [source](https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/report-illegal-immigration-costs-taxpayers-116-billion-annually-californians-texans-floridians-pay-the-most/article_f942e522-c5b0-11e9-93e6-0ff213e44ae5.amp.html)
1.6.2. Pro: In the US, undocumented immigrants pay an [average of $11.64 billion a year in taxes](https://www.unidosus.org/issues/immigration/resources/facts).
1.7. Pro: Illegal immigration threatens the native culture.
1.7.1. Con: Illegal immigrants tend to only make up a small component of the people in a country and thus are not a threat to the culture of the majority of the population.
1.7.1.1. Con: 3.5% of the population is a very large group of people, especially if given political influence. Given that these are not naturalized citizens, and are therefore just as likely to have a greater affinity and loyalty to their home countries than they have for American interests, it stands to reason that society would not be wrong to curtail their political power in American society, at minimum.
1.7.1.2. Pro: In the US during 2016, [less than 3.5%](https://www.adl.org/resources/fact-sheets/myths-and-facts-about-immigrants-and-immigration-en-espanol) of the population were undocumented immigrants.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: Most elections are decided by less than the amount of votes collected from 3.5% of the population. If laws against non-citizens voting are ignored as egregiously as our laws against illegal immigration, 3.5% of the populace can have a profound effect on society.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: This assumes undocumented immigrants vote homogeneously, which isn't necessarily the case.
