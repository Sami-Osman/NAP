Discussion Name: Has Angela Merkel been a good leader?

1. Angela Merkel has been a good leader.
1.1. Pro: Merkel has helped advance human rights and equality.
1.1.1. Pro: Merkel has [put pressure on China](https://apnews.com/article/li-keqiang-angela-merkel-hong-kong-coronavirus-pandemic-china-ddb6a845a60c3a0930384fb734fdc6b5)(According to remarks released by her office, Merkel brought up Germany’s criticism of China’s human rights record, saying in her address to the group: “There are differences of opinion here, especially when we think of the situation in Hong Kong, for example.”\n\n“We have, so far, always managed to address these issues well; I’d hope that we can get the human rights dialogue going again as soon as possible,” Merkel said.\n\nThe German leader, who does not plan to run for reelection this year, added that her wish was for “in-depth” talks that would also include the countries’ justice ministers.) to engage in a conversation about human rights.
1.1.1.1. Con: Merkel has linked Germany and China economically, [compromising the country’s ability](https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/09/30/merkel-s-mixed-legacy-on-china-pub-85471)(This economics-driven approach—a kind of Germany First strategy—prioritized strong trade and investment with Beijing over concerns regarding human rights and values issues. The approach paid off. German companies \(ranging from automobile groups like Volkswagen to major manufacturing giants like Siemens\) have grown their footprint and profits in the Chinese market over the past two decades. Illustrating Beijing’s growing significance to Berlin, in 2014, Merkel elevated Germany’s relationship with China to a comprehensive strategic partnership.) to address human rights violations in China.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Merkel has met with [Chinese human rights activists](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1874230/human-rights-being-trampled-under-xi-activists-tell)(German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with nine human rights activists and political dissidents during her trip to China, risking the ire of her hosts even as she seeks to cement economic and trade ties with the world’s second-biggest economy.\n\nMerkel met a group of human rights lawyers, writers and bloggers at the German Embassy in Beijing on Thursday evening, a government official said on the condition of anonymity because the meetings were private. The activists told Merkel that the human-rights situation in China had worsened since President Xi Jinping came to power in November 2012, the official said.) to discuss the legal and political protection of dissidents.
1.1.2. Con: Merkel has not adequately addressed [women's issues in Germany](https://www.voanews.com/a/as-merkel-bids-farewell-german-women-wish-for-more-equality-/6240854.html)(On trips to Africa, the Middle East and Asia, Merkel has often made a point of visiting women's rights projects. She has always stressed that giving women in poor countries better access to education and work is key to those nations' development.\n\nBut when it comes to the situation of women in Germany, Merkel — who said in 2018 that she wouldn't seek reelection in this Sunday's general election — has been criticized for not using her position enough to push for more gender equality.).
1.1.2.1. Pro: Gender disparities continue to reign strong [in German businesses](https://www.voanews.com/a/as-merkel-bids-farewell-german-women-wish-for-more-equality-/6240854.html)(Last year, only 14.6% of top-level managers in big listed German companies were women. Germany also has one of the biggest gender pay gaps in the EU, with women earning 18% less than men in 2020, according to the Federal Statistical Office.). The country has one of the biggest wage gaps in Europe and the lowest percentage of women with top-level positions in big companies.
1.1.2.2. Con: Merkel has led by example, showing that women can succeed in male-dominated fields.
1.1.3. Con: Merkel altered her [position on gay marriage](https://www.dw.com/en/is-angela-merkel-about-to-shift-her-partys-position-on-gay-marriage/a-39429463)(With just a few minutes left for questions from the audience, a gay man challenged the chancellor on the issue of same-sex marriage: He said that he wanted to know when he would finally be allowed to refer to his registered partner as "my husband."\n\nMerkel replied that she had noticed that all other parties in the Bundestag were in favor of same-sex marriage, and that the idea of gay marriage enjoyed widespread support among German voters. And then she dropped an unexpected political bombshell: Merkel said she "hopes" that the debate will shift "into the direction of a decision of conscience.") in order to benefit her political career.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Merkel voted against [gay marriage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-gay-marriage-merkel-idUSKBN19L0SU)(“For me, marriage in the Basic Law is marriage between a man and a woman and that is why I did not vote in favor of this bill today,” she told reporters moments after the 393-266 vote in favor of an amendment that will legalize same-sex marriage.) in 2017 and consistently spoke about the negative impact it could have on [children's welfare.](https://qz.com/1018983/in-a-nod-to-angela-merkels-political-genius-germany-votes-yes-to-gay-marriage/)(Merkel has long argued against marriage equality on the grounds of “children’s welfare,” admitting she had a “hard time” with the issue. Her main rival, Social Democrat Martin Schulz, has championed gay marriage as a central campaign issue \(paywall\) and used it to block her chances of forming a coalition as chancellor if she wins, by refusing to enter any government that does not introduce gay marriage.)
1.1.3.2. Con: Merkel's personal opinions on gay marriage are irrelevant as she didn't let them compromise a free vote and the freedoms of German citizens.
1.1.4. Pro: As Germany's [first female chancellor](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Angela-Merkel)(Angela Merkel, née Angela Dorothea Kasner, \(born July 17, 1954, Hamburg, West Germany\), German politician who in 2005 became the first female chancellor of Germany.), Merkel has paved the way for women in German politics.
1.1.4.1. Con: The percentage of female federal lawmakers has [decreased under Merkel,](https://www.voanews.com/a/as-merkel-bids-farewell-german-women-wish-for-more-equality-/6240854.html)(German women have even seen some setbacks during Merkel's reign. Before Merkel took office in 2005, 23% of federal lawmakers for her center-right Union bloc were women. Today, the figure is 19.9%. Only the far-right Alternative for Germany party, with 10.9%, has fewer female lawmakers.\n\nGermany also lags behind other European countries when it comes to equal political representation.\n\nIn 2020, the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments and governments was 31.4% in Germany, well below Sweden's 49.6%, Belgium's 43.3% or Spain's 42.2%, according to the European Union statistics agency Eurostat.) and the percentage of women in government is far below that of other European countries.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Merkel has consistently pointed out gender disparities in German politics, including [within her own party](https://www.dw.com/en/in-german-politics-women-still-have-a-long-way-to-go/a-46226146)(At a recent conference of Germany's Christian Democrat \(CDU\) youth wing, Chancellor Angela Merkel looked out across the group's leadership and had a laconic observation to share: "Very male," she said.\n\n"But 50 percent of the population is missing," she continued, addressing the group of which just 5 of 16 state-level boards are led by women. "Women enrich life, not only private life but also political life. You don't know what you're missing.").
1.1.4.3. Con: Merkel was in office for 15 years before she introduced [legal requirements](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-angela-merkel-what-has-she-achieved-for-women/a-59308030)(Merkel, who earlier served as minister of women's affairs, has had a complex time advocating and implementing equal opportunity policies, "because she also wanted to be elected by men," says Jacqueline Boysen. She long hesitated to call herself a feminist, and for years rejected calls to introduce a gender parity quota for top management of major companies. She prefers policies that limit government intervention and hoped that companies would naturally bring more women into management positions — which did not happen, finally prompting a legal change in late 2020.) for gender diversity in management positions.
1.2. Con: Merkel has failed to adequately address environmental issues.
1.2.1. Con: Merkel [responded](https://www.ethicssage.com/2015/09/vws-irresponsible-behavior-has-consequences.html)(The worst scandal in VW's 78-year history showed no sign of abating as Germany’s transport minister said last Thursday it had manipulated tests in Europe as well as the United States. To her credit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed courage when she came out and said that VW should act quickly to restore confidence in a company held up for generations as a paragon of German engineering prowess.) to the VW emissions scandal admirably.
1.2.1.1. Con: Merkel took [no meaningful action](https://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-media-first-to-tell-me-about-vw-emissions-cheating/)(The chancellor's careful phrasing didn’t please some opposition politicians.\n\n"We had high expectations for the chancellor, and she did not live up to them," said Herbert Behrens of the Left Party, the committee chairman.\n\nOliver Krischer, a MP for the Green Party, said, "Today, the chancellor tried to downplay Dieselgate in a way that, I believe, is irresponsible."\n\nIn September 2015, U.S. authorities accused VW of equipping its diesel cars with devices that lowered pollution levels when they were being tested. VW admitted to putting such defeat devices into 11 million of its cars — most of them sold in Europe.) against the car company despite the harm that was caused by their behavior.
1.2.1.2. Con: Merkel and her government consistently ignored EU advice on limiting the environmental impact of car production, including making the production of ['cheat devices' a punishable offense](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/volkswagen-scandal-angela-merkel-s-government-accused-being-bed-german-car-industry-10516040.html)(Ms Höhn blamed the Merkel government for failing to outlaw the software: “The European Union asked Germany, some years ago, to make it a punishable offence for carmakers to use these so-called emission suppressors,” she said. “To my knowledge this did not happen.” Ms Höhn said it appeared that Germany’s car industry had been “in bed” with the country’s politicians for some time. She also said it was only “by chance” that Volkswagen had become the first carmaker to be caught using manipulative exhaust emissions software.).
1.2.1.3. Pro: Merkel managed to preserve the [image of the German car industry](https://www.arabnews.com/node/815636/amp)("It is of course a dramatic event which is not good,” she said.\n“But I think the reputation of German industry, the confidence in the German economy, is not so shaken that we are no longer considered a good place to do business.”) despite the scandal.
1.2.2. Con: Merkel has prioritised the [banning of single-use plastics](https://apnews.com/article/germany-animals-business-environment-international-news-26bc656712f33ec18c196e4c77c29062)(Germany is banning the sale of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and food containers, bringing it in line with a European Union directive intended to reduce the amount of plastic garbage that pollutes the environment.\n\nThe Cabinet agreed Wednesday to end the sale of plastics including single-use cutlery, plates, stirring sticks and balloon holders, as well as polystyrene cups and boxes by July 3, 2021.), one of the most significant environmental threats.
1.2.2.1. Con: Merkel has [underestimated the challenges](https://www.dpa-international.com/topic/merkel-it-will-easy-stop-using-single-use-plastic-products-urn%3Anewsml%3Adpa.com%3A20090101%3A210605-99-875719)(Merkel said people would find that doing without such products would be easy and greatly relieve the environment.) Germany may face in banning these products, claiming the transition will be easy.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: When plastic products are banned, people typically switch to [paper and cotton bags](https://www.wri.org/insights/banning-straws-and-bags-wont-solve-our-plastic-problem)(That’s because, somewhat ironically, disposable plastic bags require fewer resources \(land, water, CO2 emissions, etc.\) to produce than paper, cotton or reusable plastic bags—by a wide margin.\n\nFor example, Denmark’s Ministry of Environment and Food found that you would need to reuse a paper bag at least 43 times for its per-use environmental impacts to be equal to or less than that of a typical disposable plastic bag used one time. An organic cotton bag must be reused 20,000 times to produce less of an environmental impact than a single-use plastic bag. That would be like using a cotton bag every day for nearly 55 years.), which use more resources.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The [behavior change](https://theconversation.com/how-to-break-up-with-plastics-using-behavioural-science-99741)(Research has found that simply providing information through awareness campaigns is unlikely to change behaviour. What media attention and campaigning can do is increase the public visibility of an issue. This can indirectly influence our behaviour by making us more open to other interventions and by signalling social norms – the unwritten rules of acceptable behaviour.\n\nSuccessful behaviour change campaigns must empower individuals. We should be left feeling capable of changing, that changing our behaviour will impact the problem, and that we are not alone. One positive example is modelling sustainable behaviours, like using KeepCups or beeswax wraps, in popular TV shows.) involved in effectively reducing plastic waste is not, by any means, 'easy.' Merkel should be more realistic in her assessment of this issue.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: People do not necessarily need to live without the convenience of single-use items, only to use renewable alternatives such as paper straws or wooden forks.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: [Consumers are already moving to reusable items](https://www.retail-insight-network.com/comment/reusable-water-bottle-sales-soar-consumers-reject-plastic/)(Reusable water bottle sales soar as consumers reject plastic\n\nPurchases of reusable water bottles and travel mugs are on the rise as consumers seek to reduce plastic waste, save money and stay hydrated. Amazon and the grocers are benefitting most as price and convenience attract kitchen-storage shoppers.) without government incentives. Merkel is asking people to do more of what they are already doing.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Merkel has encouraged German citizens to embrace the [plastic production ban](https://www.dw.com/en/merkel-urges-ambitious-glasgow-climate-summit/a-57789240)(She urged Germany's 83 million residents to embrace from July the EU's ban on the production in Europe of single-use plastics such as straws and cotton buds.\n\n"Doing without them will be easy and will greatly relieve the environment," Merkel said.\n\nThe chancellor also highlighted species depletion and losses in biological diversity.\n\n"Up to a million species are threatened with extinction, many of them already in the coming decades," she said. "We urgently need to stop this development.").
1.2.2.3. Con: Merkel's ban on single-use plastics is bringing Germany in line with a [broader EU directive](https://apnews.com/article/germany-animals-business-environment-international-news-26bc656712f33ec18c196e4c77c29062)(Germany is banning the sale of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and food containers, bringing it in line with a European Union directive intended to reduce the amount of plastic garbage that pollutes the environment.). Merkel does not deserve the credit for this initiative.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: [EU directives](https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vh75mdhkg4s0)(The member states are required to implement directives. The member states are free to choose the manner they see fit to fulfill the required objectives.) mandate objectives for member states, but do not mandate the methods by which they reach this goal. As such, Merkel's proactive approach to this directive is to her credit.
1.2.3. Con: Germany is a world leader in [recycling](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/germany-recycles-more-than-any-other-country/)(Germany has the best recycling rate in the world. Austria comes in second, followed by South Korea and Wales. All four countries manage to recycle between 52% and 56% of their municipal waste. Switzerland, in fifth place, recycles almost half of its municipal waste.).
1.2.3.1. Pro: In 2017, the [World Economic Forum](https://www.dw.com/en/plastic-waste-and-the-recycling-myth/a-45746469)(And Germany retains its good reputation. In 2017, the World Economic Forum named the country recycling world champion.) named Germany the recycling world champion.
1.2.3.2. Con: Even though Germany collects a lot of recyclable material from the public, as little as [38% of the collected plastic is actually recycled](https://www.dw.com/en/plastic-waste-and-the-recycling-myth/a-45746469)(Globally, we generate about 1.3 billion tons of trash per year. In Germany alone, this amounts to a whopping 3 million tons of plastic packaging waste annually.\n\nAccording to official statistics, 48.8 percent of that plastic waste was recycled in Germany.\n\nBut that figure is deceptive, says Philipp Sommer, a circular economy expert with the German environmental and consumer protection association Deutsche Umwelthilfe \(DUH\).\n\n"We assume that only 38 percent was actually recycled," he told DW.).
1.2.4. Pro: [Catastrophic floods](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/germany-floods-one-hundred-fifty-five-still-missing-hope-further-rescue-fade)(The catastrophic flash floods have left thousands of people in western Germany without access to drinking water, electricity and gas. The full extent of damage to the area’s infrastructure has only emerged since the waters fully subsided over the last few days.) in Germany at the end of Merkel's chancellorship have shown that the country is unequipped to deal with the changing climate.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The [lack of flood relief infrastructur](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/mayors-appeal-to-berlin-for-more-help-to-rebuild-flooded-communities)(A debate continues to rage about whether the warnings issued on the night of the deluge, 14 July, were sufficient. Federal, state and local officials are facing legal action by some campaigners who say warnings were not passed on with sufficient urgency to residents. Germany’s Meteorological Service \(DWD\) has also been criticised for appearing not to recognise the potential consequences of heavy rainfall over days.\n\nMeanwhile the state prosecutor in Koblenz has begun a manslaughter investigation, gathering police reports and media coverage to assess whether people may have died unnecessarily, in particular 12 residents of a care facility in Sinzig.)e in Germany reflects poorly on the country's preparedness for rising sea levels.
1.2.4.2. Con: The existing flood warning scheme was [effective in many areas of Germany](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57867773)(Prof Cloke said there were places where the system had "done what it's designed to do", with early warnings heeded.\n\nBut there were "also places where those warnings did not get through to the people and they did not know it was going to happen".\n\nProf Cloke set up the warning system after deadly flooding in Europe in 2002, hoping to prevent such an event from happening again.\n\nBut she said the latest flooding had exposed "breaks in the chain".), suggesting that the lack of action in other areas was due to human error.
1.2.5. Con: Merkel has been an excellent international spokesperson for combatting climate change.
1.2.5.1. Con: Merkel has used climate advocacy to her political advantage; she has shown a willingness to [compromise her values](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/making-climate-chancellor-angela-merkel)(After five years of EU negotiations about CO2 emission standards for cars, negotiators from all member states agree on a compromise to toughen the rules. But in July 2013 Merkel intervenes at the last minute by calling the Irish EU Council President, asking him to take the subject off the agenda. A government spokesperson explains the “particularities of the German automobile industry had to be taken into account”. This delays the process by another year, leading to watered-down rules. Parliamentary opposition and environment organisations are enraged by the Chancellor’s decision, and media report other EU members complained about Merkel using "bullying tactics" to protect the German car industry.) when it comes to carbon emissions.
1.2.5.2. Pro: A trained scientist, Merkel has [consistently spoken](https://www.dw.com/en/has-angela-merkel-lived-up-to-her-climate-chancellor-aspirations/a-58614259)(A physicist by training, Merkel was outspoken on climate change far earlier than most global leaders and has repeatedly insisted on the need for scientific findings to guide the political debate.) on the need to address climate change throughout her political career.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Germany held the presidency of the Council of Europe and the G8 in 2007. Merkel made climate change [the focus of these presidencies](https://www.dw.com/en/has-angela-merkel-lived-up-to-her-climate-chancellor-aspirations/a-58614259)(Early in her chancellorship, during the same year as the glacier visit, Germany enjoyed a double whammy of presidencies: that of the Council of the European Union and that of the G8. Merkel was credited with making the climate crisis a major focus of both and with ensuring important steps were taken towards establishing international goals for reducing emissions. \n\nIndeed, raising awareness of the issue on the international stage "is the greatest achievement in terms of climate policy that we can attribute to Merkel," says Tobias Austrup, climate expert for Greenpeace in Germany.).
1.2.6. Pro: Germany is not ditching fossil fuels quickly enough.
1.2.6.1. Con: All climate change protocols take time to enact, as feasible replacements and infrastructures need to be established.
1.2.6.2. Pro: The German legislation to phase out coal by 2038 has set a [significantly later target](https://www.dw.com/en/has-angela-merkel-lived-up-to-her-climate-chancellor-aspirations/a-58614259)(Meanwhile, the German Parliament passed legislation last year to phase out coal by 2038, which, for Tobias Austrup, is a belated and inadequate step: "The countries around us are all leaving coal faster than we are." And Daniela Jacob points out, "Building renewable energy capacity has been far too sluggish.") than many other western democracies.
1.2.7. Pro: Germany's renewable energy sources are not developed enough.
1.2.7.1. Con: Germany produced [excess renewable energy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/10/is-germany-making-too-much-renewable-energy/)(Clean energy sources—wind farms and solar arrays as well as hydroelectric and biogas plants—ratcheted their share of power consumption up to 46 percent, nearly equaling that of coal, gas, oil, and nuclear power combined. And after a period of stagnation in the 2010s, the greenhouse emissions of the world’s fourth-largest economy have been dropping again, last year by around 80 million tons of carbon dioxide. That puts Germany 42 percent down from its 1990 emissions level, thus surpassing its decade target by 2 percentage points. This trajectory is good news for Germany—and for the EU, which wants to turn the continent carbon-neutral by 2050.) in 2020.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: Germany's current [sources of renewable energy](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-coal-tops-wind-as-primary-electricity-source/a-59168105)(But what led to wind power's sudden fall? Statistics officials said the weather was partly to blame.\n\nA lack of wind from January to March this year sharply reduced the amount of electricity produced by Germany's wind turbines. In contrast, stormy weather in the first quarters of 2019 and 2020 sharply boosted the electricity produced.\n\nGermany is seeking to have wind, solar, biogas, and other renewable energy sources play a bigger role, as the country looks to completely phase out nuclear power by 2022 and coal-fired power plants by 2038.) are insufficient due to their vulnerability to the country's climate.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Merkel's [snap decision](https://www.dw.com/en/has-angela-merkel-lived-up-to-her-climate-chancellor-aspirations/a-58614259)(The slow progress on coal contrasts with the snap decision to quit nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Although Merkel had previously asserted that it would be "absurd to shut down technologically safe nuclear power plants that don't emit CO2," an abrupt U-turn came just days after the tsunami that caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan to experience three meltdowns and release radioactive substances into the environment.\n\nThis was a huge change. Up to that point, quitting nuclear had been a flagship policy of the Green Party — which rose in the polls following Fukushima —but was new territory for Merkel's CDU. Germany is now set to phase out nuclear completely by next year.) to abandon nuclear power in 2011 cost Germany one of its most effective non-fossil power sources.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: The [nuclear disaster at Fukushima](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56252695)(Systems at the nuclear plant detected the earthquake and automatically shut down the nuclear reactors. Emergency diesel generators turned on to keep coolant pumping around the cores, which remain incredibly hot even after reactions stop.\n\nBut soon after a wave over 14 metres \(46ft\) high hit Fukushima. The water overwhelmed the defensive sea wall, flooding the plant and knocking out the emergency generators.\n\nWorkers rushed to restore power, but in the days that followed the nuclear fuel in three of the reactors overheated and partly melted the cores - something known as a nuclear meltdown.\n\nThe plant also suffered a number of chemical explosions which badly damaged the buildings. Radioactive material began leaking into the atmosphere and the Pacific Ocean, prompting the evacuations and an ever-widening exclusion zone.) exposed the dangers of nuclear power. Merkel was right to shut down Germany's nuclear programme.
1.2.7.2.2. Pro: Other countries like the [United Kingdom](https://theconversation.com/how-nuclear-energy-can-help-make-all-uk-electricity-green-by-2035-169185)(Boris Johnson is set to announce at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester that all of Britain’s electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035, according to a recent report in the Times.\n\nThe government suspects that the British public – tired of petrol station queues and dreading winter gas bills – will like the idea of moving away from fossil fuels. But the nature of this energy crisis, stoked by a late summer lull in wind power generation, high wholesale gas prices and Britain’s meagre prospects for storing energy, demands a careful response.\n\nAnd what energy technology offers low-carbon credentials and a reliable base supply? The UK government’s emphatic answer appears to be nuclear power.) are investing in nuclear energy to meet their renewable energy targets.
1.3. Con: Merkel has not ensured a smooth succession of power in Germany.
1.3.1. Pro: Germany will experience [political instability](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56821462) since Merkel's Christian Democratic Union \(CDU\) coalition was defeated by the Social Democrats \(SPD\) in the 2021 general election.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The CDU obtained only [24.1%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56821462)(The centre-left SPD came first with 25.7% of the vote, followed by the conservative alliance \(CDU\) of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel on 24.1% - its worst result ever.) of the vote in the September general election, its worst result ever.
1.3.1.2. Con: Despite the poor performance of the CDU, [extremist parties did poorly](https://cepa.org/goodbye-merkel-consensus-hello-to-the-new-consensus/)(Perhaps one of the biggest takeaways, however, and one that has largely gone under the radar, is that it was the mainstream parties that performed well, while the anti-establishment parties performed poorly. Both the far-right Alternative für Deutschland \(AfD\) and the far-left Die Linke actually lost support. In 2017, AFD brought in 12.6% of the vote, causing significant alarm about the potential rise of a party with racist elements and even some ties to Neo-Nazis. But they seem to have either hit a ceiling or simply lost steam, dropping to 10.5% this year, though their strong performance in some districts like Thuringia does give cause for concern. Similarly, Die Linke dropped from 9.2% in 2017 to just 5% this year, the barrier for parliamentary representation.).
1.3.2. Con: The future direction of the Bundestag has been determined by German voters, not by Merkel.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The move away from the Christian Democratic Union is reflective of a [broader Western rejection of conservative centrism](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/05/merkels-final-mistake-is-her-chosen-successor/)(Centrist parties like the CDU are on the decline around the world, as power shifts towards right-wing populists and resurgent leftist tendencies. In Germany, the Green party and the far-right Alternative for Germany \(AfD\) have been eating into the electoral base of both the main center-right and center-left parties before Kramp-Karrenbauer took power.).
1.3.3. Pro: The Christian Democratic Union is about to choose [its fourth leader](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/07/germanys-cdu-leader-armin-laschet-is-willing-to-step-down-after-election-defeat)(The leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union \(CDU\) has signalled he is prepared to step down after his party’s defeat in last month’s federal elections, but intends to oversee the search for a candidate to unite the fractious centre-right.\n\nArmin Laschet, Angela Merkel’s designated successor who ended up leading the CDU to its worst result in postwar history, said at a press conference on Thursday evening that the time had come to renew the personnel at the front of the party.) since 2018.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Merkel's choice for leader of the Christian Democratic Union, [Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/05/merkels-final-mistake-is-her-chosen-successor/), was a poor choice.
1.3.3.2. Con: The incompetence of Merkel's replacements is not her fault.
1.3.3.3. Con: Just because the CDU as a party struggles to find and keep a new leader does not mean that this affects the succession of power in Germany as a country - especially since Merkel's successor as chancellor will not be / is not from the CDU.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: The historically bad results of the CDU in the 2021 election were caused in part by [Merkel's failure to establish a suitable successor](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/pressure-rises-on-cdu-csu-after-worst-election-result-since-wwii.html)(Another of the reasons the party has fared worse in this vote is undoubtedly due to the imminent departure of Merkel. Experts note that previous votes for the CDU-CSU bloc were in fact votes for Merkel, a trusted leader who attracted voters for her pragmatic and steady approach to politics at home and abroad.\n\nDespite attempts to make Laschet appeal to voters as a continuity candidate and someone who can fill Merkel’s shoes, he has not had the same appeal, and has even managed to alienate many during the election campaign, having been caught on camera laughing during a visit to a flood-hit German town.) prior to her departure.
1.4. Con: Merkel's approach to foreign policy has been damaging to international relations.
1.4.1. Con: Merkel's conservative approach to reform has allowed for continued unity within the European Union.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Merkel only approved [small, incremental changes](https://ecfr.eu/publication/beyond-merkelism-what-europeans-expect-of-post-election-germany/)(Instead, she advocated small, predictable steps to manage the many challenges the union faced. In other words, she tried to change just enough to maintain the status quo. Her priority was to make political moves as inclusive as possible, often settling for the lowest common denominator.) to EU policy, allowing her political moves to be as inclusive as possible.

In the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, the former German defence minister, is in charge. For the next six months, German ministers will be cajoling their peers into signing off legislation as the country takes over the EU’s rotating presidency. In the European Council, where the bloc’s leaders butt heads, it might technically be Charles Michel, the former prime minister of Belgium, heading it. But it is Angela Merkel—longer in post than the leaders of France, Spain, Italy and Poland combined—who is the undisputed top dog.), allowing for high levels of influence over Europe-wide policy.
1.4.2. Pro: Britain, the [second-largest economy in the EU](https://fullfact.org/economy/uk-largest-economies-eu/)(The UK is either the second or third largest economy in the EU, depending on the measure used.), left the union during the period of Merkel's influence.
1.4.3. Con: Merkel has consistently remained [one of the most popular leaders](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/09/22/germany-and-merkel-receive-high-marks-internationally-in-chancellors-last-year-in-office/) in the world.
1.4.3.1.

1.4.4. Pro: Merkel has struggled to gain the respect of prominent world leaders.
1.4.4.1. Con: President Biden has [expressed his respect](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/15/remarks-by-president-biden-and-chancellor-merkel-of-the-federal-republic-of-germany-in-press-conference/)(But I want to take a moment to acknowledge the historic nature of her chancellorship. First woman chancellor in German history. The first chancellor from the former East Germany. And now, the second largest — longest-serving chancellor since Helmut Kohl. Here’s an exemplary life of groundbreaking service to Germany and, I might add — and I mean it from the bottom of my heart — to the world.\n \nOn behalf of the United States, thank you, Angela, for your career of strong, principled leadership. And thank you for speaking out for what is right and for never failing to defend human dignity.) for Merkel and her long-standing service to Germany and the international community.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Merkel and Boris Johnson have had a [consistently contentious](https://spectator.clingendael.org/en/publication/merkel-and-uk-shared-vision-lack-understanding)(Yet, once again, we should not kid ourselves. There is clearly a desire in Berlin to work closely with the UK, particularly on issues such as security where EU capabilities remain limited. However, a choice between this relationship and EU solidarity would still be a no-brainer for any German chancellor. And, if Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union of Germany \(CDU\) is out of power and the next chancellor is from a different political tradition to the prime minister, Boris Johnson should not mistake politeness for shared priorities.\n\nOr, instead of reading between the lines, we could perhaps heed Merkel’s clear advice on her final trip to London: “We look at each other, we look at how different people can be, and we make the best of it.”) relationship.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Vladimir Putin [brought his unchained dog](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210820-merkel-putin-era-ends-dogs-flowers-and-tart-ripostes)(In the middle of their talks, a big black Labrador sauntered in.

This was a clear demonstration of disrespect.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Merkel said she thought he did this to "[prove he's a man](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/1/7313443/vladimir-putin-merkel)(Later, in discussing the incident with a group of reporters, Merkel attempted an explanation of Putin's behavior. Her quote, reported in George Packer's December 2014 profile of Merkel in the New Yorker, is one of the most pithily succinct insights into Putin and the psychology of his 14-year reign that I have read:\n\n"I understand why he has to do this — to prove he's a man," Merkel said. "He's afraid of his own weakness. Russia has nothing, no successful politics or economy. All they have is this."\n\nMerkel is not the first person to suggest that Putin's machismo — everything from his harassment of fellow heads of state to his shirtless photos to his invasion of Ukraine — are shows of strength meant to mask feelings of weakness. But she has put her finger on this phenomenon with remarkable bluntness.)".
1.4.4.3.2.

1.4.4.3.3. Con: Putin has claimed in interviews that [he trusts Merkel](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/01/11/462677207/in-interview-a-confrontational-putin-takes-on-nato)(The German reporters wanted to know whether Putin trusted German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n"Yes, I trust her, she is a very open person," he said. But, he added, "she is also subject to certain constraints and limitations.") and considers her an "open" person.
1.4.4.4. Con: Much of the disrespect shown to Merkel was misogynistic.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: George W. Bush [once gave her an impromptu shoulder rub](https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2006/jul/28/bushrubsmerke)(Earlier this month the US president, George Bush, was captured giving Germany's leader Angela Merkel a quick back rub at the G8 summit in St Petersburg.

1.5.2. Con: Brinkmanship \([threatening or suggesting military action](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/brinkmanship)(brinkmanship\n\nthe activity, especially in politics, of trying to get what you want by saying that if you do not get it, you will do something dangerous: \n\n- The talks have collapsed and both sides have resorted to brinkmanship.)\) towards powerful neighbours can lead to war. [Merkel's moderation](https://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-calls-retreat-from-multilateralism-biggest-threat-to-the-world/)(In such a setting, “harsh words” can “quickly turn into provocative actions — if we look at what’s going on in the South China Sea, what’s going on in Taiwan,” the chancellor cautioned, referencing China’s aggressive behavior over territorial disputes in the region. “And from something like that, military conflicts can arise again.”\n\nSpeaking via video from Berlin, Merkel appealed to all countries to “very, very carefully protect and nurture the institutions we founded back then … because otherwise, we’ll be living in a world in which conflicts can arise unexpectedly and unintentionally, without us having the appropriate resolution mechanisms.”\n\nMerkel, who also used her appearance to advocate for dialogue with Russia amid tensions over Moscow’s troop build-up at the Ukrainian border, concluded: “As long as you are talking, you don’t shoot at each other.”) is designed to avoid that.
1.5.3.

The AfD, who was founded by a man named Bjorn Hocke, famous for writing a political book that, at times, is indistinguishable from Hitler’s Mein Kampf, has been surging in popularity since its 2013 founding and, today, it is the leading opposition party in the German Parliament.). In reaction to Merkel's handling of the crisis, the far-right of Germany's political spectrum and, in particular, the Alternative for Germany \(AfD\) saw [a surge in popularity](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35806047) and established itself as a political force.
1.5.3.1. Con: Right-wing populism has [been growing in European countries](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36130006)(Nationalism has always been a feature across Europe's political spectrum but there has been a recent boom in voter support for right-wing and populist parties.\n\nIt is visible from Germany, where the AfD has become the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag, to Spain, where Vox has become the third largest force in parliament.\n\nIn part, voters are frustrated with the political establishment, but they also have concerns about globalisation, immigration, a dilution of national identity and the European Union.), including [countries](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/02/finland-election-finns-party-far-right/)(Finland’s extreme right came a close second at the last election, and they’re baying for power next time around.

1.5.3.2.1. Pro: This is particularly problematic for the CDU and its Bavarian partner party CSU since they claimed for the past decades to be the sole representatives of Germany's conservatives.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Franz Josef Strauss, the long-time chairman and idol of the CSU, famously [said](https://www.politico.eu/article/4-reasons-markus-soder-should-not-be-german-chancellor/) that there should be "nothing to the right of the CSU except the wall."
1.5.3.2.2. Con: The AfD's increasing popularity [may reflect an international drift towards right-wing populism](https://www.dw.com/en/afd-what-you-need-to-know-about-germanys-far-right-party/a-37208199)(Studies have suggested that the AfD has siphoned off supporters from all of Germany's established mainstream parties, and it currently boasts more than 23,000 members. Thus, some commentators see the rise of the party as part of the same populist international trend that saw voters in the UK approve the Brexit referendum and Americans elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.) instead of a reaction to Merkel's policies.
1.6. Pro: Merkel has been highly effective at building domestic and international consensus.

Merkel has remained silent on these issues.
1.6.2. Con: Merkel maintained consensus by only seeking the minimum amount of change required to maintain the status quo.
1.6.2.1. Con: This maintenance of the status quo itself has been contentious and increasingly undermined any resemblance of a national consensus.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Surveys [showed](https://www.progressives-zentrum.org/is-there-momentum-for-change-before-the-german-election-2021/?lang=en) a desire for political change and a different leadership style at record levels during the final year of Merkel's time in office.
1.6.3. Pro: Merkel has been perceived as a role model for other leaders, giving them somebody to look up to and attempt to imitate.
1.6.4. Pro: Merkel has masterfully [maintained party alliances and coalitions](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/the-secret-of-angela-merkels-extraordinary-success-her-understanding-of-german-politics/)(From the start of her career, Merkel understood that in the German system it is crucial to maintain a close network of party allies. And while Merkel may not be charismatic in public, she forges close and personal connections with ease. These connections, along with her capacity to sniff out the political mood, helped her outscheme her many challengers for the party leadership.).
1.7. Pro: Merkel has successfully handled several major crises.
1.7.1. Con: Merkel failed to effectively deal with the eurozone debt crisis.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The financial assistance programs and structural reforms enacted to promote Greek recovery were structured to [benefit German and French banks](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/greece-bailout-imf-europe/567892/) rather than promote long term recovery.
1.7.2. Pro: Merkel led Germany through the [COVID-19 crisis](https://www.france24.com/en/20200329-merkel-shines-in-handling-of-germany-s-coronavirus-crisis)(Merkel’s response to the coronavirus pandemic is still very much a work in progress, but a poll released Friday by ZDF television showed 89% of Germans thought the government was handling it well. The poll saw Merkel strengthen her lead as the country’s most important politician, and a strong 7% rise for her center-right Union bloc after months in which it was weighed down by questions over its future leadership.\n\nThe poll, done by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nThe 65-year-old chancellor initially had Health Minister Jens Spahn be the public face of the government’s response, drawing some criticism but has taken center stage over the past two weeks.) with great success.
1.7.2.1.

The country could throw open its doors to people from all over the world to take unwanted and unfilled jobs, pay taxes, and support the increasingly aging population.\n\nThat is exactly what Germany did.

Germany now has the fifth largest population of refugees in the world \(after Turkey, Colombia, Pakistan, and Uganda\).).
1.8. Pro: Merkel has substantially improved the German economy.
1.8.1.

As such, the improvements are somewhat artificial and bound to falter in coming years.
