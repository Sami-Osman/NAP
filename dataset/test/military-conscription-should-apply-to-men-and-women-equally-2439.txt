Discussion Name: Military conscription should apply to men and women equally.

1. Military conscription should apply to men and women equally.
1.1. Con: Opening conscription to both men and women would significantly weaken militaries.
1.1.1. Pro: Men are more qualified for military service than women, due to their [inherent physical advantages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477683), so they should bear the responsibility of protecting their nation.
1.1.1.1. Pro: National security is best served by the most able-bodied; equal conscription would not be a good strategy as women have much less strenuous [PT requirements](https://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/army-basic-training-pft) that could lower total military effectiveness.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The military gives [physicals](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2015/11/03/one-in-three-russians-exempt-from-military-service-for-medical-reasons-a50610) before an individual attends basic training; those lacking strength can be appropriately [streamed or exempted](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/04/health/heel-spurs-military-deferments/index.html) at this point.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Conscription that excludes individuals based on the results of their physicals is disproportionately likely to recruit men, particularly for combat roles. This would create little change compared to the current state of the military.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Due to the increase in mechanization and automation, there has been a [reduction](https://taskandpurpose.com/joining-the-military/change-physical-standards-recognize-jobs-dont-require-combat-fitness/) in the overall fitness requirements of the military.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Due to high physical demands, not all male recruits would qualify for physically demanding military roles. Equal conscription increases the recruitment pool and makes it easier to find those suited to strenuous tasks.
1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Physical strength is easily measurable; therefore, regardless of gender, all who meet performance capability standards should be enlisted for military service.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: The current combat standards are not sufficient as they are [arbitrary](https://mwi.usma.edu/women-arent-problem-standards/)(Under current fitness standards based on age and gender, my thirty-seven-year-old former platoon sergeant must run two miles in 18:18 to pass with the minimum sixty points. But if one of our twenty-year-old privates were to take that long, he would score only twenty-seven points and fail. Yet we were all expected to carry the same weapons, perform the same tasks, and go on the same patrols in Afghanistan.) and do not account for age or gender. More realistic standards would help units in combat.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Compulsory conscription is top-down in nature, moving the best recruits to where they are most needed first. Such an approach is likely to limit any decrease in safety. \([p. 30](https://www.inss.org.il/he/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/systemfiles/SystemFiles/memo159.pdf)\)
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: The lowering of physical standards to allow more women into military units [decreases](https://mwi.usma.edu/with-equal-opportunity-comes-equal-responsibility-lowering-fitness-standards-to-accommodate-women-will-hurt-the-army-and-women/) operational ability.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Very few women can achieve the physical standards of specialized units such as the Marines, and many that do reach those standards suffer [more injuries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/10/marine-experiment-finds-women-get-injured-more-frequently-shoot-less-accurately-than-men/) than men.
1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: In simulated combat, all-male troops [outperform](https://www.wsj.com/articles/women-dont-belong-in-combat-units-11547411638) integrated troops on various aspects including shooting, evading obstacles, or evacuating casualties.
1.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: [Women outperform](https://www.espn.in/shooting/story/_/id/31828521/10m-air-rifle-sport-tokyo-olympics-where-women-outgun-men) men in [shooting](https://rivetermagazine.wordpress.com/2014/03/12/why-are-women-better-shooters/). If the ability to effectively use a rifle is essential for serving as a Marine, then women should be preferred.
1.1.1.1.4.3. Con: A study which concluded the negative aspects of mixed-gender troops was fundamentally [flawed and problematic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/marines-study-casts-doubts-mixed-gender-units), as it only included a four-page summary that did not highlight parts of the study that showed the benefits of integration.
1.1.1.1.4.4. Con: Poor performance on a test of physical ability is not indicative of poor physical ability. Since strength is associated with men, stereotype threat can cause women to [underperform](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235624872_The_Impact_of_Stereotype_Threat_on_Performance_in_Sports) on tests of physical ability \(pp. 7-10\).
1.1.1.1.5. Con: PT requirements can be [standardized](https://taskandpurpose.com/health-fitness/army-wants-gender-neutral-fitnes-test/) for all genders. Doing so will eliminate the double standard that affects female soldiers by causing male service members to assume that women are less physically capable than men.
1.1.1.1.6. Pro: At boot camp, 3 out of 4 women [fail to meet combat standards](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2017/08/11/at-boot-camp-3-out-of-4-women-fail-to-meet-combat-standards/). This suggests that women are not as capable as men in this regard.
1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: After [training](https://www.npr.org/2013/12/27/257363943/marines-most-female-recruits-dont-meet-new-pullup-standard)("At first, a lot of women weren't able to do it," Jacob says. "They were able to do one, some were able to do two, but what happened was by having that standard and enforcing that standard, it made my Marines, it made the troops go to the gym and train to that standard."\n\nWithin six months, all of the women in his company were doing eight to 12 pullups, he says.), women recruits were able to meet the same combat standards as men.
1.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: The [high failure rate](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/both-men-and-women-fail-new-marine-corps-fitness-standards) of female recruits calls into question how well integration in the army can work.
1.1.1.1.6.3. Pro: Failure to meet combat standards renders a person [ineligible for military service](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/army-pt-test), irrespective of gender.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1. Con: The US military has been tasked with developing a new set of requirements for those in [non-combat roles](https://getaboutcolumbia.com/lawmakers-have-ordered-the-military-to-establish-a-separate-fitness-standard-for-combat-disciplines/)(“Military personnel in military occupational disciplines that require close combat with the enemy must meet stringent physical fitness requirements to ensure the success of the operational mission,” the report’s language said in the authorization bill.\n\nThe amendment requires Army officials to provide “new, gender-neutral high fitness standards” for Army combat jobs by next summer, if the National Defense Act passes, as usual, this winter. The new requirements will be “higher than the non-combat requirements \[jobs\]. “).
1.1.1.1.6.4. Con: Gender-specific norms for physical appearance \(e.g., slimness in women\) may deter women from developing the [physical capabilities](https://eckercise.com/womenandweighttraining/) required to meet combat standards, many of which are more aligned with norms for men \(e.g., strength, muscle mass\).
1.1.1.1.6.5. Con: The parent claim is only discussing women who applied for [combat arms careers](https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/army-rotc/careers/)(Combat Arms is a collective name for troops within national armed forces which participate in direct tactical ground combat. Combat Arms works together with the Combat Service and Combat Support branches to complete any task or mission in order to successfully defend the United States of America, its allies, and its interest.). There are numerous [non-combat roles](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/non-combat-military-jobs)(Serving your country doesn't always mean having to participate in combat positions within the military. There are several non-combat jobs that allow you to contribute to the betterment of the United States. In this article, we explore the meaning of a non-combat position and 25 non-combat military jobs to consider if you're thinking about joining a branch of the military.) in the military.
1.1.1.2. Con: The military has [many occupations](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/jobs-in-the-military-that-don%27t-involve-combat) in various branches that are dedicated to non-combat areas such as logistics, communications, command and control, medical support, civilian-military cooperation, and signals intelligence.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Enforcing equal conscription would require that roles necessitating less "physical prowess" be accordingly filled by women, with the rest taken by men. This would lead to the correct allocation of people within the military, improving its efficiency.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: In many ways, women are [stronger than men](https://elemental.medium.com/what-makes-women-strong-2c927bf286ef): they have more endurance, greater pain tolerance, and lower fatigability. All of these [characteristics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/11/the-weaker-sex-science-that-shows-women-are-stronger-than-men) make them better suited to combat.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: Only assigning women to roles that do not require physical prowess would reinforce gender roles. Properly serving in the military requires combat readiness, endurance, and strength training.
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: [80% of military personel are non-combatants](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-myths.html), so poor battlefield performance for mixed-gender units is not an issue.
1.1.1.2.5. Pro: In the Air Force, "[work smarter, not harder](https://amuedge.com/show-your-colors-my-time-with-the-air-force/)(In my personal experience, it was a branch that consistently engaged your problem-solving mindset at every level. Your ability to think creatively and quickly became your most valuable asset. The phrase “work smarter, not harder” was adopted as the unofficial motto of nearly every squadron that I encountered.)" is repeated quite often to remind soldiers of this diversity in positions.
1.1.1.3. Con: Today's military [relies less](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/cliche-boots-on-the-ground-syria-iraq/414097/)(As Helene Cooper recently detailed in The New York Times, in the past year “American pilots have assumed a huge bulk of the war effort \[against the Islamic State\]. They have conducted more than 4,700 airstrikes since August 2014 ... and provided air support for Iraqi security forces and Kurdish pesh merga fighters on the ground.”\n\nIn a sense, Obama is right that he has been consistent. The U.S. military’s ground presence in Iraq and Syria has been restricted over the past year. But America has nevertheless been waging a war this whole time.) on physical strength; rather, it now favours drones, missile strikes, and elite operations over traditional boots on the ground missions.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: One of the mottos of the Marines is "[every Marine is a rifleman](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2021/04/02/every-marine-a-rifleman-still-relevant-says-sergeant-major-of-the-corps/)," making skilled specialisation a core part of their service.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The battlefield of the world is shifting as more wars are fought with technology and fewer occur on the battlefield. Most soldiers will [not need to resort](https://www.wearethemighty.com/military-life/why-the-term-every-marine-is-a-rifleman-needs-to-stop/) to only using their rifle during their military careers.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.2.1.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Marksmanship is considered the most important skill that a Marine can have, as it empowers them to effectively utilize their weapons to neutralize threats \([p. 53](https://mca-marines.org/wp-content/uploads/0521-Every-Marine-a-Rifleman.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Modern inventions, such as assault rifles and vehicular warfare, have leveled the playing field of physical strength greatly when it comes to fighting wars.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: The modern military is multi-faceted and [data driven](https://warontherocks.com/2020/02/the-army-needs-full-stack-data-scientists-and-analytics-translators/); roles that focus on these skills may keep women from armed combat whilst still strengthening the army.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Cyber threats require military agencies to be equipped with [cyber war units](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/09/15/when-cyber-war-becomes-war/?sh=41c15cc36186). As this does not required armed combat, women can be assigned these roles within the military.
1.1.1.3.3.2. Con: Even when not part of the infantry, strength is required to handle heavy equipment.
1.1.1.4. Con: Generally, women are able to endure many [harsh conditions](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/kU4sAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA29) on roughly the same level as men. \(p.29\)
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Due to gendered social problems like poverty, [climate change](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/how-climate-change-affects-women/)(The IPCC \[International Panel on Climate Change\] found that gender inequalities are further exaggerated by climate-related hazards, and they result in higher workloads for women, occupational hazards indoors and outdoors, psychological and emotional stress, and higher mortality compared to men,” Verona Collantes, an intergovernmental specialist with UN Women, told Global Citizen.) is expected to negatively impact women's health more than men's health. This could significantly reduce the pool of healthy women who are eligible for conscription.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Women often make excellent [professional sailors](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/26/gender.features11), as they are attuned to their sleep cycles, have a preference for strategy over strength, and possess the will to succeed. Such traits may also suit naval military conditions.
1.1.1.4.3. Pro: Women [outlive](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/4/E832) men in epidemics and famines, indicating their longevity.
1.1.1.5. Pro: On dimensions relevant to [physical conflict](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205132404.htm), men are, on average, stronger than women. Their biological endowment makes them better suited for [military combat](https://www.livescience.com/52998-women-combat-gender-differences.html).
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Women are less biologically capable than men as they have [less dense bones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12830370) and [muscle structure](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jappl.2000.89.1.81). This reduces their capacity to perform physically strenuous roles.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: Society embraces the concept of "[hysterical strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterical_strength)," yet considers women unfit to use their strength in combat. This is disingenuous and indicates that women should be conscripted.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Hysterical strength is a rare occurrence, which occurs only in extreme situations. It is impractical to rely on that kind of strength, when people with sufficient ordinary strength for the tasks of a soldier exist.
1.1.1.5.3. Pro: In the Air Force test for lifting ability, [68% of men and 1% of women can lift 110 pounds](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm). During times of danger, men's greater lifting ability empowers them, whilst women's relative inability could put them in jeopardy.
1.1.1.5.3.1. Con: The [relevance of lifting abilities](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm)(I do not know how important lifting capacity is in the range of capabilities that enhance combat effectiveness.) to military participation has not been proven.
1.1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: In the US, the average man and woman weigh about [200 and 170 pounds](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm), respectively. Thus, carrying an injured soldier would be a challenge for both men and women.
1.1.1.5.3.1.2. Con: When the relevance of a specific ability to military performance is unknown, it is more prudent to regard it as relevant in case it is necessary in a life-and-death scenario.
1.1.1.5.3.2. Con: The author uses demeaning terms, such as "[weakling women](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm)," which suggests that his opinions about women's potential contributions to the military stem from benevolent sexism and should be discounted.
1.1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The author admits that the potential ramifications of poor lifting abilities are based on the [personal opinions of a colonel](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm)(\[I\]t does resonate with the clincher line of the retired colonel’s argument quoted above \(p. 159\), that a weakling woman would be unable to save her wounded comrade’s life in battle by dragging him away.), not empirical evidence.
1.1.1.5.3.2.2. Con: The use of demeaning language invalidates the credibility of the author, but it does not negate the underlying empirical findings.
1.1.1.5.3.3. Con: Including women in the army does not exclude men. In the event that an injured soldier requires assistance, more than one soldier can provide assistance, regardless of gender.
1.1.1.5.3.4. Pro: Hand grip strength is a significant factor in the ability to manually lift and carry loads. Even highly trained, athletic women have significantly [lesser grip strength](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186303/) than the average man, putting them at a disadvantage.
1.1.1.5.4. Con: Some women are as strong, or stronger, than the average man. If strength is important, then [these women](https://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm) should be conscripted.
1.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Differences in strength could be attributed to [culture, rather than biology](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm). Thus, from childhood, girls could be trained to develop their lifting abilities if conscription is made equal.
1.1.1.5.4.2. Con: To identify the limited number of women who are as strong as men, the military would have to conscript larger pools of women and exclude larger numbers of women who fail fitness tests. This may be a drain on military resources.
1.1.1.5.5. Con: Even though there are physical differences between the average man and the average woman, there is significant overlap, making differences between individuals way less significant than [averages](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm).
1.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: The idea of impractical sex-based strength differences adheres to a [faulty generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization) that frames women as physically weak as a whole. Many women are physically agile and strong.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: Notions of sex-based strengths are more likely to be based on deliberate efforts to undermine how girls and women perceive themselves, as demonstrated by the insult, "[You throw like a girl](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259160571_You_throw_like_a_girl_The_effect_of_stereotype_threat_on_women%27s_athletic_performance_and_gender_stereotypes)", than implicit generalizations.
1.1.1.5.5.1.2. Pro: While women's muscles tend to have less strength, they are [more resistant](https://www.livestrong.com/article/355987-female-male-muscles/) to fatigue. This improves female soldiers' endurance.
1.1.1.5.5.2. Pro: Those not suited to military service are likely to be [exempt](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-medical-conditions.html); therefore, limiting skills gaps between men and women in practice as outliers are excluded.
1.1.1.5.5.3. Con: Conscripting an equal number of women on the basis of gender equality effectively implies a loss of an equal number of male combat staff, who would be more efficient during times of war by virtue of their strength and endurance.
1.1.1.5.5.4. Pro: Since the military also uses assessment to determine rank, grouping and entry, averages have very little impact on conscription. The military will take into individual traits and pick the best of the best, regardless of who is conscripted.
1.1.2. Pro: Military cohesion may be weakened if women are conscripted equally.
1.1.2.1. Con: [Cohesion issues](https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/184/5-6/e131/5160926?login=true) within mixed-gender troops are [negligible](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/389575/20141218_WGCC_Findings_Paper_Final.pdf) \(p. 5\).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Cohesion issues may arise in mixed-gender military units when performance standards differ for men and women \([p. 4](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep27485.pdf)(Recent studies, such as a 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service, show that strong\nunit cohesion is more likely when physical and performance standards are “applied equally to men and women.”)\).
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Any problems that arise from having mixed-gender troops can be mitigated by having gender-segregated units.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Gender-segregated units are not uncommon and are used successfully in nations like [Norway](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/inside-world-s-first-all-female-special-forces-unit-norway-n746041).
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Gender segregation implies that men and women cannot get along and that the only way to resolve gender-based conflicts is by separating the two groups. Instead, men and women should be trained to be more [cooperative and collaborative](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dedehenley/2018/03/16/the-big-idea-men-and-women-working-as-partners/?sh=f89aac7aacbf).
1.1.2.2. Pro: [Military recruits](https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2021/01/06/initiation-rituals-within-the-military-time-for-a-change/) are often subjected to [initiation rituals and ceremonies](https://www.salon.com/2004/06/04/carol_burke/) which promote male bonding. Such acts can alienate women and weaken cohesion within units.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Hazing is often [misogynistic](https://www.dw.com/en/female-bundeswehr-soldiers-abused-and-forced-to-pole-dance/a-37571140) and, if supported by the chain of command, can perpetuate a incredibly harmful work culture.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Issues of hazing may be [endemic](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/02/07/nearly-90-of-military-hazing-complaints-come-marine-corps-data-shows.html) to particular units; were these to be reformed, then equal conscription could be viable.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: Hazing can be combatted with adequate training of senior personnel, targetting key opportunities for misbehaviour while providing supportive alternatives. \([p. 29](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/tools/TL200/TL240/RAND_TL240.pdf)(Leaders should monitor key situations in which hazing might be most likely to occur, including when someone joins a unit, is promoted, or goes through other transitions.\n\nExplore ways to provide alternative bonding and celebratory activities. Given that rituals and traditions are an important part of Military culture, as a leader, you can explore ways to provide alternative approved activities that can promote bonding and provide a safe way to celebrate changes in status or new accomplishments. However, these should be consistently monitored to ensure that approved actions do not transition into hazing\nacts.)\).
1.1.2.3. Pro: The possibility of [dating and sex](https://www.hprc-online.org/social-fitness/teams-leadership/fraternization-dating-and-sex-your-unit-how-close-too-close) between fellow military service members can distract from one's duties and hurt morale and team readiness.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: By this logic, gay and lesbian individuals should not be allowed to serve in the military since they might be distracted by same-sex members. Yet this is generally not seen as problematic.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: In the US military, for example, [only about 6%](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9955z6.html) of service members identify as gay or lesbian. This share is much smaller - and thus less problematic - than what equal conscription would cause. The two are therefore not comparable.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Gay people are still [barred from military](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-transgender-military-ban-leaves-few-countries-lgbt-rights-642342) service [in many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation_and_military_service_by_country#/media/File:Map_of_homosexuality_and_military_service.svg) and, in most countries where they are permitted, this is a recent development.
1.1.3. Con: Those arguing against female conscription have no evidence that women are unable to perform at the same level as men.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The [available evidence](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Publications/Article/1411860/women-regardless-understanding-gender-bias-in-us-military-integration/) suggests that many women are able to perform at the same level as men; that [some women are unable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26159007/) to participate in national defense is not a valid argument against their conscription, as the same is true for some men as well.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: This source also implies that standards for men should be lowered to produce a single unisex physical requirement. While a few women may be able to meet the original requirements, standards maybe reduced to include women who cannot serve at the same level as has historically been required.
1.1.3.2. Con: Any task involving extreme physical activities in a life threatening situation would be much more taxing for women than men.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Nations with equal conscription have demonstrated that militaries are not weakened when implementing this measure.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: In Israel, equal sex [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Israel) works well.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In 2021, Israel's military was ranked [20/140 in the annual GFP review](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=israel), indicating that their military was not adversely affected by the inclusion of women.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: In Israel, mixed-gender battalions are uncommon \([p. 81](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1000762.pdf)\), so many women serve in women-only units. This might not be possible in other countries.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: Nations that enforce equal conscription may be fundamentally different from nations that don't, such as on gender equality metrics. Therefore, what works in one country may not work in others.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Gender-neutral conscription is practiced only in [Norway and Sweden](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/countries-with-compulsory-military-service-554340.html) - which are among the most [gender-equal countries](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2021.pdf) in the world \(p. 10\).
1.1.3.3.2.2. Con: Countries that practice [selective conscription](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/countries-with-compulsory-military-service-554340.html) of women do not rank high on gender equality indices. Notably, North Korea practices conscription but is deeply [patriarchal](https://www.independent.co.uk/world/north-korean-women-rights-kim-jongun-domestic-violence-sexual-harassment-a8525086.html).
1.1.3.3.2.3. Con: Conscription of men and women may improve gender equality in those countries, thus solving the problem by itself.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Several nations have fielded all-female units, some of which have [stellar records](https://militaryhistorynow.com/2016/04/18/sisters-in-arms-historys-famous-and-not-so-famous-female-fighting-forces/) on par with their nation's most decorated all-male units.
1.1.3.3.4. Pro: Soviet Russia conscripted women to be pilots and snipers amongst other roles. [89 women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_women_in_World_War_II) received the highest combat award for their participation in demonstrating their skill.
1.1.4. Pro: Serving in the military has life-and-death implications. Conscription based on gender equality rather than physical capability may [endanger lives](https://nypost.com/2015/11/22/struggling-firefighter-injured-after-just-10-days-into-new-job/).
1.1.4.1. Con: The implicit assumption that the only way to save lives is through the use of physical force is incorrect.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Physical force may not be the only means of saving lives. However, when it is necessary, having a strong military is essential.
1.1.4.2. Con: The military already relies heavily on [combat equipment](https://taskandpurpose.com/joining-the-military/change-physical-standards-recognize-jobs-dont-require-combat-fitness/), rather than direct physical force, when engaging with enemies. As this increases, the importance of physical capabilities diminishes.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Combat equipment is [quite heavy](https://www.npr.org/2011/04/10/134421473/weight-of-war-soldiers-heavy-gear-packs-on-pain), weighing up to 100 lbs for a standard load. It is crucial to have the physical capability to carry it, or a soldier could run the risk of back injuries and chronic pain.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Unmanned aerial vehicles \([UAVs](https://www.britannica.com/technology/military-aircraft/Unmanned-aerial-vehicles-UAVs)\) are increasingly used on the battlefield. As they can be piloted remotely, they drastically reduce the demand for combat-trained soldiers.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Women in the military face a higher risk of being [raped by a fellow soldier](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5760295&page=1) than being killed by enemy soldiers.
1.1.4.4. Con: Women are excluded from combat roles in [many countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51385224); this reduces their risk of death and injury compared to their male peers.
1.1.4.5. Pro: US female soldiers who were wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq had a [higher death rate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21390560/) than men who were involved in the same operations.
1.1.5. Con: Instead of excluding women from the draft, responsibilities should be made proportionate to advantages shared by group members on average. If women on average are better strategically, they should occupy those roles.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Cumulative disadvantages imposed by selecting members of both sexes to fill identical positions, when one sex is better suited for the job, could cause an adverse outcome for the military campaign.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: There is no empirical evidence to suggest that women and men playing identical roles leads to a strategic disadvantage for the military.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Deploying female troops [boosts effectiveness](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13773.doc.htm) in peacekeeping missions, as they are better able to reach out to both men and women and promote a less confrontational atmosphere.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Strategic disadvantages caused by female conscription would be more pronounced if the enemy country follows male-only conscription. Therefore, countries may prefer to play it safe and have a military that matches those of potential enemies.
1.1.5.2. Con: There is a fine line between average group differences and stereotypes; assigning roles based on such generalizations could reinforce stereotypical notions of what men and women are differentially suited for.
1.1.5.3. Con: Such differentiation would require a much bigger miltiary bureaucracy to organize, which would be incredibly costly.
1.1.5.4. Con: Selection for roles should be based on the competence of each individual, not on stereotypes.
1.1.5.5. Con: There is no proof women may perform better on a strategic standpoint.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: Women tend to be [more cautious](https://www.psychological-consultancy.com/blog/women-twice-likely-cautious-risk-men/) and take more calculated risks based on a holistic understanding of issues. These traits are highly relevant in military operations as they could reduce necessary risks and maximize risks with a good payoff.
1.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Men take more "[idiotic risks](https://www.livescience.com/49101-darwin-awards-are-men-idiots.html)" than women, thereby posing significant threats to their own survival and the survival of those around them.
1.1.5.5.1.2. Pro: A study of male and female chess players demonstrated that women are more likely to choose risk-averse opening strategies, and that men's strategies are more often impacted by the sex of their opponent \([pp. 14, 16](https://repec.iza.org/dp4793.pdf)(In Table 2, the results from the OLS estimations are shown. As can be seen from column \(1\), the female dummy coefficient is .0204, implying that the marginal probability for women to choose a solid opening strategy is about 2 percentage points greater than for men, holding constant for age, Elo rating, number of games played and regional dummies. The estimate is significant on a one percent level, which implies that there is strong statistical support for the claim that female players prefer opening strategies that are considered more risk-averse than their male counterparts. \n\[...\]\nFor male players the probability of choosing a solid strategy is about 1.3 percent lower when facing a female opponent compared to a male opponent, see column \(1\) in Table 3. In other words, men on average abstain more often from using solid strategies when playing against women.)\).
1.1.5.6. Pro: There is a long history of women demonstrating success in [intelligence and espionage](https://www.spymuseum.org/exhibition-experiences/sisterhood-of-spies/)(Explore the shadowy world of espionage and uncover the secret history of female spies whose heroic achievements, courage and strength outshine James Bond. \n\nThese remarkable women completed some of the most daring missions in history, using everything in their power to gain information, and risking it all for a cause they believed in.) roles.
1.1.5.6.1. Pro: Women cryptologists have made extraordinary contributions to US military efforts, including breaking the "Purple" code during WWII, which helped secure the Allied victory \([pp. 1-2](https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/sharing_the_burden.pdf)(The cryptanalysts working for the Signals Intelligence Service \(SIS\) of the U.S. Army knew how crucial it was\nto decipher and read Japanese secret messages. But this new code, “Purple,” wasn't breaking.\n\[...\]\nThen, one day in September 1940, Genevieve Grotjan made a discovery that would change the course of history. By analyzing and studying the intercepted coded messages, she found a correlation that no one else had yet detected. This breakthrough enabled other cryptanalysts to find similar links. Shortly thereafter, SIS, along with the U.S. Navy, built a “Purple” analog machine to decode the Japanese diplomatic messages.\n\[...\]\n“What \[Genevieve\] Grotjan did was a big step forward and was very significant in the solution of the ‘Purple’.” Her discovery, and the work of other team members, allowed the United States to read secret Japanese diplomatic messages and to continue reading them throughout World War II.\nGenevieve Grotjan’s contribution to the Allied victory cannot be measured.")\).
1.1.5.7. Pro: If women are equal to men, they must be able to achieve the same outcomes as men, regardless of physical abilities. To segregate their roles is to suggest that they cannot.
1.1.5.7.1. Con: Women can be equal in value, without needing to have identical abilities as men.
1.1.5.7.2. Pro: There are [small to nonexistent differences](https://hbr.org/2017/08/what-the-science-actually-says-about-gender-gaps-in-the-workplace) found in the majority of studies that look at the differences between men and women's cognitive abilities, communication, personality traits, measures of well-being, motor skills, and moral reasoning.
1.2. Pro: More women in the military will improve its culture and operation.
1.2.1. Pro: [Rampant](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/217724-invisible-war-fighting-rape-crisis-us-military) [sexual assault](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/100-of-military-sexual-assault-survivors-feel-trapped-have-suicidal-ideations) in the military remains largely unaddressed, possibly due to the lack of women in command. Adding more women to the military might help resolve this.
1.2.1.1. Con: A significant proportion of women in the US military [are in command roles](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/women-in-the-military-4177666) as both commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers. This has not reduced levels of sexual assault.
1.2.1.2. Con: Having women in positions of power does not deter sexual harassment. Rather, women in leadership roles experience [even more harassment](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/825257) as they are exposed to new groups of potential perpetrators.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Following the [chain of command](https://theconversation.com/women-have-served-in-armed-forces-for-decades-but-the-military-is-still-a-mans-world-165136)(The willingness of some officers to ignore or cover up the physical and emotional abuse of women in their units means that the chain of command all too often supports perpetrators instead of the soldiers who are brave enough to make complaints.) can significantly contribute to women's struggles in the military, as it enables misconduct to thrive, leaving women with [little chance for justice](https://abcnews.go.com/US/military-sexual-assault-victims-system-broken/story?id=72499053).
1.2.1.4. Pro: Women have a [disproportionately](https://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/career-advice/military-transition/it-really-is-harder-for-women-to-get-promoted.html) hard time being promoted within their organizations, which is likely to reduce their ability to make social change.
1.2.1.5. Con: Women who have suffered [harm](https://abcnews.go.com/US/military-sexual-assault-victims-system-broken/story?id=72499053) cannot wait for the military to change its system to properly provide support to its victims in accordance to progressive social norms.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Senior military leaders are often [blissfully unaware](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/military-culture-hostile-to-women-gays-says-explosive-canadian-armed-forces-report)(“We had indications of very few individuals coming forward. Our belief therefore was that our policies and procedures were working very well,” he said Thursday. “But what Madame Deschamps’s study and report brought forward is it may not have been working at the level we had confidence in.”) of the scale of problems faced by women in the military. If they are unaware of these challenges, then it is unlikely that they can make the military more welcoming.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: Despite the poor treatment of women in the military, the representation of women [continues to increase](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/04/24/female-soldiers-are-changing-how-armed-forces-work). With time, these demographic shifts will inevitably weaken norms created by a male-dominated system.
1.2.1.6. Pro: The disproportionate representation of men versus women in service may contribute to sexual assault rates. Drafting women could reduce the risk of sexual assault by creating [strength in numbers](https://www.genderontheballot.org/the-strength-in-numbers-for-women-in-politics/).
1.2.2. Pro: Men and women generally have [different](https://www.ilo.org/global/docs/WCMS_632323/lang--en/index.htm) ways of thinking or acting. Having different insights can be [positive](https://cco.ndu.edu/PRISM/PRISM-volume-6-no1/Article/685108/gender-perspectives-and-military-effectiveness-implementing-unscr-1325-and-the/)(A gender perspective casts a critical eye on an area of operations that involves the examination and understanding of social, economic, political, cultural, and religious practices; of how equality and inequality manifest themselves in the distribution of and access to resources and of decisionmaking power not just between rich and poor, but in all parts of society. Gendered dimensions of conflict can indeed be tremendously transformative by affecting both what the operation does and how it does it, in terms of its priorities and tactics. It affects the aims of operations, and expands the range of violence that must be addressed \(including sexual violence and other violence directed at the civilian population, not just the violence of traditional warfare\). Gender perspectives can also inform tactics, for example by shaping behavior along patrol routes, encouraging consultation with people in the local community, and so on.) in organizations such as the army.
1.2.2.1. Pro: As men are often more aggressive than women, \([p. 1032](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S187704281200287X?token=AC9EF03871030D1EFD9CBB200A5C5C801BA791C11F1533A32EAE6C4A81FAD651740DBB668D17AFDF395BA116F64B8615&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20211020090527)(Violence and aggression have traditionally been viewed as being associated with being male. This long-standing lay perception has been supported by several studies which have shown that in general population males perpetrate violent acts approximately ten times more frequently than females \(Tardiff & Sweillam, 1980\).)\) having women in the military could reduce the number of offenses committed against hostages and refugees.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Not having female comrades can make [female officers feel helpless](https://mwi.usma.edu/women-arent-problem-standards/)(I wish I had had a female soldier with me in Afghanistan when an Afghan woman approached me begging for help. Armed males menacingly gathered around to heckle and began physically harassing her for talking to me; I tried to help, but the more I tried, the worse it got. After we left, I never saw that woman again; I’m still haunted by what may have happened to her. If I had had a female soldier with me, that situation might have ended very differently.) in their efforts to help distressed enemy civilians, who are likely to be harmed by male officers. Increasing the number of women could empower units to demonstrate compassion.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The torture and abuse of [Guantanamo Bay](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/AQ-ISIS-Propaganda-Use-of-Gitmo-Issue-Brief.pdf) military prison detainees \(p. 1\) was used as propaganda to recruit terrorists. By improving prisoner treatment through the conscription of women, terrorist recruitment could decrease.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Women work in [Guantanamo Bay](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/05/guantanamo-bay-prisoners-ask-judge-to-ban-use-of-female-guards) where abuses occur [rampantly](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210218-exposing-life-inside-the-worlds-most-notorious-prison), and have previously [participated](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/03/eight-years-after-abu-ghraib-lynndie-englands-not-doing-so-well/330398/) in the torture and humiliation of prisoners in [Abu Ghraib](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/04/04/472964974/it-was-torture-an-abu-ghraib-interrogator-acknowledges-horrible-mistakes).
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: In regions where the rape of civilians by soldiers is very common, uniformed men evoke fear in local women; because uniformed women do not evoke such a response, they are better able to glean [crucial military intelligence](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/04/24/female-soldiers-are-changing-how-armed-forces-work)(She recalls seeing women and children gathered on the edge of a village—victims of rape cast out by their communities. “The last thing a Congolese woman wants to see is a man in uniform,” she recalls, unsurprisingly, in a place where soldiers commit a lot of rape. “But a woman in uniform is different.” At one meeting with women in Eringeti, on the edge of Virunga National Park, the information they shared about when and where attacks might occur was far more useful than other intelligence gleaned by the UN.).
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Anecdotal reports suggest that having [just one woman](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/04/24/female-soldiers-are-changing-how-armed-forces-work)(Rachel Grimes served three tours of Northern Ireland as an officer in the British army. Her colleagues in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the region’s erstwhile police force, noticed that things were different when she—the only woman present—joined police and army patrols. The team’s behaviour changed. Fellow soldiers behaved with more restraint. At checkpoints, locals stopped to talk for longer.) on a military team changes soldiers' behaviors and interactions with locals for the better.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: In [Afghanistan](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/08/cst-afghanistan/), a small team of female Marines were able to amicably engage with 50% of the population that, due to religious and cultural reasons, male soldiers had no access to.
1.2.2.1.3.3. Con: The rape of civilians is a [human rights violation](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/rape-war-crime) and [war crime](https://www.grin.com/document/461960) that must be prevented through strategic intervention, regardless of whether women are conscripted.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: Psychological aggression is what makes men better than women at combat, as they are more likely to have [fight or flight reactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425245/) \(vs tend and befriend\). This should not be diluted as it could decrease the efficacy of an army.
1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: The fight-or-flight reaction is the [instinctive biological response](https://scholar.harvard.edu/marianabockarova/files/tend-and-befriend.pdf)(Although fight-or-flight may characterize the primary physiological responses to stress for both males and females, we propose that, behaviorally, females' responses are more marked by a pattern of "tend-and-befriend.") in both men and women. However, women may feel compelled to mask this response as women are often punished when they [demonstrate aggression](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00081/full).
1.2.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Aggression can be elicited by using [primes and triggers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-017-9747-9#Sec25). Thus, if aggression is what makes men better at combat, aggression can be artificially increased in women.
1.2.2.1.4.2. Con: While war is typically associated with aggression and enmity, [camaraderie, empathy, and kindness](https://theworldlink.com/news/local/acts-of-compassion-kindness-put-human-face-on-war/article_c48fd117-b662-5f0e-a76d-a4cf48b84721.html), [even toward enemies](https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/uk-soldiers-cried-as-afghan-mothers-flung-babies-over-kabul-airport-razor-wire-4107119.html), are celebrated. Being able to tend and befriend is not antithetical to military warfare and could be useful, such as when a wounded soldier requires assistance.
1.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: [Aggression and military service](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/military-men-at-greater-risk-of-committing-violent-crime-8535608.html)(Professor Sir Simon Wessely, co-director of the Centre for Military Health Research at King's College London, who co-authored the study, admitted that an aggressive streak can be useful in a soldier.\n\n"Some people with aggressive dispositions make very good soldiers, that's the nature of the game," he told a press conference in London.\n\nHe added: "My own view, and the view of many people in this area, is that you meet a lot of people in the armed forces who you're glad are in the armed forces, and it's doing them a lot of good.") constitute a vicious cycle, wherein violent men are more likely to enlist in the military, and military experience increases their rate of violent offenses. Conscripting women may break this cycle for the better.
1.2.2.1.4.4. Con: Aggression is not solely correlated to sex. Given this, it should not be a basis for changing conscription legislature.
1.2.2.1.4.4.1. Pro: The tendency to "tend-and-befriend" is more resonant with nurturing [gender roles](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/sex-gender-identity/what-are-gender-roles-and-stereotypes), than sex. Thus, if a tendency to tend and befriend is a valid basis for exclusion, then [nurturing men](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903532804576566943060360516) should also be excluded.
1.2.2.1.4.4.2. Con: In [conflict situations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-57259-0), men often demonstrate a more aggressive response, which is partially attributable to higher levels of testosterone and body muscularity. As women cannot emulate this, it would be inadvisable to recruit them.
1.2.2.1.4.4.3. Pro: Aggression levels may be correlated with demographic categories such as [race, ethnicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383599/), and [socioeconomic status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6816473/). Unequal conscription based on these characteristics would be considered discriminatory, yet sex-based conscription is not.
1.2.2.1.5. Con: Previously, female IDF soldiers have not been allowed to serve as combat staff, as their male comrades acted "[out of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_combat#Tactical_concerns)" when they were injured. Such reactions could spur harm to hostages, refugees, and enemy soldiers.
1.2.2.1.5.1. Con: Uncontrollable male behaviour at the sight of wounded female comrades could be a [learned habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender) and could be unlearned with training.
1.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: The [Australian military](http://www.isiswomen.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=589)(Australian male soldiers have similar feelings. They are reluctant to take women on reconnaissance or special operations, as they fear that in the case of combat or discovery, their priority will be to save the women and not to complete the mission. Thus while men might be able to be programmed to kill, it’s is not as easy to program men to neglect women.) was reluctant to enlist female soldiers because they doubted men's capacity to defy the socialisation that compelled them to protect women.
1.2.2.1.5.3. Con: How men react to wounded female soldiers is influenced by culture. Similar acts of benevolence have not been reported among soldiers in [East Timor and Indonesia](http://www.isiswomen.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=589).
1.2.2.2. Con: Gender differences are largely the product of patriarchal [socialization](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/gender-and-socialization/). As societies become more equal, these gaps will attenuate.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Some research has indicated that there are [differences in the neurological function](https://www.livescience.com/3808-men-women-differently.html)(The brain is made primarily of two different types of tissue, called gray matter and white matter. This new research reveals that men think more with their gray matter, and women think more with white. Researchers stressed that just because the two sexes think differently, this does not affect intellectual performance.\n...\nTheir findings show that in general, men have nearly 6.5 times the amount of gray matter related to general intelligence compared with women, whereas women have nearly 10 times the amount of white matter related to intelligence compared to men.\n\n"These findings suggest that human evolution has created two different types of brains designed for equally intelligent behavior," said Haier, adding that, "by pinpointing these gender-based intelligence areas, the study has the potential to aid research on dementia and other cognitive-impairment diseases in the brain.") of men's and women's brains.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Since gendered experiences have been found to contribute to epigenetic genome expression, neurologic differences between genders are also [influenced by socialization](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190417102816.htm)(These behaviors and expectations around gender identity can be seen in "epigenetic marks" in the brain, which drive biological functions and features as diverse as memory, development and disease susceptibility. Forger explained that epigenetic marks help determine which genes are expressed and are sometimes passed on from cell to cell as they divide. They also can be passed down from one generation to the next, she said.\n\n"While we are accustomed to thinking about differences between the brains of males and females, we are much less used to thinking about the biological implications of gender identity," she said. "There is now sufficient evidence to suggest that an epigenetic imprint for gender is a logical conclusion. It would be strange if this were not the case, because all environmental influences of any importance can epigenetically change the brain.").
1.2.2.3. Pro: Under [stress](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/neuroscience-women-smarter-than-men.html), women are [more cautious](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110603125103.htm) and make [better decisions](https://womenignitingchange.com/blog/busting-misconceptions-around-women-and-decision-making/) than men, which could strengthen the planning and strategy phases of operations. It is inefficient to exclude women.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: In certain conflict situations, women are able to [solve problems](https://www.ipinst.org/2020/10/woman-first-soldier-second-taboos-and-stigmas-facing-military-women-in-un-peace-operations#2)(When Norwegians deployed to Afghanistan, they came back and said, ‘We need them, we cannot solve the problems out there without the women.’) that men are unable to.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Women are less self-assured than men, which leads to a [confidence gap](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/). Confidence is a necessary factor for people to perform their jobs competently.
1.2.2.4. Con: Having many different perspectives could reduce military efficiency. In high-pressure, risky situations, a diversity of opinions could stall action and lead to unfavourable consequences.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: The idiom, "[too many cooks spoil the broth](https://medium.com/business-as-unusual/too-many-cooks-spoil-the-broth-73e8e4c30b15)," captures the sentiment that the involvement of multiple parties can make decision-making inefficient.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: Diverse groups perform poorer than homogeneous groups in the short term, but, in the long run, [those same groups perform better](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter) than their more-homogeneous counterparts.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: The collective [group intelligence](https://hbr.org/2011/06/defend-your-research-what-makes-a-team-smarter-more-women) of an organization is increased when women are present, as they have more [social sensitivity](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2157136.2157258)(Social sensitivity is the personal ability to perceive, understand, and respect the feelings and viewpoints of others, and it is reliably measurable.). This skill is crucial for military professionals.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Decisions need to be made quickly and clearly in a combat zone. Pairing men and women together may make that more [difficult](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/resolution-not-conflict/201202/how-gender-differences-make-decision-making-difficult), leading to outcomes that may harm the whole unit.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Conscripts occupy [low ranks](https://warontherocks.com/2020/07/people-win-wars-the-pla-enlisted-force-and-other-related-matters/) within the military hierarchy. Therefore, they have little influence in decision-making processes, making any differences in communication of minimal concern.
1.2.2.4.4. Con: When diversity hampers decision-making, resolutions can be found by adhering to the chain of command.
1.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: Women in the military must adhere to the same rules of command as men.
1.2.3. Con: Women are unlikely to improve military culture, as they will struggle to introduce high standards of discipline.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Forcing women to join the military will not change the [strict hierarchical system](https://www.womenalliance.org/no-to-female-conscription/)(It is an illusion to believe that the inclusion of women in the military machinery at a low level, will lead to a significant change of structures and attitudes. Although women can increase the diversity, they are not supposed to change the strictly hierarchical organization of the military, which is characterized by absolute obedience on the grounds, that the soldiers should learn to defend themselves, use violence and, if necessary, kill.) of the military. Newcomers will likely struggle to fit in while not changing much of the culture itself.
1.2.3.2. Con: Women are in no way inherently less disciplined than men.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Men [don't usually pick](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246110/)(That men almost exclusively have male role models should not be entirely surprising. Earlier research on gender and role models reported this, but it was rather hidden in those papers. Previous studies6,7,19 used samples of pre-chosen role models identified by students or faculty representatives. That these samples of role models were almost all male \(\>80%\) should perhaps have been reported as an anomaly or provoked interest in why the samples were so skewed.\n\nSeveral previous studies have shown the importance of role models in developing professionalism.1–3 If role modelling is gendered, as the results of the present study suggest, severe implications exist on what kind of professionalism this process develops. If men do not consider women as role models, for example, they exclude half of the models of good medical of practice available to them.) women as role models. Men in the armed forces will not be significantly positively influenced by women's behavior, even if women are more disciplined than men.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Men cannot have women as role models if no such models exist. Conscription will increase the representation of women, particularly in positions of authority, thereby positioning women as [positive role models](https://www.jackcentral.org/opinion/young-men-need-female-role-models/article_2ecaf764-0bd9-5e30-a50a-38f92e9f0e03.html) for men.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Men do not regard women as role models because of [internalized sexism](https://www.indy100.com/viral/women-role-models-men-twitter-debate-9677686). These are precisely the cultural norms that can be changed by increasing female representation in the military through conscription.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: In general, women are held to [significantly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2016/06/12/why-men-and-women-are-held-to-dramatically-different-standards-and-women-are-punished/?sh=5939d3d97f23) [higher standards](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/02/480487259/women-held-to-higher-ethical-standard-than-men-study-shows) than men. Therefore, men are unlikely to experience the same pressures that coerce women into demonstrating greater discipline.
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Due to bias, discipline delivered by women are perceived to be [less effective](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.861.4206&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and fair than discipline delivered by men \(p. 1\).
1.2.3.4. Con: Men might be incentivized to be more disciplined if they believe that it will gain the interest of women they desire.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Men demonstrate [more altruism](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/02/120202093836.htm) in the presence of attractive women than in the presence of men. Thus, male military officers can be expected to be better behaved in mixed-gender units.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: Women should not have to be dangled as potential rewards to promote good behavior among men; instead, men should be disciplined because it is a virtue that is essential to [military service](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/NCO-Journal/Archives/2017/November/Standards-and-Discipline/).
1.2.3.4.3. Con: Issues arising from male and female officers viewing each other as potential romantic partners may adversely affect discipline.
1.2.3.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.2.3.4.3.2. Con: [Sexpionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexpionage) is an ever-present threat to military operations and national security. Therefore, being romantically involved with a comrade is preferable to being seduced by outsiders with ulterior motives.
1.2.3.4.3.3. Con: Romantic interest and sexual attraction are a part of human nature. Instead of trying to suppress such tendencies, the military could offer services and guidelines that ensure that romantic relationships between comrades do not interfere with work.
1.2.4. Pro: Having more women serving in the military will improve the overall culture of the military; this in turn could improve how the military is perceived in society
1.2.4.1. Pro: The equal conscription of women by the Israel Defense Forces supports the idea of the army as being [for the people](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/24554)(The view that women are drafted because the IDF is a people’s army and should therefore apply the principle of equality to all segments of society remains unchallenged, as does the approach which holds that security needs require that Israeli society’s man \(and women\)power potential be utilized to the fullest possible extent.).
1.2.4.2. Con: Having women serving in the military is [more likely](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/) to lead to a projection of existing male dominated culture on to women veterans, than it is to convert existing culture.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Women make up just [16% of military forces](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/women-warriors-the-ongoing-story-of-integrating-and-diversifying-the-armed-forces/). As they are a significant minority, their presence is unlikely to lead to a significant change.
1.2.4.3. Con: Combat efficiency should take priority over public image; women may jeopardise the former which makes the latter unimportant.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: In some places, public confidence in the military is essential for [justifying](https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/idss/1539-image-matters-military-effect/)(However, the best systems in the world will always be undermined by the human operators of the system. The best combat aircraft in the world is useless if the pilot flying this aircraft is poorly trained. A soldier who does not carry his own backpack therefore conveys an image that cannot be comforting.) its costs.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Building a more [efficient and ready](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/10/04/why-we-need-a-more-modern-and-ready-military-not-a-larger-one/) military is much more important than increasing its recruitment numbers.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: There is limited evidence to suggest that women [compromise efficiency](http://gppreview.com/2020/02/25/women-combat-bad-military-effectiveness/) in the army.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: Studies focused on the negative impact of women in the military were found to be [heavily biased.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/marines-study-casts-doubts-mixed-gender-units)
1.2.4.4. Pro: The army is likely to be more appealing to people if it is open to them. Equal conscription may encourage people to think of the army as fair domain instead a male-dominated one.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: A [five-year plan](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/army/2020/09/army-releases-five-year-plan-to-better-diversity-equality-and-inclusion/) to demonstrate that the army is a model of inclusion will increase diversity in terms of gender and other attributes. This will attract the most talented people to the organization, regardless of their background.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: [Higher rates](https://www.theredstonerocket.com/military_scene/article_8856afb8-1930-11eb-bb2e-e7815e6b9a55.html) of diversity and inclusion in the army have led to highly productive workforce.
1.2.4.4.1.2. Con: Inclusion can be difficult to achieve when some are only part of the army due to conscription; people cannot be made to [feel included](https://ideal.com/diversity-equity-inclusion/) if they do not want to be.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: The army should not lower its standards and accept anyone who wants to sign up, as many Americans are [ineligible](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-12/joining-the-military-doesn-t-appeal-to-enough-young-americans) for military service due to health issues or past criminal convictions. These exclusion criteria are necessary to ensure safety within the army.
1.2.4.5. Con: Improving the image of the military is not necessarily a good thing. The public perception of the military may be inaccurate, seeing it as more positive than it actually is.
1.2.4.5.1. Con: A positive perception of the military is important in supporting veterans' [civilian careers](https://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/why-public-perception-important-veterans-career-prospects.html) after they have been discharged.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: A country's military has the power to stage a [coup](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55902070), overthrowing the current government without regard for the will of the people.
1.2.4.5.2.1. Con: Sometimes military coups are done with the [support](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20220126-hundreds-gather-in-burkina-faso-s-capital-to-support-military-coup) of the people who are unhappy with the current government regime, but see no way of removing them from power.
1.2.4.5.2.2. Pro: In general, countries with high rates of military coups \(e.g., [African countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46783600)\) tend to be those that do not conscript women. This could suggest that female conscription lowers the likelihood of coups.
1.2.4.5.3. Con: The presence of U.S. military personnel overseas puts them in a position to act as [representatives](https://minerva.defense.gov/Owl-In-the-Olive-Tree/Owl_View/Article/1797784/understanding-how-populations-perceive-us-troop-deployments/) of their country; a positive reputation is important for successful foreign policy.
1.2.4.5.4. Pro: Having compassion for and trusting in the military may be [harmful](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/03/americans-blind-faith-in-the-military-is-dangerous-civilian-oversight-deference-mcraven-trump/)(This consensus is dangerous. It allows presidents who surround themselves with generals to tap into public admiration for the military and bask in the military’s reflected glory and thereby seek to silence civilian critics of their foreign policies. At the same time, it weakens civilian officials’ claim, under the normal model of civil-military relations, that they have the right to be wrong and undermines civilian control over defense policy. Even more worrisome, the top brass may come to believe these militarist myths: Persuaded of their own superiority, and confident of the public’s trust, they may come to prefer their own judgment to that of elected officials. That may seem appealing now, given the current president’s impulsive nature, but it is a treacherously slippery slope.). The military holds huge capacity for harm and should be treated with suspicion by society so that they and the government can be held properly accountable.
1.2.5. Con: Increasing the number of women in the armed forces could create new problems or conflicts.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Emotional connections between male and female soldiers sharing foxholes could increase the stress of their non-military spouses.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Rates of [infidelity](https://www.militaryspouse.com/military-life/is-cheating-more-common-in-a-military-marriage/) are not significantly higher in military marriages in comparison to non-military relationships.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Veterans are [twice as likely](https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ResearchBrief_London2013.pdf) \(p. 1\) to have an extra-marital affair than non-veterans, which increases their risk for divorce. Fear of infidelity among military spouses is, therefore, justified.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Fear of infidelity is a [significant stressor](https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8855&context=dissertations) among spouses of active-duty personnel \(p. 3\).
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: Military deployment can be an extremely stressful and lonely experience; these circumstances render military personnel vulnerable to infidelity, because romantic and sexual encounters can at least temporarily [alleviate distress](https://taskandpurpose.com/popular/why-i-cheated-when-i-deployed/).
1.2.5.1.4. Con: Women-only battalions could limit the harm that might arise from emotional connections between soldiers.
1.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: The risk of pregnancy can mean that romantic and sexual relationships pose more significant threats to women than to men. Women-only battalions mitigate such risks.
1.2.5.1.4.2. Con: Same-sex couples exist; therefore, emotional connections between soldiers cannot be ruled out. As such, the military should develop alternative methods for promoting co-operation and reasonable communication.
1.2.5.1.5. Con: It is plausible to share a foxhole with a friend of another sex and become [platonic friends](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/237720/can-men-women-just-be-friends)(For example, Dana Dorfman, Ph.D., psychotherapist and co-host of the podcast 2 Moms on the Couch, says it’s possible for men and women who are attracted to the opposite sex to be friends — but they’ll at least consider taking the relationship to the next level.\n“I think it’s inevitable it will cross at least one person's mind," Dorfman says. “Part of friendship is there being an emotional attraction to the other person. Whether it necessarily translates to a sexual relationship is another story, but I think it would be very difficult for it not to at least be a consideration.”). Victorian morality does not have the monopoly on emotional connections that it used to.
1.2.5.2. Con: More women in the armed forces would help address [existing gender-related problems and conflicts](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Publications/Article/1411860/women-regardless-understanding-gender-bias-in-us-military-integration/).
1.2.5.3. Con: The gender pay gap has been attributed to the higher representation of men in jobs that involve [danger and require risk-taking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/12/21/heres-your-gender-pay-gap-fatal-occupational-injuries/?sh=55619db06c3e). Increasing the number of women in the army would serve to attenuate this disparity.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: A vast majority of employees in dangerous job sectors are men who are [10 times](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/culture-conscious/202104/why-do-men-have-the-most-dangerous-jobs) more likely to be killed on the job than women.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Increasing the representation of women in dangerous jobs would be ineffective in reducing the pay gap, as these jobs are usually [not well paid](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-conscious/202104/why-do-men-have-the-most-dangerous-jobs) and would create an even wider disparity.
1.2.5.4. Con: People will [adapt to changing circumstances and conditions](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12344547). The potential for new problems is not a valid reason for failing to improve systems.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Female soldiers could be raped in war by both allies and enemies.
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Throughout history, rape continuously has been used as a [weapon of war](https://www.britannica.com/topic/rape-crime/Rape-as-a-weapon-of-war).
1.2.5.5.2. Pro: In a combat zone, trained female soldiers are more likely to be [raped by a fellow soldier](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/217724-invisible-war-fighting-rape-crisis-us-military) than killed by enemy fire.
1.2.5.5.3. Con: [Women civilians are raped in war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/11/21/rape-is-still-being-used-as-a-weapon-of-war-right-now-today/) by both allies and enemies. As gendered sexual violence occurs regardless of profession, it should not affect conscription.
1.2.5.5.4. Con: Military training could empower women by [training them to fight](https://blackbeltmag.com/top-10-self-defense-techniques-for-women) assailants. This may be useful outside of the military, making female soldiers less likely to be assaulted than civilians.
1.2.5.5.4.1. Con: Implying that adequate training can help women fend off rapists perpetuates [victim blaming](https://www.verywellmind.com/sexual-assault-and-victim-blaming-4802707) by implying that assaulted women are weak or did not fight hard enough.
1.2.5.5.4.2. Con: [Gang rape](https://nypost.com/2020/11/18/soldier-killed-herself-after-being-gang-raped-by-colleagues-mom/) is not uncommon in the military; therefore, even if a woman is otherwise able to fight a single assailant, she may not be able to do so when confronted with many predatory men.
1.2.5.5.4.3. Con: Rape in the military is largely a product of [rape culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/magazine/military-sexual-assault.html) and a [lack of accountability](https://abcnews.go.com/US/military-sexual-assault-victims-system-broken/story?id=72499053). Instead of shifting the responsibility of rape reduction onto women, the military should tackle the systemic factors that underlie this "epidemic."
1.2.5.5.4.4. Pro: Self-defense training significantly lowers the rate of [attempted and completed rape](https://qz.com/425030/teaching-women-to-fight-today-could-stop-rapes-tomorrow/) women experience. Incorporating such training programs into combat preparation can further empower women against potential assailants.
1.2.5.5.5. Con: Sexual assault in the military is not a gendered problem; men are [sexually assaulted](https://www.army.mil/article/166188/male_hazing_most_common_type_of_sexual_assault_expert_reveals) in the military by other men.
1.3. Pro: Having more women serving in the military will [promote](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2020/05/08/including-women-in-the-draft-would-help-tackle-gender-inequality-in-the-us/) gender equality, changing the image of women in society for the better.
1.3.1. Con: Expanding military conscription to women will legitimize it, which is counter to the principles and policies of modern society. The harm of this action is more important than any gain in gender equality.
1.3.1.1. Pro: By making conscription egalitarian, it would become perceptually less archaic and more compatible with modern values. This may allow the practice to continue.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Conscription implies that citizens do not support their military. Governments may be better served by reconsidering the need for such an action.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Regardless of appreciation or respect for the military, many people are not suited for service. Time and resources should not be wasted to filter people who are not cut out for such an environment.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It cannot be assumed that conscription increases the burden of identifying those not cut out for military service. Unsuitable individuals may still volunteer to join the military, whereas well-suited individuals may choose to not enlist.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the US, [four out of five applicants](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/2014/05/14/80-of-military-recruitments-turned-down.html) are rejected during military recruitment. Increasing the number of applicants places an unnecessary burden on bureaucractic systems.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Regardless of the morality of conscription, if the military decides to conscript people, both men and women should be conscripted. Conscripting only men is discriminatory.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The question of whether conscription is ethical is relevant, because it determines the direction societies should take when eliminating gender inequality. Demanding equal conscription implies that conscription is inevitable.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Public opinion of a war does not reflect that war's justness, and so conscription can still be necessary, even in wars that are unpopular.
1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The [US has used conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States) for almost every major war in its history, some of which were just and some of which were not. Even when public support for a war is high, voluntary participation can be low, necessitating the need for a draft.
1.3.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Since [1973](https://warontherocks.com/2020/02/fifty-years-after-the-presidents-commission-on-an-all-volunteer-armed-force/), the US has been at war with many countries. As a volunteer military has been sufficient to fight these distant wars, there is no need for conscription.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Conscripting women might bring to light its immorality. It is a lot easier for people to ignore injustices that do not affect them.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Perceptions of increased distance often [reduce](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01824/full)(In brief, the chance that an empathic reaction will be triggered and its magnitude depend on the nature of the social and affective relationships that binds people.) people's empathetic responses. By conscripting more people, social distance would be reduced.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: As conscription of women in Israel is [described](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editors-Note-Hands-off-women-conscripts-501929) as a good thing, it is not clear that making conscription equal would help illustrate its immorality.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Some forms of conscription, like [impressement](https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/british-navy-impressment/), are particularly heinous forms of rights violations. Abolishing the draft entirely reduces the risk of these methods being implemented.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: Conscription is compatible with a democratic society, if most citizens agree that conscription is necessary during a time of threat.
1.3.1.2. Con: Men and women should carry equal responsibility for protecting their country; gender parity is a [key value](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/04/30/worldwide-optimism-about-future-of-gender-equality-even-as-many-see-advantages-for-men/)(Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important.) in the modern world.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: In societies where individuals are equal before the law, conscripting men and not women constitutes gender discrimination.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Some feminists, aiming to promote gender equality, [advocate](https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/feminists-weigh-draft-registration-women) for equal conscription as part of reaching their goals. Implementing this policy therefore would make societies more in line with feminist principles.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.2.1.
1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Many Norwegian feminist organizations are against female conscription as they believe it is only justified through a [misunderstanding](https://www.womenalliance.org/no-to-female-conscription/)(Gender equality implies first and foremost that women and men should have the same human rights and fundamental freedoms. Women should be valued and allocated power and resources on equal terms with men. But women and men do not have to be alike or do the same things to be equal.) of gender equality.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Governments impose the same tax laws on both men and women. Given that conscription is a type of tax \([p. 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46464005_The_Political_Economy_of_Conscription)\), both men and women should be drafted, in countries where conscription is practiced.
1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Though gender discrimination is illegal, [single-sex spaces](https://sex-matters.org/posts/single-sex-services/are-single-sex-services-legal/) that cater to distinct needs are permitted. Given this, male-only conscription can be justified based on gender differences in physiology and social needs.
1.3.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Gender discrimination is different from gender or sex segregation, which is often legal e.g., [single-sex schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sex_education).
1.3.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Gender-segregated spaces often exist to protect women from harms, such as [sexual assault](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/sexual-assault-unisex-changing-rooms-sunday-times-women-risk-a8519086.html)(The vast majority of reported sexual assaults at public swimming pools in the UK take place in unisex changing rooms, new statistics reveal.\n\nThe data, obtained through a Freedom of Information request by the Sunday Times, suggests that unisex changing rooms are more dangerous for women and girls than single-sex facilities.\n\nJust under 90 per cent of complaints regarding changing room sexual assaults, voyeurism and harassment are about incidents in unisex facilities.), which also render them highly vulnerable to death and serious injury.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The military can be conceptualized as a semi-segregated space that allows women to protect themselves from the unique threats and risks that they face, when compared to men.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2.1.2. Con: There are racial disparities in the [risk of serious injury](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/13/politics/military-diversity-data/index.html)(\[B\]lack service members are less likely to become officers and, as a result, are more likely to be seriously injured serving their country than their white colleagues.), yet military conscription does not vary by race to protect these groups.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2.1.3. Con: Women want to serve in [combat roles](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-ready-for-combat-are-you/articleshow/74131298.cms), yet they are denied this opportunity. Thus, the segregation is forced rather than voluntary.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Gender segregation exacerbates gender inequality because it reinforces the notion that "[boys will be boys](https://www.dictionary.com/e/unteaching-boys-will-be-boys/)(The phrase boys will be boys was first recorded in English in 1589. It originated from a Latin proverb: “Children \(boys\) are children \(boys\) and do childish things.” While a bit obvious, if it had remained intact as such, it wouldn’t be so problematic. Children in fact do childish things, and that’s to be expected to some degree.\n\nLike a bad game of telephone, however, the phrase has morphed over the years into a flippant way to excuse the actions and attitudes of boys and men of all ages. It’s typically used to explain rowdy or naughty behavior—things like jumping in mud puddles, roughhousing, and raising Cain. It’s also, unfortunately, used to explain away things like sexual assault allegations and other serious crimes. It doesn’t hold individuals responsible for their behavior and choices but rather infers all males are preprogrammed to act in such ways.)" and that the only way women can protect themselves is by isolating themselves from the company of men.
1.3.1.2.1.3.2.3. Con: Gender-segregated spaces can deny women access to the many privileges and opportunities that have traditionally been reserved for the proverbial "[boy's club](https://equitablegrowth.org/gender-segregation-at-work-separate-but-equal-or-inequitable-and-inefficient/)".
1.3.1.2.1.3.3. Con: Comparing gender-segregated spaces to a policy which requires one gender to report to a service with a high probability of death and injury is a false equivalency.
1.3.1.2.1.4. Pro: Equality is achieved only when requirements are applicable to all. Within the military, even if roles cannot be uniformly assigned across genders, requirements to participate should still be equal.
1.3.1.2.1.5. Con: A society where every individual is absolutely equal before the law cannot exist, since laws and the mechanisms of their adjudication employ cultural standards that support discrimination.
1.3.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Legislative systems justify favoring women in [custody decisions](https://www.militarytimes.com/pay-benefits/mil-money/2021/05/11/military-parents-would-get-12-weeks-of-leave-to-care-for-new-children-under-congressional-proposal/) by claiming it is better for the children involved. Discrimination is therefore facilitated by social norms.
1.3.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Discriminatory legal standards exist due to cultural norms; as regressive norms change, laws become fairer. Therefore, justifying gendered conscription based on norms is illegitimate.
1.3.1.2.1.5.3. Con: Just because laws currently adhere to cultural standards does not mean that they should; rather, they should be improved by being based on values such as [equality and justice](https://www.e-ir.info/2013/12/01/can-and-should-human-rights-be-universal/)(Scholars argue the appeal to cultural relativist arguments such as Asian values is an “ideological attempt to justify authoritarian government” \(Freeman, 2008, 363\). Sen argues that Asian \(authoritarian\) values appear to stem “almost exclusively” \(1999, 246\) from those in power, stating, “to see Asian history in terms of a narrow category of authoritarian values does little justice to the rich varieties of thought in Asian intellectual traditions” \(Sen, 1999, 248\). Cultural relativist arguments consistently under-represent women, supposed spokespersons of ‘culture’ ensure that women are persistently under-represented \(Phillips, 2001, 13\), falsely presenting a culture of “male dominance” \(2001, 14\). This shows us that cultural relativist arguments are often a shallow tool used to impede the application of human rights.).
1.3.1.2.1.6. Pro: Men-only conscription policy perpetuates [misandry](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-06-09/supreme-court-draft-women-exempt).
1.3.1.2.1.6.1. Con: Conscription was largely [instituted by men](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/when-men-experience-sexism/276355/), based on the means and ends they typically endorse. Therefore, [women](https://www.generalassembly.ca/archive/we-can-do-it-but-we-dont-want-to), who tend to prefer alternative conflict-resolution methods, should not be forced to participate in conscription.
1.3.1.2.1.6.2. Pro: When conscription is applied unevenly, conscripted men may feel resentment towards exempt women. This may fuel [prejudices](https://theconversation.com/women-have-served-in-armed-forces-for-decades-but-the-military-is-still-a-mans-world-165136)(Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected. By extension, the acceptance of women into the military implies the undermining of the institution, explaining why Canada’s women soldiers continue to be resented, marginalised and subjected to harassment and abuse by their male counterparts more than 20 years after they were first permitted to serve in combat roles.) to legitimise further gender-based segregation.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Equal conscription may impart a sense of mass mobilization, making a country feel that it is in a constant state of war, like [Israel](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-why-israelis-live-in-fear-and-who-capitalizes-on-it-1.5462456).
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: As long as women serve as the [primary caregivers](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/faq/statistics), their absence from the home will be more strongly felt than that of their male counterparts.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: In countries like the UK and US, [peacetime conscription](https://www.britannica.com/topic/conscription) is no longer practiced. Therefore, if conscription were to be reinstated, a feeling as if the country was in a state of war would be apt.
1.3.1.2.2.3. Con: [Norway](https://www.defmin.fi/files/3825/BOTILLE_2017-06-12_Universal_Conscription_in_Norway.pdf) practices universal conscription \(p. 5\), but it is not a country at war.
1.3.1.2.2.4. Con: Initiating conscription already creates a sense of mass mobilization. Including women in the draft would not change that.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Drafting men but not women sends the message that men are more disposable.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: Military interventionism is [more strongly favored](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/01/19/men-and-womens-support-for-war-accounting-for-the-gender-gap-in-public-opinion/) by men than by women. Thus, it is not fair to demand that both men and women equally participate in this particular method of protecting the country.
1.3.1.2.3.2. Pro: As women are [increasingly](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2021/3/press-release-women-in-politics-new-data-shows-growth-but-also-setbacks) involved in political matters that influence the military, they shouldn't be exempted from conscription. People should not have the power to risk the lives of others whilst they themselves are safe.
1.3.1.2.3.2.1. Con: In states with military rivalries, women are [less likely](https://inkstickmedia.com/how-military-rivalries-impact-female-political-representation/)(Female representation in national parliaments is reduced by half \(from 20% to 10%\) in states involved in an interstate rivalry compared to states not involved in a rivalry. Additionally, the more rivalries a state is involved in, the more female representation suffers — decreasing to 4% during two rivalries.) to be involved in political leadership. As such, in situations where combat may be necessary, women are less likely to be making decisions.
1.3.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: If women are not willing to risk their lives for their country, then they shouldn't have a say in how it's run.
1.3.1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: The majority of people have not risked their life for their country. This is not a prerequisite to obtaining rights.
1.3.1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: Adhering to the principle that legitimacy of governance comes from a willingness to risk your life, [Queen Elizabeth II](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/queen-elizabeth-ii-during-world-war-ii) served in World War II, as her male predecessors had done historically.
1.3.1.2.4. Con: Men and women contribute equally to protecting their country through different social roles.
1.3.1.2.4.1. Con: [Women](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/our-impact/campaigning/care-in-crisis/breaking-point-report/) carry more responsibility for maintaining their country than men. Most [domestic work](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/feb/17/dirty-secret-why-housework-gender-gap) is done by women, as are the majority of [healthcare](https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/women-are-well-represented-in-health-and-long-term-care-professions-but-often-in-jobs-with-poor-working-conditions.htm) jobs.
1.3.1.2.4.2. Pro: Men and women differ in their approaches to resolving conflicts. Through [diplomacy and effective peacemaking](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/women-and-war-securing-more-peaceful-future), women may be able to protect their countries by making wars unnecessary, or shorter.
1.3.1.2.4.3. Pro: Equity is important, not equality. It is infeasible to make all responsibilities equal, as demonstrated by the differing expectations of adults versus children.
1.3.1.2.4.4. Con: Women's contributions \(e.g., domestic work\) are typically [unpaid](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/csw61/redistribute-unpaid-work) and [unrecognized](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-women-stay-out-of-the-spotlight-at-work), whereas service in the military is both compensated and prestigious. \([p. 1](https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-Pres-Occupations-2007-08.pdf)\) Equal conscription counteracts this inequity.
1.3.1.3. Con: Conscription is a legitimate means of improving the defensive capabilities of a nation with security concerns.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Rather than relying on conscription, several nations have realised that [testing and recruitment](https://cms.polsci.ku.dk/english/pdf/conscription_report.pdf) of an exclusively professional military is more suitable for international defense operations \(p. 2\).
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: [Sweden](https://www.government.se/articles/2017/03/re-activation-of-enrolment-and-the-conscription/) reactivated conscription in 2018, as voluntary recruitment did not provide the Swedish Armed Forces with enough personnel for the country to reach its military capability goals.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: When the security of a country is under threat, capable citizens are obligated to serve for the greater good.
1.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: Conscription during the world wars positively shaped the [image of nation](https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/25/military-conscription-and-its-role-in-shaping-a-nation/), breaking down ethnic barriers and uniting all citizens for a common cause and identity.
1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: Conscription was key to countries, [like the UK](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/yourcountry/overview/conscription/), winning the world wars. There was no alternative source of necessary troops.
1.3.1.3.3.3. Con: A government that forces its citizens to leave their families, take up arms, and go to war is [autocratic](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-politicalscience/chapter/forms-of-government/).
1.3.1.3.4. Con: The world is becoming [increasingly less violent](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence/up-next#t-557924). Although wars still occur, the percentage of people confronted with warfare is declining. Investing in a conscripted military force is increasingly unnecessary.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Con: Reports of a decline in wars are based on [fewer battle deaths](https://oneearthfuture.org/opinion-insights/there-really-evidence-decline-war). However, the lower mortality rate may be attributable to improved healthcare or random factors, meaning that the percentage of people confronted by war may remain unchanged.
1.3.1.3.4.2. Con: Regardless of whether the world is becoming less violent, conscription should apply to either both sexes or none, persuant of the broader principle of equality.
1.3.2. Con: The harms of conscripting women may not be outweighed by any positive changes in how they are perceived, especially since they can already join the military voluntarily.
1.3.2.1. Pro: As more opportunities are afforded to women, they are able to join the military [in larger numbers](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-military-sees-threefold-increase-in-women-personnel-in-6-years-101612843615626.html). In this manner, the harms of conscription can be eliminated while maximizing the benefits of having more women in the military.
1.3.2.2. Con: The double standard of making military service mandatory for all eligible men and optional for women reinforces widespread benevolent sexist notions that women should be afforded considerations and exemptions that do not apply to men.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Forcing women into the military could actually increase gender-based discrimination as they would enter an environment with [extensively documented](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44944.pdf) instances of harassment, assault, and discrimination \(pp. 5, 21\).
1.3.3. Pro: Serving in the military will facilitate the growth and improvement of women who are serving, as well as women at large.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Military personnel are likely to [come from military families](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/women-warriors-the-ongoing-story-of-integrating-and-diversifying-the-armed-forces/)(Some 60 percent of Army recruits now come from military families, for example. And as of 2018, the Army recruited 50 percent of its enlisted soldiers from just 10 percent of the nation’s high schools, suggesting too much dependence on certain geographic areas. This suggests that military service has become a largely family affair, with most volunteers emulating their parents’ \(usually their fathers’\) career paths.), suggesting that role modeling is a significant contributor to enrollment. Equal conscription would make it more likely that young girls have [role models](https://www.ausa.org/news/army-female-role-models-aid-recruiting) who inspire them to pursue military careers.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Given that the vast majority of military personnel are men, role-modeling effects have presumably been observed between male family members. These findings cannot be [generalized](https://www.americaspromise.org/us-military-demographics) to women.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Military careers may not be especially desirable; there is a [high level of job dissatisfaction](https://time.com/3826163/us-military-morale/)(Job satisfaction remains low, USA Today reports, with 48% of service personnel not feeling committed or satisfied with work. And 52% of troops marked yes to statements like “I rarely count on good things happening to me.”) among servicepeople.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Becoming an officer or a non-commissioned officer requires passing [basic training](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/basic-training-the-places-youll-go.html), which is usually part of conscription. This can open career paths to women in military logistics, medicine, and support roles that are otherwise unavailable to civilians.
1.3.3.2. Con: Militaries utilize strict [physical and mental fitness tests](https://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/army-basic-training-pft) when recruiting candidates. Thus, militaries are likely to induct individuals who are already fit rather than trying to reform the unfit.
1.3.3.3. Con: Serving in the military is known to take a significant toll on one's physical and mental health, irrespective of gender. Thus, serving in the military does not unequivocally improve self-perceptions and increase population strength \([p. A19](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/Suppl_1/A19.1.full.pdf)(First, better physical health was reported by veterans and attributed to the high volume of exercise undertaken in the AF. However, veterans also reported more physical health problems \(e.g. hearing loss, injuries\) due to a lack of protective equipment in the AF compared to non-veterans. Second, despite health problems, veterans were more reluctant to seek medical treatment than non-veterans, owing to a sense of self-sufficiency instilled during AF service. Finally, veterans developed a greater resilience and self-confidence during service that was carried across the life-course. However, high-levels of workplace trauma exposure appeared to result in psychological problems later in life for some veterans.)\).
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Veterans experience a particularly [high rate of mental health concerns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572092/)(The most publicized mental health challenges facing veterans service members are PTSD and depression. Some research has suggested that approximately 14% to 16% of U.S. service members deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq have PTSD or depression. Although these mental health concerns are highlighted, other issues like suicide, traumatic brain injury \(TBI\), substance abuse, and interpersonal violence can be equally harmful in this population.), including PTSD, depression, substance abuse, and suicide.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Veterans, and in particular female veterans, are substantially [more likely to experience homelessness](https://www.greendoors.org/facts/veteran-homelessness.php)(While only 8% of Americans can claim veteran status, 17% of our homeless population is made up of veterans. In 2010, the Department of Veteran Affairs \(VA\) estimated that on any given night there were 76,000 homeless veterans sleeping on American streets.\n...\nThe number of homeless female veterans is on the rise: in 2006, there were 150 homeless female veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; in 2011, there were 1,700. That same year, 18% of homeless veterans assisted by the VA were women. Comparison studies conducted by HUD show that female veterans are two to three times more likely to be homeless than any other group in the US adult population.) than other Americans.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Conscription can lead to [positive social effects](https://www.ft.com/content/66f6fd18-94b9-11e7-83ab-f4624cccbabe), as those who go through military service develop useful skills and form social networks that lead to success later in life.
1.3.3.5. Con: Forcing people to serve in the military delays their personal development and makes it harder to for them to achieve their life goals. Many conscripts suffer [physical](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15105) and [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedovshchina) damage from their service years, which worsens this problem.
1.3.3.5.1. Pro: Those who have undergone compulsory military service are less tolerant of others and often use violence to solve problems \([p. 1](https://sistemas.colmex.mx/Reportes/LACEALAMES/LACEA-LAMES2019_paper_563.pdf)\).
1.3.3.5.2. Pro: In some nations, being conscripted can [reduce](https://izajole.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40172-015-0026-4) an individual's probability of obtaining a university degree, which may lead them to earn lower wages.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Women trained in the basics of modern military conflict—use of modern weaponry, survival, and teamwork—will be more prepared to cope with crises, improving their chances of survival.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: Reservists often have higher skill levels than the general population; as such, military training could increase women's likelihood of survival in dangerous situations \([p. 37](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/event/symposium/pdf/2011/e_03.pdf)(Self-contained, utilising teams from across the military which are combined on an ad hoc basis and have a high level of interoperability, based on combined forces operations, with little need for further augmentation which would delay response. This includes making greater use of reservists; reserve personnel tend to have unique specialist skills from civilian careers which are of great value in responding to crises.)\).
1.3.3.6.2. Con: Military training can be provided to civilians, similar to [fitness bootcamps](https://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.com/what-are-boot-camps/history-of-boot-camps/) run by ex-military personnel. In this manner, the benefits of military combat can be spread without exposing people to the risks associated with armed combat.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Including women in the military promotes the idea that women can participate equally in physical activities. This could encourage women to be more physically active, improving in their health.
1.3.3.7.1. Pro: There is a gender gap in [physical activity](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/girls-less-physically-active-than-boys-due-to-societal-factors-study-68560) participation. Thus, it is necessary to provide girls and women with positive role models who encourage them to be [more physically active](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667\(19\)30135-5/fulltext).
1.3.3.7.2. Con: Physical activity is gendered in that men often engage in physical activity as part of leisure, whereas women do so as part of [domestic work](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/girls-less-physically-active-than-boys-due-to-societal-factors-study-68560). Military representation would do little to overcome restrictions to physical activity that come from [societal and familial](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667\(19\)30135-5/fulltext) factors.
1.3.3.7.3. Pro: Voluntary enlistment promotes self-selection, in that only women who believe they are physically capable would enroll in the military. In contrast, conscription implies that all women meeting basic criteria are fundamentally suitable for combat.
1.3.3.7.4. Con: There are [many ways](https://www.womenshealth.gov/getting-active/physical-activity-all-women) women can be encouraged to participate in physical activity without having to join the military.
1.3.3.7.5. Pro: Conscription would improve women's ability to cope with and overcome extreme conditions whilst also helping in war.
1.3.4. Pro: Equal conscription shows that women and men are equally capable in fighting for their country.
1.3.4.1. Con: Ability and interest are two different constructs. Just because women are capable of doing something does not mean that they would want to engage in said activity.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Women who join the military are [30% more likely](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/05/19/women-nearly-30-more-likely-leave-military-men-new-report-finds.html) to leave service than men.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Interest does not develop in a vacuum; instead, it is the product of [gender socialization](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-development/gender-and-careers/). Equal conscription could weaken such processes and nurture girls' interest in combat from a young age.
1.3.4.2. Con: Women can fight for their countries and rights in other ways, such as through [activism](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/29/remembering-women-killed-fighting-for-human-rights-in-2017) and advocacy.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Activism may have more of an impact on securing rights and freedoms for individuals than conscription, as the military can be a violent perpetrator that [suppresses](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59462503) such advocates.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Sometimes it is necessary for the military to curb [civil unrest](https://www.military.com/military-life/6-times-military-was-used-suppress-civilian-uprisings-us.html) for the sake of keeping peace in society.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: Activism is often more democratic because it reflects the [shared beliefs](https://www.academia.edu/44910252/Public_opinion_media_and_activism_the_differentiating_role_of_media_use_and_perceptions_of_public_opinion_on_political_behaviour) of ordinary citizens \(p. 23\), whereas military actions reflect orders from national leaders, which may differ from [public opinion](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/19/iraq-war-continues-to-divide-u-s-public-15-years-after-it-began/).
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Participation in activism and advocacy does not preclude equal conscription. In the same way that men can be activists, advocates, and military officials, women should also be able to serve their country in different capacities.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: Women should not have to fight "in other ways", as they are absolutely capable of fighting alongside and against men in battle.
1.3.4.3. Pro: During the Second Indochina War, Vietnamese women were expected to [mobilize and fight](https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-37986986) to defend their country. This contributed to a successful outcome for the Vietnamese.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Many other factors played into the outcome of the Second Indochina War; female conscription is arguably not even a significant one.
1.3.4.4. Pro: "Ladies first" is commonly cited to advocate for the preferential treatment of women; however, during challenging times like war, it is men who are expected to be first to answer to the call of duty. Conscripting women would put an end to such double standards.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: "[Ladies first](https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/why-i-hate-the-phrase-ladies-first/)(Even though his gesture had courteous intent, this “ladies first” ideology upholds patriarchal dominion. On a basic level, it reinforces the gendered stereotype that women can’t and shouldn’t do hard physical tasks and implies that men must accommodate women’s inherent weakness. We can never be equal if women are assumed to be dependent on men to get to where we want to go.\n\nBeyond simple day to day life, such forced male dependency is also de jure. Dr. Lucy Delap of Cambridge University argues that the British elite vehemently propagated the Titanic legend to prevent women from obtaining suffrage. In other words, women had no need for the right to vote because men, even in the face of death, would put the interests of women before their own.)" is a sexist phrase, rooted in the notion that men should and do make accommodations for women, particularly within domains requiring physical effort.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: Ladies are almost [never](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/232808-ladies-first-you-say-heres-what-that-looks-like) treated with preference, either under normal or adverse circumstances. Given this, equal conscription would do little to alter social norms.
1.3.4.4.2.1. Con: There is evidence that women receive preferential treatment with regard to both [criminal sentencing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0887403400011002004)(Dramatic increases in the number of women incarcerated in state and federal prisons have led some researchers to conclude that differential sentencing of female offenders is a thing of the past. This study uses data on offenders convicted of felonies in Chicago, Miami, and Kansas City to address this issue. The authors find no evidence to support this “gender neutrality” hypothesis. In all three jurisdictions, women face significantly lower odds of incarceration than do men.) and child custody \([p. 956](https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1419&context=lr)(The evidence is overwhelming and demands that we re-examine the\nwisdom of conventional custody. Unless you believe that a father’s value to his children diminishes after divorce, it is hard to justify a custody policy that routinely and automatically disrupts the divorced father’s relationship with his children. The notion that only mothers are important to their children is false; it is time to jettison it from custody policy.)\).
1.3.4.4.3. Pro: Gender norms often encourage men to play the role of a [knight in shining armor](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/knight-in-shining-armor-syndrome/) and women to play the role of a [damsel in distress](https://www.gameindustry.com/news-industry-happenings/the-role-of-women-in-gaming-culture/)(When present, women were often in a submissive or passive position, portrayed as “Damsels in Distress,” needing to be rescued by men, or love interests of male characters with no motivations of their own. Female avatars in games are represented as objects and often explicitly sexualized \(e.g., League of Legends female champions\), thus leading to increased insecurities of girls that identify with them when playing.). Equal conscription teaches women that they are not helpless.
1.3.4.4.4. Pro: The camaraderie and influence of fighting alongside women might change the views of more conservative soldiers when they come home, increasing equality.
1.3.4.4.5. Con: During disasters, the vulnerable are prioritized to ensure that they are not left behind \([p. 1](https://www.unisdr.org/preventionweb/files/11440_DisasterRiskReduction1.pdf)(The growing literature on social vulnerability and disasters clearly \ndemonstrates that natural disasters and other extreme events do not impact populations equally orat random. Lori Peek, Assistant \nProfessor in the Department of Sociology at the Colorado State University, argues that deaths, injuries and property losses from disasters tend to reflect larger patterns of social stratification and \ninequality. Vulnerable groups such as children, the emphasis of this \npaper, because of their positions in society, often have the hardest \ntime preparing for and responding to disasters, and thus suffer disproportionate impacts when an event actually does occur \(Peek, \n2007\).)\). This courtesy is [extended to women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_children_first), as they may face physical limitations that put them in jeopardy.
1.3.4.4.5.1. Con: It is impractical to prioritize women during modern evacuations, as there are [more vulnerable groups](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16576289)(Usually people will help the most vulnerable to leave the scene first. It's not necessarily women, but is likely to be the injured, elderly and young children, he says.), such as the injured and people with special mobility needs, who need help.
1.3.5. Con: Women have a positive image in society, especially with regard to their strength and capabilities. This does not need to be changed.
1.3.5.1. Con: Women are typically perceived as weak, but their strength is demonstrated through childbirth, menstruation, and childcare activities. What needs to change is the imposition of [androcentric](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868318782848?journalCode=psra) definitions of strength onto women.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Women can exude a strong and capable image in society without joining the military.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Countries led by women are more likely to be [equal and caring](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/women-political-leaders-key-to-more-equal-and-caring-societies). This points to the idea that female politicians can lead society in a more positive direction.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Con: There are still many [biases and perceptions](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210108-why-do-we-still-distrust-women-leaders) that women don't fit with the traditional ideas of a leader and are not trusted when in these roles. Having more women in the military can help change societal perceptions of what it means to be a leader in a routine and regular manner.
1.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: Increased female political power is associated with a lower [likelihood of going to war](https://www.wfd.org/commentary/we-need-girls-school-become-women-politics)(Research shows that women policy makers prioritise issues such as healthcare and the environment; increased representation of women in elected office is associated with counteracting corruption; and, states where women hold more political power are less likely to go to war and less likely to commit human rights abuses.). Thus, as more women become [state leaders](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2021/3/press-release-women-in-politics-new-data-shows-growth-but-also-setbacks), female leadership will increasingly render conscription of people of all genders less necessary.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: As they lead within male-dominated environments, female military officers can acquire unique [leadership qualities](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jpoc.20086) which may be more powerful than those acquired in civilian life.
1.3.5.2.3. Pro: Female representation in various [sectors of society](https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/multimedia/2020/2/infographic-visualizing-the-data-womens-representation) other than the military is vital to the betterment of society.
1.3.5.2.4. Con: Excluding women from conscription implies that they lack traits that are essential to military service. Even if women are only assigned to traditionally feminine roles within the military, it would go against the stereotype that equates military service with masculinity.
1.3.5.3. Con: Even in the most [egalitarian countries](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190831-the-paradox-of-working-in-the-worlds-most-equal-countries), women are still less likely to be lauded for their career successes. This is due to social conditioning that values their work less than men's.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: Research has demonstrated the persistence of traditional gender norms that associate women with family identity and men with work identity \([p. 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01781/full)(Both young males and females believed that norms show greater compatibility between\nmale and work identities and between female and family identities: As indicated in the lower half of Table 2, they believed norms to indicate that men currently do and should invest more in their career than in their\nfamily, and that women currently do and should invest more in their family than in their career.\n\[...\]\nMoreover, differences between\nyoung males and females’ norm perceptions indicated that young females estimated men’s current\ncareer investment significantly higher than young males do, and they perceived prescriptive norms to indicate more strongly that men should invest in a career and that women should invest in a family. Thus, young females perceived gender norms to be even more traditional than young males, which could be explained by the fact that women experience more disadvantages from\ntraditional gender divisions than men.)\).
1.3.5.4. Con: [Feminine gendered slurs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-019-01095-z) reinforce the idea that women are weak, cowardly, or inferior. Having more women in the army would position them as strong and courageous, subverting those expectations.
1.3.5.5. Pro: One of the primary purposes of the military is to engage in [warfare](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/military/force/weinberger.html)(Our policy has always been to work hard for peace, but to be prepared if war comes. \[...\] For we have entered an era where the dividing lines between peace and war are less clearly drawn, the identity of the foe is much less clear. In World Wars I and II, we not only knew who our enemies were, but we shared a clear sense of why the principles espoused by our enemies were unworthy.), which is a means of destruction. In contrast, women are linked to the creation of life.
1.3.5.5.1. Con: The military engages in warfare to protect the lives of civilians. Thus, military participation is associated with the maintenance of life and may be compatible with the link between womanhood and the creation of life.
1.3.5.5.2. Pro: Women have often been key to bridge-building efforts in conflict zones, directly undermining war through their actions and roles as [caring figures](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/women-together-in-darkest-days-of-troubles/)(We developed what we called Talking and Listening Circles, creating spaces where women could start to talk to one another about their lives, their difficulties bringing up children in a divided and sometimes dangerous society, their hopes, fears and dreams. We always encouraged open and honest dialogue. These were real women, real life situations, real pain, real fear, real challenges. We brought together women from across the divides in Northern Ireland, from the South and eventually from the Church of Scotland Guild as well: women engaged with sharing, shifting and shaping a society free from violent conflict, where every single person could feel at home and welcome.) \([p. 53](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07907184.2021.1877898)(‘Bridge-builder feminism,’as will be demonstrated, became a distinguishable feature of Northern Irish feminism and was used as a mechanism to transgress what Todd calls the ‘grammars of nationality’\(2015\), to side-step the political discourse typically framed as emanating from either nationalism or unionism. With its emphasis on cross-community accord, I suggest bridge-builder feminism tended to prioritise peace-building over what might otherwise be viewed as overtly feminist issues like abortion and gendered state violence as contentious gender issues were often circumvented in the pursuit of building bridges across the ethno-national divide.)\).
1.3.5.5.3. Con: Women are not exclusively associated with creation; [destructive](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/lilith)(Two primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately, in there is hardly a tale where Lilith encompasses both roles. But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft.) and wrathful female [archetypes](https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/389/389.html)(Kali is probably the most familiar example of the dual nature of the mother archetype. Hindus worship her as the universal mother of all beings; while simultaneously giving birth to all humanity, she devours her own children and wears a bloody belt of severed heads around her waist and a necklace of severed arms. \n\[...\]\nDemeter and Gaia are also other familiar manifestations of the mother archetype, each formidable and potentially wrathful, with her own relationship to the underworld. Demeter, mother of Persephone, is at once the Great Mother of all, and at the same time, inflicts devastation and drought in retaliation for the capture of her daughter and her imprisonment in the underworld. \[...\] Demeter, while her daughter’s protector, is also a savage force of destruction, much like Kali. \n\[...\] \nGaia, an earth goddess, has underworld attributes as she originates from it, and like Demeter and Kali, is full of savage destruction as well as creativity.) are common around the world.
1.3.5.5.3.1. Pro: There are numerous examples of [notable women warriors](https://www.thecollector.com/women-warriors-ancient-world/)(While war history focuses on men, many courageous women warriors have had significant political and historical impact despite the laws and obstacles that tried to silence them.\n\nThe archetype of the beautiful warrior is firmly rooted in world culture. We see them in movies, we see them in books but we know very little of the great women warriors that lived thousands of years before our time. \n\nHistory remembers not one or two great men who won memorable victories on the battlefield. However, there are also women who have become legendary because of their incredible courage and determination in battle. \n\nFrom Europe through Africa to Asia, there have been women who left their mark in history despite the laws and common ancient beliefs that women should not interfere with power and politics. Here are 8 of the greatest women warriors of the Ancient world.) throughout history.
1.3.5.5.4. Con: The military's purpose is [national defense](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/us-army-overview.html), not destruction as an end in itself.
1.4. Con: When it comes to reproduction, women are less replaceable than men so should not be conscripted en masse. Doing so could lead to the death of many woman and limit reproduction.
1.4.1. Pro: If equal conscription were to be enacted, women could get themselves [pregnant](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/military-pregnancy-deployment/)(‘Hey, some chick in the squadron got herself knocked up. Can you find out who?’” Haynie recalled one of her fellow pilots asking. “They were making bets about who it was and guessing that whoever it was had gotten pregnant to get out of deployment.) to avoid deployment. As men don't have this option, there will always be inequality in military conscription between the sexes.
1.4.1.1. Con: There is no empirical evidence to suggest that women will get themselves pregnant to avoid deployment.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: To say that women will use pregnancy to avoid deployment is analogous to saying that women will use pregnancy to avail maternity leave and benefits. There is no evidence to suggest this is true.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The cost of pregnancy for the sake of avoiding deployment is too huge. [Bearing and raising a child](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/invisible-labor-taking-toll-mothers-60519555)(“We encourage people to really think about how invisible labor and the mental gymnastics that go with it can be taxing on mental and emotional resources. Recognizing the reality that mothers are disproportionately carrying this burden might help us understand why many moms are feeling burned out. Recognizing this allows steps to be taken within a marriage or within a household to address inequalities. When a family is aware of the true distribution of labor in the household, they can make more informed decisions about how to ease that burden across parents and other family members.”) is an intense experience, as is deciding to terminate a pregnancy \([pp. 803-804](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07399332.2018.1465945?needAccess=true)(The women presented a tension between independence and dependency. In order to arrive at an independent decision, they strove to create space for quiet contemplation. In order to keep a possible termination of the pregnancy secret, the women limited the involvement of significant others. Those involved were to varying degrees involved in or distanced from the complex considerations. In total, this resulted in an existential loneliness for women.\n\nWhen struggling to arrive at a decision, the women’s conflicting values and the society’s norms, which meant a threat of being judged, were prominent. Regardless of the final choice, the study participants experienced a feeling of relief and a wish to leave the previous struggle behind.)\).
1.4.1.1.3. Con: Motives are difficult to empirically study, as women could always conceal the real reason for why they became pregnant.
1.4.1.1.4. Con: Former military pilot [Senator Martha McSally](https://coppercourier.com/story/watch-mcsally-says-women-in-the-military-get-pregnant-to-skirt-deployment/) believes that women use pregnancy as an excuse to avoid deployment.
1.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Unplanned pregnancy rates are higher among [military women](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2016/08/02/double-standard-military-pregnancy-what-contraceptive-access-wont-fix/) than among their civilian counterparts. This may indicate that military women are attempting to avoid deployment with pregnancy.
1.4.1.1.4.2. Con: Unplanned pregnancies among military women are largely the result of [poor access to contraception](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2016/08/02/double-standard-military-pregnancy-what-contraceptive-access-wont-fix/).
1.4.1.1.4.3. Con: Even if Senator Martha McSally's claims that women became pregnant to avoid deployment were true, the percentage of women for whom this is true is [small](https://coppercourier.com/story/watch-mcsally-says-women-in-the-military-get-pregnant-to-skirt-deployment/).
1.4.1.2. Pro: The US Navy has a [pregnancy problem](https://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/exclusive-deployed-us-navy-has-a-pregnancy-problem-and-its-getting-worse/)(A record 16 out of 100 Navy women are reassigned from ships to shore duty due to pregnancy, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.\n\nThat number is up 2 percent from 2015, representing hundreds more who have to cut their deployments short, taxing both their unit’s manpower, military budgets and combat readiness. Further, such increases cast a shadow over the lofty gender integration goals set by former President Barack Obama.\n\nOverall, women unexpectedly leave their stations on Navy ships as much as 50% more frequently to return to land duty, according to documents obtained from the Navy. The statistics were compiled by the Navy Personnel Command at the request of TheDCNF, covering the period from January 2015 to September 2016.); this could be exacerbated by equal conscription.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Better training could ameliorate the unconscious bias that currently makes motherhood in the military an issue, giving mothers [additional choices](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/08/02/military-leaders-are-confronting-new-form-of-discrimination-pregnancy-bias.html)("Just because \[women\] might be taking some convalescent leave because they're pregnant, doesn't mean you should not hire them for a particular position," she said. "\[Commanders\] may think they're protecting the individual to give \[her\] more time with family, but what they really need to do is to ask them what they want out of their career.) to advance their career.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.4.2.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: Pregnancy rates are [declining](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53409521) globally. By improving access to contraception, unplanned pregnancies can be [reduced](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32044313/)(Basic training contraceptive policy influences contraception use among junior enlisted servicewomen. Implementing best practices across the military may increase contraception use and decrease childbirth rates among junior enlisted servicewomen.) in the military, in tandem with the global trend.
1.4.1.3. Con: Conscription could be delayed should someone become pregnant.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Conscription is often only necessary during times of [emergency](https://www.usa.gov/selective-service)(A draft is the mandatory enrollment of individuals into the armed forces. The United States military has been all-volunteer since 1973. But an act of Congress could still reinstate the draft in case of a national emergency. The Selective Service System is the agency that registers men and is responsible for running a draft.). Therefore, in such cases, delayed conscription would not be suitable to meet the goal at hand.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Childbearing women could be excluded from conscription until their youngest child turns 3 years old, for example, in addition to general age restriction.
1.4.1.4. Con: Claiming that women will avoid conscription through pregnancy is arguing extremes. It is necessary to implement legislation if the net effect is positive, regardless of the extremes to which people may take in order to find loopholes.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Both women and men face [barriers to deployment](https://www.ipinst.org/2020/10/woman-first-soldier-second-taboos-and-stigmas-facing-military-women-in-un-peace-operations#7)(Major Hudson said that women were wrongfully suspected of resisting deployment. “If someone says they don’t want to deploy, it won’t be because they don’t want to deploy, it would be because there is a barrier. Find out what that barrier is and what your organization is doing about it. In most cases, it’s actually about parenting issues that men and women both need support with.) that make them reluctant to go; this could be remedied through better support from the military.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: What appears extreme during peacetime may appear reasonable during [desperate times](https://www.theguardian.com/century/1960-1969/Story/0,,106464,00.html) like war; this is demonstrated by the [methods](https://www.businessinsider.com/11-ways-people-dodge-the-draft-during-the-vietnam-war-2020-1?IR=T) and [rates of draft evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion_in_the_Vietnam_War) documented throughout history.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Irrespective of gender, those determined to be discharged will find a way to do so. This can be done by using [draft avoidance](https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion) techniques, including [self-inflicted injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-inflicted_wound)(Potential draftees may self-injure to have a health deferment to conscription.).
1.4.2. Pro: Societies can more easily recover from the loss of males than females because of sex differences in reproductive capacity.
1.4.2.1. Con: Men are more important to the US economy, [working more hours and earning more](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-databook/2020/home.htm). If conscription was required, economic damage could be reduced by conscripting women instead.
1.4.2.2. Pro: A man can impregnate many women within a 9-month period, but a woman can only gestate once during that same time span, producing few children. Therefore, women's role in reproduction necessitates greater time investment.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Just because a man can impregnate many women does not mean he will. Instead, it is more likely that a planned pregnancy is the result of a monogamous couple wanting to have a child.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: A man's ejaculate contains about [200 to 400 million sperms](https://files.oakland.edu/users/lindeman/web/spermfacts.htm), but a woman ovulates only once a month.
1.4.2.3. Pro: In WW1, a large number of young men died. If gender-equal conscription were to be instituted, entire cultures could be [endangered](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-04/lost-wwi-generation-of-town-maroon-qld/10419238).
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Women in the military are [more at risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21390560/) for death and serious injury.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: An entire generation of British women went [largely unmarried](https://www.amazon.com/Singled-Out-Million-British-Survived/dp/0195378229)(Almost three-quarters of a million British soldiers lost their lives during the First World War, and many more were incapacitated by their wounds, leaving behind a generation of women who, raised to see marriage as "the crown and joy of woman's life," suddenly discovered that they were left without an escort to life's great feast.) after WWI.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Con: This allowed women in the UK to more easily move into roles previously reserved for men.
1.4.2.3.3. Con: Historic conscription jeopardised generations by targeting only a single sex; equal conscription would be more impervious to this issue as the same number of recruits could be more equitably distributed across a population.
1.4.2.3.4. Con: The world wars were eventually followed by periods of [economic prosperity](https://www.history.com/news/post-world-war-ii-boom-economy) and [population increases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-20th_century_baby_boom). This shows that societies can recover, regardless of the human toll of war.
1.4.2.3.5. Con: The logistics of war won't allow a country to send a dangerously large majority of its population to the front lines, as the homefront needs to continue running when it's at war.
1.4.2.4. Con: Technology can now [grow fetuses outside of a womb](https://www.businessinsider.com/baby-lamb-fetus-inside-artificial-womb-2017-4?r=US&IR=T). If there weren't enough people to maintain the population, stored eggs and sperm could be retrieved and artificially fertilized.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Large-scale ectogenesis is not currently feasible; therefore, it is not an effective strategy to repopulate a society that has witnessed a massive loss of life.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: Ectogenesis is soon expected to become [as common](https://theconversation.com/we-may-one-day-grow-babies-outside-the-womb-but-there-are-many-things-to-consider-first-125709) as in vitro fertilization. This technology could be highly beneficial if a significant proportion of the population is lost to war.
1.4.2.5. Con: A wide variety of men is necessary to ensure there is a [diverse](https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/why-genetic-diversity-important) genetic pool to carry on the species.
1.4.2.6. Con: The human population is [quite large](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/); even after a war, there would be [enough](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/how-many-humans-would-it-take-keep-our-species-alive-ncna900151) people to reproduce.
1.4.2.6.1. Con: Many nations, due to increased access to contraceptives, face [shortages](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/adopt-baby-cost-process-hard/620258/) of children to adopt, and [declining birth rates](https://ifstudies.org/blog/a-new-normal-an-updated-look-at-fertility-trends-across-the-globe). This may limit the pool of people who can repopulate after a war.
1.4.2.6.2. Pro: The world is [overpopulated](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/david-attenborough-warns-planet-cant-cope-with-overpopulation/); reproduction poses a [threat](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/biggest-threat-earth-many-kids/) to the survival of the planet and all living things. Given this, maintaining the existing population should not be a major consideration in war-gaming.
1.4.3. Pro: The typical [age range for conscription](https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2020/07/08/raising-the-age-of-military-enlistment/) conflicts with women's [childbearing years](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/childbearing-age). Conscription could pose threats to raising the next generation.
1.4.3.1. Pro: If men and women are both drafted, there will be no one to take care of the children.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Rules can be created to prevent both parents from being conscripted at the same time.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: In Israel, any couple that are raising a child together can ask for a [postponement of service](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-idf-recognizes-gay-parents-rights-1.5363722) if both partners are called up for duty at the same time.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Given that heterosexual marriage was the norm in earlier times, male-only conscription can be conceptualized as a means of ensuring that both parents are not conscripted.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Opposing female conscription because children may not have a caretaker implicitly [imposes](https://www.moms.com/men-are-praised-for-taking-care-of-their-kids-women-are-just-expected-to-do-it/) child care duties on women.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Concern over gender-neutral conscription based on the risk of a child losing both parents is disingenuous because there is no such concern regarding the effect of military conscription on gay male couples who raise children together.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: Until very recently, gay men were not allowed [to have kids](https://www.familyequality.org/2017/10/20/a-very-brief-history-of-lgbtq-parenting/), and openly gay men were prohibited from [serving in the army](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/20/us-military-lifts-ban-gay-troops). Thus, the issue of gay fathers serving in the army is unlikely to have been at the fore of conscription-related discussions.
1.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: Opposition to female conscription is largely rooted in [conservative values](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/07/23/conservatives-riled-up-over-registering-women-for-draft/), as demonstrated by the strong opposition to equal conscription from [Republicans](https://nypost.com/2021/07/25/republicans-oppose-making-women-register-for-draft/), who also oppose non-traditional families and gender roles.
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: Children are often left under the care of their next of kin in families where [both military parents](https://www.parents.com/parenting/dynamics/military/when-mom-dad-are-in-the-military/) are absent, either temporarily or permanently. Not all families may have this option available to them.
1.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: Families in which both parents are deployed have few options to find child care, as there is [no policy or law](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-active-duty-spouses-struggle-with-deployment-2007sep02-story.html) that prevents sending both parents to combat zones at the same time.
1.4.3.1.4.2. Con: Technological advances in real-time communication has allowed dual military spouses to keep strong familial ties and [manage the stress](https://www.army.mil/article/28539/dual_military_spouses_share_deployment_successes) of dual deployment.
1.4.3.1.4.3. Pro: In cases where no one is available to care for children orphaned through conscription, the government would be obligated to take care of the children; this would increase government expenditure.
1.4.3.2. Con: In the US, active-duty personnel constitute about [0.5% of the population](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military). It is unlikely that reducing childbirth rates among 0.25% of the population will have a significant impact.
1.4.3.3. Con: Conscription doesn't necessarily involve [conscripting women en masse](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-women-conscription/norway-becomes-first-nato-country-to-draft-women-into-military-idUSBRE95D0NB20130614).
1.4.3.4. Pro: Women have a limited optimal fertile window; it's often [better](https://www.babycenter.com/0_age-and-fertility-getting-pregnant-in-your-20s_1494692.bc) for them to have children when younger.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Having a child after the [age of 35](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy) carries greater risks of complications for the mother and birth defects for the child.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: Many women in modern times do not have children until their early [30s or late 20s](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/reports/a12784974/average-age-women-have-first-baby-become-mum/).
1.4.3.4.3. Con: Conscription usually only takes [one to two years](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44646267), while women typically have at least 20 years to have children. This is a significant period of time in which to choose whether or not they want children.
1.4.4. Con: War results in high numbers of both [combatant and civilian casualties](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.765261/full). Therefore, not conscripting women would still subject them to the harms of war.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Military service no longer carries an increased risk of death, with a generally decreasing mortality rate \([pp. 5-6](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972351/20210325_Deaths_in_the_UK_Regular_Armed_Forces_2021_O.pdf)(There was a downward trend in the rate of deaths among UK regular armed forces personnel over the latest ten-year period. This was the result of a higher number of deaths during 2011 and 2012 due to operational activity in Iraq and Afghanistan with the rate falling following the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan. Since 2014, there have been only three lives lost as a result of hostile action \(one in 2015, one in 2018 and one in 2020\)...\nResults in the top left graph of Figure 2 show that the UK armed forces were at a statistically significantly lower risk of dying compared to the UK general population.)\).
1.4.4.2. Pro: The home is often the [most dangerous place](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2018/November/home-the-most-dangerous-place-for-women-with-majority-of-female-homicide-victims-worldwide-killed-by-partners-or-family--unodc-study-says.html) for women. If governments were truly motivated to protect women from death, more efforts would be taken to make the home safer for them.
1.4.4.3. Con: Civilians have more options to protect themselves from the harms of war, such as by internally migrating away from war-torn regions or [emigrating](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/11/20908160/turkey-invasion-syria-refugee-crisis-trump)(Turkey’s escalating offensive in Syria could displace as many as 300,000 people and cut off their access to humanitarian services — creating yet another refugee crisis in the war-torn country just as the US is slashing the number of refugees it will admit.\n\nSince the beginning of the ongoing civil war in March 2011, about 6.6 million refugees have fled the country and another 6.1 million remain in Syria but have been internally displaced.\n\[...\]\nTurkey has absorbed more Syrian refugees than any other country: 3.6 million, the overwhelming majority of which live outside of camps and have difficulty accessing basic services, such as medical care and food assistance. The EU has provided Turkey with financial aid to facilitate refugee resettlement and prevent migrants from flooding the continent, but Erdoğan is facing pressure to resettle most of them in light of a recent economic downturn in the country.) to a more peaceful country \([p. 599](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol45/18/45-18.pdf)(These migration balances reveal the extent of the May–June 1940 exodus in France. The population of the eastern and northern border regions fled to the southwest. Ardennes lost 40% of its population between 1939 and 1940, and the départements in the Alps bordering Italy lost 10% of their population to internal migration. In the northeastern départements, allocated for German colonization, refugees returned only after this project was abandoned in late 1941. From 1941, the largest population flows were from the north and northwest to the south, beyond the demarcation line into the free zone)\).
1.4.4.4. Con: Women are often able to [carry on living](https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/multimedia/2016/10/women-between-war-and-peace) in spite of the violence that surrounds them during times of war, even working to prevent conflict and extremism in a civilian capacity.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Up to [90%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio) of modern wartime casualties are civilians, which means that remaining in a civilian position during war does not provide any guarantees in avoiding any kind of harm.
1.4.5. Con: Reproductive responsibility should not form the basis for gender roles, the value of a human being, or equal treatment.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Linking womanhood to the creation of life is a dangerous and false equivalency.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: The creation of life is more closely associated with parenthood, rather than womanhood.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: While not all women give birth, all who give birth were assigned female at birth. Thus, a female identity is inextricably linked to the creation of life.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: Not all women are [physically](https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/07/uterine-transplant-transgender/) [capable](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/infertility/) of bearing children, and not all people who bear children are women.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Linking womanhood to the creation of life perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women, legitimizes benevolent sexism, and ultimately limits their emancipation \([p. 12](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303535237_Benevolent_Sexism_Attitudes_Toward_Motherhood_and_Reproductive_Rights_A_Multi-Study_Longitudinal_Examination_of_Abortion_Attitudes)("\[T\]he idealization of motherhood ultimately undermines women’s rights.")\).
1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro: Likening womanhood to the creation of life reinforces the [disproportionate burden](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/) women carry when it comes to child care.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: The link between womanhood and the creation of life is dangerous only if the latter is considered a prerequisite for the former. To merely say that women have the unique ability to create life is not dangerous.
1.4.5.2. Con: An [accepting attitude](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387654/) towards stereotypical gender roles is associated with a positive fertility rate. Thus, acknowledging such attitudes is important in determining a country's population policy.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: The female gender role typically portrays women as [nurturing](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-psychology/chapter/gender/) and compassionate creators of life. Therefore, it is only logical that women who endorse such notions go on to have more children, which would allow them to portray such attributes.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: In the cited study, fertility was defined as [number of children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387654/) per woman. Therefore, the findings merely imply that egalitarian women have [fewer children](https://www.niussp.org/gender-issues/gender-equality-and-fertility-is-there-a-connection/), particularly in gender-unequal countries, such as [Iran](https://old.iranintl.com/en/iran-in-brief/world-economic-forum-ranks-iran-150-out-156-countries-gender-gap), where the study was conducted.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Even though not all women can or want to have children, repopulation could still occur. This indicates that biological role should not be considered a determining factor when evaluating equal conscription.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: People can be given [time off](https://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/Benefit-Library/Federal-Benefits/Military-Parental-Leave-Program-\(MPLP\)?serv=122) from military duty if they have children.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: In the US, bills are being considered to [increase](https://www.militarytimes.com/pay-benefits/mil-money/2021/05/11/military-parents-would-get-12-weeks-of-leave-to-care-for-new-children-under-congressional-proposal/) the length of leave for military parents to give them more time to take care of their new children.
1.4.5.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.1.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: The fact that women can choose to not have kids is all the more reason to ensure that they are not killed in large numbers; society depends on those who want to have children to continue the human race.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: Many women choose [careers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/25/study-single-american-women-say-career-is-priority-over-having-kids.html) over children.
1.4.5.4. Con: The survival of the human race depends on biology. Biology should not be the only factor in deciding the role and value of men and women in society, but it should not be discounted.
