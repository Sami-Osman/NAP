Discussion Name: The Forward Party has the best platform (not most likely to win) of any Political Party in America.

1. The Forward Party has the best platform \(not most likely to win\) of any Political Party in America.
1.1. Pro: The Forward Party is the only party supporting important non-partisan democratic innovation.
1.1.1. Con: The Forward Party's platform mainly concerns procedural changes to improve voting and strengthen democratic institutions. While some of these changes might be good, they will not meaningfully improve the wellbeing of most people. A good political platform should focus on material issues, such as economic inequality, public safety, health care, and the environment.
1.1.1.1. Con: We don't need to move right or left. We need to save democracy.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Most people are more concerned with their everyday material struggles than they are with saving democracy. If someone is facing the loss of their job, or eviction from their home, they will always vote for the person who will stop that from happening over the person who will spend all their time trying to save democracy. This means that any plan to save democracy must be coupled with some kind of economic program.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: We won't be able to make meaningful improvements in the well-being of most people in today's political environment.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Many of the material issues that need addressing cannot be addressed due to procedural inadequacies, such as political gridlock.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: For decades, political gridlock has undermined legislative action on [environmental issues](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/22/americans-want-climate-solutions-why-wont-our-politicians-deliver/).
1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Senate GOP leader, [Mitch McConnell](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/555877-mcconnell-returns-as-senate-grim-reaper) - dubbed the 'Grim Reaper' - has helped thwart much of Biden's legislative agenda.
1.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: It is not clear how the Forward Party could deal with this. If people like Mitch McConnell or Joe Manchin can stymie progress on material issues, then they can also stymie progress on democratic reform. And they would have every incentive to do so, since democratic reform would mean they would have less power.
1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: It is not self-evident from non-partisan independent observers that Mitch McConnel or Joe Manchin always hold back "progress." They might prevent overreach when they prevent re-structuring our whole society from unpopular razer thin majorities. We have already spent trillions of dollars, are massively in debt, have massive inflation. It is not self-evident that we NEED trillions of more dollars spent in a partisan manner that doesn't engage the other side.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: It is impossible to have an intelligent discussion in today's hyper-partisan political environment, so we need to turn down the temperature before trying to have difficult conversations on complex issues.
1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: We won't be able to do anything new to fix our real problems until we improve our ability to have nuanced conversations.
1.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Our existing political parties want to re-hash the same old rage-based conversations. So we have to turn down the temperature before having rational discussions.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: We should stop jumping back and forth between people trying to make liberal or conservative utopias and ensure our elections promote sane candidates.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: It is irrational to fully trust your own beliefs and assumptions of which way the country should go. We need others in politics, and we need debate, compromise, and the scientific method to reach rational consensuses.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Not everyone agrees on what "will meaningfully improve the wellbeing of most people."
1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: We need others in politics, and we need debate, compromise, and the scientific method to reach rational consensuses.
1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: No matter how obvious it is to you that we should move left or right, countless people who disagree are just as confident and passionate. Millions of Americans have convinced themselves that we must move the country to the left or it will be destroyed. Millions have also convinced themselves of the exact opposite conclusion.
1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Millions of Americans have convinced themselves that we must move the country to the left or it will be destroyed. Millions have also convinced themselves of the exact opposite conclusion.
1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Your confidence in what we should do politically cannot be the deciding factor.
1.1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1.
1.1.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: You don't know everything.
1.1.1.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: In a country of 300 M there are likely myriad people who could improve your thinking processes, assumptions, and set of data.
1.1.1.1.3.1.5. Pro: In democracies, we must use evidence. Even if you "knew" what we should do, there is no way for non-dictators to use that knowledge without explaining themselves. The evidence-based policy movement is just an effort to use quality control in our arguments. And the book "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" proves we can't make rational arguments against quality, no matter how we define quality. Therefore, there can be no sensible argument against the evidence-based policy movement.
1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.2. Con: Other political parties have shown support for changing [filibuster rules](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture.htm), which are seen as anti-democratic.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-slams-filibuster-after-gop-blocks-voting-rights-act-2021-6?r=US&IR=T) - a Democrat - has slammed the filibuster in the past, arguing that it allows a minority of Senators to block legislation that otherwise has wide support.
1.1.3. Pro: The Forward Party is the only political party [supporting Term Limits](https://www.forwardparty.com/term-limits), which is a [valid reason to support them](https://www.kialo.com/congress-and-the-senate-should-impose-term-limits-on-representatives-16035).
1.1.3.1. Pro: Term limits would lower corruption. As a person's power increases, their moral sense diminishes.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Power tends to corrupt. John Dalberg-Action, 1st Baron Action said: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority."
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: William Pitt said in 1770 that "Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."
1.1.3.1.3. Con: While power can sometimes corrupt, research shows it can also [elevate moral behaviour](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15001232) due to its disinhibiting effect.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Term limits could reduce the risk of [nepotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism) as elected representatives have less time to shape and influence their work environment.
1.1.3.2. Con: Term limits might be a positive development, but there is no good reason to think that they're a silver bullet for solving political dysfunction. There are lots of democracies that function well without term limits.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Setting term limits will help accelerate improved diversity among Representatives and Senators.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Term limits would reduce incumbents' advantages \(statistically, it is tough to remove an incumbent\). They have a paid staff; they can travel for "work." They get interviews because they are in power.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Due to the tremendous power and privilege of those in office, once an elected official burrows in, it's nearly impossible to get them out. Within a very short time of taking office they figure out the rules for staying in office.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Compared to the US population, Congress is [disproportionately white](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/racial-ethnic-diversity-increases-yet-again-with-the-117th-congress/) and what diversity there is today has taken decades to build.
1.1.3.3.4. Pro: Elected representatives quickly assimilate into the ruling class, becoming just one more voice in partisan groupthink.
1.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Term limits may not eliminate partisan politics, but at a minimum it would introduce new voices into the conversation.
1.1.3.4. Con: Changing political representatives regularly is not necessarily good in itself; there is no guarantee that new candidates will be as or more competent.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: The potential for less experienced, less competent candidates to be elected is a necessary price to pay for democracy; avoiding this altogether would be a dictatorship.
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: Old candidates should not be discriminated against if they serve well; perhaps what should be established instead is that no person can be elected by the populace \(i.e., not the Supreme Court - necessary for judicial independence\) once and then serve for life. For example, Napoleon seized power not by being elected repeatedly, but by being elected for life. This is one key issue that the Forward Party agenda simply doesn't grasp.
1.1.3.4.4. Con: Term limits would reduce time fundraising for reelection and could help Representatives focus on their constituents.
1.1.3.4.4.1. Con: That is only true in the "Lame Duck" period of their appointment. They still have to raise funds for re-election until their final term, and could be voted out before then.
1.1.3.4.4.2. Con: That could be solved by imposing prohibitions on time spent raising money, not just limiting terms.
1.1.3.4.4.3. Pro: It is estimated that elected officials spend more than half their [time](https://www.termlimits.com/congress-fundraising-priority/), sometimes even 6 to 8 hours a day, fundraising instead of working on legislation.
1.1.3.4.4.4. Con: A new [study](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/term-limits-legislator-research) found that politicians who have the ability to serve another term are actually more productive.
1.1.3.4.4.4.1. Pro: Lawmakers who cannot be reelected "sponsor fewer bills, serve on fewer legislative committees and skip more roll-call votes", according to the University of Chicago and Stanford University [study](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/term-limits-legislator-research).
1.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.4.
1.1.3.6. Pro: Term limits would help diversify Congress by bringing in younger representatives with fresh ideas, values, and concerns.
1.1.3.6.1. Pro: Despite the myths about young generations being more focused on themselves, most research points out that millennials prefer [brands](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314156) that are socially responsible, care about the environment and are more [transparent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahlandrum/2017/03/17/millennials-driving-brands-to-practice-socially-responsible-marketing/#10dee85f4990). Therefore as a generation, they do seem to care about their surroundings a lot.
1.1.3.6.2. Pro: According to [research](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/25/opinion-polls-public-opinion-politicians), shifts in public opinion are very correlated with [age](http://www.ipsos-mori-generations.com/). As younger generation hold different values \(in most cases more tolerant and open-minded\), older politicians indeed lose touch with constituents.
1.1.3.7. Pro: Term limits exist at the Executive Branch, they should be in place for elected law makers as well.
1.1.3.7.1. Pro: Most voters on states with terms limits across parties support them. In Florida, where there are term limits, 76% of voters voted in favor. [A nationwide poll](https://www.fedsmith.com/2018/04/19/congressional-term-limits-without-constitutional-amendment/) conducted by McLaughlin & Associates found that 82% of voters support Congressional term limits, including 89% of Republicans, 83% of independents, and 76% of Democrats.
1.1.3.7.2. Con: Most modern term limits [internationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_term_limits) affect only  presidents or similar figures.
1.1.3.7.2.1. Con: We can learn from other countries, but we shouldn't just treat decisions like popularity contests and do what other countries are doing. It might make sense to see what other countries are doing if we examine if it is working well and understand why. But it always needs to go back to logic, not just popularity, and likely costs benefits or benefits, and why the benefits are or aren't expected. However, no one made any of these arguments.
1.1.3.7.3. Con: The responsibility and power of the executive branch are not comparable with the legislative branch.
1.1.3.7.3.1. Pro: In the US, for example, the President has [legislative](https://www.thoughtco.com/legislative-powers-of-the-president-3322195) powers. Elected officials, by themselves only, are not able to pass legislation, and so their responsibility and potential to corrupt the system or to become depots is far inferior.
1.1.3.7.3.2. Con: This is correct. The powers of the President are dwarfed when compared to the powers retained by Congress under the Constitution \(Ref US Const, Art I & US Const, Art II\)
1.1.3.8. Pro: Being a career representative is a conflict of interest. One is elected to represent the voters \(not rule\) and then return to a productive life. Elected office was never meant to be a career.
1.1.3.8.1. Pro: If elected officials spend most of their lives as politicians, instead of owning business or working, they become disconnected to the actual need of the working population.
1.1.3.8.1.1. Con: Being an elected official is a job too. They have schedules, meetings, goals and requirements to meet, superiors to report to, etc. Therefore, they can understand the struggles of the working population.
1.1.3.8.2. Pro: The Founders intended for this to be a part time role to serve the states and the nation, not to be a lifetime career of self aggrandizement and power grabbing. [mic.com](https://mic.com/articles/61831/what-would-the-founding-fathers-do-about-congressional-term-limits-today#.ZOHlD93NS)
1.1.3.8.3. Pro: Lawmakers should be making decisions on what's best for their constituents. If public office is a career, then representatives could be more likely to make decisions based on what is best for them personally, rather than the collective.
1.1.3.8.4. Pro: Politicians spend more time on personal re-election fundraising than on the legislative duties. A true representative would spend the most time researching and determining the district priorities that best serve the district, state, and nation. It is estimated that elected officials spend more than half their [time](https://www.termlimits.com/congress-fundraising-priority/), sometimes even 6 to 8 hours a day, fundraising instead of working on legislation.
1.1.3.8.5. Con: A term-limited representative has no re-election related incentive to do what those in her district wish, and are completely free to be as self-serving as they like without fear of consequences at the hands of their voters.
1.1.4. Pro: The Forward party supports evidence based policy, [which is a valid reason to help them](https://www.kialo.com/we-need-to-create-an-evidence-based-policy-movement-56081).
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See discussion #56081: [Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_legislation) decisions should be based on [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_practice).
1.1.4.2. Pro: Andrew Yang [said](https://www.forwardparty.com/whyforward): “This is what we have to change: We have to give rise to the use of evidence, facts, and results and have legislator accountability based on whether they can demonstrate that they’ve helped move us in a better direction.”
1.1.4.3. Pro: An [American Scorecard](https://www.forwardparty.com/whyforward) is one of the platforms supported by the Forward party. It is an effort to judge the performance of our country from a specific measurement and evidence based perspective.
1.1.4.4. Con: Having evidence-based policies should be and is a minimum condition for any legitimate political party; it does not distinguish the Forward Party from others.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: The [Green New Deal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620301067)(We find Sanders’ GND economically credible and argue that the GND's use of Keynesian demand-side macroeconomics challenges governments, policymakers and citizens to think anew about the nature of money.) proposed by some Democrats is evidentially supported too.
1.1.5. Pro: The Forward Party is the only political party [supporting Ranked-Choice Voting](https://www.forwardparty.com/rankedchoice-voting), which is [an excellent reason to support them](https://www.kialo.com/ranked-choice-voting-36382).
1.1.5.1. Pro: We need nonpartisan ways of promoting better candidates.
1.1.5.2. Pro: We need to turn down the partisan hatred from our elections.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Political parties get support by spreading outrage pornography, exaggerating, oversimplifying, and mischaracterizing the other side.
1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4. Con: The Forward Party's position against partisan-based polarization is hypocritical since it is a political party, and thus partisan itself.
1.4.1. Con: In an interview, Forward Party's founder - Andrew Yang - said he was a ["big fan" of Howie Hawkins' Green Party](https://www.wnyc.org/story/andrew-yang-moves-forward-new-party/)(I'm a big fan of the Green Party and many or most are-- \[laughs\] I haven't looked at the platform so there might be something I don't like in there, but big fan of the Green Party. I think what we should be fighting for is a system where different parties can participate more meaningfully.), which indicates he does not have a partisan mindset.
1.4.2. Pro: In order for Forward Party's agenda to be successful, it must become politically influential. To do this requires substantial partisanship.
1.4.3. Con: The problem is left/right propaganda that tries to reframe the world along socialist/capitalist or tradition/reform framework, which the Forward Party does not do. Instead of fighting for specific outcomes, a political party that focuses on nondogmatic processes improvements to democracy itself can be nonpartisan.
1.4.3.1. Pro: When data is only shared from one side of these approaches, it is partisan propaganda. Therefore, a political party trying to promote processes instead of fighting these partisan battles with propaganda is not the problem.
1.4.4. Con: We don't need hatred, and virtue signaling for politics to keep our attention. A nonpartisan political party that focuses on process improvements will generate enough support.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The average person's attention and desire do not allow great things to be created. Individuals with an idea and the will to create something new are the only thing that has ever improved the world.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Ellon Musk didn't need the approval or faith from the average American to believe in Electric vehicles or re-usable rockets to form the team of believers who could work with him and make them happen. Once everyone saw that they worked, they changed their mind. He didn't need their approval beforehand. So if we can show that something works on a small scale, we rump up. That is how everything has always worked. People resist change, then say that it was obviously going to happen all along.
1.5. Con: The Forward Party is essentially an off-shoot of the Democratic Party, and therefore its platform suffers from the same problems.
1.5.1. Pro: The Forward Party's founder - Andrew Yang - was a [Democratic mayoral candidate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberleespeakman/2021/10/04/andrew-yang-leaves-democratic-party-registers-as-independent/) in 2020.
1.5.2. Pro: The Forward Party advocates for a [universal basic income \(UBI\)](https://www.forwardparty.com/), which many high profile [Democrats](https://medium.com/basic-income/on-the-record-bernie-sanders-on-basic-income-de9162fb3b5c) were already behind. But experts question how [affordable](https://www.moneycrashers.com/universal-basic-income/)(The most common and compelling argument against UBI is that it’s simply too expensive. The government canceled the basic income trial in Ontario early due to what it called “an extraordinary cost for Ontario taxpayers,” and that program covered only 4,000 people.\n\nFor a national program, the costs would be an even bigger hurdle. In her memoir “What Happened,” Hillary Clinton reveals that she wanted to propose a UBI plan when she ran for president in 2016. However, her team just “couldn’t make the numbers work.”) UBI is.
1.5.2.1. Pro: UBI is a solution to a problem we don't have right now. UBI is there to take care of the massive number of people who can't find jobs because of automation. We actually have the opposite problem. We can't find enough people to work, or who are willing to move to the location of available jobs.
1.5.3. Con: Even though the Forward Party has similar policies to the Democratic Party, the fact it is not labelled as such will make it more appealing to non-Democratic voters.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Politics often change from thinking about and debating issues to exploiting team loyalty, and "my side is good and your side is either evil" or "naïve" group psychology.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: If party members think their leader came up with an idea, they will support it. However, we have all seen people shown that the quote came from the other party's leader. We know the problem with party politics as they now work out in real-time why the quote was an error instead of examining themselves and seeing the reality of party loyalty and lack of reason.
1.6. Con: The Forward Party's platform is too ambitious to gain traction in mainstream American politics. \(Off topic. Even people will 10s of millions of dollars, with advanced degrees in statistics, are terrible at predicting the future. It is not part of the original topic. The original post is what should win, not who will win\).
1.6.1. Pro: The Forward Party is likely to face backlash from both Democrats and Republicans, thus making it difficult for the majority of Americans to see them as a legitimate third option.
1.6.1.1. Con: Best does not imply "will win."
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.7. Con: The Forward Party wants to embrace [cryptocurrencies](https://www.forwardparty.com/crypto), which could be seriously damaging for the United States.
1.7.1. Pro: Cryptocurrencies enable or encourage illegal activities.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Cryptocurrencies enable tax evasion.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Tax evasion does not need enabling, it is already rampant, both among corporations and among society’s elite. [The Panama Papers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers?wprov=sfti1)
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Cryptocurrencies allow people to transfer money from A to B without a trace and thus receive untaxed income.
1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: This is simply untrue. Most cryptocurrencies are completely transparent and can be publicly reviewed by anyone on sites called block explorers. [blockexplorer.com](https://blockexplorer.com/)
1.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Some cryptocurrencies, unlike other forms of payment, are anonymous and untraceable.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) is a fully fungible, anonymous and untraceable cryptocurrency implementation.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Most cryptocurrencies are [traceable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6izhgw/eli5_how_traceable_are_transactions/) by design, and [not fully anonymous](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608716/bitcoin-transactions-arent-as-anonymous-as-everyone-hoped/) due to traceability.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Zcash is a cryptocurrency with a fully [private](https://hackernoon.com/how-private-are-privacy-coins-a-closer-look-at-zcash-and-zclassics-blockchains-32dae60d5b9f) transfer option.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.4. Con: Security does not require anonymity or untraceability.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Security means that nobody unauthorized can manipulate, authorize or see your transactions.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: Security, when talking about money transactions, does not mean that nobody can tell that you are paying someone, nor whom you are paying.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.5. Con: Untraceability can even be bad for security.
1.7.1.1.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: When cryptocurrencies are stolen, there is no hope of recovering them because the transactions are irreversible once confirmed by the network and added to the blockchain.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: To spend cryptocurrencies in most contexts, a person needs to sell them for fiat through an exchange, and all the exchanges are subject to governmental reporting, which is used for tax enforcement. In fact these accounts are even easier to audit than traditional ones because blockchains are transparent. [Coinbase and IRS Subpoenas](http://fortune.com/2017/07/06/coinbase-irs-summons/)
1.7.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.2.1.1.
1.7.1.1.4. Pro: Tax evaders do not even need to open a bank account in shady places anymore to hide their money away from the eyes of tax authorities.
1.7.1.1.4.1. Pro: At least bank accounts were associated with a face and often also a name, even if it only was a number account in Switzerland.
1.7.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Having a face and name offers no advantage if the taxes are being evaded.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Extortion attacks are much more likely if you have a very hard to trace option of payment.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: [CryptoLocker](http://www.zdnet.com/cryptolockers-crimewave-a-trail-of-millions-in-laundered-bitcoin-7000024579/) is a trojan that encrypts your data and only decrypts it after you paid a ransom using Bitcoin.
1.7.1.2.2. Pro: Cryptocurrencies have made an [escalation of ransomware attacks](https://theconversation.com/are-cryptocurrencies-a-dream-come-true-for-cyber-extortionists-80115) in recent years possible by providing a method of payment that is more difficult to trace than the alternatives.
1.7.1.3. Con: The vast majority of illegal transactions are settled in U.S. denominated cash. Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrency transactions entail creation of immutable ledger entries which are uniquely identifiable \(though at least superficially anonymous\). Blockchain transaction analysis presents greater risks to organized criminals than existing cash laundering schemes.
1.7.1.4. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make it easier to purchase and sell illegal goods and services.
1.7.1.4.1. Pro: It simplifies funding of terrorists.
1.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: According to the Indonesian government, terrorists in the Middle East used bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund [militants in Indonesia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-paypal-used-to-finance-terrorism-indonesian-agency-says-1483964198). These transactions are harder to track for the Indonesian police than regular ones.
1.7.1.4.1.2. Con: As of 2017, terrorist groups' use of virtual currencies was [limited](https://www.lawandsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CLSCNASReport-TerroristFinancing-Final.pdf) \(p. 2\), primarily due to the difficulty of converting them back to currencies that can be used in the real world.
1.7.1.4.1.3. Pro: Cryptocurrencies enable terrorist groups to avoid the [global banking system](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/cryptocurrencies-and-national-security), which has specific regulations to combat terrorist financing.
1.7.1.4.2. Pro: Silk Road, once one of the major services empowered by Bitcoin, was basically only selling [illegal services and goods](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2013/12/Jones-Andrew-et-al-Silk-Road-Indictment.pdf).
1.7.1.4.2.1. Con: Silk Road got busted. It shows that even if the system is anonymous there will still be consequences for committing crimes.
1.7.1.4.3. Pro: If you buy illegal items using cryptocurrencies and the police catches you, they can only prove that you had them delivered, but not that you bought them, as the money trail cannot be traced.
1.7.1.4.3.1. Pro: Under US law, receiving illegal drugs through the mail is only illegal when the [recipient knew about it](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-10/news/ct-met-beach-park-raid-sidebar-20121010_1_search-warrant-illegal-drugs-search-and-seizure) - something that is much more difficult to prove if they paid for them using cryptocurrencies.
1.7.1.4.3.2. Con: The police are getting better and [better at tracking Bitcoin](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/why-criminals-cant-hide-behind-bitcoin) address owners. It is a serious security industry these days, with lots of developments and investment.
1.7.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.3.2.
1.7.1.4.5. Pro: The creation of an ["assassination market"](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/18/meet-the-assassination-market-creator-whos-crowdfunding-murder-with-bitcoins/&refURL=&referrer=), where you can contribute Bitcoins to place a bounty on major government figures, is one byproduct of cryptocurrencies.
1.7.1.4.6. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make it easier for consumers to acquire banned products such as [child pornography](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mgbeda/bitcoin-is-implicated-in-a-clearnet-child-porn-trend).
1.7.1.4.6.1. Pro: Sellers are afraid that money will be traced back to them in the status quo, but this changes with [untraceable cryptocurrencies](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/monero-drug-dealers-cryptocurrency-choice-fire/).
1.7.1.5. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make new kinds of crime possible.
1.7.1.5.1. Pro: [Fake ICO's](https://gizmodo.com/cryptocurrency-scam-site-disappears-leaving-only-the-w-1822509367) can scam people out of money.
1.7.1.5.2. Pro: Cryptocurrencies have led to the [proliferation of "pump and dump" schemes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-regulation/u-s-regulator-warns-of-cryptocurrency-pump-and-dump-schemes-idUSKCN1FZ2QE).
1.7.1.5.3. Pro: Scams playing on people's gullible nature fuelled by the hype around cryptocurrencies [proliferate](https://medium.com/coinremix/twitter-scam-elon-musk-is-not-giving-you-free-eth-one-tweet-has-collected-155-eth-and-counting-2f52fe35b5a8) on social media.
1.7.1.6. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make it easier for criminals to operate and be paid.
1.7.1.6.1. Pro: Banks have to [report](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geldw%C3%A4sche#Meldu...) suspicious activities, including large wire transfers. Cryptocurrency transfers, on the other hand, are not reported to anyone, which makes them very useful for criminals.
1.7.1.6.1.1. Pro: In the US, banks [have to report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_transaction_report) transactions involving more than $10,000, including international transfers.
1.7.1.6.2. Pro: Bitcoin can or could be used to pay for [hitmen](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hitman-network-says-it-accepts-bitcoins-to-murder-for-hire).
1.7.1.6.3. Con: Every way to transfer money has probably been used by criminals.
1.7.1.6.3.1. Con: Yes, but some make it easy and others make it difficult to be used by criminals - and cryptocurrencies make it significantly easier.
1.7.1.6.4. Pro: Today illegal activities are mostly paid for using cash or anonymous bank accounts in shady places, which is costly and complicated - cryptocurrencies make this much simpler.
1.7.1.6.5. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make money laundering much easier.
1.7.1.6.5.1. Pro: In April 2018, Europol uncovered a crime network that used cryptocurrencies to launder more than [8 million euros](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/illegal-network-used-cryptocurrencies-and-credit-cards-to-launder-more-eur-8-million-drug-trafficking) of drug money.
1.7.1.6.5.2. Con: It is not easier to launder money using cryptocurrencies. The laundering always means you have to make it seem like the money was earned legally. You will have the same problems, no matter if it is Bitcoin, cash or money on offshore accounts.
1.7.1.6.5.2.1. Con: When laundering money, money has to flow from one entity to another. This part of the process can be obscured with cryptocurrencies as there is no entity overseeing these financial flows.
1.7.1.6.5.2.2. Con: A number of criminal organisations have already successfully used cryptocurrencies to launder money - usually, they just withdraw it in [small batches of cash](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/04/26/crypto-money-laundering) in the end.
1.7.1.6.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.6.5.2.2.
1.7.1.6.5.4. Pro: The former CEO of a Bitcoin exchange company [was sentenced](http://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ceo-bitcoin-exchange-company-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-two-years-prison) to two years in prison for helping to sell nearly one million dollars in Bitcoin that had been used for drug purchases on Silk Road.
1.7.1.6.6. Pro: Handling large stashes of cash is cumbersome and it is difficult to use this money in the normal economy.
1.7.1.6.7. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make black market labor much easier.
1.7.1.6.7.1. Con: This also has the upside of greasing the economy in jurisdictions where clean employment registration is subject to too heavy taxation.
1.7.1.6.7.2. Pro: If the black market labor is not just for babysitting but for some significant project, then paying big amounts of money in cash is quite a problem today.
1.7.1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Alone the going to a bank and withdrawing thousands of Euros in cash, is uncommon today.
1.7.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.6.5.
1.7.1.8. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.3.2.
1.7.1.9. Con: That's the same as saying that the guilt of a murder is the weapon and not the murderer.
1.7.1.10. Con: Payments in cash are largely [untraceable](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150724-the-truth-about-the-death-of-cash), allowing them to be used to fund illegal activities just as easily.
1.7.1.10.1. Con: Payments in cash require physical presence, making it always potentially more traceable than cryptocurrencies.
1.7.2. Pro: Pivoting to cryptocurrencies risks [worsening economic inequality](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/cryptocurrencies-could-lead-to-financial-instability-author-warns.html)(Cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology hold out the promise of democratizing finance by making digital payments and other financial products and services easily accessible to the masses. But because of existing inequalities in digital access and financial literacy, they could end up worsening inequality. In particular, any financial risks arising from investing in cryptocurrencies and related products might end up falling especially heavily on naïve retail investors.) due to the ongoing digital divide and financial illiteracy.
1.7.2.1. Con: Digital currencies allow financial innovation among communities that otherwise do not have strong access to capital, potentially increasing prosperity.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The [Circles UBI](https://joincircles.net/) project is experimenting with creating a voluntary basic income platform using webs of trust greatly facilitated by blockchain.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Countries like Venezuela are hard to send aid to because potentially oppressive regimes may interfere with remittances, but digital currencies give an easy way to send aid that bypasses these policies, e.g. [Bitcoin Venezuela](https://www.bitcoinvenezuela.com/).
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: The [Trustlines Network](https://trustlines.network/) project uses blockchain to allow peer to peer lending, even amongst those who do not have high standing with a bank or major financier.
1.7.2.1.4. Pro: The [WIR Bank](http://community-currency.info/en/currencies/wir-bank/) in Switzerland has greatly stabilized their economy in times of economic depression, and with the decreased overhead of digital currencies, could be a more accessible model.
1.7.2.1.5. Con: The most popular Cryptocurrencies have [gained their value from fiat currency](https://cafenau.com/2021/08/15/how-does-cryptocurrency-gain-value/)(Fiat Inflation If a fiat currency, like the USD or GBP, becomes inflated, its price rises and its purchasing power drops. This will then cause cryptocurrencies \(let’s use Bitcoin as an example\) to increase with respect to that fiat. The result is that you will be able to acquire more of that fiat with each bitcoin. In fact, this situation has been one of the major reasons for Bitcoin’s price increase.) I.e spending cash to buy crypto. Thus it’s just an exchange of one form of fiat for another. The difference is cryptocurrency can be used for [totalitarian end game scenarios](https://www.afinalwarning.com/576880.html)(The price of Bitcoin has been wildly inflated by Tether purchases, and the Tether company has so far created over $70 billion in Tether coins. They are supposed to have $70 billion in dollar deposits to back it up, but they don't. And since it's entirely unregulated, they technically don't have to submit to any accounting and can simply "claim" to have whatever deposits they want. \(Making "self-affirmation" statements instead of engaging in rigorous accounting audits.\) This is the equivalent to a central bank claiming they have, say, 10,000 tons of gold in their vaults while refusing to have their gold deposits audited. In fact, that's the situation we all currently face with central banks: They print fiat currency while claiming to have deposits, but they refuse to allow auditing of their books.).
1.7.2.2. Con: Cryptocurrencies would make banking more accessible.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: It would allow everyone to hold digital money without being required to hold an account with a bank.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: You need a bank to buy into digital “money”.
1.7.2.2.1.2. Con: Most users would have to hold accounts with middleman/third party services such as Wallet hosting/Exchanges, in order to use cryptocurrencies.
1.7.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: In order to use Cryptocurrencies without trusting a middleman for your wallet, you have to be very [technically savvy](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/23700/can-i-make-and-host-bitcoin-wallet-in-my-own-website-to-get-rid-of-using-3rd-par).
1.7.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Very few users have the technical ability to host and use their own blockchain wallet, or the time to maintain security updates.
1.7.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Users can use a [paper wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/information/paper-wallet-tutorial/) to hold cryptocurrencies without needing to be technically savvy.
1.7.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Crypto middlemen are less trustworthy than the established banking system.
1.7.2.2.1.3. Con: This is an issue that can easily be solved through other forms of digital money, as has been done in [China](http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2110118/going-cash-free-why-china-light-years-ahead).
1.7.2.2.2. Pro: While most service sectors have moved into the internet, the banking industry is still a very centralized platform based industry.
1.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: This would facilitate innovation in the financial industry and thus create more jobs.
1.7.2.2.2.2. Con: The banking industry has moved to the Internet for a long time.
1.7.2.2.2.3. Con: Centralization isn't the problem, but human greed an immoral behavior is. Whatever the currency or technology, as long as humans are flawed, any technology will be used for bad intent.
1.7.2.2.3. Con: This could be achieved to the same degree through other forms of digital money.
1.7.2.2.4. Pro: The cost of achieving financial inclusion would be vastly reduced, as people could gain financial access simply by downloading a secure application on their smartphone.
1.7.2.2.4.1. Con: This already exists without the use of cryptocurrencies, e.g. [M-Pesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa) in East Africa.
1.7.3. Pro: Cryptocurrency mining is a waste of resources.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Cryptocurrency mining consumes too much [energy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland).
1.7.3.2. Con: Cryptocurrencies are no different from any other production in this regard. As long as the cryptocurrency holds value \(relative to a purchaser\), the resource cost is just that: cost. Cost only becomes waste once the production loses its value. The concept "waste" assumes that the production process is in vain.
1.7.3.3. Con: If the energy comes from renewable energy sources it is not that bad.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: The renewable energy could have been used to replace non-renewable energy, instead of having been used for cryptocurrency generation. This of course only applies if you are able to redirect it to other industries.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: As Cryptocurrency mining is usually done 24/7 and many renewable energy sources have a peak production instead of a continuous 24/7 production, the investment for the hardware will not be lucrative if you only mine on peak-renewable energy production.
1.7.3.3.3. Con: That is probably not the case for most cryptocurrencies right now.
1.7.3.4. Con: Mining minerals for normal currency consumes a lot of resources too.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: American currency has not been linked to resources such as [gold](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2017/november/why-us-no-longer-follows-gold-standard) for a long time.
1.7.3.4.2. Con: [Less than 10%](https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm) of the world's currency exists in coins and paper money - most of it is purely virtual.
1.7.3.5. Con: Not all cryptocurrencies require mining, or large amounts of electricity to generate blocks.
1.7.3.6. Pro: Cryptocurrency mining requires a lot of [hardware](https://www.coindesk.com/information/how-to-set-up-a-miner/).
1.7.3.6.1. Pro: Purpose-built devices such as [application-specific integrated circuits \(ASICs\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) have been developed for mining cryptocurrencies. Resources and production costs are spent on these devices that are only useful for mining cryptocurrencies.
1.7.3.6.2. Pro: There is a [shortage](https://kotaku.com/the-great-graphics-card-shortage-of-2018-1822346367) of graphics cards around the world as more and more people venture into cryptocurrency mining. People who would like to use GPUs for gaming or machine learning are faced with much higher prices or empty shelves.
1.7.3.6.3. Con: Most cryptocurrencies - [some more efficiently than others](https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/cryptocurrency-mining/) - can be mined on normal consumer computers as well. How one uses their computer is a personal choice.
1.7.3.6.3.1. Pro: Some people mine cryptocurrencies on their computer in the [downtime](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tutorial:_Automatically_mine_when_computer_is_locked_on_Windows) - when they are not using it for anything else.
1.7.3.6.3.2. Con: As consumer computers are [not very efficient](https://www.abitgreedy.com/cryptocurrency-mining/) at mining cryptocurrencies, squeezing out every bit of efficiency, if done incorrectly, often [leads to](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1612/can-i-damage-my-computer-by-mining-bitcoin) overheating the hardware, reducing its lifetime.
1.7.4. Con: Cryptocurrencies reduce the effective power of centralized banks and financial institutions.
1.7.5. Con: Cryptocurrencies may be the [future](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/future-of-cryptocurrency/); it is important that America adapts.
1.7.5.1. Con: Most ordinary citizens would not use such a currency anyway, rendering all potential benefits moot.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: With a cryptocurrency, people wouldn't be able to participate in bonus systems, like payback, which track and analyze all purchases.
1.7.5.1.1.1. Con: Systems that allow functionality such as payback can be built on top of cryptocurrencies by third parties.
1.7.5.1.1.2. Con: There is no evidence that bonus systems are the determining factor when people decide which payment system to use. If it was, cash would've long been eliminated.
1.7.5.1.2. Con: If cryptocurrencies achieve ease of use equal to traditional banking, it only needs to offer a single benefit to potentially achieve mass adoption, and there are many such benefits, including speed and low transaction fees.
1.7.5.1.2.1. Pro: Using cryptocurrencies for online transactions can be faster than traditional payment solutions. For example, Nano \(aka RaiBlocks\) allows [near-instantaneous transactions](https://globalcoinreport.com/rethinking-the-global-digital-payment-system-with-nano/), not comparable to traditional and extremely slow SEPA transfers.
1.7.5.1.2.2. Con: Transferring cryptocurrencies [takes time](https://coincentral.com/how-long-do-bitcoin-transfers-take/) and the associated fees can be [quite high](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/big-transactions-fees-are-a-problem-for-bitcoin.html).
1.7.5.1.3. Con: Huge companies gathering all payment information of citizens is bad for society.
1.7.5.1.3.1. Pro: Citizens have no control over whether their information is stored securely by the companies who collect it, which can lead to malicious agents acquiring it.
1.7.5.1.3.2. Pro: Consumer data can contribute to the creation of "[big data profiles](https://theconversation.com/big-data-security-problems-threaten-consumers-privacy-54798)" for individual citizens, which can be misused for political manipulation and in other morally dubious ways.
1.7.5.1.3.3. Con: Society requires there to be records of payments, as these are primary means for fighting tax evasion, so somebody has to keep these, whether it is many small or some big companies, does not matter.
1.7.5.1.3.4. Pro: A lot of companies will [sell all your personal details](https://www.forbes.com/2010/11/29/black-market-price-of-your-info-personal-finance/) for their own advantage, regardless of the customers' benefit.
1.7.5.1.3.4.1. Pro: People get a lot of spam because of the way their information is passed on to their real customers, advertising companies.
1.7.5.1.3.5. Con: Relevant targeted advertisements are based on knowing the customer.
1.7.5.1.3.5.1. Pro: At least relevant advertising would be less annoying than untargeted advertising for goods and services that are completely irrelevant for users.
1.7.5.1.3.5.2. Con: People do not need that kind of advertisement - they know themselves better than any company and can just google the stuff they want.
1.7.5.1.3.6. Con: In the US, most [Internet services](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) that regular users use today are free. On these websites, users generally do not expose themselves to being tracked via payment methods.
1.7.5.1.3.7. Con: By gathering all your payments, companies can provide excellent anti-fraud systems, thus lowering the amount of fraud and the cost of payment services for the consumer.
1.7.5.1.4. Con: Cryptocurrencies only need to have utility for niche groups of people in order to be worth having.
1.7.5.1.4.1. Con: This is not true if the harms accumulated by cryptocurrencies to the rest of society outweigh the benefits to the niche group.
1.7.5.1.5. Con: Things can be "beneficial for the world" even if only minorities use it.
1.7.5.1.5.1. Con: The overall evaluation of societal benefit has to based on looking at the aggregate numbers.
1.7.5.1.6. Pro: All potential benefits in terms of convenience, which might lure citizens to use cryptocurrencies, are already provided by existing digital payment methods.
1.7.5.1.7. Pro: Cryptocurrencies are considered complicated, obscure and [unstable](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/whats-keeping-cryptocurrencies-from-mass-adoption/?guccounter=1) by most people, all of which make mass adoption highly unlikely.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See discussion #47392: Bitcoin's energy consumption will cause its own failure.
1.7.6. Pro: The volatile, decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies could destabilise the US economy.
1.7.6.1. Con: Currencies backed by governments are often harmful themselves. Being a government does not correlate with strong currency management, as the example of [Venezuela](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/20/americas/venezuela-currency/index.html) shows.
1.7.6.2. Pro: For a currency to have a reliable value, it either has to be backed by a government fiat or have a consistent and reliable use as a commodity \(such as being the value used within a legal system to allocate damages\).
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: Being supported by government fiat means that there is an \(ostensibly\) neutral party with a long term interest in the stability of the currency and with the financial tools \(setting interest rates, taxes, etc\) to strongly influence its value.
1.7.6.2.2. Pro: Without a consistent and widespread use as a commodity a currency is more prone to speculation — they need a stable source of value and so people have incentives to invest or short against value fluctuations.
1.7.6.2.3. Con: Cryptocurrencies do not preclude government backing or commodity stability, as the [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) project has demonstrated: a cryptocurrency can be pegged to represent any stable value.
1.7.6.3. Pro: There can be no monetary policy for decentralised digital currencies.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: There actually can be. For example, [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/) is a blockchain-based organization that manages a treasury, and produces digital financial products that have successfully tracked the price of the dollar through great volatility, and could track any other asset value, too.
1.7.6.4. Pro: Cryptocurrencies make it harder for states to implement capital controls, which makes regulating the economy more difficult.
1.7.6.4.1. Con: Most people pay taxes and banks report all their in/outflows above certain limits.
1.7.6.4.1.1. Con: The banks have to internally keep an eye, they are not reporting to anybody and thereby breaching privacy.
1.7.6.4.1.1.1. Con: Banks have to [report](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geldw%C3%A4sche#Meldu...) suspicious activities, including large wire transfers. Cryptocurrency transfers, on the other hand, are not reported to anyone, which makes them very useful for criminals.
1.7.6.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the US, banks [have to report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_transaction_report) transactions involving more than $10,000, including international transfers.
1.7.6.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.4.1.1.1.1.
1.7.6.4.2. Pro: It makes it much easier to circumvent capital controls, like in [China](https://www.coindesk.com/china-leading-global-rise-bitcoin/).
1.7.6.5. Con: In case of a catastrophic collapse of the financial system cryptocurrencies are still able to retain some of their value, while major currencies like USD, EUR and CHF will not.
1.7.6.5.1. Con: During the [last major financial crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/business/worldbusiness/22iht-dollar.4.17174760.html), the US dollar never really depreciated against other currencies.
1.7.6.5.1.1. Pro: Whenever there is a major crisis, there is a [flight to quality](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/flighttoquality.asp), which means USD treasury bonds are being bought by investors around the world, thus increasing the demand for USD.
1.7.6.5.2. Con: This is pure speculation - cryptocurrency exchange rates fluctuate so wildly, even without financial system collapses, that considering them as retainers of any sort of value would be highly risky.
1.7.6.5.2.1. Con: If a cryptocurrency was in wider use, then its value would be more stable.
1.7.6.5.3. Con: Precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum already serve this purpose [without](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/19/bitcoin-is-not-the-new-gold-goldman-sachs-says.html) the phenomenal fluctuations typical in the prices of cryptocurrencies.
1.7.6.5.3.1. Pro: Precious metals retain value precisely because they remain in high demand regardless of infrastructure or economic model. Cryptocurrencies assume an advanced, underlying technological infrastructure to serve their function, and therefore carry long-term risk which precious metals don't.
1.7.6.5.3.1.1. Pro: Cryptocurrencies will require some authoritative blockchain mechanism that can be reached from around the world.
1.7.6.5.4. Pro: Cryptocurrencies don't need a central entity like banks, VISA/Mastercard or PayPal to verify and mediate transactions.
1.7.6.6. Con: Holding and using any currency carries risk proportional to the trust in the central authority printing and accepting it. Bitcoin's "central authority" is the completely transparent and well-reviewed open source code at the core of its existence.
1.7.6.7. Pro: Bitcoin does not have the ability to ease or tighten in times of economic turmoil.
1.7.6.7.1. Con: This is a key feature of the currency, and helps eliminate one major source of inflation, namely a central government printing more currency.
1.7.6.7.2. Con: Money "ease" or "tighten" by themselves in times of economic change, it's called the price mechanism. The government interventions destroy that mechanism and make crises longer and frequent.
1.7.7. Pro: Handling and storing cryptocurrencies is less safe for ordinary consumers than traditional forms of electronic payment.
1.7.7.1. Con: A question of personal usage. Your cash is as secure as your wallet, so are bitcoins. You can make these more secure by your own means, you can not do so with all other forms of electronic payment. This differs from all other systems as the money is in your 'wallet' and under your control.
1.7.7.2. Con: Some cryptocurrencies, unlike other forms of payment, are anonymous and untraceable.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: Security does not require anonymity or untraceability.
1.7.7.2.1.1. Pro: Security, when talking about money transactions, does not mean that nobody can tell that you are paying someone, nor whom you are paying.
1.7.7.2.1.2. Pro: Security means that nobody unauthorized can manipulate, authorize or see your transactions.
1.7.7.2.2. Pro: Zcash is a cryptocurrency with a fully [private](https://hackernoon.com/how-private-are-privacy-coins-a-closer-look-at-zcash-and-zclassics-blockchains-32dae60d5b9f) transfer option.
1.7.7.2.3. Pro: [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) is a fully fungible, anonymous and untraceable cryptocurrency implementation.
1.7.7.2.4. Con: Untraceability can even be bad for security.
1.7.7.2.4.1. Pro: When cryptocurrencies are stolen, there is no hope of recovering them because the transactions are irreversible once confirmed by the network and added to the blockchain.
1.7.7.2.5. Con: Most cryptocurrencies are [traceable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6izhgw/eli5_how_traceable_are_transactions/) by design, and [not fully anonymous](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608716/bitcoin-transactions-arent-as-anonymous-as-everyone-hoped/) due to traceability.
1.7.7.3. Con: Online banking from a compromised system, such as a PC or a phone that has been hacked, is insecure as well.
1.7.7.4. Con: The bitcoin security system is based on an asymmetrical encryption: the ownership of bitcoins is protected through two keys. Through the private key every payer has to digitally sign every transaction. Then the user can spend digital money which is directly linked to a specific address. On top of that, the bitcoin network verifies the signature with their public key. In case of loss of the private key, no other evidence of ownership is possible.
1.7.7.5. Pro: Even service providers such as exchanges and wallet apps are not a secure way of holding cryptocurrency assets.
1.7.7.5.1. Pro: There have been a number of [major Bitcoin thefts.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83794.0)
1.7.7.5.1.1. Pro: [Bitcoin Savings & Trust](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Savings_%26_Trust) was a Ponzi scheme that cost its victims [265,678 bitcoins](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/a-brief-history-of-bitcoin-hacks-and-frauds/).
1.7.7.5.1.2. Pro: MyBitcoin had 78739 Bitcoins stolen.
1.7.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.2.4.1.
1.7.7.7. Pro: Even though we know to which bitcoin addresses large amounts of stolen bitcoins went, we cannot retrieve them.
1.7.7.7.1. Pro: [Flexcoin](http://flexcoin.com) shut down and all their account holder [lost their bitcoin holdings](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7339978).
1.7.7.8. Pro: Cryptocurrencies lack the standard consumer protections provided by banks.
1.7.7.8.1. Pro: For cryptocurrencies, there is no central institutional authority akin to a central bank that would provide deposit insurance, as is the case for ordinary banks. Thus if a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet app shuts down, all your assets will be lost.
1.7.7.8.1.1. Con: Even if these services necessary for using cryptocurrencies are less secure, this downgrade is voluntary.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1. Con: No sane person stores huge amounts of legally obtained cash at home either.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Cryptocurrencies are not designed for storing your savings and gaining interest.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There certainly could be a "bank" that would do traditional saving and lending and thus even give you interest on your cryptocurrency holdings.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The IRS [classifies](http://www.coindesk.com/irs-bitcoin-tax-guidelines-mean/) Bitcoins as an investment, rather than a currency, which means people have to pay capital gains tax on any profits derived from it.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Cryptocurrencies are a currency like any other currency and currencies are used as a store of value.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1.2. Con: Storing money at home is very common among old people.
1.7.7.8.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Some people store their money at home, because they do not trust the banking system. Especially in times of worldwide economic crises.
1.7.7.8.1.1.2. Con: Most people are not capable of storing anything of value securely on their computing devices.
1.7.7.8.1.1.2.1. Pro: Most people do not patch their software as often as required.
1.7.7.8.1.1.2.2. Pro: Most people use very unsecure software.
1.7.7.8.1.1.2.3. Pro: Many people can be tricked into installing trojans, which can then be used to steal the wallets stored on their computer.
1.7.7.8.1.1.2.4. Pro: Most people do not understand security mechanisms.
1.7.7.8.1.1.3. Con: It is less risky to use insecure devices for transactions with daily transaction limits, than being your own "bank", where in 1 second and without transaction limits, all your assets could be irrecoverably gone.
1.7.7.8.1.1.3.1. Pro: Banks can cancel transactions if you are quick enough.
1.7.7.8.1.1.3.2. Pro: Money can be traced through the banking system and often recovered.
1.7.7.8.1.1.3.3. Pro: When transferred via the banking system, money has to be sent to the account of a known entity. At least in the case of major criminal activities, governments will cooperate across borders on identifying senders and recipients.
1.7.7.8.1.1.3.4. Pro: Banks will stop fishy transactions or confirm with the account holder.
1.7.7.8.1.2. Con: Most people only use cryptocurrency exchanges to convert between currencies, which exposes their assets to those risks only for a short period of time.
1.7.7.8.1.2.1. Con: Even though they are called exchanges, people store significant amounts of cryptocurrencies on them.
1.7.7.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: Mt. Gox lost 850.000 Bitcoins, when the total amount of Bitcoins was just 11 million. It's unlikely that 10% of all Bitcoins were exchanged every day.
1.7.7.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.7.1.
1.7.7.8.1.4. Pro: [Mt Gox](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/02/mt-gox-once-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-exchange-shuts-down/) shut down and all their account holders lost their bitcoin holdings.
1.7.7.8.2. Pro: Banks normally have daily limits for your protection as to how much you can transfer per day. As of now, cryptocurrencies have none, so all your cryptocurrencies could be transferred maliciously or by mistake in the blink of a second.
1.7.7.8.3. Pro: When somebody steals your credit card data and uses it for himself, you as the credit card owner will, in most cases, not be liable for the damage and will get your money back.
1.7.7.8.3.1. Pro: Due to Bitcoins operating without third party there is also nobody who would pay you back in the case of abuse/theft.
1.7.7.9. Pro: Cryptocurrencies are much more desirable to steal than credit cards.
1.7.7.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.2.4.1.
1.7.7.9.2. Pro: It is very simple to transfer large amounts of cryptocurrency over large distances, which is very hard with cash.
1.7.7.9.2.1. Con: Transferring cryptocurrencies [takes time](https://coincentral.com/how-long-do-bitcoin-transfers-take/) and the associated fees can be [quite high](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/big-transactions-fees-are-a-problem-for-bitcoin.html).
1.7.7.9.2.2. Pro: The amount of value transferrable via cash payment is limited to physical constraints \(e.g. 10 million dollars in 100 dollar bills weigh approx. 100kg\).
1.7.7.9.2.3. Pro: Transferring large amounts of cash has a high risk of detection.
1.7.7.9.2.3.1. Pro: Only relatively small amounts of cash are allowed to be carried by individuals crossing borders.
1.7.7.9.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.9.2.2.
1.8. Pro: The Forward party supports [nonpartisan primaries](https://www.forwardparty.com/nonpartisan-primaries) as one of their platform objectives, [which is a valid reason to support them](https://www.kialo.com/we-should-use-nonpartisan-primaries-56087).
1.8.1. Con: The Forward Party's vision for non-partisan primaries incorporates [ranked-choice voting \(RCV\)](https://www.forwardparty.com/nonpartisan-primaries)(Note that this \[non-partisan primaries\] reform requires the implementation of Ranked-Choice Voting.). However, RCV is already something that both [Republicans and Democrats](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/why-republicans-moderates-see-opportunity-ranked-choice-voting-n1286250) get behind and is thus not unique to the Forward Party.
1.8.1.1. Con: The fact both Republicans and Democrats endorse RCV is good evidence that the Forward Party's platform is a uniting force, it's main goal.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See discussion #56087: We should use nonpartisan primaries. \(Background: they allow all candidates to run together in the same primary. All voters get a voice in who will run in the general election. The general removes the bottom candidates. Washington and California remove all but two for the general election\).
