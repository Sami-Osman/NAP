Discussion Name: Is it OK to Punch a Nazi?

1. It is okay to punch a Nazi.
1.1. Con: Legitimising political violence sets a bad precedent that could enable further political violence.
1.1.1. Pro: There is a risk that people may be falsely accused of being a Nazi and subjected to violence.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It is morally wrong to punish an innocent person.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Activists can make mistakes when figuring out who is guilty. Often activists lack the resources to conduct due process and ensure that all facts and rumors have been fairly evaluated before determining guilt.
1.1.1.3. Con: Far left anti Nazi activists have strong incentives to ensure that they only target genuine Nazis. Thus, it is unlikely that people who are not Nazis will be punched.
1.1.1.4. Pro: People may accuse those whom they dislike of being Nazis so they can get beaten up.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: This is true of any claim. People can falsely accuse someone of rape or being a fascist. But just like with self-defense laws, each case can be investigated on its own merits. People who punch someone who isn't a Nazi would still fall under assault and battery laws.
1.1.1.5. Con: Such false accusations and violence based on those accusations can be morally condemned and punished as a separate issue.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: This remedy is curative as opposed to preventative. The damage would have already been done.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Knowing that falsely accusing someone would be punishable, say in a civil suit, would serve as a deterrent.
1.1.1.6. Pro: The most publicised example of a "Nazi" being punched, [Richard Spencer](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/26/14369388/richard-spencer-punched-alt-right-trump), does not identify as a Nazi. If people with racist beliefs are punched for being "Nazis", then many people who aren't Nazis will be punched too.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: Most Nazis do not outwardly identify as Nazis. Richard Spencer has in many public occurrences demonstrated a political ideology indistinguishable from Fascism.
1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Spencer openly embraces the term "white supremacist" and calls for imperialism and the subjugation of other races.
1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Spencer [himself](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/richard-spencer-trump-alt-right-white-nationalist/) admits to the similarity between his own political ideals and those of the Fascist, and even admits wilful obfuscation of that fact: “If you looked at what I was doing, there was a clear interest in radical traditionalist right-wing German philosophy, a semi-fascist type thing \[...\] But there was always plausible deniability to it all.”
1.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Spencer took over the NPL with the explicit backing of conservative publisher William Regnery II - founder of a White Nationalist think tank, and publisher a racist and anti-semitic journal, whose grandfather bankrolled the America First Committee’s campaign against fighting Nazi Germany during World War II, and whose uncle founded the conservative Regnery Publishing, which is known for printing Ann Coulter’s books.
1.1.1.6.1.4. Pro: Spencer openly states that he believes in the genetic superiority of the white race, and [actively advocates](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/richard-spencer-u-s-military-should-have-enslaved-haitians-after-hurricane-instead-of-providing-relief/) for the enslavement of non-white races, the ethnic cleansing of racial minorities from the United States, and the ethnic cleansing of Turks from Anatolia.
1.1.1.6.1.5. Pro: Spencer has been [filmed](https://youtu.be/XLNLPIRS62g) performing a Nazi salute on two seperate occasions, as well as chanting Sieg Heil.
1.1.1.6.1.6. Pro: Spencer holds [traditionalist views](https://web.archive.org/web/20161126113832/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/25/the-alt-right-isnt-just-about-white-supremacy-its-about-white-male-supremacy/) regarding gender roles, believing that "women should never be allowed to make foreign policy", that "their vindictiveness knows no bounds", and that they should return to their traditional roles as childbearers and homemakers.
1.1.2. Pro: The legitimacy of violence against Nazis can be used as a justification for calling for the use of force against other groups.
1.1.2.1. Con: Nazis are uniquely evil. The justification for punching Nazis can thus not be easily extended to other examples.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Due to their status as the embodiment of evil in our political mythology, "Nazi" is commonly used as an insult for one's opponents, by itself or in compounds such as "feminazi". This provides a means to extend justification to violence against other ideologies.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If someone is truly misidentified as a Nazi, and another person then punches them in reliance on that misidentification, that latter person can be punished and morally condemned. This need not affect the question as it relates to true Nazis.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Unlike the US political and judicial bodies at large, Antifascist groups have an excellent track-record of attacking only those who fit the criteria of Fascists when later characterised by experts. No antifascist organisation targets individuals simply because they are referred to as Feminazis, or other Nazi-adjunct terminology.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: "Fascist" itself is a Nazi-adjacent term; Nazis are a subset of fascists and not all fascists are Nazis, so this is an example of extending justification of violence to other ideologies.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Nazis are merely one point on a continuum of evil, in which human tribalism is exploited to dehumanize opponents and justify atrocity, on the left and on the right. They deserve and should be subjected to no special exemption from the rules of civilized discourse.
1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.4. Pro: Such physical aggression could result in retaliatory action and possibly escalate the conflict.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Conflicts of identity are likely to elongate and become deadly.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: An attack on one individual because of their identity is likely to antagonize other individuals with the same identity.
1.1.4.2. Con: The punch is retaliatory action.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Nazis are usually punched as a response to them spreading their objectively bad ideology and the graphic, targeted violence that ideology promotes.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: The Nazi has most likely done nothing to you personally; therefore you are striking first.
1.1.5. Pro: The far left overuse and misapply the term Nazi. Thus it is certain that this proposal will result in people being subjected to violence who do not deserve it.
1.1.5.1. Con: When it comes to the application of violence, antifascist groups have significantly better track records than the political and judicial apparatus of the US.
1.1.6. Con: Even if it is a slippery slope, that is fine. There are other ideologies which are also harmful to society, and violence should be used against individuals who spread these ideas.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Individuals who spread racism, sexism and homophobia, regardless if they identify as a Nazi or not, deserve to be punched.
1.1.6.2. Pro: People who self identify as communists deserve to be punched.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Communism is responsible for the [deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes) of millions of people around the world.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: If a party does not explicitly call itself 'Capitalist', then the wars and tragedies initiated by it are deemed to have no relation to Capitalism. By the standard of evidence used to attribute deaths to Communism, nearly every post-Feudal political party that is not explicitly Communist would be considered Capitalist, and they are therefore guilty of far more deaths in total.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: The trans-Atlantic slave trade was driven by Capitalist Imperialism, and caused a [near-incalculable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Human_toll) number of deaths both directly and indirectly.
1.1.6.2.1.3. Con: Many of these deaths attributed to Communism have Capitalism to blame.
1.1.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: People who died due to famine in Holodomor are counted as 'killed by communism', despite Western countries' [trade blockade](http://orientalreview.org/2012/12/17/episodes-10-who-organised-famine-in-the-ussr-in-1932-1933/) against USSR which prevented them from exporting anything but their grain to be able to buy industrial machinery. The famine would not have occurred without this blockade, and the Communist government did everything in its' power to rectify the famine by implementing [rationing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_and_famines_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union) across entire country to help the regions with famine.
1.1.6.2.1.3.2. Pro: U.S. military interventionism has always been a threat to developing Communist nations, consistently forcing them to rapidly militarise which promotes authoritarian tendencies in these regimes. It seems strange to blame Communism for these deaths when not one of these massacres were perpetrated by a stateless society such a Communism aims to create, but by an authoritarian one, such as they were steered into by Capitalist pressures.
1.1.6.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The United States directly [facilitated](https://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/telegrams-confirm-scale-of-us-complicity-in-1965-genocide/) and [supported](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/10/20/uncovering-indonesias-act-of-killing/) the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s.
1.1.6.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: [The Bay of Pigs invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion) and [many assassination attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro) were specifically orchestrated and facilitated by the CIA as an attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro to stop the spread of Leftism.
1.1.6.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: [The 1953 Iranian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#United_States'_role) was at least partially organised and carried out by the CIA under Eisenhower out of fear that Mosaddegh would institute communism.
1.1.6.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: In 1964, the US government [supplied and supported](http://www.dominionpaper.ca/international_news/2004/04/06/us_role_in.html) members of the Brazilian Armed Forces in the overthrowing of referendum-elected President João Goulart as a "socialist threat".
1.1.6.2.1.3.3. Pro: It is difficult to attribute these deaths directly to Communism in the first place, since none of them were stateless, classless, or moneyless societies \(such as is the end-goal of Communism\), most had significant private sectors \(thus were not Socialist\), and many had a strong hierarchically-structured government \(thus were not Anarchist\).
1.1.6.2.1.4. Con: Capitalism too is responsible for the [deaths](https://medium.com/\@comradefinnegan/socialism-vs-capitalism-death-toll-d19b6187444c) of millions of people around the world.
1.1.6.2.1.4.1. Pro: The [death toll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/71282b/i_made_a_post_that_can_be_linked_to_whenever/dn8jw5o/) of Capitalism is rarely attributed to it. Communist and capitalist parties exist, but if a party does not call itself 'capitalist', then the wars and tragedies initiated by these parties are deemed to have no relation to capitalism. By the standard of evidence you use to attribute deaths to communism, nearly every post-Feudal political party that is not explicitly communist is capitalist, and they are therefore guilty of far more deaths in total.
1.1.6.2.1.4.2. Pro: King Leopold II's Imperialist rule of Congo, which was expressly Capitalistic, killed 10 million Africans.
1.1.6.2.1.4.3. Pro: The amount of deaths caused both directly and indirectly by the trans-Atlantic slave trade is [near-incalculable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Human_toll).
1.1.6.2.1.4.4. Pro: The Imperialistic Capitalist exploitation of India caused up to [35 million](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/inglorious-empire-what-the-british-did-to-india-1.2981299) Indians to die in needless famines as millions of tonnes of wheat were exported to Britain in times of starvation.
1.1.6.2.1.4.5. Pro: Even considering Maoist China, where most of these attributed deaths come from, China & India had the same life expectancy until after the Chinese revolution. By 1979, Maoist China had a life expectancy of more than 14 years longer than India. The excess in mortality of India over China was about [4 million lives a year](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Sen2006.pdf). Comparing this to [Amartya Sen's estimation](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/opinion/why-india-trails-china.html) that 23-30 million people died during the revolution, after 5.75-7.5 years, Capitalism had caused more deaths by proxy.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Individuals who seek to limit women's reproductive rights deserve to be punched.
1.1.6.4. Con: The spread of violence in society will result in a more polarized and toxic political environment.
1.2. Pro: By using violence against Nazis, we can reduce the number of people who become Nazis.
1.2.1. Con: Punching a person is not an extreme enough of a measure to change their ideology.
1.2.1.1. Con: Making an example of an individual can help change other peoples minds.
1.2.2. Con: People might not be overtly Nazi if they fear getting punched but they will still believe in the ideology.
1.2.2.1. Con: Then they will be silent and inactive, which is good.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Nazis would be disinclined to meet people other than fellow Nazis, reaffirm their beliefs, and become more extreme.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: If they continue to not profess their ideology or act on it, then their increased internal extremism has no real effect.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The threat of violence would disincentivise Nazis from congregating and reaffirming their beliefs since there is a potential of them being overheard, whereas it would do nothing to prevent them from having social relationships with other people, so long as they keep their Fascist beliefs to themselves.
1.2.2.2. Con: The point with disrupting Nazi and fascist activities with violence or other means is mainly to keep them from organizing further which, when coupled with de-platforming, will hurt their recruitment process.
1.2.3. Pro: The use of violence is a powerful reminder to the rest of society that Nazi ideology is not tolerable.
1.2.3.1. Pro: It would still be unacceptable to use violence against any other political ideology. Thus, by using violence against Nazis only, a clear message is sent out that Nazism is uniquely despicable.
1.2.4. Pro: A public show of force can be used tactically to prevent a Nazi from inspiring others to their ideology.
1.2.5. Pro: Human beings dislike being subjected to violence. Thus, the threat of violence will deter people from becoming Nazis.
1.2.6. Pro: There are a number of historical case studies which demonstrate that the use of violence reduces the number of people who become Nazis.
1.2.6.1. Pro: During the battle of Lewisham, the use of violence by anti fascist protesters reduced support for the [National Front](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/13/battle-of-lewisham-national-front-1977-far-right-london-police).
1.2.7. Con: Recourse to physical violence rather than to debate suggests the perpetrator lacks the intellectual capacity, or a sufficiently good argument to prevail in a debate. Opposition to a position, when this opposition is championed by people who are demonstrably violent, as well as either wrong or stupid, is all things being equal, likely to discourage others from aligning or joining with the opposition.
1.2.8. Con: Using violence against Nazis is counterproductive .
1.2.8.1. Con: World war II is highlighted by violence against fascists and was successful in eliminating the fascist violence of nazi germany and fascist Italy.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Concerted efforts by military powers to wage war on fascist govornments put an end to genocide and fascist state oppression.
1.2.8.1.2. Pro: [Grass roots actions](https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/fr/document/general-chronology-nazi-violence) to combat state fascism played a big role in the final days of Mussolini's government as well as in the resistance against Hitler's Nazi Germany and the fascist public supporting those leaders.
1.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.8.3. Pro: Using violence against Nazis led to their rise. Continued violence is likely to create more Nazis.
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: [In the Weimar Republic](https://www.facinghistory.org/weimar-republic-fragility-democracy/readings/weimar-political-parties) The National Socialist Worker Party initially fought against Communists and Socialists [who where consistently striking and fighting other German parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Weimar_Republic). They came off looking like the good guys as they where fighting against the aggressors.
1.2.8.3.1.1. Con: While this may be part of the origins of the Nazis, punching is a reaction to Nazis, not something Nazis rebel against from the start.
1.2.8.3.2. Pro: Regardless of what is right or wrong, a person who resorts to violence first, in a civilized society, will be regarded negatively and as the aggressors.
1.2.8.3.3. Con: Appeasement politics is widely regarded as a key contributing factor to the rise of Nazism prior to WWII. Violence largely is what quelled Nazi propagation globally.
1.2.8.4. Pro: The use of violence allows Nazis to portray themselves as 'victims', thereby increasing long-term support for them. It makes more people sympathetic towards Nazis.
1.2.8.4.1. Pro: Right-wing media is likely to use this opportunity to vilify the left.
1.2.8.4.1.1. Con: Right-wing media will do and use anything it can to vilify the left. There's no reason that should bar the left from resisting objectively horrible beliefs and actions.
1.2.8.4.2. Con: Nazis will do this regardless of any actions taken against them.
1.2.8.4.2.1. Pro: The framing of the establishment of a white ethnostate as protection against ['white genocide'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_genocide_conspiracy_theory) is a clear example of this.
1.2.8.4.3. Pro: [Violent confrontations](https://theconversation.com/how-should-we-protest-neo-nazis-lessons-from-german-history-82645) with anti-fascists \(e.g., in Wedding\) gave the National Socialists the chance in the 1920s and 30s to profile themselves as victims of the left.
1.2.8.4.4. Pro: An image of a Nazi being attacked by a member of the Far left can be used as propaganda. It can be used to argue that the far left are unable to defeat the arguments Nazis' have, and instead have to resort to violence.
1.2.8.4.4.1. Pro: Additionally, attacked Nazis can argue that the far left is radical and dangerous fueling fears in the general population thereby.
1.2.8.5. Pro: These people provoke others intentionally so using violence against them makes them the winners.
1.2.8.5.1. Pro: The Nazis deliberately choose provocative marching routes, and chant provocative slogans so that they can encourage far left protesters to get into fights with them.
1.2.8.5.2. Pro: The Nazis want to be subjected to violence because it results in them getting more media coverage.
1.2.8.5.2.1. Con: If violence against Nazis is normalised, it will not result in increased media coverage.
1.2.8.6. Pro: Instead of reducing the number of Nazis, this practice will separate them from the rest of society cementing their beliefs.
1.2.8.6.1. Con: For the most part, people who have become and are Nazis are likely already cemented in their beliefs.
1.2.8.7. Pro: Violence breeds violence.
1.2.8.7.1. Con: The parent impliedly lays fault at the feet of the punchers or would-be punchers as starting the violence, which results in more violence. But it's really the other way around- Nazis have and continue to commit violence, which is why they get punched.
1.2.8.7.2. Pro: [A study found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124247/) that children who were exposed to higher levels of violence had higher rates of adolescent conduct problems than those who experienced less violence.
1.2.8.8. Pro: Historically, the actual Nazis relied on fears of communist violence to seize power, most famously when they [capitalised on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree) the [Reichstag fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire).
1.3. Con: The use of violence against a Nazi is immoral.
1.3.1. Pro: Authorizing violence against a minority group for ideological reasons is a very Nazi-like thing to do.
1.3.1.1. Con: Nazis are not the same as those groups against whom they authorize violence. Thus, authorizing minor violence against Nazis is not Nazi-like.
1.3.1.2. Con: Nazis advocate violence based on immutable and/or unchosen characteristics of the people they target \(race, sexuality, cultural heritage, phenotype, etc\). Advocating violence towards someone because of their beliefs and the damage those beliefs cause is not comparable, since people choose to have those beliefs.
1.3.2. Pro: Every person has [human dignity](https://cbhd.org/category/issues/human-dignity). Punching someone on the basis of their beliefs is a violation of it.
1.3.2.1. Con: Tolerating intolerant beliefs allows for the spread of intolerant beliefs which can transform a tolerant society into an intolerant one. Disregarding an intolerant groups dignity to ensure the protection of the human dignity of other groups can protect against the erosion of a tolerant society.
1.3.2.2. Con: Punching a Nazi is not punching them on just the "basis of their beliefs," but an opposition to their mission of destroying minorities.
1.3.2.3. Con: Nazis are a strong exclusion from this generalization.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: [The Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_war_crimes#World_War_II) committed atrocious war crimes and crimes against humanity, causing millions of deaths.
1.3.2.4. Con: Not all beliefs are equal. The Nazi belief is to remove human dignity from others. Accepting that belief undermines the very point of tolerating others based on their beliefs or claiming that everyone has human dignity. Since being a Nazi implies that one does not respect the dignity of others, it would follow that Nazis' dignity should not respected either.
1.3.3. Con: There are instances where punching a Nazi is morally acceptable, right, or even necessary.
1.3.3.1. Pro: It is morally right to punch a Nazi in order to stop violence and harm.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Unless the punch is hard enough to injure the Nazi, it will still be physically possible for them to commit violence.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Nazis may be punched if they attacked first \(self-defense\).
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Self-defense is not a good excuse to incite more violence, as it's better not to feed into the behavior \(two wrongs don't make a right\).
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: The use of violence against Nazis puts people on a similar level to them.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Considering that the original Nazis carried out mass genocide, a mere punch is pretty proportional to active adherence and promotion of Nazi ideology.
1.3.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: We want to punch Nazis because they’re bad; we would be the bad ones in a scenario where we punch a Nazi.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Con: Self-defense is not an attempt to incite violence, it is an attempt to bring violence already occurring from continuing.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Legally, in places like [Connecticut](https://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2011/title53a/chap951/Sec53a-19.html), if a person responds to an initial [aggressor](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/aggressor) \(who lets them know they're withdrawing\) by threatening about or continuing with violence, then the initial aggressor is allowed to use physical force at that moment. Even if this self-defense isn't meant to incite violence, it does it anyway by continuing it \(especially by 'opening up the door' for it legally\).
1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: According to the [Connecticut penal code](https://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2011/title53a/chap951/Sec53a-19.html) on self-defense, "A person is not justified in using physical force when with intent to cause physical injury or death to another person, he provokes the use of physical force by such other person".
1.3.3.2.1.3.1. Con: If self-defense is found, as assumed by the grandparent to this claim, the person is by definition not provoking the use of physical force by the other person.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: The best self defense is avoiding being attacked to begin with \(through avoidance, shielding oneself, increase security, etc.\).
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: Avoidance is supported by “[duty to retreat](https://aliengearholsters.com/blog/duty-to-retreat-or-castle-doctrine/)" laws, where people [avoid violence first when they're able to do so](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+S.U.+L.+Rev.+1&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=c8e62408a82a0d3f25ed6de2b30731fe). This would apply to where someone would punch someone else \(unless it's lethal \(i.e. imminent danger'\) or an inescapable place, where 'no duty to retreat' applies\).
1.3.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The [duty to retreat](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-law-basics/self-defense-overview.html) applies to the use of lethal force. A punch is not lethal.
1.3.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: Avoidance is supported by laws if punching back is deadly, where a person could [retreat first or comply 'with a demand'](https://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2011/title53a/chap951/Sec53a-19.html) to not act if they're safely able to do so.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Lethal violence should only be used as a last resort.
1.3.4. Con: Violence might be the only possible solution when an individual seeks to defend themselves from an attack by a Nazi.
1.3.5. Pro: It is problematic to use violence against a non-violent citizen.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The only acceptable violence is in self-defense or the defense of others. Harming someone for ideas or words makes the attacker the one who should be stopped.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Nazism is inherently threatening to large numbers of people. Merely punching them, then, is an act of self-defense and defense of others.
1.3.5.2. Pro: If non-violence is preferable to violence, then non-violent solutions are preferable to violent ones \(for non-violent issues such as unwanted words or beliefs\).
1.3.5.3. Pro: Using violence to settle non-violent issues is a dangerous precedent.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: Nazism is a "violent issue."
1.3.5.4. Con: Nazis are inherently violent.
1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.3.7. Con: Punching a Nazi can be seen as a mark of courage and protest against evil.
1.3.7.1. Pro: A society that collectively punches Nazis may gain positive international reputation.
1.3.7.2. Con: There are other ways to protest Nazism that do not involve violence.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: An effective non-violent way is to sue the Nazis wherever possible.
1.3.7.2.1.1. Pro: A 'Unite the Right' rally was successfully contained by using Virginia’s anti-paramilitary laws and [filing a lawsuit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/this-legal-tactic-can-keep-neo-nazi-protests-out-of-your-city/2018/08/10/c80bc240-9c07-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html).
1.3.7.2.2. Pro: The group 'Hope Not Hate' successfully [infiltrated](https://qz.com/1084248/hope-not-hate-is-taking-the-fight-against-the-international-alt-right-to-the-us/) the alt-right \(BNP\) in the UK both online and in-person and disclosed their ideas, convictions, and plans. As a result, they lost a large number of followers.
1.3.8. Pro: Ultimately, it is society's fault that Nazis exist. If it made more of an effort to engage with those who are alienated from the political process, such as the white working class, there would be fewer Nazis.
1.3.8.1. Con: Blaming the general public for the ignorance and violence of individuals who follow fascist ideology ignores the capacity of adults to own their beliefs and infantalises the fascists.
1.3.8.2. Pro: In the 1930th, [economic depression and social dislocation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/12/these-are-the-three-reasons-that-fascism-spread-in-1930s-america-and-might-spread-again-today/) helped fascism spread in the US.
1.3.8.3. Con: Engaging legitimate problems doesn't require people in any way to become a Nazi. Those who would be Nazis can work on legitimate problems without becoming Nazis. Therefore, becoming a Nazi is an active choice they make without a good reason.
1.3.8.4. Pro: Vulnerabilities in the system create opportunities for such behavior, so preventing or filling these voids would prevent problems from emerging \(or getting bigger\).
1.3.8.5. Con: Working to engage the politically alienated and punching Nazis are not mutually exclusive.
1.4. Pro: Alternative methods of physical social reprimand might be wasteful.
1.4.1. Pro: Throwing a milkshake wastes good ice cream.
1.4.1.1. Con: It could be argued that effecting social change for the betterment of both society at large, and especially the most vulnerable members of that society is a very good use for ice cream, and not a waste at all.
1.4.1.2. Con: If the milkshake didn't taste good, throwing it at a Nazi wouldn't be a waste.
1.4.2. Pro: Cracking an egg on their head wastes a good egg.
1.4.2.1. Con: You can use eggs that went bad, thus giving a use to something that would be thrown away.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: There are [easy ways](https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/tell-if-your-expired-eggs-are-still-good-eat-0154309/) to determine if an egg is still good to eat or spoiled.
1.4.3. Con: When it comes to tackling Nazis, the most effective and not the cheapest method should be chosen.
1.5. Con: Punching can seriously hurt the puncher's hand.
1.5.1. Con: Nazi punchers could wear boxing gloves.
1.5.2. Con: If a person punches with their [knuckles](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-throw-a-punch-correctly-5829523) instead of the flats of their fingers, they are unlikely to get hurt.
1.6. Pro: Nazis deserve to pay for the crimes they committed.
1.6.1. Con: Nazi ideology doesn't automatically convert into Nazi action. [John Rabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rabe), for example, was a Nazi party member but saved countless lifes during the Japanese Massacre of Nanjing.
1.6.1.1. Pro: [Oskar Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler) was a member of the Nazi Party who is credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Someone in the Nazi party who acted against fascist actions cannot be considered a fully convinced fascist.
1.6.1.2. Con: Fascist will work with out-groups if it benefits them at the time. The Germans and Japanese were both nationalist countries and benefited from being ally's. A sort of - the enemy of my enemy is my friend - attitude.
1.6.2. Con: Present day Nazis have not committed the same atrocities as Nazis in the past. Therefore, they should not have to pay for such things.
1.6.2.1. Con: They have not committed those crimes; however, they worship those who did.
1.6.2.2. Con: The Nazis who are around today aim to commit the same level of crimes as Nazis from the past.
1.6.2.3. Con: Even if the crimes they have committed are not on the same scale, the crimes they have committed are still evil.
1.6.3. Con: The best way to make Nazis pay for crimes which they have committed is via the legal system.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Allowing/tolerating to punch a Nazi violates the rule of law.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: In many countries, for example in the United States, it is illegal to commit physical violence against someone because they said something you don't like, even if the vast majority believe that what they said is evil.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Nazis do not merely "say something you don't like," they advocate the destruction of large swaths of people.
1.6.3.1.1.2. Con: Illegality is not a valid moral argument. Where a law is immoral, we have a moral obligation to disobey it. Plenty of horrific and immoral acts have been enshrined in law, and only through civil disobedience were these remedied.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: The prosecutor, the judge, and the executor will be the same person.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Con: Nazis have already been judged and "prosecuted," so really the punching individual is only a minor executor.
1.6.3.1.3. Pro: Allowing/tolerating to punch a Nazi violates equality before the law.
1.6.3.1.3.1. Con: Self-defence is enshrined in the law, and since Nazism, by its nature, provides a credible threat to a person or groups continued survival, it is a perfectly valid and equitable application of that law to employ violence against them.
1.6.3.1.4. Pro: Punching a person without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves \(verbally\) violates the presumption of innocence.
1.6.3.1.4.1. Con: Fascists weaponise the presumption of innocence to protect themselves as they spread hatefull messages.
1.6.3.1.4.2. Con: Demanding that each individual be given the opportunity to defend Nazism before violence can be advocated against them, what you’re actually suggesting is that vulnerable minorities should have to endlessly argue for the right to exist and that at no point should the calm and rational argumentation be considered over and won.
1.6.3.1.4.2.1. Con: It is not about defending Nazism, but about defending oneself from being accused of being a Nazi.
1.6.3.1.4.2.1.1. Con: One does not have a right to defend themselves from accusations of being a Nazi when they are espousing Nazi views, which is when they are punched.
1.6.3.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: One could be falsely denunciated in order to get punched.
1.6.3.1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: A bystander could be seen \(or photographed\) by mistake with a group of Nazis.
1.6.3.1.5. Con: The law does not always indicate what the moral course of action is.
1.6.3.1.6. Pro: Physical punishment is the responsibility of government system, not regular citizens.
1.6.3.1.6.1. Con: The government is meant to manifest the will of the people. Where it fails to do so, it is an unrepresentative government, and illegitimate. To grant a monopoly over violence to any state is a risky proposition already; to grant a monopoly over violence to an illegitimate and unrepresentative one is a recipe for disaster.
1.6.3.1.7. Pro: Punching someone without any reason is prohibited
1.6.3.1.7.1. Pro: Being a Nazi is not in and of itself a crime. Citizens shouldn't be punished for thoughts and ideas which they may believe. They should only be punished for crimes which they have committed.
1.6.3.1.7.1.1. Con: Nazis are generally only punched after they have revealed themselves to be Nazis, at which point they are advocating the Nazi beliefs.
1.6.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con: [Advocating nazi beliefs is not a crime.](https://www.tctimes.com/news/it-s-legal-to-be-a-nazi/article_160c9562-877a-11e7-90b0-df331bd4e744.html) There are dozens of websites where people go can and do that, e.g .[Stormfront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_\(website\)), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAltRight/), and [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neo-Nazi_websites).
1.6.3.1.7.1.2. Con: [Preventive policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_police) is common practice in many countries. A crime does not have to be committed to be stopped by the police, only proven planned or likely to happen. Being a Nazi is a good indicator that the person is going to commit crimes.
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1. Con: [Planning to commit a crime is itself a crime.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_\(criminal\)) They are punished for committing 'conspiracy' ; They are not punished for their thoughts/ideas/identity. Therefore, preventative policing doesn't disprove the concept that one must have committed a crime to be violently stopped by police.
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Nazism is an agreement to commit certain crimes. At the point when a Nazi is punched, they are generally promoting those crimes, thus taking a further step toward committing those crimes. Therefore, they are not being punished for their "thoughts/ideas/identity."
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Identifying as a Nazi does not equate to promoting the Nazi ideology.
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: People could be born into a Nazi family and have to taken on that identity. It doesn't necessarily follow that they promote it.
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Being born into a Nazi family, and not espousing those beliefs oneself is never used as justification for the advocacy of violence against an individual by antifascist organisations.
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: If asked, they could say we identify as a Nazi but don't go on justifying Nazism.
1.6.3.1.7.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Identifying oneself as a Nazi implies that one supports Nazism, so identifying as a Nazi is necessarily promoting the Nazi ideology.
1.6.3.1.7.1.3. Con: The possession and display of objects and symbols related to National Socialism are subject to legal regulations.
1.6.3.1.7.1.3.1. Pro: The use of[flags from the German Third Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post–World_War_II_legality_of_Nazi_flags) is currently subject to legal restrictions in numerous countries.
1.6.3.1.7.2. Con: The reason they are being punched is because they have chosen to become a Nazi.
1.6.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: Nazis are extremist and by that virtue needs to be punched.
1.6.3.1.7.2.1.1. Con: If all extremist needs to be punched then also those on the left, single issue extremists and religious extremists need to be punched.
1.6.3.1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Punching the Pope because he is a religious extremist would be hard to justify.
1.6.3.1.7.2.2. Pro: Nazi ideology poisons a society and carriers need to be punched to fight these negative side effects.
1.6.3.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Many ideological orientations create negative externalities, such as capitalism. Still, we don't justify punching capitalists.
1.6.3.1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: The damage caused by Capitalists can be more effectively combatted through redistributing their profits and the restructuring of the workplace; where such efforts are resisted, plenty of groups do advocate for violent revolution, and/or violent action by groups harmed by them. The damage caused by Nazis can be combatted through the renunciation of their beliefs and conversion; where such efforts are resisted, violence against them, from the people they actively harm is justifiable.
1.6.3.1.7.2.3. Con: Often, children are influenced by their parents to become Nazis \(e.g., [here](https://www.dw.com/en/how-neo-nazis-bring-up-their-children/a-48638756-0)\). Those have not decided \(deliberately\) to become Nazis.
1.6.3.1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Children can be born into a Nazi household and indoctrinated to become Nazis.
1.6.3.1.7.2.3.1.1. Con: When children age, they have more distance from their parents and agency to decide which ideology they wish to espouse.
1.6.3.1.7.2.3.1.2. Pro: Parents are likely to scold the child or, in extreme cases, beat them up if the child's ideology differs from theirs.
1.6.3.1.7.2.4. Pro: Society makes it clear to all individuals that Nazi ideology is evil. If an individual chooses to ignore what they have learned in school and from society about the evils of Nazism, they deserve to be punched.
1.6.3.2. Con: The legal system is institutionally racist and does not do enough to punish Nazis.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.6.3.1.7.1.
1.6.5. Con: There is no available information on current Nazis and whether or not they've committed crimes.
1.6.5.1. Con: There is plenty of well-documented information on right-wing extremism and violence in America, much of which directly cites and refers to Neo-Nazi groups.
1.6.6. Pro: Present day Nazis seek to promote [holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial), this is a crime.
1.6.7. Pro: Nazi groups encourage their members to commit attacks against members of the LGBT community and ethnic minorities.
1.6.7.1. Pro: In June 2019, a group of [neo-Nazis](https://www.timesofisrael.com/neo-nazis-sought-gay-pride-event-violence-detroit-police-chief-says/) provoked and intimidated a Gay Pride event in Detroit.
1.6.8. Pro: Every Nazi is complicit in the perpetuation of an ideology which directly results in crimes being committed against the most vulnerable in society.
1.6.9. Con: Many people who join Neo Nazi parties are convinced that these groups are modern respectable political parties. They are unaware of their hateful ideology.
1.6.9.1. Con: Even if an individual is unaware of the Nazi's hateful policies, by being a member, they are still complicit in legitimizing the organisation and helping to further its appeal.
1.6.10. Pro: Nazis commit hate crimes which inflict suffering onto entire communities. They deserve to suffer for these crimes.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Since hate crimes cause a larger scale of harms compared to crimes which are not hate crimes, it is more justified to use violence against those who commit hate crimes.
1.7. Pro: Someone who promotes an inhumane ideology that stands for crimes against humanity should be reprimanded.
1.7.1. Con: Responses need to adhere to the [proportionality principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(law\)). It is unproportional to answer the promotion of violence with immediate violence.
1.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.1.
1.7.2. Pro: The Nazis oppose [LGBT rights](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/gay-men-under-the-nazi-regime), [immigration](https://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-10-2-a-united-states-immigration-policy-and-hitler-s-holocaust), minority rights, [women's rights](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxb8msg/revision/1), and democracy. Their ideology is repugnant and must be opposed.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.7.4. Con: Ideas aren't crimes; actions are. There is a line between motive and deed, and that line should always be observed. Not doing so perpetuates one of the crimes that Nazis comitted in the past.
1.8. Con: Some Nazis may know a form of self defense, making it painful for you if you were to punch them.
1.9. Con: Punching Nazis violates the principles of liberal democracy.
1.9.1. Con: This action should not be judged based on what is permissible in a liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is not the only form of democracy, people who believe in direct democracy, anarchism, or democratic socialism might disagree with liberal democracy.
1.9.2. Pro: Disputes should be resolved using democratic institutions, such as courts, as opposed to resorting to violence.
1.9.2.1. Con: Democratic institutions effectiveness in dealing with Nazis may be undermined in certain circumstances.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: If the institution has been [compromised](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement) by Nazis or Nazism.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: A sufficiently democratic institution is transparent to enough of a degree that Nazis wouldn't be able to infiltrate without being exposed to the public.
1.9.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The public can not force Nazis to resign; Only courts or parliamentary boards can do that.
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: The institution is bogged down by such bureaucracy that punitive or restorative actions are not taken on an individual who exerts coercive behavior to enact the results of these beliefs.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.9.4. Pro: Freedom of speech is essential in a democracy.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Punching a Nazi is an act of trying to silence free speech, which is prohibited.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: Nazis remain free to continue their "speech" during, before, and after they've been punched. They're just subject to criticism that's aggressive proportionate to their "speech."
1.9.4.2. Con: Nazism incites violence, therefore it is reasonable to prohibit it.
1.9.4.3. Con: If the Nazis came to power they would eradicate freedom of speech. In order to prevent this occurring, it is legitimate to use violence against Nazis.
1.9.4.4. Con: Not all acts of speech should be equally valued. Certain kinds of speech are harmful and should be censored.
1.9.4.4.1. Pro: Speech acts which encourage violence should be censored.
1.9.4.5. Pro: It is important that people who sympathize with Nazis feel empowered to articulate their concerns. If they censor themselves because they fear violence, the rest of society will never get the chance to debate them and disprove their ideology.
1.9.4.5.1. Con: The Nazi ideology has already been disproven on a global scale.
1.9.4.6. Pro: Penalizing and sanctioning free speech and freedom of expression is a typical feature of [authoritarian regimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism).
1.9.4.6.1. Con: A measured and balanced approach to the restriction of free speech is a typical feature of all successful modern Democracies.
1.9.4.6.1.1. Pro: There is not a single nation on Earth which practices free speech absolutism. Such a position would necessitate the disassembly of False advertising, Fraud, Blackmail, Copyright infringement, Insider trading, Confidential medical information, Incitement to violence, Threat, Incitement to panic, Perjury, Privileged conversation, Libel, slander, and defamation laws, and would necessitate the wholesale revealing of operational military information on an international level.
1.9.4.7. Con: Freedom of speech is not essential in a democracy, in practice no democracy has freedom of speech in an absolute sense.
1.9.4.7.1. Pro: Companies or individuals which engage in fraud or which falsely advertise their products are subject to penalties.
1.9.4.7.2. Pro: Copyright infringement is subject to legal penalties.
1.9.4.7.3. Pro: Persons who release or disseminate Confidential medical information, or who release the detailed of a privileged conversation \(such as one undertaken through attorney/client privilege\) face legal consequences.
1.9.4.7.4. Pro: The revealing of operational military information to any unauthorised party is a criminal offence.
1.9.4.7.5. Pro: Perjury before a court is a crime.
1.9.4.7.6. Pro: Individuals who threaten or incite violence with their words face arrest.
1.9.4.7.7. Pro: News media is subjected to fines and various punitive actions for spreading lies and defamation.
1.9.5. Con: Nazis are inherently undemocratic.
1.9.5.1. Pro: The Nazis once removed a democracy \([the Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic)\).
1.9.5.2. Pro: The '[Führerprinzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Führerprinzip),' which means that the Führer's word is above all written law, is a crucial factor of the National Socialism.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
