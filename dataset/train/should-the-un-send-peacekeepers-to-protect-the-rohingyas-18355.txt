Discussion Name: Should the UN send peacekeepers to protect the Rohingyas?

1. The UN should send peacekeepers to protect the Rohingyas.
1.1. Con: There is no legal basis for the UN to act in regard to the Rohingya question.
1.1.1. Pro: The Rohingya problem is not threatening international peace and security as specified in [Art 1 of the UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html).
1.1.1.1. Con: Myanmar's government has violated the[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.](http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf)Therefore, there are grounds for a UN intervention in accordance with Article 1.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The Rohingya problem is threatening peace and security throughout the Asian region.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: An estimated [25,000 Rohingya people](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/rohingya-crisis-can-destabilise-region-if-not-solved-bangla-prez-119061600240_1.html) have crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which can put serious strain on these countries.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: These countries are [already struggling](https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2019/06/15/rohingya-crisis-could-destabilise-the-region-warns-president-hamid) to deal with regional issues such as violent extremism, international terrorism, and forced migration.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: There are nearly 700,000 Rohingya [refugees](https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/bangladesh_100945.html) in Bangladesh with nowhere to go. This could easily strain Bangladesh's society and economy.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Bangladesh is currently struggling to cope with over [909,000](https://www.unocha.org/rohingya-refugee-crisis) stateless Rohingya refugees that are residing in camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas.
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The majority of these refugees live in [34 extremely congested](https://www.unocha.org/rohingya-refugee-crisis) camps.
1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Nearly [25%](https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/bangladesh/rohingya-refugee-crisis-quick-facts) of all Rohingya refugee children living in the camps are malnourished.
1.1.1.3. Con: The Rohingya problem is contributing to terrorist propaganda and the growth of terrorist organisations - which does threaten international peace and security. [The Rohingya Crisis: Regional Security Implications](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/41985)
1.1.2. Con: The UN has a legal [responsibility to protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect).
1.1.2.1. Pro: UN member states have a [legal responsibility](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/about-responsibility-to-protect.shtml) to protect populations if they are facing severe human rights violations such as ethnic cleansing and genocide, which are occurring currently in Myanmar.
1.1.2.2. Con: The responsibility to protect isn't a legal responsibility but a political committment.
1.2. Con: China is supportive of Myanmar. Any intervention will lack their support, and may turn China against the UN.
1.2.1. Pro: China has continuously protected Myanmar from [sanctions](https://www.usip.org/publications/2018/09/chinas-role-myanmars-internal-conflicts) at the hands of the United Nations.
1.2.2. Pro: China has [special economic interests](https://www.usip.org/publications/2018/09/chinas-role-myanmars-internal-conflicts) in Myanmar, and is unlikely to go against the same.
1.2.2.1. Pro: China has [extensive economic interests in Rakhine](https://www.usip.org/publications/2018/09/chinas-role-myanmars-internal-conflicts), including a major port at Kyaukphyu, a planned special economic zone \(SEZ\), and a road, rail, and pipeline network to move energy and other materials and supplies from the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar to Yunnan Province.
1.2.3. Pro: China has recently [proposed](https://www.mmtimes.com/news/china-proposals-new-infrastructure-projects-myanmar.html) a set of infrastructure projects and special economic zones in Myanmar and it is a key part of the Belt and Road Initiative.
1.2.4. Con: China has much more important interests than Myanmar to risk damaging its reputation at the UN over the Rohingya issue.
1.2.5. Con: China's government is a permanent member of the Security Council with [veto powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power) so a UN intervention cannot actually be done if they are strongly opposed.
1.3. Pro: The UN can prevent the Rohingya crisis from destabilizing the entire region.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.3.2. Con: Putting pressure on Myanmar to look after these refugees properly would also solve this issue.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The International Court of Justice has [recently demanded](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-genocide.html) that Myanmar protects the Rohingya population and ordered that they report back regularly on the steps they have taken to do so.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.3.4. Con: The region is already destabilized. Fixing all of its problems would be prohibitively costly and time consuming.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The UN Peacekeeping department is [its most expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/un-united-nations-peacekeepers-rwanda-bosnia) one, so its resources and efforts should not be wasted in trying to resolve a conflict that is unlikely to be resolved.
1.4. Pro: Genocide should always be opposed.
1.4.1. Con: The UN was wrong to [label](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/24/rohingya-genocide-is-still-going-on-says-top-un-investigator) the situation as genocide.
1.4.1.1. Con: Myanmar military’s atrocities in Rakhine State against Rohingya Muslims [violates](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/12/10/myanmar-hearings-begin-genocide-case) the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and is thus correctly labelled as a genocide situation.
1.4.1.2. Con: The genocide was [meticulously](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45341112) researched and documented.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Whilst Myanmar has used disproportionate force and committed a number of human rights violations, their crimes [do not constitute](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/myanmar-finds-war-crimes-genocide-rohingya-crackdown-200121012116763.html) genocide.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: In order for a crime to constitute genocide, it must be undertaken with the [intent to destroy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/myanmar-finds-war-crimes-genocide-rohingya-crackdown-200121012116763.html), in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.
1.4.1.4. Con: The Myanmar government has [not allowed human rights investigators](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/asia/myanmar-united-nations-rohingya.html) into the country, so they must have something to hide.
1.4.2. Con: The UN does not need to be the opposition, it serves a better purpose as a unifying body and space for discussion and cooperation.
1.4.2.1. Con: Outside of the UN mandate, any intervention will be illegal. The UN is the only suitable actor in this scenario.
1.4.3. Pro: Genocide goes against the [values](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.5. Con: UN Peacekeeping Forces could be better used elsewhere.
1.5.1. Pro: There are worse humanitarian crises in [Yemen](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/yemen-face-worst-humanitarian-crisis-2019-181204105615554.html) and [DRC](https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/dr-congo/quick-facts-humanitarian-crisis-drc) that the UN should focus on instead.
1.5.1.1. Con: The U.N. already has [troops in the DRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONUSCO) and [has brokered a truce to stop famine in Yemen](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13887.doc.htm).
1.6. Pro: UN Peacekeeping Forces are the most viable option for protecting the Rohingyas.
1.6.1. Pro: UN Peacekeeping Forces have been extremely successful in the past, and would hence be fit for protecting the Rohingyas.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The UN Peacekeeping Mission to Sierra Lone is hailed [as a success](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/11729436/Srebrenica-20-years-on-What-have-been-the-successes-and-failures-of-UN-peacekeeping-missions.html) - being able to implement a peace agreement after the civil war.
1.6.1.2. Pro: [UNOCI successfully](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/our-successes) disarmed over 70,000 combatants, returned 250,000 refugees, and decreased human rights violations in Cote d'Ivoire.
1.6.2. Pro: Although many Rohingya have fled to neighbouring countries due to the state-sanctioned violence in Myanmar, they have [not been welcomed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/myanmar-rohingya-united-nations_b_59b695c3e4b0dfaafcf95e79) by the governments of these countries \(e.g. Bangladesh, [Malaysia](https://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2017/5/590990ff4/168000-rohingya-likely-fled-myanmar-since-2012-unhcr-report.html), Thailand and [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/india-plans-deport-thousands-rohingya-refugees-170814110027809.html)\).
1.6.2.1. Pro: This absence of a state backing the Rohingya people makes it especially important for an international body to stand in defence of the Rohingya people.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Gambia filed a [lawsuit against Myanmar](https://www.businessinsider.com/rohingya-genocide-myanmar-explained-in-30-seconds-muslim-islamophobia-2019-12?r=US&IR=T#gambia-filed-a-lawsuit-against-myanmar-in-november-accusing-the-country-of-genocide-4) in 2019, forcing Aung San Suu Kyi to appear before the UN's International Criminal Court.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: This lawsuit was backed by the [57 nations](https://fortune.com/2019/12/18/whats-happening-with-the-rohingya-crisis-now/) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. That suggests substantial support for the Rohingya people from individual states, and internationally.
1.6.3. Con: The case taken to the International Criminal Court has been a more effective way to tackle the situation in Myanmar.
1.6.3.1. Pro: This process has been able to 'fast-track' investigation by the UN of [providing protection](https://fortune.com/2019/12/18/whats-happening-with-the-rohingya-crisis-now/) to the Rohingya and placed Myanmar under an international media spotlight.
1.6.4. Con: The case is [currently being tried](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-genocide.html) in the International Court of Justice, who have recently ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya population and report back regularly on the steps it has taken to do so.
1.6.5. Con: If the Myanmar government doesn't allow them into the country, UNPKF would be violating the nation's sovereignty.
1.6.5.1. Con: Sovereignty does not exclusively protect States from intervention, or action by UN Peacekeeping Forces.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: According to [principles enshrined in](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/peace-and-security/) the R2P and the Genocide Convention, sovereignty is a responsibility that States owe to their people. The failure of this responsibility can justify interference.
1.6.5.2. Pro: According to the Capstone Doctrine, [two-fold consent](https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/UN-PeacekeepingAndHostStateConsent.pdf) is required for Peacekeeping interference, otherwise the peacekeepers risk being parties to the conflict. \(p. 13\)
1.6.5.3. Con: The violation of a nation's sovereignty can be considered legitimate under the UN's [Responsibility to Protect](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/about-responsibility-to-protect.shtml) clause.
1.6.5.3.1. Pro: The clause notes that if a state is either unwilling or unable to protect its own people from crimes such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, or crimes against humanity, then the international community has a [responsibility to protect them.](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/about-responsibility-to-protect.shtml)
1.6.6. Pro: UNPKF is the most objective and politically neutral peacekeeping force on the planet.
1.7. Pro: The attacks on the Rohingyas serve to radicalize them, feeding a cycle of retaliatory strikes that can only be stopped by a third party.
1.7.1. Pro: The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army carried out a [massacre](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/myanmar-new-evidence-reveals-rohingya-armed-group-massacred-scores-in-rakhine-state/) of Hindu civilians in Myanmar in August 2017 and there are [fears](https://www.ft.com/content/eef90090-d95a-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) that they are influencing refugees in the camps.
1.7.2. Con: The Rohingyas aren't being radicalized- they are engaging in self defense to prevent their own extermination.
1.8. Con: The UN would be ineffective at stopping the violence.
1.8.1. Pro: The U.N's previously demonstrated inflexibility with modifying their mandate to respond with force would hobble their chances to succeed in this theatre.
1.8.1.1. Pro: [UNOSOM failed](https://www.trtworld.com/americas/twelve-times-the-un-has-failed-the-world-21666) to make any major changes to the living conditions of people in Somalia, and was met with a lot of opposition.
1.8.1.2. Pro: UN peacekeeping [failures](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/11729436/Srebrenica-20-years-on-What-have-been-the-successes-and-failures-of-UN-peacekeeping-missions.html) in Srebrenica and Rwanda resulted in many thousands of deaths.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: The UN had an “Assistance Mission” for Rwanda in 1994, which knew about the impending genocide, but its peacekeepers failed to stop the majority Hutus going on a murderous rampage and [killing almost a million members](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/11700969/UN-at-70-Five-greatest-successes-and-failures.html) of the Tutsi minority.
1.8.1.2.2. Pro: The massacre of more than [8,000 Bosnian Muslim men](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/11700969/UN-at-70-Five-greatest-successes-and-failures.html) at the hands of Serb forces in Srebrenica in 1995 was an even more specific failure for the UN than Rwanda.
1.8.2. Con: The UN has numerous experts with a deep understanding of the issue. This will increase the likelihood that they will choose effective policies.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The UNHCR has over [300 staff](https://www.unhcr.org/rohingya-emergency.html) in Bangladesh working on the issue.
1.9. Con: The UN's history of interventionism is weak.
1.9.1. Pro: The UN has a history of [under reporting and failing to act](https://www.economist.com/international/2017/10/28/peacekeepers-in-name-only) on human rights abuses in fear of antagonizing local governments.
1.9.1.1. Pro: The United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur was [accused of concealing 16 difference cases](https://www.economist.com/international/2017/10/28/peacekeepers-in-name-only) of assaults on civilians, in fear of offending the government of Omar al-Bashir.
1.9.1.2. Pro: The UN was criticised for [failing to properly stand up](https://www.economist.com/international/2017/10/28/peacekeepers-in-name-only) for victims and their human rights during a peacekeeping mission to Sri Lanka in 2009.
1.9.2. Pro: This is because of the Security Council, where the permanent members have a [right to veto](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/voting-system), and use it to protect their national interests.
1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #17915: The UN Security Council should be dissolved.
1.9.3. Pro: In the [Democratic Republic of Congo](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/11700969/UN-at-70-Five-greatest-successes-and-failures.html), UN peacekeepers have been accused of paying women and young girls they were supposed to be protecting for sex, and sometimes raping them.
1.9.3.1. Pro: In the DRC, peacekeepers were said to have offered abandoned orphans [small gifts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/25/unitednations) in exchange for sexual encounters.
1.9.3.2. Pro: During one investigation into allegations of abuse in the DRC, [used condoms were found](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/30/nine-times-peacekeepers-have-sexually-abused-those-theyre-supposed-to-protect/) scattered around the military camps.
1.9.4. Pro: UN peacekeepers in Haiti have been accused of [unintentionally killing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k) dozens of civilians, as well as introducing cholera to the country - starting an epidemic that killed more than 10,000 people.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.9.6. Con: The UN was successful in their peacekeeping [mission](https://medium.com/unpeacekeeping/the-success-of-peacekeeping-in-liberia-9efd440d19d) in Liberia for 15 years.
1.9.6.1. Pro: The United Nations Mission in Liberia \(UNMIL\) [helped conduct](https://medium.com/\@UNPeacekeeping/the-success-of-peacekeeping-in-liberia-9efd440d19d?) three successful elections in the country \(2005, 2011 and 2017\), which saw the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another for the first time in more than 70 years.
1.10. Pro: A successful intervention could radically improve the UN's image.
1.10.1. Pro: The UN has struggled in the past because many countries have a [negative perception](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/10/03/is-the-un-a-friend-or-foe/) of it due to its [numerous failures](https://www.trtworld.com/americas/twelve-times-the-un-has-failed-the-world-21666). A successful intervention might counter this.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Research has [shown](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/10/03/is-the-un-a-friend-or-foe/) that some countries have a middling to negative view of the UN as an institution.
1.10.1.2. Pro: This is due to [reported violations](https://www.peaceopstraining.org/cotipso/theses/international-humanitarian-law-training-and-credibility-of-unit/) of international humanitarian law as well as human rights law by peacekeeper.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.
1.10.1.2.2. Pro: In Haiti, UN peacekeepers have been accused of fathering [hundreds of children](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k).
1.10.1.2.2.1. Pro: In some cases, girls [as young as 11](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k) were sexually abused and impregnated by UN peacekeepers.
1.10.1.2.2.2. Pro: The UN has also previously acknowledged that more than 100 Sri Lankan peacekeepers deployed to Haiti [exploited 9 children](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k) in a sex ring from 2004 to 2007.
1.10.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Whilst these peacekeepers were sent home, [none of them](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k) were punished for their crimes.
1.10.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: This is because the UN is [unable to take](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k) disciplinary action.
1.10.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Under article 47\(b\) of the Model Status of Forces Agreement, countries that contribute soldiers to UN missions have the [responsibility](https://theconversation.com/why-the-un-isnt-winning-its-battle-against-sexual-abuse-by-peacekeepers-52866) to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct by their own soldiers.
1.10.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Because states are often [unwilling to pursue](https://theconversation.com/why-the-un-isnt-winning-its-battle-against-sexual-abuse-by-peacekeepers-52866) criminal cases themselves, most crimes go unpunished.
1.10.1.2.2.3. Pro: Victims and abandoned peacekeeper babies faced [stigmatisation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/25/unitednations) by their families and communities due to these actions.
1.10.1.2.3. Pro: A UN inquiry revealed that UN peacekeepers have been involved in child prostitution in [six separate countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/world/americas/haiti-un-peacekeepers.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes&fbclid=IwAR0bHM3bOEiI8P17RneKsjobclHuznXLg1j3jThLl6_iTH-BMKtnETYwI7k).
1.10.1.2.3.1. Pro: Allegations have surfaced that UN peacekeepers that were sent to police Liberia were [regularly having sex](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/25/unitednations) with girls aged as young as 12.
1.10.1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.1.
1.10.1.2.3.3. Pro: During the 1990s, investigators found soldiers were customers in brothels run in Bosnia and Kosovo which [relied on women](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/25/unitednations) sold into forced prostitution.
1.10.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: One recent estimate suggested that up to [2,000 women](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/25/unitednations) had been coerced into sex slavery in Kosovo.
1.10.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: These soldiers were also reported to run these brothels, as well has [help traffic women](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/30/nine-times-peacekeepers-have-sexually-abused-those-theyre-supposed-to-protect/) from Eastern Europe to work as prostitutes.
1.10.1.2.3.4. Pro: A [1992 report](https://theconversation.com/why-the-un-isnt-winning-its-battle-against-sexual-abuse-by-peacekeepers-52866) shows that soldiers attached to the UN operation in Mozambique recruited girls aged 12-18 years into prostitution.
1.10.1.2.4. Pro: UN peacekeepers were accused of a number of crimes whilst stationed in Bosnia in 1993-1994.
1.10.1.2.4.1. Pro: The commander of the Canadian Army [accused](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/18/world/canada-accuses-47-of-misconduct-in-bosnia.html) 47 UN peacekeepers of drinking while on duty, having sexual relations with nurses and interpreters, and physically abusing patients at a mental hospital.
1.10.1.2.4.2. Pro: Some soldiers were also charged with [black market activities.](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/18/world/canada-accuses-47-of-misconduct-in-bosnia.html)
1.10.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.2.3.3.
1.10.2. Pro: At a time when international institutions are being criticized as ineffective bureaucracies, the UN needs to show that it can play a constructive role in international peacekeeping.
1.10.3. Con: Due to the complexity of the problem, the odds of a successful intervention are low. A failure could damage the UN's image.
1.10.3.1. Pro: The UN, generally, has a positive image around the world. This could be put at risk if the Rohingya mission ends up failing.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Across 32 [surveyed countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/23/united-nations-gets-mostly-positive-marks-from-people-around-the-world/) by Pew Research, a median of around 61% of individuals have a positive view of the UN, while a median of only 26% have a negative view.
1.10.3.1.2. Pro: In the US, [the approval](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/20/favorable-views-of-the-un-prevail-in-europe-asia-and-u-s/) of the UN climbed from 48% to 64% between 2007 to 2016.
1.10.3.2. Pro: [Experts believe](https://theglobepost.com/2019/08/01/un-peacekeeping/) that UN peacekeeping missions no longer have good changes at succeeding due to changes in both public willingness to fund these missions and the evolved nature of operations from original UN missions.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: In democratic countries, it can be difficult for politicians to justify diverting public funding to peacekeeping missions in far away countries. In light of this spending available to UN peacekeeping is a [fraction](https://theglobepost.com/2019/08/01/un-peacekeeping/) of that available in previous years.
1.10.3.2.1.1. Pro: The reduced funding available has rendered peacekeeping forces inadequately trained and supplied to be able to effectively carry out their objectives in creating and sustaining peace in their missions.
1.10.4. Con: The definition of what constitutes success will be difficult to determine, given the range of actors likely to be involved in the intervention.
