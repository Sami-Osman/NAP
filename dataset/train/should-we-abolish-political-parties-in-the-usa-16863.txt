Discussion Name: Should we abolish political parties in the USA?

1. There should be no political parties in the USA.
1.1. Con: Abolishing the two-party system would require a law to be created in order to enforce that policy.
1.1.1. Pro: A law banning political parties would violate the constitutionally protected [right to free assembly](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/peaceful-assembly/us.php).
1.1.1.1. Pro: A [political party](https://www.thoughtco.com/political-party-definition-4285031) is nothing more than a group of people agreeing to work together toward a common set of political goals. It is impossible to maintain a free society in which people cannot do this.
1.1.1.2. Con: Abolishing official support for parties would not in any way effect people's ability to congregate. It would only prevent identifying a candidate party in government documents, eliminate registering voters as a particular party, and prohibit party-specific \(official\) primary elections.
1.1.2. Con: If the law was only to eliminate government sponsored recognition of parties \(i.e. on the ballot or congressional documents\), then Americans would not see restriction on freedom.
1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.3. Con: The two party "system" is a [byproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) of the [current voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting). Changing to a fairer system would allow third parties and independents greater opportunity to participate in politics.
1.1.4. Pro: The power structures of the current two party system ensure that it is not in the interests of representatives and senators to alter it in this way.
1.2. Pro: Political parties cause partisanship within politics.
1.2.1. Con: Culture and human nature within the US cause the country to be partisan. This would not change if there were no political parties.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Political parties were formed by individuals with loosely-aligned political views. In the absence of a strict two-party system, people would still align themselves by their political views.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Partisanship can still [happen](https://theconversation.com/partisanship-runs-deep-in-america-even-among-independents-104884) to voters not within a political party.
1.2.1.2. Pro: [Studies](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/us-versus-them-how-neurophilosophy-explains-populism-racism-and-extremism/) have shown that political division is a result of human nature.
1.2.2. Pro: The Republican and Democratic parties [engage in actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization) which fuel polarization.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Both sides regularly [blame](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-democrats-play-the-blame-game-in-2nd-shutdown-weekend) each other for not compromising on specific policies.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Experts hold that [multi-party democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/two-party-system-broke-constitution/604213/) would result in less partisanship in the US than a two-party system.
1.2.3. Pro: [Party identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_identification) encourages partisanship. Without political parties, partisanship would be reduced.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Voter's perception of each other encourages polarization.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Surveys](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/upshot/how-we-became-bitter-political-enemies.html?mcubz=1) have been conducted using a 100-point scale to rate how voters feel toward each other, from cold to warm. Democrats and Republicans have been giving lower and lower scores to the opposite party.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: In [2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/upshot/how-we-became-bitter-political-enemies.html?mcubz=1), 45% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans said they hold “very unfavorable” views of the opposing party.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: A 2016 [survey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/upshot/how-we-became-bitter-political-enemies.html?mcubz=1) found that 70 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans considered members of the opposing party to be more close-minded than other Americans.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Political parties have an incentive to create problems they use as "wedge issues" to divide up the electorate. They then have no incentive to solve those problems, because a solution to a problem leads to less enthusiasm for the party/less incentive for members to remain engaged.
1.2.3.3. Con: There would still be partisanship on the substantive political issues even if party labels disappeared. People will continue to disagree about what the problems in society are and how to fix them.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Many \(not all\) topics that are politicized shouldn't be, because political parties stay around longer than candidates do, giving them time to materialize. With candidates, they can start over fresh, and personalize/customize their viewpoints to cater to the public's needs without having to fit into a political party to continue what shouldn't be.
1.2.4. Pro: The politics industry is controlled by [a duopoly that is failing America.](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf) If political parties worked for the people, we wouldn't see the kind of tribalism we do today.
1.3. Pro: Politics would be more representative without political parties.
1.3.1. Con: Banning parties would reduce transparency of the political system. Without parties, [political circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanahoe) would form which are less accountable to the people.
1.3.2. Pro: Laws which are passed without political party interference are likely to be more representative of the people.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Republicans [previously](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/09/09/how-republicans-opposed-to-medicaid-expansion-hurts-children/#40c62ae83674) have had to vote for policies which harmed members of their districts.
1.3.2.2. Con: Laws are still likely to not be representative due to the influence of [lobby groups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States). As a result of the large amount of money given to fund politician's expensive political campaigns, these politicians often choose the interests of their lobby over their constituents.
1.3.2.3. Pro: More views may be represented in legislative bodies as candidates with opinions distinct from those of parties now stand a chance of getting elected.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Candidates aligned with a specific party also enjoy a head start, as people may choose to vote for them regardless of whether they know them or not due to party identification.
1.3.2.4. Pro: In the absence of partisan labels and stereotypes to rely on, voters would be [forced to assess](https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2018/10/30/get-rid-of-democrats-and-republicans-steve-almond) their ballots without bias in favor, or against a political party. This will make such a ban effective.
1.3.2.5. Con: There will be uncertainty as to how an office holder might vote in the future.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: Office holders will still have to run in elections and declare their stances on issues.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: With no party mechanism to bind them to their word and electoral promises, elected officials may choose to shift stances.
1.3.2.5.2.1. Con: If an office holder votes on an issue such that their constituents disagree, then they can be voted out.
1.3.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: Voters can use many different sources to verify if politicians are adhering to their campaign promises, such as the media or website such as [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/).
1.3.2.6. Con: If parties were abolished, it would take so much longer to pass laws that the practical benefits of having theoretically more representative laws would be thwarted.
1.3.2.6.1. Pro: Political parties allow for elected officials to form majorities and pass agendas through Congress as opposed to individuals who will disagree and block governance.
1.3.2.6.1.1. Pro: [Party whips](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/03/what-does-a-congressional-whip-actually-do.html) keep elected party members in line and limit their ability to vote autonomously and often in support of legislation proposed by the other party.
1.3.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Office-holders are not bound to vote a certain way just because of their party affiliation. They can, and [often do](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/upshot/two-senators-willing-to-defy-the-party-line.html), cross party lines to vote their conscience.
1.3.2.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Office holders that vote against their party are often replaced by their party during the next voting cycle.
1.3.2.6.1.2. Pro: It would take far more time to convince individual members of Congress to vote on a specific bill than it would to convince a party.
1.3.2.6.1.2.1. Con: If a bill takes longer to pass, it can be modified over a longer period of time.
1.3.2.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Studies](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/) have shown that politicians rarely vote out of line with their parties position.
1.3.2.6.1.2.2. Con: Under the current two-party system, parties do not vote as a whole and so individual members of Congress still must be convinced to vote for specific bills.
1.3.2.6.1.2.3. Pro: Parties help to unify a plethora of individual interests and therewith make package deals possible.
1.3.2.6.1.3. Con: Political parties may actually prevent legislation from passing by disallowing members to vote against party lines.
1.3.3. Pro: A wider range of issues is likely to be discussed in a world where the political agenda is not shaped by just two parties.
1.3.3.1. Con: The media has influence over the political agenda through their editorial choices.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Parties often choose to ignore issues due to fear of a democratic backlash and electoral loss. Independent candidates are likelier to bring these issues up and discuss them.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Independent politicians can remind voters they are not being played by big money from outside influences and they don’t have to follow a party platform, they can think independently on all issues.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Independent candidates may also fear electoral defeat and therefore may not shed light on certain issues.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: It is often seen as politically weak for political parties to form alliances on certain issues, which means that they are not resolved as quickly or effectively as they should be.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Political parties often create a group-think mindset, [pressuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_\(politics\)) members to support causes they may not support.
1.3.3.4. Con: [Agenda-setting theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory) says that the media is largely responsible for determining the political agenda, and not political parties. As such, abolishing them is unlikely to notably impact what issues are discussed.
1.3.4. Pro: Political parties do not legally have to represent their voters.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Political parties have no obligation to uphold the results of primary elections \(as recently demonstrated by [the dismissal of Carol Wilding, et al. vs DNC](http://jampac.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/62-D.E.-62-Ord-of-Dismissal-8-25-17.pdf)\) casting an unmerited aura of democratic legitimacy on a non-democratic process.
1.3.5. Con: Having individual candidates instead of parties in office could lead to political uncertainty.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.6.1.
1.3.5.2. Pro: If political parties in the USA are abolished, then it would immediately cause anarchy, which is the worst form of government because it allows the wrong people into power.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: For some time after abolishing parties, voters would have no way of assessing and trusting individual representatives once free of partisan constraints. This could cause a crash of confidence in the whole system of governance.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: Abolishing parties would to some extent also wipe away a representative's political track record. This is because their previous actions in office may have been a direct result of their partisanship, rather than their personal convictions.
1.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.5.
1.3.5.4. Con: Offices are already held by individual candidates. Political parties merely support these candidates.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: Initially, the party was run by an aggregate of individual politicians. However, as partisan politics grew, now it is the party that runs the individual politicians.
1.3.5.4.1.1. Pro: Partisan politics and the party that decides who runs institutes a platform that no longer addresses regional issues as representatives have to beg, trade, and vote the party way before regional issues are addressed.
1.3.6. Pro: Electing individual candidates is likely to better engage, inform, and animate voters.
1.3.6.1. Pro: [Straight party voters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-ticket_voting) are defined as voters who vote along political party lines, rather than candidate by candidate. If there are no political party lines from which to vote based on, voters would need to vote candidate by candidate and would be more likely to become more informed on each candidate's positions prior to casting their vote.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: This could also result in those voters not voting, because there is no obvious candidate to vote for.
1.3.6.2. Con: Selecting politicians for political roles will be more difficult as there are likely more applicants for each position. This could result in the election of politicians that are less representative.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: According to [The Paradox of Choice,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) a 2004 book about shopping behaviors, being presented with a wide variety of options tends to result in consumers more frequently choosing nothing at all, and, when they do choose, more frequently being dissatisfied with their choice. If this applies to choice of elected officials, then more candidates would result in lower voter turnout and lower approval ratings.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: Attempts to replicate the research in "The Paradox of Choice" have been mixed, and it's not necessarily true that a phenomenon that emerges in shopping behavior would also emerge in the voting booth.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Voters whose views were not represented before, are likely to come out and vote as a result of the ability to vote for individuals.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Currently more people in the US [identify](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths) as independent than a Republican or Democrat.
1.3.6.3.2. Con: [Studies](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths) have shown that independent voters often have politician preferences which line up with those who identify as a Republican or Democrat.
1.3.6.3.3. Pro: Many potential voters do not [vote](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote) as they feel the current options within parties do not represent them.
1.3.6.3.3.1. Pro: Political parties [alienate](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/mar/17/rock-vote/half-millennials-dont-associate-democrat-or-republ/) voters, as most likely they won't fit into each one 100%.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: In recent years, the two political parties in the US have become more [divided](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/upshot/how-we-became-bitter-political-enemies.html?mcubz=1). This leads to a lack of representation in the middle ground for people.
1.3.6.3.4.1. Pro: The [ideological overlap](https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) between Republicans and Democrats is shrinking, with 94% of Democrats to the left of the median Republican and 92% of Republicans to the right of the median Democrat.
1.3.6.3.5. Pro: Voters are likely to engage more with individual candidates, which could improve voter turnout.
1.3.6.3.5.1. Con: The Party system is like consumer branding.The values associated with a Party build brand loyalty and sustained engagement; continuity and motivation that independents may not always provide.
1.3.6.3.5.1.1. Con: Candidates having to stand on their own opinions rather than that of a party platform makes them more personally connected, as the electorate often does not fully agree with the platform of either party.
1.3.6.3.5.1.2. Pro: Parties provide easily digestable information to voters.
1.3.6.3.5.1.2.1. Con: The best place to get information about a candidate, is from the candidate themselves.
1.3.6.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: More easily digestable information is likely to make people feel more engaged in politics, which is good for democracy.
1.3.6.3.5.1.3. Pro: Party events foster a sense of community.
1.3.6.3.5.1.4. Pro: Political parties help voters feel more connected to politics.
1.3.6.3.5.1.5. Con: [Mandatory voting](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/11/30/case-mandatory-voting/) would easily solve this and would help the country adjust to the change.
1.3.6.3.5.1.5.1. Pro: Countries that have mandatory voting tend to get [better representation](https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/beyond-turnout-consequences-compulsory-voting) of disadvantaged populations.
1.3.6.3.5.1.5.2. Pro: -> See discussion #1692: Citizens in democratic states should be required to vote.
1.3.7. Con: Political parties are more capable of improving representation than individual representatives.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Competition between parties encourages parties to be more representative.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Competition gives parties [incentives](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/9/5/16227700/hyperpartisanship-identity-american-democracy-problems-solutions-doom-loop) to respond to voters as they wish to make sure the other side does not get these votes.
1.3.7.1.2. Con: Competition would still be present in a system without political parties as politicians would still need to win elections.
1.3.7.1.3. Con: In the [United States](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf), competition between parties has resulted in undermining the system of representative democracy. \(p. 14\)
1.3.7.1.3.1. Pro: In the great majority of US states, the task of redistricting is delegated to the legislature, so the party that controls the state legislature also [controls the redistricting process](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf). By this process, politicians choose their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians. This is anything but a representative democracy. \(p. 14\)
1.3.7.1.3.2. Pro: Laws in the US, created to protect the parties from competition, keep voters from being able to choose the candidate whom they [likely would have wanted](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf) as their senator. \(p. 14\)
1.3.7.1.3.3. Pro: Only the majority party [rules in legislation](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf). The Hastert Rule does not allow a floor vote on a bill unless a majority of the majority party \(i.e., the Speaker’s party\) supports the bill, even if the majority of the entire House would vote to pass it. \(p. 15\)
1.3.7.2. Pro: Parties help in representing underrepresented people by using [collective action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action) to better define their common problems and more clearly characterize them in ways that would not be possible if people worked independently.
1.3.7.3. Con: Political parties in a [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy#Criticisms) have a tendency to become spaces for a rule of oligarchy instead of genuinely representing different social groups.
1.3.8. Con: Free association is part of the lifeblood of any democracy, so this proposition is quintessentially anti-democratic.
1.3.8.1. Con: The right to freedom of association is [not absolute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/right-of-association) in a democracy.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: Democracies do not allow free association with many groups such as [terrorists](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-polisci-032211-221825).
1.3.9. Con: Without political parties, new ideals would find it hard to enter the system, making the same kind of thinking in most politicians.
1.3.10. Pro: Capitalism and socialism are two completely different philosophies, and could and would never work in one group.
1.3.10.1. Con: According to many sources, socialism's [overall goal](https://www.thehawkeye.com/opinion/20180901/lenin-goal-of-socialism-is-communism) is communism.
1.3.11. Pro: People still have different opinions under one party.
1.4. Con: Banning political parties would be ineffective.
1.4.1. Pro: Political parties form as a natural result of how people engage with politics.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Political parties are not formed by any government decree.
1.4.1.2. Pro: [Neuroscience](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/us-versus-them-how-neurophilosophy-explains-populism-racism-and-extremism/) has shown that human nature guides people to being within a political party.
1.4.1.3. Pro: [Studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/after-service/201705/the-science-behind-why-people-follow-the-crowd) have shown that people like to group together with those of the same ideology as them.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: There are far more than two political ideologies in America, if people were truly grouping themselves by their ideologies — [rather than by branding/marketing](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf) — there would be far more than two thriving political parties in this country, as there are in other countries.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: The two party system is due almost entirely to the usage of the [First-Past-the-Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) / [Plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting) voting system used in the US.
1.4.1.4. Con: [Americans' satisfaction with Congress has reached record lows.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/poll-of-the-week-congress-approval-rating/) If the parties in power actually represented the political ideologies of the American people, this would not be the case.
1.4.1.5. Con: Grassroots political movements form this way, but the entrenched duopoly of Democrats and Republicans have created a system in which voters are divided up into groups with "wedge issues," ensuring loyalty will remain with one of the two major parties. [This is a classic example of an industry duopoly.](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf)
1.4.1.6. Con: Even if political parties do form as a natural result of people engaging in politics, that natural inclination is not necessarily a good thing for a liberal democracy.
1.4.1.6.1. Pro: A critical ingredient of a liberal democracy is having the '[consent of the governed](https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy/The-legitimacy-of-government)'. Yet if partisanship becomes too intense, then the losing party's voters may eventually refuse to consent to be governed by the other party. This would mark the end of a functioning democracy.
1.4.1.6.1.1. Con: The rule of law and [political due process](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/provisions.html) is a sufficient antidote to the hyperpartisanship that risks destabilising democracy because they help maintain faith in the wider political system.
1.4.2. Pro: Even if it were illegal to organize, there would still be material advantages to doing so, even if there were fewer. This closes off those advantages to only political groups who are willing to act in bad faith and attempt to subvert the law.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Parties are better able to advertise their candidates due to greater financial resources meaning that third party candidates stand [little](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/gary-johnson-jill-stein-third-party-candidates-us-election-a7393961.html) chance of being elected.
1.4.3. Con: Political parties only exist because of representative democracy, which is extremely inefficient.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The costs of election campaigns are [extremely high](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2020/11/27/the-2020-election-was-the-most-expensive-in-history-but-campaign-spending-does-not-always-lead-to-success/).
1.4.3.2. Con: There exist countries \(for example, Iraq, China, Vietnam, and others\) that do not possess representative democracies, yet they have political parties.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam#Government_and_politics) and China are both single-party states, and as such do not have "parties".
1.4.4. Pro: Abolishing political parties would not affect political polarization.
1.5. Pro: The Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be made up of political parties.
1.5.1. Con: The Founding Fathers drafted the [US Constitution](http://constitutionus.com/) and chose not to include anything about political parties. Due to this it is clear that they did not all think of it as enough of a bad policy to prevent them from being formed.
1.5.1.1. Pro: One of the founding fathers of the United States, Alexander Hamilton,with a coalition of others, [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton#Emergence_of_political_parties) the Federalist party, one of the first political parties within the country.
1.5.1.2. Pro: In Federalist Paper no. 10, [James Madison](https://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/summary-essay-10) stated that in order to control a faction you must control their money or their beliefs. This statement indicates that the construction of parties was intended to control and differentiate between different beliefs.
1.5.2. Con: Political parties should be judged based on their current benefit to society, not on the beliefs held by people from the past, who do not know how these parties currently act.
1.5.3. Con: [Freedom of association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), which supports the creation of political parties among other types of association, is protected by US bill of rights and therefore protected by US Constitution, which was drafted and approved by US Founding Founders.
1.5.4. Pro: Washington was [against](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/quotes/article/however-political-parties-may-now-and-then-answer-popular-ends-they-are-likely-in-the-course-of-time-and-things-to-become-potent-engines-by-which-cunning-ambitious-and-unprincipled-men-will-be-enabled-to-subvert-the-power-of-the-people-and-to-usurp-for-th/) a party system. As a primary author of the US political system, his opposition to having two parties carries considerable weight.
1.5.4.1. Pro: In his [Farewell Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address#Political_parties), Washington warned of sectionalism as it weakens the government.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Washington warned that political parties have the power to [destabilise democracy](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/9/5/16227700/hyperpartisanship-identity-american-democracy-problems-solutions-doom-loop) by promoting conflict, leading to the demise of the social contract of democracy.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.6.1.
1.5.4.2. Con: Washington was not the [only Founding Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States#Social_background_and_commonalities) of the United States, and hence his opinion should not constitute the final word on the political system in the US.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Washington commanded [considerable public support and trust](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/poll-george-washington-still-tops-073032), so his views are highly persuasive.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: As the country's premier statesman, Washington was [unanimously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington) elected President by the Electoral College in the first two national elections.
1.5.4.4. Con: As a leader of soldiers and civilians alike, Washington is renowned. As a political thinker his merits leave something to be desired.
1.5.4.5. Con: George Washington's actions and opinions are not always objectively correct.
1.5.4.5.1. Con: In this context only Washington's actions / opinions on political parties need be judged.
1.5.4.5.2. Pro: Washington previously supported slavery.
1.5.4.5.2.1. Con: Washington spoke out against [cruel slaveowners](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/the-only-unavoidable-subject-of-regret/) and encouraged kindness towards slaves.
1.5.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: In his later years, Washington [believed](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/ten-facts-about-washington-slavery/) that harsh and indiscriminate punishments to slaves could backfire and urged to motivate them with encouragement and rewards.
1.5.4.5.2.1.2. Con: Washington still approved of “[correction](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/ten-facts-about-washington-slavery/)” when these methods failed to motivate and discipline slaves.
1.5.4.5.2.1.3. Pro: Washington responded kindly to [Wheatley](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/ten-facts-about-washington-slavery/), a slave, in a letter and addressed her as "Miss Phillis," an unusually polite way for a member of the gentry to address an enslaved person.
1.5.4.5.2.2. Pro: "Washington was born into a world accustomed to [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#Slavery); he had no qualms about its practice prior to 1775 and held commonplace views that Blacks were an inferior race."
1.5.4.5.2.3. Pro: Washington never set any of his slaves [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery).
1.5.4.5.2.3.1. Con: Washington's will included [manumission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery) for his enslaved people.
1.5.4.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: At the end of his life, Washington made the [decision to free all his slaves](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/slavery/ten-facts-about-washington-slavery/) in his 1799 will - the only slave-holding Founding Father to do so.
1.5.4.5.2.3.2. Con: Washington spoke frequently of his desire to [end the practice](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/status-of-slaves-in-washingtons-will/) of slavery.
1.5.4.5.2.3.3. Pro: "By 1799, there were 317 [slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#Slavery) living at Mount Vernon; he owned 124 outright and held 153 for his wife's dower interest."
1.5.4.6. Pro: George Washington presided at the [Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\(United_States\)) of 1787, which established the US federal government.
1.5.5. Pro: Hamilton saw political parties as "[the most fatal disease](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1205304-alexander-hamilton?page=20)" of the government.
1.5.6. Pro: Franklin [described](http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lled&fileName=005/lled005.db&recNum=166) political parties as "perpetually dividing the nation, distracting its councils, hurrying sometimes into fruitless mischievous wars."
1.5.7. Con: The founding fathers [created](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/formation-of-political-parties.html) political parties.
1.6. Con: Altering the current two party system is more beneficial than eliminating political parties altogether.
1.6.1. Pro: The approach should be to reform the way the 2-Party system operates in Congress by implementing [Shared Legislative Power \(SLP\)](https://jpmcjefferson.blogspot.com/2018/09/slow-learners-save-democracy-heed.html).
1.6.2. Pro: -> See discussion #15546: The United States' political system should have more than two major political parties.
1.6.3. Con: There is no two-party system to be abolished. All states allow any number of parties on the [ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access_in_the_United_States), provided they meet [certain requirements](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_major_and_minor_party_candidates).
1.6.3.1. Con: Rules/requirements for ballot access, debate access, & every other aspect of running for office is [controlled by the two parties currently in power](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf). They've therefore configured a system in which third-parties are not competing on a level playing field.
1.6.3.2. Con: While the "two party system" is a rather unofficial system, the US political arena is still dominated by the Republicans and Democrats, largely due to the [Plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) voting system, and in some cases [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering).
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.3.1.
1.6.4. Pro: The current voting method falls victim to the [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect), which decreases the chance voters will vote for a third party candidate, strengthening the two party system. To alter the two party system without outlawing political parties, change the voting method to one that is absent the spoiler effect.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Cardinal voting methods \(such as [Score Voting](https://www.kialo.com/score-voting-aka-range-voting-%E2%80%94-rate-every-candidate-highest-rated-wins-described-here-enwikipediaorg-and-here-4650.56?path=4650.0~4650.56)\) are free of the spoiler effect, because the scores given to candidates by each voter are independent.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The spoiler effect is reduced under [Ranked Choice Voting](https://www.kialo.com/alternative-vote-aka-ranked-choice-voting-and-instant-runoff-voting--shown-here--enwikipediaorg-and-here-youtubecom-4650.1?path=4650.0~4650.1), due to being able to rank each candidate. Weak candidates that would split votes under a standard plurality system are eliminated during runoff stages, allowing voters' 2nd/3rd place support for strong candidates to be taken into account.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: Though reduced, spoiler effect is still however an issue with [RCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting), and the [instances thereof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect#Mathematical_definitions) are less obvious than under [Simple Plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting).
1.6.4.3. Pro: The spoiler effect is greatly reduced under [STAR voting](https://www.kialo.com/star-voting-score-then-automatic-runoff-described-here-wwwequalvote-4650.48?path=4650.0~4650.48), because the score each candidate receives from a given voter are independent.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: The spoiler effect is however reintroduced by STAR's runoff step.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: Example with a 10 pt scale and 100 voters: Candidate A receives 100% 2s, for 200 points. Candidate B receives 30% 8, for 240 points. Candidate A wins the runoff, 70:30. Now imagine candidate C were in the race, and receives 25% 10s, for 250 points. Now the runoff is between B and C, and B wins, 30:25. Candidate C has thus spoiled the election for candidate A, who despite receiving fewer points than B, was widely prefered to B by voters.
1.6.4.4. Con: The spoiler effect is not the only problem with first-past-the-post. It also generates non-proportionate results, encourages gerrymandering and pork barreling, and creates perverse incentives for safe vs risky seats. Many alternatives share these, so they must be chosen carefully.
1.6.4.5. Con: It is precisely the candidates that cannot win under the current system for whom reform is in their interests. Any candidate that can win is by definition benefiting from the current system and has no incentive to change it.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.6.6. Pro: An alteration might be to increase the number of parties. [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Peru), for example, has many political parties, and as "a consequence, it is rare for any single political organization to obtain an absolute majority in the [Congress of Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Peru), thus, these parties often work with each other to form [coalition governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government)."
1.6.7. Pro: Members of Congress should be elected in partisan elections; however, Congress should organize so that there are no caucuses and all members contribute independently.
1.6.7.1. Pro: The Nebraska Unicameral successfully runs a similar system, with the exception that their elections are non-partisan.
1.7. Con: Banning political parties means that people with multiple perspectives will not be able to run the country in their own groups.
1.7.1. Con: A diverse focus on changes allow departments and committees to be formed to produce multiple options for the same point, and would allow voters to better make their choice \(beyond a "vote Yes for" or "vote No for" system\).
1.8. Con: It's not up to government to decide what political parties there can be.
1.9. Pro: Party needs are selfish and thus do not benefit society.
1.9.1. Pro: When you have a goal of winning against the other side, human nature causes you to oversimplify, distort, and demonize the other side. Like the [Hatfield's and McCoy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud), [sports teams](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-psychology-of-why-sports-fans-see-their-teams-as-extensions-of-themselves/2015/01/30/521e0464-a816-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html), and [wars](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/how-confirmation-bias-can-lead-to-war/260347/): each side can justify escalating the conflict.
1.10. Pro: There should not be political parties, instead, we should have a direct democracy of some form.
1.10.1. Pro: We may vote for a representative who we think is best for us, but they may only act in the best interest of the party and not the people, so it does not make sense for any political parties to exist. Each and every politician that wants to run for any legal position should have their own campaign.
1.10.2. Con: Direct democracy can lead to the [deterioration of democracy.](https://www.theglobalist.com/technology-democracy-society-social-media-surveillance/)
1.10.3. Pro: Politicians may not have an interest in the protection of democracy.
1.11. Con: Banning political parties is one of the key tools of Macchiavellian dictators
1.11.1. Pro: The Nazi Party dissolved all other political entities during the transition of Germany from [democracy to dictatorship](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/law-against-the-founding-of-new-parties)(In another pivotal step in the transformation of German society from a democracy to a dictatorship, the Nazi leadership passed the Law against the Founding of New Parties. With this law, passed on July 14, 1933, all other political entities were disbanded or dissolved. As a consequence, some activists fled abroad. Others prepared to work within an illegal party framework. Some parties went underground and some simply dissolved from intimidation and pressure.\n\nGermany became a one-party dictatorship led by National Socialists, whom the law made the only legitimate political party in the country.).
1.12. Con: Our problems are the hidden party that government serves today. It serves the capitalists and the oligarchs. In that, both parties are united. If government is to serve all of the people, there needs to be less differences between the classes.
1.13. Con: We don't need to end political parties in the USA, but really getting other parties supported and into offices. By doing so, we could get a system where compromise will actually happen for the betterment of all of the people of the country.
