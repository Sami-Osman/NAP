Discussion Name: Is enlightened despotism superior to democracy?

1. Enlightened Despotism is superior to Democracy.
1.1. Pro: An enlightened despot is independent from the negative influences that plague decision-making in democracies.
1.1.1. Pro: The political career of a benevolent despot is not hindered by corporate interest, allowing them to focus more on the well-being of their people.
1.1.1.1. Con: In modern history advisors to despots were mainly the business elites and the military since the two safeguard power.
1.1.1.2. Con: A despot relies on businesses to achieve its economic goals. This makes them dependent.
1.1.1.3. Con: Nobody can rule alone. A despot has to satisfy the people who execute his/her wishes, or he [will be replaced by someone who does](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook).
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: To [keep his key cronies loyal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs&feature=youtu.be&t=117), the despot has to spend large parts of his resources on them. Thus, there are fewer resources left for the common people.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: An enlightened despot would enact anti-corruption laws that would prevent this.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: The same fear motivates elected leaders, which is why their policies are often shortsighted and only benefit a subset of the population at the expense of the entire country.
1.1.2. Pro: An despot, regardless of his/hers wisdom and forethought, is independent from public approval and therefore can, theoretically, pursue the nation's best interest \(i.e. as an aggregate homogenous population\) regardless of the popularity of his initiatives.
1.1.3. Pro: Enlightened despots do not need to worry about bureaucracy getting in the way. Societies would then not have to deal with inefficiencies and lack of productivity due to bureaucracy.
1.1.3.1. Con: A despot cannot in any human capability micromanage a large society. Some level of hierarchy and bureaucracy will exist.
1.1.3.2. Con: Inefficiency and bureaucracy create jobs.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Inefficiency and bureaucracy can create jobs only in the short term. Over time, an economy will shrink if there is too much inefficiency and bureaucracy, resulting in fewer jobs.
1.1.4. Con: Despots may not suffer from the influences that democracies suffer from, yet they suffer from other ones.
1.1.4.1. Pro: A despot's personality may include quirks, predispositions and weaknesses that can translate into a negative influence on the political system of the respective country.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Power can corrupt - and even if that doesn't take away from a despot's benevolence, it can have negative effects on those around the despot.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: A corrupted ED, even if still benevolent towards the population, may attract the scorn of those around, thereby undermining his/her own position.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Park Chung Hee, who ruled in South Korea as a despot from 1963 to 1979, was assassinated by his own security chief. Among the [suspected motives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Park_Chung-hee#Restoring_democracy_as_motive) was the perception that Park had become corrupted betrayed the Korean people.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Despotism has much more potential to produce popular disenchantment with politics. In a democracy, there is always the potential for change, signified by changing people and parties in power - where this potential doesn't exist under despotism where those in power remain the same.
1.1.4.3. Con: Any problems that center on a single individual are easier to resolve than problems that are of a social or structural nature, as is usually the case with the problems that plague democracies.
1.1.5. Pro: By keeping fair but firm control over corporations, the Enlightened Despot can allow entrepreneurship to flourish, without edging into monopolistic expansion and predatory practices. The distraction of big business gaming the system and running amok is avoided.
1.1.6. Pro: A despot is not indebted to any power structure, therefore he is less prone to external pressures which could harm the people.
1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.7. Pro: Since an enlightened despot need not worry about reelection or term limits, he/she may take actions which will harm the nation in the short run but strengthen it in the long run.
1.1.7.1. Con: Without the pressure induced by term limits and the desire to be re-elected, the ED has fewer incentives to come up with the best-possible policies. This might result in decisions that are worse than optimal.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: In a democracy with term limits the goal is not to implement the best possible policies, but rather to propose the most popular policy accepted by the voters during times of election.
1.1.7.2. Con: If the despot does not have the trust of the people, he/she may need to use force to impose unpopular measures.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: The same could be said of democratically elected leaders who lose the trust of their people before the end of their term, as was the case of Ukrainian president [Viktor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych) in 2010.
1.1.7.3. Con: Short term pain-causing decisions could easily risk severing trust between the Enlightened Despot's staff or the populace or both.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: With a loyal, like-minded, well-briefed staff, an efficient PR/propaganda arm, and a robust security apparatus, the Enlightened Despot would not have problems implementing short-term pain, long-term gain decisions. Hardships would be pleasantly framed, and hardcore dissenters surgically squashed. The greater good would proceed intact.
1.1.8. Pro: An Enlightened Despot is far less susceptible to corruption from within their own country than politicians are in a democratic government.
1.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.1.8.2. Con: Access to the despot becomes another avenue for corruption in the overall system, even if a specific despot is not corruptible himself.
1.1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.8.4. Pro: Many politicians have to plan for the time after their political career and utilize questionable means like [revolving doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_\(politics\)) into private business. An enlightened despot would not be affected by considerations of this kind.
1.1.8.5. Con: According to the [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017), democratic countries are generally far less corrupt than non-democratic countries.
1.2. Con: The Enlightened Despot is a single point of failure -- if anything happens to them, the government is crippled. Democracy's distributed leadership is much more resilient.
1.2.1. Pro: Unless there will be another enlightened despot available to succeed after the current leader, the political system would be subject to conflicts of inheritance.
1.2.1.1. Con: Authoritarian states with a dominating political party, such as Russia, China, Singapore and Vietnam, have shown that generational transitions are possible without instability.
1.2.1.2. Pro: There is no means in which the succession is enlightened. In all authoritarian states, the successor is the most powerful of the ruling party, not the most beneficent or enlightened.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Not if the ruling powers follow what the previous enlightened despot said. They can select a suitable successor and then the ruling party would abide under his wishes.
1.2.1.3. Pro: It is difficult to imagine how a successor for the ED could be found and/or selected.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: There are several mechanisms one could use to select an enlightened despot.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Hereditary rule - if we’re looking at super-smooth transition - whereby an heir is raised from birth to be fit for the position has been implemented with effectiveness throughout history.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: The mechanisms for selecting an enlightened despot could be undermined. for example, hereditary rule could be undermined if the heir is killed in an accident or if more than one heir end up competing for the thrown.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: There are no clear and generally agreed-upon criteria based on which a successor could be looked for and selected.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: There is no obvious and widely accepted procedure for finding and selecting a successor.
1.2.1.4. Con: A truly enlightened despot would select a suitable successor while still in power.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Some would say only ones self can know if they are enlightened or not. Therefore, there would be no process of verification of the despot's status of enlightenment and no way for the despot to know if the successor was enlightened, too. If the successor is not enlightened, the system becomes broken.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: The Enlightened Despot can direct many and diverse resources to finding a suitable successor.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: The Enlightened Despot could massively fund and otherwise empower all efforts to find a successor.
1.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: The Enlightened Despot could direct the realm's best and brightest to push the boundaries of science and technology, without restriction, to find a way to produce the next great ED.
1.2.1.4.2.3. Pro: The Enlightened Despot could have all aspects of themself intensively documented and analyzed to discover the metrics for selecting a similarly great successor.
1.2.1.4.2.4. Pro: The Enlightened Despot could call upon all citizens to be screened as potential successors.
1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.2.3. Pro: A single individual is vulnerable to accidents and assassination.
1.2.3.1. Con: Historically, few leaders are actually assassinated.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Individual despots, furthermore, are obvious targets for assassinations since anyone who wants to overthrow the established order knows where to start and how to have the greatest possible effect.
1.2.4. Con: If the enlightened despot manages to establish principles and guidelines for leadership, these can prevail beyond their death, this ensuring the continuation of enlightened despotism.
1.2.5. Pro: A despot would be an unstable form of government because there is usually more than one center of power in a society. The despot wold rely on other power brokers to maintain control and since power is the only source of a despot's legitimacy there is nothing preventing other powerful interests from challenging his rule.
1.3. Con: The Enlightened Despot is incapable of understanding everything that needs to be done, whereas an effective democracy reflects the needs of all the people.
1.3.1. Pro: Democracy allows the state to take into account the realities of more than one class of people. Whilst the ability to adapt under any form of autocracy will be up to a single person, which is unaware of the realities of a great deal of his subjects. One cannot ask someone who has everything what it is to live in poverty, one cannot ask him to solve a problem he knows nothing about, no matter how wise.
1.3.1.1. Con: A truly benevolent despot would attempt to know everything about everyone in his country, and attempt to fix the issues plaguing all classes of people.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Even an enlightened despot can learn only so much about his people, for example because any exposure to the economic hardships they deal with would be limited and voluntary, and therefore fundamentally different what they experience.
1.3.1.2. Con: A Enlightened Despot could chose to live among the poor.
1.3.1.3. Con: An Enlightened Despot does not have to experience every living condition personally in order to know about and act to improve all conditions.
1.3.2. Pro: In democracy, everyone has a say -- unless the Enlightened Despot duplicates the democratic process, Enlightened Despotism can't achieve the same level of understanding of the people's needs.
1.3.2.1. Con: Neither system limits governance to only a single individual. Any despot, president or prime minister will have staff.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Despots tend to surround themselves with sycophants, not wise advisors.
1.3.2.2. Pro: An individual is often guided by life experiences. Empathy comes from having had similar experiences. An individual and its staff have limited \(even if\) enlightenment and experiences. As such it is impossible to make the best decisions.
1.3.2.3. Con: These days, there are many ways to quickly and directly consult an entire population. \(For example, in 2019, [over 5 billion people have mobile devices, over half of them smartphones](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/).\)
1.3.3. Pro: A single individual in power is more susceptible to making grave mistakes like mishandling the economy or declaring devastating wars.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Excessive power by one person makes arbitrary decisions a risk.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Decisions by one about too many issues will lead to hasty decisions. Hasty, then led by irrational "fast thinking" \(Kahneman, 2011\), then arbitrariness \("being based on \[...\] personal whim, rather than any reason or system"\).
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Without check and balances, there's no double-check of the sovereign's decisions. Without any harsh feedback to his decision, the sovereign can be susceptible to detachment from reality.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Absolute power of a man implies that the sovereign acts by his own decision \(which can bring about whimsical decision\) and not by superimposed constitutional rules \(whose rational procedures exclude whim\).
1.3.3.2. Con: But, it's given that the leader is enlightened.
1.3.3.3. Con: An enlightened despot will rely on expert advisors that can take wiser and more rational decisions than a generally uninformed society.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: A enlightened despot will promote people on a loyalty basis instead of an expertise basis, which is more the rule in an administration implementing democratic decisions.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.3.3.3.3. Con: Experts might be knowledgeable, but they are also subject to corruption and selfishness.
1.3.3.3.4. Con: A despot is not required to listen to anyone.
1.3.3.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.3.3.3.5. Con: This assumes that the despot has total freedom in decision making, which \(s\)he can never have, as \(s\)he relies on the loyalty of other people who execute his/her orders.
1.3.3.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.3.3.3.6. Pro: Plato [advocated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_five_regimes) a form of elite, enlightened rule rather than democracy for this reason.
1.3.3.3.6.1. Con: Plato's ideas were tested by the disciples of his own school on Sicily, with disastrous results. See [Dion of Syracuse.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_of_Syracuse)
1.3.3.3.6.2. Con: In the very same lines, Plato advocates strong social segregation. Also, while himself doubting to refusing the existence of the Olympic deities, he required death penalty for the common people doing the same, all because considering the religion a pillar of morality worth brutal enforcement. The morality and correctness of Plato's views are thus highly questionable, and may not be counted as doubtless pro for such political arguments.
1.3.4. Con: Large-scale data collection using modern communications and computing technologies, analyzed using statistics and findings from the social sciences, can provide the Enlightened Despot and their staff with a detailed view of the population's opinions, wants, and needs, which they can immediately act upon.
1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.5. Pro: Under Enlightened Despotism's top-down order, corruption at lower levels is free to flourish. In democracy, the continual struggle for representation from the grassroots up pushes back against lower-level tyranny.
1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.4. Pro: With an established ruling elite, the people of such a state need not worry about politics and can live their lives with greater freedom.
1.4.1. Con: Being able to participate in politics, and thus being trusted in one's self-government, is an ultimate and far-reaching form of freedom.
1.4.2. Pro: Human's [innate liberal-or-conservative orientation](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2018/02/the-big-five-personality-traits-what-they-mean-for-your-political-views/) means that in a democracy, control tends to swing from one side to the other, producing ideological policy shifts that will always leave a significant segment of the population feeling poorly represented and unfairly constrained. With Enlightened Despotism, such uncertainty is eliminated since there is always only one way, focused on practical benefits equally for all.
1.4.3. Con: People in an autocratic state have less freedom because they cannot object if the despot requires them to do something.
1.4.4. Con: The [Human Freedom Index](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index) shows that democratic countries generally provide much greater freedom to their people than non-democratic countries.
1.5. Con: Enlightened Despotism risks unchecked corruption. Instead of investing absolute power in a single person, democracy distributes power to create checks and balances that can be used to combat corruption
1.5.1. Con: There is no one person capable of wielding absolute power so the despot would have to delegate. Checks and balances would need to be introduced to ensure that the delegated powers are not subject to corruption.
1.5.2. Con: An enlightened despot would have no motive to become corrupted. Since his society will be well run and efficient it would be easily able to service his desires and should be happy to do so. Corruption would serve no benefit.
1.5.3. Pro: There is no way to tell ahead of time if a particular despot will become corrupt after taking power. Therefore, enlightened despotism does risk unchecked corruption in practice.
1.5.4. Pro: Power corrupts. An enlightened despot may quickly become a tyrant.
1.5.4.1. Con: Power corrupts because the people wielding power tend to do so because they have a thirst for power which is not readily quenched. An enlightened despot would not be driven by such a thirst.
1.5.4.2. Con: So can an enlightened democracy. The Tyranny of the uninformed majority is just as bad if not worse than that of a despot.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: In an ideal enlightened democracy, voters would be informed and unsusceptible to this. You must compare the ideal versions of both systems.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: Meanwhile, in the real world... an enlightened democracy is an even more fantastical notion than an enlightened despot, if only because there are so very many more people to enlighten. If we are imagining an idealised system then the despot wins hands down because it is so very much more efficient.
1.5.4.3. Pro: An authoritarian leader who became tyrannical would be extremely difficult to remove.
1.5.4.4. Pro: There is nothing inherent to despotism that ensures the despot to remain benevolent or to continue to have any focus on well-being of the people.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: Even the most enlightened despots became corrupted over time. Frederic the Great created a Judge Court that designed to be independent from the king himself, but the court ended up being fully controlled by the king anyway.
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: Benevolence to the general public is more inherent to democracy as the leader can be removed if they are disliked by the population they rule.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.5.6. Con: The fact that the despot is "enlightened" suggests that corruption would be impossible because enlightened and corrupted are logically incompatible states of being on any plausible definition of enlightened.
1.6. Con: Enlightened Despotism has never worked, and if history is an indicator, it never will.
1.6.1. Con: There is no evidence here to suggest that it has ever been tried.
1.6.2. Pro: The most prosperous countries are democracies. There's not a single despot in the modern world which can compete with the best democracies.
1.6.2.1. Con: Historical examples of South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have shown that the [developmental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state) under authoritarian rule can grow economically.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Historical example of the present day Russia proves the contrary.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: On the other hand, historical examples of late Maoist China, Pol Pol and the Khmer Rouge \(to pair with the suggested South Asia Theme\) are examples of when authoritarian rule had led to mass killings.
1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Mao or Pol Pot have not been what we consider 'enlightened despots' here.
1.6.2.1.3. Con: [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee#Legacy), [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_\(Taiwan\)), and [Singapore](https://www.opendemocracy.net/jim-sleeper/lee-kuan-yew%E2%80%99s-hard-truths) also experienced human rights abuses under authoritarian rule.
1.6.2.1.4. Pro: Stalin's USSR, Genghis Khan's Mongolian Empire and Nazi Germany are more examples of countries that grew economically under despots.
1.6.2.1.5. Con: This is true, but the reasons why this is the case - efficiency due to a lack of due process, a lack of checks and balances, etc. - are also the reasons why authoritarian regimes are so incredibly dangerous and usually horrible. Democracy is messy, boring, and slow, but that's worth it.
1.6.2.1.6. Con: Economic growth has been a defining feature of Asian countries that adopt free market policies. Authoritarians under command economies have resulted in starvation. Therefore it is likely that free markets, not authoritarianism, should get credit for economic growth in Asia.
1.6.2.1.6.1. Con: Free markets can exist under despots, just as controlled economies can exist under democracies. They aren't mutually exclusive.
1.6.2.2. Con: Perhaps none of the current despots are enlightened.
1.6.3. Con: Some of the most successful stories of rapid development were the result of enlightened despotism.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Under the dictatorial rule [of Park Chung-hee](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/park-chung-hee), the formerly poor South Korea developed at a rapid speed during the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the country is among the [world's largest economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)).
1.6.3.2. Pro: Under the one-party rule of the Communist Party, the poverty rates in China have been [declining at a rapid pace](https://www.unicef.cn/en/figure-29-poverty-rate-19902015) over the course of the past decades.
1.6.3.3. Con: Rapid development does not equate to long term stability which is arguably a much better indicator of a good or bad government.
1.6.3.4. Pro: The rapid development of Singapore is largely attributed [to Lee Kuan Yew's leadership](https://theconversation.com/how-lee-kuan-yew-transformed-singapore-from-small-town-into-global-financial-hub-39192). His rule is commonly described in the terminology of enlightened despotism.
1.6.4. Con: The Enlightened Despot can take advantage of modern technology in ways that would be difficult for democracies to match.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The Enlightened Despot is able to handle new and rapidly advancing technologies in a timely manner, without the complicated political and bureaucratic processes of democracy to cause endless delays.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Democratic governments haven't kept up with oversight of recent and emergent capabilities and issues, such as social media, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering. An Enlightened Despot could act quickly to have technological development continuously monitored and dynamically regulated to put the interests of the people first.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: The Enlightened Despot is free to institute fundamental policies at will, and modify them at any time, in order to keep up with rapid technological change and new findings.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: The fast handling of technologies goes hand in hand with risks, for example unforeseen consequences, as was the case for the largely unregulated growth of social networks. Democracies, through their slower and more regulated approach, have a better chance of recognizing and containing these risks.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Information is much more abundant and available. An enlightened despot now will have much more information available to make better decisions.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.6.4.3. Pro: If a despot is truly enlightened, he could use modern communications to give complete transparency, allowing the population to see that his actions are morally good.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Having evidence that the ruler is acting in the interests of the people would reduce revolutionary and anti-authoritarian groups.
1.6.4.3.2. Con: Increased transparency/visibility would highlight the mistakes of the despot. He is enlightened, not perfect, and being well intentioned but ineffective would be reason for revolt.
1.6.4.3.2.1. Pro: An ineffective enlightened despot or one whose benevolence has become questionable will be replaced. In practice this may be a regular occurrence, and each will learn from the mistakes of the last.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.8. Pro: Democracy is a deeply flawed system of government, in ways that Enlightened Despotism is not.
1.8.1. Pro: Democracy is tyranny of the un-enlightened majority.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Democracy can devolve into mob rule, where minorities are trampled upon. An enlightened despot could ensure they don't lose sight of minorities.
1.8.1.2. Con: An un-enlightened majority is not a necessary and inevitable feature of democracy. Through education, the majority could be enlightened.
1.8.1.3. Pro: In a democracy the rule of law can end up playing second fiddle to the will of the majority as argued by Aristotle. The will of the people can undermine expert professional advice, where the majority's decisions are often argued more from sentiment, emotion and tradition rather than evidence-based research or peer-vetted verdicts.
1.8.2. Con: Democracy empowers the subjects, or at least allows an illusion of it.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Democracy is superior because it gives people the chance to take decisions for themselves.This can help society because people stop feeling powerless,although many times this isn't accomplished to the full extent. So people may feel well if they see that they can influence how their life will go by making certain decisions.
1.8.2.2. Con: With gerrymandering and special interest groups in play, it is doubtful that democracy really empowers the people.
1.8.2.3. Pro: Revolt is a legitimate threat to any system of government. When people feel like they have agency over a system, they are less likely to act outside the system to instigate change \(ie through violent political action\).
1.8.3. Con: Enlightened despotism might be preferable to a flawed democracy, but if you assume an ideal outcome for the one system, you should compare it to the ideal outcome of the other, i.e. an enlightened democracy. An enlightened democracy is preferable.
1.8.3.1. Con: The best version of an enlightened despot would still be more effective than the best version of an enlightened democratically elected leader. No term limits, no election campaigns, no gridlocks in parliament - there would be less possible obstacles that would get in the way.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: If we are talking about an ideal form of democracy, then term limits etc would have no bearing on the effectiveness of the government.
1.8.3.1.2. Con: It's just as fair to assume that the best version of a democracy would have one great democratically elected leader after another as it is to assume that, over time, one despot after another will be suitably enlightened.
1.8.3.2. Con: But comparing enlightened despotism to enlightened democracy, the former is far easier to accomplish than the latter. You only need one person to be enlightened to achieve enlightened despotism, but you need everyone to be enlightened in an enlightened democracy.
1.8.3.2.1. Con: It can more easily go wrong, too. If your single despot becomes corrupted, your situation is ruined whereas it requires a majority of your democrats to be corrupted to spoil the alternative system.
1.8.3.2.1.1. Con: A minority of corrupt democrats can use the democratic system itself to spread dissent and install a corrupt regime.
1.8.3.3. Pro: We must compare the ideal outcome for each system in order for the comparison to be valid. If we fail to specify whether the democracy in question is "enlightened", "flawed" or somewhere in between, then it will be impossible to come to a conclusion as to which system is superior because any such conclusion will rely on implicit assumptions about where the Democracy lands on that spectrum.
1.8.4. Pro: Democracies are vulnerable to populists seducing and corrupting the masses. A despot relying on expert support does not have this problem.
1.8.4.1. Con: Experts might be knowledgeable, but they are also subject to corruption and selfishness
1.8.4.2. Con: Democratic governments also rely on experts, so there isn't really a difference here.
1.8.5. Pro: In Representative Democracy, a fraction of a percent control the power.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Public opinion has [“near-zero” impact on U.S. law](https://represent.us/action/theproblem-3/), according to A Princeton University study.
1.8.5.2. Pro: The predominant power in the United States belongs to those who have the money, specifically [owners of income-producing land and businesses](https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/class_domination.html) \(Banks, corporations, agribusinesses, and big real estate developers\).
1.8.5.3. Pro: 0.02% of Americans dictate the first stage of electing candidates. -[TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE)
1.8.5.4. Con: They are elected officials, as giving power to the many comes with many downsides - it's important to give a fraction of the populace the power to keep from chaos.
1.8.5.4.1. Con: The problem with current democracies is not that the power is in the hands of a few elected officials, but that the power is dominated by a few unelected elites.
1.8.5.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.1.
1.8.5.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.2.
1.8.5.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.3.
1.8.5.4.2. Pro: Liquid Democracy would be susceptible to the whims of the people, which could lead to instability, lack of direction, and even chaos.
1.8.5.4.2.1. Pro: The government would become less stable.
1.8.5.4.2.1.1. Con: Stability of executive and legislative branches can be split.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2. Pro: Sudden changes in public opinion could cause drastic policy changes.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Some sudden changes in public opinion *should* cause drastic policy changes.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Large changes affecting the democratic set-up of a country should happen slowly not suddenly, with time given to debate and study the options once public opinion shows a desire for change. This gives time for the best option to be found.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The decisions under vote should be carefully selected in a Liquid Democracy, to ensure that only decisions appropriate for a public vote are put to the public, and the quantity of votes are appropriate.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: No vote should be held which is impossible or not clearly implementable, for example a sudden change of law which does not account for conflicts with other parts of law, or an unachievable goal for example "vote to cut all taxes by half".
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: A group choosing the voting agenda has potentially abusable power.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Proper checks and balances would stop this group from abusing power. Those checks would be enforceable by military/police, because this group would not have control over them.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A Liquid Democracy could have a similar system of [Checks and Balances](https://www.britannica.com/topic/checks-and-balances) as existing Democracies, with seperation of power between legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Minorities could be protected by having liquid democracy only enabled in one branch of government, say the Legislative. That way they still have access to judicial review.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: A strong constitution that limits what can be legislated would be critical to a successful implementation of Liquid Democracy.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: This would prevent the ability of voters to vote for money to be given to themselves to the point of bankrupting the government.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: This would prevent leglislation which, for example, infringes on human rights.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Requiring a higher threshold when a vote is more important could ensure drastic changes are controlled. For example, voting to go to war or to change basic freedoms may require a minimum voter turnout and a larger supermajority to pass the vote.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Using a [supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority) instead of a 50% +1 majority will reduce the effects of inappropriate majority control.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: A large majority may be impossible
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The [2012 Egyptian election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_presidential_election,_2012) had a 46% voter turnout and the winner had 25% of the votes cast.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Making a decision with a small majority is a sign that the decision may well be the wrong one. Most democratic changes should require a large majority, with the exception of time-sensitive changes, which could be handled by the executive branch.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: If there is low voter turnout and/or those who do vote are very divided, extremist measures can pass.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: As voters can withdraw their vote at any moment, the ability of parties \(and consequentially top level delegates\) to push their agendas against the will of their voters would be fundamentally reduced, weakening their influence.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Like capitalism causes companies to die out and be replaced with stronger ones, the same may happen to parties under Liquid Democracy. If political parties begin pushing ideas that are not supported by the public then they would indeed quickly lose votes and influence, but they would just be replaced with parties which do match the political demands of the public. These new parties which do represent their voters interests could be stronger and wield more influence.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.3. Con: If an unpopular measure passes, then many previously unmotivated voters may change their minds and vote.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: This may give too much power to the executive branch.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The decision of having a single leader who has lots of power to do what they want \(ie USA/Brazil - a [Presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system)\), or little power \(ie the UK/Canada/Japan - a [Westminster System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system)\), is a separate decision to being Representative vs Liquid.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: This is similar to the emergency powers and executive orders that the executive branch in the US has.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: US Executive orders are [often used for non-time-sensitive control](https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/the-use-and-abuse-executive-orders-and-other-presidential-directives) of the country. An ideal system would only allow executive power to overrule/skip democratic voting if it is necessary in that moment, and cannot wait for the full democratic process.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: Any such decisions that turn out to be bad could be changed by the voters in the aftermath.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: In the US, executive orders can [number in the thousands](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php) per President. At these quantities, they are too numerous for a finite senate to challenge them all. Liquid Democracy might be more effective at checking presidential power, as increased popular dissatisfaction with executive decisions can be met with increased numbers of empowered groups doing the work to lobby against the decision, draft/propose alternative legislation, and actually trigger a vote to change the law.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: This is an improvement over the status quo because it elevates the will of the people over the will of the politicians.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Constituational safeguards could ensure that once an act/bill has been successsfully passed, it can not be repealed or undone by other acts/bills without exceptional circumstances. This would ensure that direction can't change frequently, and agencies and industry have stability when implementing new rules.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.5. Con: Without a strong cohesive party controlling the leglislative branch, existing problems with the [executive branch eroding protecitons and acquiring more power](https://www.cfr.org/article/unconstrained-presidency-checks-and-balances-eroded-long-trump) may worsen.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.5.1. Con: This US example is exasperated by a strongly opposed two party system, where the side with the power in the leglislative branch is most likely to also have control of executive branch. This creates incentive to allow power creep. Under Liquid Democracy the public holds the power in the leglislative branch, and do not have partisan reason to allow increased executive power.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: This is only the case where too much power resides in one political party. The issues in the US are more to do with the lack of political plurality in the system, which does not require a different governance system to resolve, but a more representative range of voting options and/or greater strength of character of politicians.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.2. Con: As the voting agenda is very public, it will be harder for this group to abuse policy direction compared to the existing groups driving policy discussion within government, without the public knowing. Mechanisms to check and remove the groups power would be available if public consensus, or the current country leader \(president, prime minister etc..\), agrees that abuse is occurring.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3. Con: This is already an issue with Representative Democracies, where the public has no little to no input on the topics voted on by their representatives.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Usually the candidates publish a manifesto containing an indication of the measures they would like to progress whilst in government and the public input is in choosing one of these hopefully coherent packages.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: ... [Usually](https://thebrexitparty.com/)...
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Between 1987 and 2005, [88%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32350493) of majority UK governments fufilled their manifesto pledges.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: A Liquid Democracy system could be very conservative in public votes, and keep most decisions to appropriate government bodies. A half dozen broad votes a year on hot topics \(or wider-direction decisions\) may provide the best balance between democratic will and efficient/stable governance.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: By voting a set of goals over a fixed term which is only changed in special circumstances eg war/ economic crisis, you give those responsible definite targets which they can be held accountable to.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: If votes are too broad they are open to interpretation, meaning that the people implementing the decisions have free reign to control the detail unopposed. The public may feel the outcome is not what they wanted.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Some examples of Direct Democracy like the [Brexit-Vote](https://www.businessinsider.com/britain-bregret-theresa-may-soft-brexit-2018-5) show that Direct Democracy can produce have highly controversial results.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Controversy might not be bad. Especially since often in Liquid Democracy models there is an option to change one's vote at any time.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Brexit may not be a good example, as it was not a legally binding referendum. If it was, a supermajority would likely have been required - removing the risk of a controversial result.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.4. Con: If the citizens had a way of directly putting their concerns on the ballot \(perhaps with a certain number of signatures\) this would counterbalance the power of whatever institution "normally" decides what is voted on.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Publicly suggested votes can function well. Switzerland [allows the public to suggest popular initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative_\(Switzerland\)#Federal_popular_initiative)\(100,000 signatures required\). Issues are directly voted on, which has resulted in 22 changes in federal, cantonal and municipal law.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.4.2. Con: The UK has a petition system which has enabled [59](https://petition.parliament.uk/) topics to be debated in the house of commons, but none have ever resulted in a change of policy.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: When public opinion changes in reaction to sudden events, for example war/catastrophes, a sudden change in policy may be appropriate.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.2. Con: In the US policy sometimes does sometimes change very quickly as a new president or party takes majority.
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: If policy can change on a whim then investors may be uncomfortable investing which would hurt the economy
1.8.5.4.2.1.2.4. Pro: Regular sudden changes in policy would be hard to implement
1.8.5.4.2.1.3. Con: Only in subjects where public opinion is closer to an even split, encouraging the debate of such topics.
1.8.5.4.2.1.4. Con: Measures can be taken to prevent this, such as an enforced refractory period after a change in policy happens.
1.8.5.4.2.1.5. Pro: The unpredictable and volatile sway of mass public opinion would result in an inability to set, implement and deliver stable policy platforms and thus hinder beneficial outcomes.
1.8.5.4.2.1.6. Con: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.2.
1.8.5.4.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.5.4.2.2. Pro: Faster voting and change could lead to chaos as direction on issues is changed frequently and dramatically. This could dramatically affect business competitiveness and international relations.
1.8.5.4.2.2.1. Con: Faster voting is possible, but also anyone can change their vote at any time. Most things would move slowly unless it is literally 50/50 split in the mind of the public/delegates.
1.8.5.4.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.4.
1.8.5.4.2.3. Pro: Decentralisation and democratisation can \(and does, in many cases\) make it hard/impossible to reach actionable decisions.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1. Pro: In 2010 the [German Pirate Party tried Liquid Democracy](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org/issue/1/The_Liquid_Democracy_Journal-Issue001-02-Five_years_of_Liquid_Democracy_in_Germany.html&ved=2ahUKEwj1vvLUpOnbAhXpJ8AKHYs9DP0QFjACegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw2pnLER4b0TkMx8cdIsYZha) but it was not successful.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: Practical experience of the Pirate Party in Germany shows the method to be ineffective due to the enormous \(and failing\) time and money effort to get citizens interested in broad liquid democracy participation. The participant percentages show a rather undemocratic activist minority dominance.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con: There is nothing undemocratic about an activist minority dominance. If anyone doesn't like it, they can become an activist too.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Germanys Pirate Party has shown that with liquid democracy, voting is much more concentrated than with other forms of democracy. Out of 80,000 citizens in Friesland, only 583 \(0,7%\) registered for their platform at all. [Only 382 out of these 583 registered users voted](https://internetunddemokratie.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/liquid-friesland-wurde-eingestellt/) on liquid democracy decisions, and twelve users dominated each of the 76 initiatives.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.2.1. Con: This was a poorly implemented example of Liquid Democracy and so should not be extrapolated from.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The version of Liquid Feedback used had no API and so it had ["an interface only a developer could love."](http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22154/how-german-pirate-partys-liquid-democracy-works) This, less then user friendly, application made it hard for the average user to use.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: ["Liquid Feedback can only be accessed by registered members."](http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22154/how-german-pirate-partys-liquid-democracy-works) This adds another barrier to entry for prospective voters.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: There must be a good reason why only [583 out of the 80,000](https://internetunddemokratie.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/liquid-friesland-wurde-eingestellt/) eligible voters registered. It would seem that the platform was not user friendly and not advertised well enough.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: Germany's Pirate Party Liquid Democracy attempt was abandoned in 2016, because [only 583 citizens of the more than 80,000 authorised users registered for the platform](https://internetunddemokratie.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/liquid-friesland-wurde-eingestellt/) by mid-2015, and votes were neither representative of the general public nor for the general will.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.3.1. Con: An effective implementation of Liquid Democracy requires high voter involvement.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: To achieve high voter turn out, a government or society would need to develop a sense of public duty and pride in voting within the electorate.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.4. Con: The experiment that is stated, tested the usability of liquid democracy in a setting where the stakes were negligible. If the stakes are real, people will participate. This is clearly evidenced by the interest rising in politics significantly during election time.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.4.1. Con: As the stake of any single voter in traditional elections is even more negligible, small stakes cannot explain the abysmal participation in liquid democracy.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.4.2. Con: Proponents of liquid democracy wanted it tested on a small scale first, because they thought it would be easier to mobilise a relevant number of people in a small constituency. This was clearly wrong.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.4.3. Con: As liquid democracy did not work in a test run, the test needs to be acknowledged as wrong. Before moving to a grand scale of societal importance, successful tests are a must.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5. Con: This test was [technically sophisticated](https://www.sebastianjabbusch.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Liquid-Democracy-in-der-Piratenpartei-Eine-Neue-Chance-fur-die-innerparteiliche-Demokratie-im-21-Jahrhundert-By-Sebastian-Jabbusch.pdf) and highly idealistic undertaking but the design [was poor](https://www.sebastianjabbusch.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Liquid-Democracy-in-der-Piratenpartei-Eine-Neue-Chance-fur-die-innerparteiliche-Demokratie-im-21-Jahrhundert-By-Sebastian-Jabbusch.pdf). To encourage participation, usability and sophistication have to be balanced. Thus, this failure need not be a total failure of liquid democracy, but a failure of their take on it.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1. Con: This is a "[no true scotsman](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman)" fallacy. By this mistaken logic, communism has "not" failed in the Soviet Union because it was "not true" communism. Same in North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and all failed communist countries.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1. Con: That is a bad comparison because communism has been tried many times the world over, while Liquid Democracy has only been attempted twice, once before the technology, such as computers and the internet, had advanced enough; the second time was not user friendly enough to achieve widespread adoption.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: It is bad science if the falsification of a hypothesis is being brushed off, with two simplistic generalising counterclaims which do not offer falsifiability.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Any technology driven advancement will require many iterations. Liquid Democracy is no exception.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Successful modern Democracies and Republics had thousands of years of history to build on, and often went through iterations themselves \(such as the US colonies, then the Articles of Confederation, then the US Constitution, which has been added to over the years\). Making a new form of government is not likely to work on the first try.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.3. Con: The claims in the grandparent can be falsified.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.4. Con: The "No True Scotsman" fallacy is a logical claim, not a scientific hypothesis.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.5. Con: Scientific experiments usually don't work on the first try. Learning is accomplished and then, if still unsatisfied, another attempt is made.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.2. Con: "User friendliness" is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the success of a man-machine system. If "usability" had been the key problem of liquid democracy, it would have been easy for the promoters to fix as this is a well known field with many capable practitioners.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: User friendliness is being improved with the [implementations of APIs.](http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22154/how-german-pirate-partys-liquid-democracy-works)
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: That quote from 2012 preceeds the failure of the liquid democracy project, hence logically it either did not improve it enough or - much more likely - the liquid variant is just a brain wave, but not a viable form of democracy. Both reasons are sufficient to make us look for better alternatives rather than ride a dead horse.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: There is an unlimited number of other \(and more plausible\) reasons why the liquid democracy project has failed, other than simply the one "user friendliness".
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.

1.8.5.4.2.3.1.5.2. Pro: [Surveys indicated](https://www.sebastianjabbusch.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Liquid-Democracy-in-der-Piratenpartei-Eine-Neue-Chance-fur-die-innerparteiliche-Demokratie-im-21-Jahrhundert-By-Sebastian-Jabbusch.pdf) that the Pirate Party's test failed due to a total focus on sophisticated representation of every single detail, overwhelming and deterring most users.
1.8.5.4.2.3.1.6. Con: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.3.1.2.1.
1.8.5.4.2.3.2. Pro: The amount of communication and compromising needed to come to a decision grows exponentially with the size of the group making the decision.
1.8.5.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: A dictator could, in theory, be the most efficient decision maker possible.
1.8.5.4.2.3.2.2. Con: Compromising and communicating is the nature of democracy.
1.8.5.4.2.3.2.2.1. Con: The compromising that is so important in Representative Democracy may not happen when everyone can vote on issues, at least not with a majority or super-majority.
1.8.5.4.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.
1.8.5.4.2.3.4. Con: Most votes are for or against a single bill, so the parent issue would not be a common problem.
1.8.5.4.2.4. Con: The reason that current democracies need limitation is that government's natural tendency is toward tyranny. Liquid Democracy is a step away from tyranny.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1. Con: There is no clear understanding of the technical or structural limitations of liquid democracy and it is therefore unclear whether it is a step away from, or toward tyranny.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2. Con: Liquid Democracy is a step away from tyranny because it fundamentally puts more power in the hands of people.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.1. Con: "The people" are entirely capable of exercising [tyranny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) shows that the majority of an electorate can and does place its own interests above, and at the expense of, those in the minority.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The Tyranny of the Majority, can be limited by a constitution that sets the framework for a political system running Liquid Democracy.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.4.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: Generally, people are self interested, and so value not being oppressed. A logical person will try to prevent their neighbor from being oppressed so that they will return the favor.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.2.1. Con: People's [self-interest](https://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/summer-2009-thrift-the-double-edged-virtue/who-voted-for-hitler/) does not have a great [track record](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) in preventing oppression.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In Germany, popular support for the Nazis was [between 27 and 39%](https://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/summer-2009-thrift-the-double-edged-virtue/who-voted-for-hitler/) in the early 1930s.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The 27% in 1932 and the 39% in 1933 made the national socialist party the most popular party in a hung parliament, with the 1933 result leading on to von Hindenburg appointing Hitler as chancellor, the seizure of power via the Reichstag Fire Decree and Enabling Act and the dismantling of democracy from there.
1.8.5.4.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The nazis actions were publically supported. [Robert Gellately writes that](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205609.001.0001/acprof-9780198205609) "the Germans generally turned out to be proud and pleased that Hitler and his henchmen were putting away certain kinds of people who did not fit in, or who were regarded as 'outsiders', 'asocials', 'useless eaters', or 'criminals'". He adds that many 'ordinary' Germans not only supported Nazi terror passively, but actually helped make it possible with a 'flood of denunciations' to the police.
1.8.6. Pro: Democracy has no mechanism for long-term thinking. An enlightened despot is better able to make decisions beneficial in the long-run than the public in a democracy.
1.8.6.1. Con: The burden of proof claiming that democracy has no mechanism for long-term thinking lies on the claim to prove. The inherit balance of powers within a democracy is a self-repairing system aimed at long term survival.
1.8.6.2. Con: This assumes that short term thinking is something that should be avoided. If a country is too focused 25-50 years out then it could easily miss a near term opportunity to gain economic/political advantage.
1.8.6.2.1. Con: As we are talking about an enlightened despot there is no reason to assume an opportunity will not be recognised for what it is.
1.8.6.3. Con: There is no general agreement about what "long-term" actually means, hence democracy and despotism cannot easily be compared in this regard
1.8.7. Con: Just because democracy suffers from flaws does not mean that other systems are any less flawed and superior.
1.8.8. Pro: Democracies waste a lot of time and resources [reversing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/24/what-trump-has-undone/?utm_term=.418b9554bd25) [policies](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/12/22/10-obama-regulations-trump-has-overturned/23315217/#) of previous administrations.
1.8.8.1. Con: Reform is the basis of political change. If one government had complete sovereignty, the [power paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS9VHBlYklc) tells us that power compounds and changes our psychological view on other people to the lesser.
1.8.9. Con: Using the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as an example, history tells us that even enlightened despots are doomed to fail when even utilizing a democratic system. The case of Catherine the Great and Stanislaw II Augustus reminds of just how dangerous centralized power can be, even if there is no perceived-nefarious intent, and eventually lead to the demise of even democratic institutions to absolutism.
1.9. Con: Despotism is inherently inferior to democracy due to a lack of legitimacy.
1.9.1. Con: Legitimacy is seen here as a result of the system of rule, not the other way around. But the rules of democracy initially describes it legitimately within itself and than continue to justify itself using those discussions, giving only the appearance they are one and the same.
1.9.2. Pro: Despotism is inherently wrong because it doesn't legitimately represent the individual.
1.9.2.1. Pro: A despot could not possibly know policies his/her people truly wish for.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Modern polling makes it relatively easy even for despots to figure out the will and preferences of the public.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: What people wish for is not necessarily what is good for them or the country as a whole. An enlightened despot may thus be wise to ignore public demands.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: Even in non-democratic countries like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_and_dissent_in_China), [Vietnam](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/vietnam-month-mass-protests), and [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_demonstrations_in_Singapore), public protests can and do occur. This shows the regimes the true wishes of the people, even if they are suppressed.
1.9.2.2. Pro: An enlightened despot should be viewed like a benevolent slave master. Even if a despot acts in the best interest of people, this impedes on their autonomy and their freedom to act in ways that might not be in their best interest
1.9.2.3. Con: "Inherently" is just a [semantic stop sign](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FWMfQKG3RpZx6irjm/semantic-stopsigns). There is nothing in the laws of physics that say that despotism is wrong. We decide this, just as we [decided what human rights should be](http://www.ynharari.com/topic/power-and-imagination/).
1.9.3. Pro: The Enlightened Despot would be viewed as an illegitimate leader by part of the population and many democratic countries, increasing the likelihood of internal and external conflict.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Despotism will strain diplomatic relations with democratic countries.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Not according to US relations with multiple other countries. Look at the US and Saudi Arabia, US and South Africa during the apartheid years, and US and Iran pre-coup years with the Shah. They not only got along with these men, but also have stabilized their power.
1.9.3.1.2. Con: Democratic states have an incentive to keep autocrats of other nations in power: You only need to pay the autocrat to do as you wish, instead of paying/convincing the entire population of his/her country.
1.9.3.1.2.1. Pro: The US [supported](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09CAIRO874_a.html) Hosni Mubarak in Egypt for decades, providing his government with billions of dollars and military equipment.
1.9.3.1.2.2. Con: This would not apply Enlighted Despotism, as the despot is assumed to not be corrupt, and instead "attempt to maximize social welfare and happiness within the nation".
1.9.3.1.3. Pro: Autocracies are [more likely to start wars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook).
1.9.3.1.3.1. Con: The Enlightened Despot, dedicated first and foremost to elevating the people, would not go to war lightly.
1.9.3.1.3.2. Pro: An autocratic leader / despot has less to loose if some of his subjects die in war, as his power is not dependent on the people's opinion of him.
1.9.3.2. Pro: The virtue of democracy is not its efficiency but rather its legitimacy.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: Government exists to serve the people and a government is legitimate insofar as it serves the people well. If a enlightened despotism does this more effectively than a democracy, then it is more legitimate.
1.9.3.2.1.1. Con: A government can maintain power by serving a minority of the people at the expense of the majority.
1.9.3.2.1.2. Con: Serving the people well is subjective.
1.9.3.2.1.3. Con: In a democracy, legitimacy of a ruler is not derived from a ruler's effectiveness but from their being selected and agreed to by the population. Many people \(e.g. supporters of democracy, by definition\) would rather have an inefficient but democratically elected ruler than a slightly more effective despot.
1.9.3.2.1.4. Con: A despot might not allow criticism of their failures.
1.9.3.2.2. Pro: Democracy provides a government with legitimacy as it is based on a social contract, as [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#John_Locke%27s_Second_Treatise_of_Government_\(1689\)) argued. Citizens agree to delegate certain rights to the government, for example the rights of violence and taxation, and in return are provided with an impartial judge and guarantor of their safety.
1.9.3.2.2.1. Pro: Other forms of government do not serve this ideal as well as democracy as they usually deny citizens the right and the mechanisms to change or withdraw from this contract.
1.9.3.2.3. Pro: Democratic governance derives its legitimacy from the fact that a majority of those governed support the government.
1.9.3.2.4. Pro: A comparison between systems must take into consideration the conditions that give rise to each - despotism arises because people fail to take responsibility for their circumstances.
1.9.4. Con: Legitimacy can come [through performance](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-011-9140-8) and the successful accomplishment of political goals that are in the population's interest.
1.9.5. Con: According to [Max Weber](http://anthropos-lab.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Weber-Politics-as-a-Vocation.pdf), if a leader is truly charismatic she will gain not just the recognition to rule, but the devotion of her people which is beyond legal obedience and closer to pure faith - the ultimate form of legitimacy.
