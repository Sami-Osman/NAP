Discussion Name: Should the EU have its own army?

1. The European Union should create a centrally controlled army in addition to the armies of member states.
1.1. Con: An EU army could negatively affect member states' sovereignty to make independent foreign policy.
1.1.1. Pro: Any attempt to deploy the EU Army outside Europe could entangle member states in ill-advised or unwinnable foreign conflicts.
1.1.1.1. Con: The EU could make it possible for states to choose not to send their troops into such conflicts.
1.1.1.2. Pro: NATO membership has led several EU member states [to send troops to Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO#War_in_Afghanistan), to fight in a costly war that many believe is [unwinnable](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/world/asia/afghanistan-war.html).
1.1.2. Pro: Inclusion in a European Army could undermine the neutrality of member states such as Ireland, Sweden, Finland, and Austria.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Neutrality is currently a [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_neutrality) part of Irish foreign policy.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Irish government has already come [under pressure](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/government-accused-of-seeking-to-join-eu-big-boys-on-defence-1.3800079) earlier this year after reports that it had sought closer cooperation on European defence projects.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Article 29.9](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thejournal.ie/readme/if-we-are-heading-for-an-eu-army-what-does-that-mean-for-irish-neutrality-4331443-Nov2018/%3famp=1) of the Irish Constitution states: "The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State."
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Ireland has shown signs that it may redefine or move away from its neutral status.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Ireland allows the US to land and refuel military aircraft at Shannon Airport. This has been said to be [inconsistent](https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2019/0115/1023314-a-question-of-neutrality-and-shannon-airport/) with the idea of neutrality.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: After Ireland signed up to [PESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Structured_Cooperation), Fine Gael MEP [Brian Hayes](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thejournal.ie/readme/if-we-are-heading-for-an-eu-army-what-does-that-mean-for-irish-neutrality-4331443-Nov2018/%3famp=1) called for the ‘redefinition of neutrality’, as well as ‘amending Ireland’s triple lock system’.
1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Irish Taoiseach [Leo Varadkar](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.independent.ie/irish-news/neutrality-is-different-now-says-varadkar-36434630.html) claimed that neutrality meant "something different now" and that his country was not neutral when it came to human trafficking, the migrant crisis, and cyber attacks.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The 1955 Austrian State Treaty and its constitution bind Austria to [neutrality](http://nato.gov.si/eng/topic/national-security/neutral-status/neutral-countries/) by prohibiting entry into military alliances and the establishment of foreign military bases on Austrian territory.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The principle of neutrality has been key in Finnish foreign policy for over 150 years \([p. 188](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aUr7TDC8x2MC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=finland%27s+neutrality+150+years&source=bl&ots=Bd-WdYY8af&sig=ACfU3U1EMFi_ynAnBZ94F49OicEkF_wBEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY2Le3sIboAhUMThUIHe9zAIAQ6AEwEXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=finland's%20neutrality%20150%20years&f=false)\).
1.1.2.3.1. Con: In recent years Finland has been moving away from the principle of neutrality. Finland [joined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Finland) the EU Battlegroups in 2006 and NATO Response Force in 2008.
1.1.2.4. Con: Sweden has largely abandoned its foreign policy stance of neutrality in recent years.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: In 2014, Sweden adopted a foreign policy which emphasized the importance of [conflict prevention](https://centreforfeministforeignpolicy.org/journal/2019/11/11/how-feminist-is-the-swedish-feminist-foreign-policy).
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Sweden entered into mutual self-defence treaties with the EU in [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_neutrality#Today).
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: In [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_NATO) Sweden became a NATO affiliate.
1.1.2.4.4. Pro: [43% of Swedes](https://www.politico.eu/article/under-threat-sweden-rediscovers-its-viking-spirit-nato-russia/) now support becoming a full member of NATO.
1.1.3. Con: Any agreements made at the supra-national level could be opted out of if member states disagree.
1.1.3.1. Con: Opt-outs within the EU framework would lead to disintegration, as it would be an abandonment of [unity](https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-explainer-two-speed-multispeed-europe/28396591.html) as a central operating pillar of the EU.
1.1.3.2. Pro: [Denmark](https://english.eu.dk/en/denmark_eu/danishoptouts) is an example of how opt-outs can work. With opt-outs in place, those member states that are interested in further integration can still pursue it, without infringing on the sovereignty of other member states.
1.2. Con: The political will to finance an EU standing army does not exist.
1.2.1. Con: Creating a common EU army might reduce the overall cost of defending Europe, because countries would stop duplicating one another's military capacities.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Security experts found that a European Army would create economies of scale in European defence and lower costs. \([p. 109-110](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10242690302921)\).
1.2.1.2. Con: Creating an EU Army in addition to existing European armies would not end the problem of duplicated capacities, it would simply add a twenty-eighth army to the existing twenty-seven.
1.2.2. Pro: Many EU member states currently don't meet their military spending obligations to NATO.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Only six EU members](https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-jens-stoltenberg-donald-trump-8-countries-to-hit-defense-spending-target/) are currently meeting NATO's target of military spending of 2% of GDP.
1.2.3. Con: The European Defence Fund will receive [€1.5 billion](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/pl/memo_17_1476) a year as of 2021.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Of the European Defence Fund, [€525 million](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-1717_en.htm) has already been specifically allocated to support collaborative defence projects.
1.2.4. Con: The EU intends to invest [€13 billion](https://www.iiss.org/blogs/analysis/2019/01/macron-european-army-reality) in defence research, development, and equipment between 2021 and 2027.
1.2.5. Pro: Without Britain's military capacity, the EU would [need to invest](https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-europe-en-formation-2019-2-page-41.html#) in substantial equipment and personnel to meet current shortfalls.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [Almost 25%](https://iea.org.uk/debate-should-the-eu-have-an-army/) of the EU's military expenditure comes from the UK.
1.2.6. Pro: The German Defence Minister has estimated that the budget increase for 2019 should have been [five times higher](https://www.dw.com/cda/en/german-government-clashes-over-defense-spending/a-43622812) to meet current defence needs.
1.3. Con: An EU army would increase Euroscepticism.
1.3.1. Pro: Any attempt to deploy the EU Army would be hugely controversial within member states, as populations would see their troops being endangered as part of a European project they would not necessarily support.
1.3.1.1. Con: The European Union [requires unanimity](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/unanimity/) for decisions related to foreign and security policies. Therefore it is unlikely that troops would be deployed without the support of every member state.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: The designs for a European Army pushed by Germany and France also [include](https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-emmanuel-macron-eu-army-to-complement-nato/) the removal of treaty provisions that require unanimity in security and defence issues, instead opting for a qualified majority system.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The proposed deployment of troops to Iraq in 2003 was met with [record-breaking protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War) in countries across the world, many of them members of the EU.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: An anti-Iraq war rally of three million people in Rome is the [largest anti-war protest in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War).
1.3.1.3. Pro: Historically, the deployment of troops to a war zone has become progressively more unpopular as the public learns details of the conflict.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: The increased reliance on [unmanned weaponry](https://www.ft.com/content/6346dd78-322d-11ea-9703-eea0cae3f0de) and small tactical military units make it unlikely that an EU army's support would be stymied by large numbers of casualties.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: As the public learns that its forces are suffering casualties, a ["body bag effect"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307938985_Did_the_Iraq_War_Have_a_Body_Bag_Effect) is created, whereby public support for military intervention declines. This decline in support could also exist for the EU itself.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Media coverage of a war's horrors often leads to a corresponding decline in public support for the deployment of troops. This is a phenomenon sometimes known as ["the CNN effect".](https://www.e-ir.info/2011/08/11/the-cnn-effect-and-somalia/)
1.3.1.4. Con: It wouldn't be any more controversial than NATO missions. Many European NATO members [don't like](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_51977.htm) extra-territorial US interventions, but still take part.
1.3.2. Pro: Any casualties suffered by the EU Army would be highly politicised, with anti-EU campaigners claiming them as symbols of why member states should leave.
1.3.2.1. Con: NATO forces have already faced [significant casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan) in Afghanistan and elsewhere without calls for abandonment of NATO, even when most recent military interventions have been ['American'](https://thefederalist.com/2018/07/24/iraq-afghanistan-wars-soured-americans-nato/) rather than European conflicts. It is unclear why a similar logic would not apply to EU army casualties.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Spanish politicians faced criticism over the country's NATO involvement on account of the [deaths](http://seven Spanish military intelligence officers) of seven Spanish military intelligence officers in 2003.
1.3.2.2. Con: Casualties suffered during war often unite different aisles of opinion rather than divide them.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: [World War II unified](https://europe.unc.edu/the-end-of-wwii-and-the-division-of-europe/) former economic rivals against the much greater threat in Nazi Germany.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: The effect of '[othering](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/08/us-vs-them-the-sinister-techniques-of-othering-and-how-to-avoid-them)' the enemy is to create an 'us v them' complex that unifies people on each side.
1.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.
1.3.3. Pro: Many supporters of Brexit [argued](https://www.cer.eu/insights/eu-army-four-reasons-it-will-not-happen) that staying within the EU would force the UK to be part of an EU army.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Misinformation regarding the EU army is thought to have [played a role](https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2016/07/how-myth-eu-army-bolstered-brexit-vote/129746/) in the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the Union.
1.3.3.2. Con: There are many reasons to believe that the UK is not representative of the EU as a whole.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The UK is more [militaristic](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/26/growing-culture-of-militarism-in-uk) than other EU nations, and its attitude to military affairs should not be taken as representative. In particular, the pride that the UK takes in its army makes it unlikely to support a European army, which may supersede its own.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: The UK spends [vastly more](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20180518-1?inheritRedirect=true) on its military than any other member of the EU.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con: France has a [higher](https://www.kialo.com/the-state-would-likely-be-dominated-by-the-interests-of-powerful-actors-30339.250?path=30339.0~30339.1_30339.531-30339.250) military strength than the UK.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Many EU states have adopted constitutions designed to promote pacifism.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The German Constitution [specifically prohibits](http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/NZYbkIntLaw/2008/26.html) “Angriffskrieg”, which translates as “offensive war”. However, the meaning in German is [somewhat broader](https://noelmaurer.typepad.com/aab/2010/06/the-historical-roots-of-german-pacifism.html), encompassing almost anything but self-defence.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: British public opinion and political culture glorifies recent military history, [especially the Second World War](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/27/brexit-britain-myths-wartime-darkest-hour-dunkirk-nationalist-fantasies), to an extent that would be unthinkable in comparably-sized countries like [France](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32956736) or [Germany](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40172317).
1.3.3.2.1.4. Con: Many other EU states are quite [militaristic](https://www.kialo.com/the-state-would-likely-be-dominated-by-the-interests-of-powerful-actors-30339.250?path=30339.0~30339.1_30339.531-30339.250).
1.3.3.3. Con: Most [polling data](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/?p=1153) published after the election suggests that concerns about an EU army were not part of the major reasons people voted for Leave.
1.3.4. Con: [76%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiKsoXG4-ThAhUCsXEKHQQTBaQQFjACegQIARAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fcommfrontoffice%2Fpublicopinion%2Findex.cfm%2FResultDoc%2Fdownload%2FDocumentKy%2F84930&usg=AOvVaw3hclo0fezItIJTCmQEznBw) of EU citizens support a common EU defence policy \(p.29\).
1.3.4.1. Pro: Support is [high](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statista.com/chart/amp/16756/percentage-of-respondents-who-support-the-creation-of-an-eu-army/) for a European Army within member states with 74 percent of respondents in the Netherlands and Belgium supporting an EU army.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The neutral member states are [not](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statista.com/chart/amp/16756/percentage-of-respondents-who-support-the-creation-of-an-eu-army/) as supportive of an EU Army, with 45 percent in Austria, 46 percent in Ireland, 42 percent in Finland, 55 percent in Malta, and just 40 percent in Sweden.
1.3.4.2. Con: Eurosceptic parties are often most successful when they highlight the [large sums of money](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13160367) countries pay to the EU, even if for popular policies.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: For example, even though EU funding gave [substantial investment](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/common-fisheries-policy) to UK fisheries, many of those areas still abhored the amount of money being spent on EU projects.
1.3.5. Con: A collective security union within the EU would increase [economic integration](https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/0486-the-sword-and-the-market-a-defence-union-would-strengthen-european-economic-integration) in Europe.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Successful negotiations on a sticky issue like defence could help set a positive precedent for other negotiations on contested issues in the future - such as immigration and the common market - through building trust and confidence in cooperation.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Immigration is currently a highly [contested](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/immigration-europe-sweden-elections-brexit) issue within the EU.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: Even if this is true a failure of these negotiations could complicate future talks regarding further integration.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Forming an EU army would require common decision making over shared resources that would imply the need for alignment of executive control and democratic accountability. Such decision making structures could provide a model for closer [economic integration.](https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/0486-the-sword-and-the-market-a-defence-union-would-strengthen-european-economic-integration)
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Given the [recorded economic benefits](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/07/01/the-uk-has-been-one-of-the-main-beneficiaries-from-free-movement-of-labour-in-the-eu/) of free movement have [failed to persuade](https://www.politico.eu/article/poll-three-quarters-of-brits-back-dramatic-fall-in-immigration/) many Europeans that free movement is a good thing, it is unlikely that collective security would be enough to protect it from criticism.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: Most calls to restrict border movement are by reason of avoiding [terrorist attacks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/17/the-paris-attacks-could-mark-the-end-of-europes-open-borders-if-the-far-right-has-its-way/). It is unclear how a standing army would end a fear of terrorism.
1.4. Pro: A centrally controlled army would increase the EU's ability to defend itself and its allies.
1.4.1. Pro: Russia currently poses a [large threat](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-needs-to-recognise-the-threat-from-russia/) to the safety of Europe.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Europeans can no longer [rely](https://www.theweek.co.uk/98495/fact-check-does-the-eu-want-a-european-super-army) on the US to defend them after President Donald Trump pulled out of the 1987 nuclear treaty with Russia, effectively removing Europe's protection from nuclear weapons.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Russia is likely to increase its armament in the near future, after the [collapse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty) of the [1987 treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty) banning medium-range ground-launched missiles.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: President Macron has already said that Europe will be the "[main victim](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46108633)" of this development.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Germany is already [reconsidering](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-germany-anger-at-trump-throws-cold-war-nuclear-pact-into-question-11549976449) its support for the 'nuclear shield' that the US has provided against the threat of a Russian nuclear attack since the Cold War.
1.4.1.2. Con: Relations between Russia and the EU have improved greatly in recent years.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Russia and Germany have recently started construction on a new [gas pipeline](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germany-tells-us-to-mind-its-own-business-over-nord-stream-2/) between the two nations, increasing economic integration with each other.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Many countries have [objected](https://www.dw.com/en/the-unclear-future-of-nord-stream-2-russias-controversial-gas-pipeline/a-52357665) to the new pipeline making it unclear if it ever will be completed.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Russia has recently be [readmitted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-rights-council-russia/council-of-europe-readmits-russia-five-years-after-suspension-over-crimea-idUSKCN1TQ1VL) to the council of Europe after a 5 year suspension.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: [Relations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43581449) between Russia and the West are at record low levels.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Pro: [Tensions have substantially increased](http://time.com/5564207/russia-nato-relationship/) between the West and Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea.
1.4.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The EU has already implemented a comprehensive [sanctions regime](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/) against Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Any further escalation could risk military confrontation.
1.4.1.2.3.2. Con: Germany and Russia's diplomatic relationship has been [improving](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/germany-russia-are-getting-closer%E2%80%94heres-why-26116).
1.4.1.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.3.1.1.
1.4.1.2.4. Con: French President Emmanuel Marcon has [previously said](https://www.rferl.org/a/france-urges-european-army-to-defend-against-russia-u-s-/29586020.html) that the EU urgently needs an army to defend itself from Russia and the US.
1.4.1.2.4.1. Con: Defence experts have [dismissed](https://www.iiss.org/blogs/analysis/2019/01/macron-european-army-reality) Macron's comments as mere political provocation.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Tensions are currently [increasing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/27/russia-to-charge-ukrainian-sailors-as-kerch-crisis-deepens) between Russia and Ukraine. If conflict were to break out, this battle would be on the border of the EU.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: [In 2014,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93European_Union_relations) Ukraine was vying for membership [in both the EU and NATO](https://freedomhouse.org/article/ukraine-countering-russian-intervention-and-supporting-democratic-state). A full-scale war in Ukraine against Russia could force the EU's hand in [order to retain its credibility.](https://theconversation.com/we-war-gamed-an-escalation-of-the-ukraine-russia-crisis-heres-what-it-taught-us-about-the-real-world-113802)
1.4.1.4. Pro: Russia is one of a number of countries which are members of the [Collective Security Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization).
1.4.2. Pro: A single [chain of command](https://strategiccfo.com/chain-of-command/) would allow an EU army to be deployed [faster](https://www.thenewfederalist.eu/making-europe-stronger-why-the-eu-needs-a-common-army?lang=fr) than the joint deployment of all member states in the event of a crisis.
1.4.2.1. Con: A combined EU army would be much larger than those of individual nations. As such, the number of people involved in the chain of command might make it more cumbersome to deploy the army.
1.4.3. Con: An EU army would be incredibly difficult to establish and manage.
1.4.3.1. Con: A policy being hard to implement is not a valid criticism of the policy itself.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Even if implemented perfectly, overcoming difficulty comes at a cost, making a more difficult-to-implement policy a more costly policy. Thus, such a policy is worse, so it's a valid criticism.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Deployment and command of an EU army would be extremely difficult.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: European nations might want to [keep](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-european-army-would-be-total-disaster-37817) their national armies or be unwilling to give up control of their troops, which leaves fewer resources for a pan-European army and command issues within the EU army structure.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Despite Germany being a strong supporter of an EU army, the German Defence Minister has [stated](https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_fighting_words_risks_of_loose_talk_about_a_european_army) that the Bundestag’s control of German armed forces is not up for debate.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: Since 2007 the EU has consistently failed to agree on the deployment of its [EU Battle Groups](https://www.cer.eu/insights/eu-army-four-reasons-it-will-not-happen).
1.4.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: The EU has [never deployed](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-17/the-european-army-that-has-never-been-in-a-fight/10506466) its Battlegroups on account of its failure to achieve unanimity. Given this is only a limited force, it is unclear how EU members could agree on the deployment of a full-scale army.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The optimization of military capabilities of various member states on the use of a common language would require a long period of time to adapt and standardise.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: It is unlikely that all military personnel throughout Europe are proficient in one language; training costs to improve communication would be expensive.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: Many national armies, notably that of [India](https://www.quora.com/In-which-language-do-Indian-Army-soldiers-communicate), consist of troops who speak several different languages.
1.4.3.2.2.3. Con: The language barrier does not prevent the smooth operation of NATO.
1.4.3.2.3. Con: A standing army could be managed in a similar manner to existing policies such as the [Common Security and Defence Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy).
1.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: Since 1999 the EU has carried out [30 military operations](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/fact-figures/what-is-the-common-security-and-defence-policy/) under the Common Security and Defence Policy, many of which have achieved significant mission objectives.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: The EU peace contingent in Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved some of its objectives, specifically maintaining a safe and secure environment, and advancing human rights and gender equality. \([p. 89](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318502143_Analysing_the_Effectiveness_of_EUFOR_Althea_Operation_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina)\)
1.4.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: [Since 2008](https://gcaptain.com/european-union-naval-force-marks-9-years-fighting-pirates-off-somalia/) the EU's anti-piracy operation off the Horn of Africa has disrupted 136 acts of piracy and has assisted in numerous rescue missions for distressed local trading and fishing vessels.
1.4.3.2.3.2. Con: In 2015, the [ECR group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Conservatives_and_Reformists)'s shadow rapporteur [concluded that](https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/special-report/common-security-and-defence-policy-failing-reach-its-potential) Common Security and Defence Policy operations were "inefficient, under-resourced, more concerned with appearance than results, and often irrelevant".
1.4.3.2.4. Con: Many other countries are able to manage operating with shared military resources.
1.4.3.2.4.1. Con: Sharing military resources and working in an alliance is different to an army all working under one central command.
1.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.4.3.2.4.3. Pro: There are currently [41 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Military_Counter_Terrorism_Coalition) of the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition.
1.4.3.2.4.4. Pro: The African Union currently controls the [African Standby Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Standby_Force) which is made up of troops from countries throughout Africa.
1.4.3.2.4.4.1. Con: The African Union's defence forces have been [notably absent](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jan/06/african-union-missing-action-conflicts-mali-south-sudan) in quelling conflict in a number of cases across the African continent. This only further evidences the difficulties in managing continental military alliances.
1.4.3.2.5. Pro: Member states are likely to have [different](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-european-army-would-be-total-disaster-37817) opinions of what actions an EU army should conduct.
1.4.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.3.2.5.2. Con: Management of the EU army could be made to be a non-political body, such as the [EU civil service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Civil_Service).
1.4.3.2.5.2.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that member states would allow other people to make [foreign policy decisions](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-european-army-would-be-total-disaster-37817) which could impact their country.
1.4.3.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: The EU's current security and defence organisation [PESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Structured_Cooperation) is managed by the [European Council](https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/pesco_factsheet_november_2018_en_0.pdf).
1.4.3.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.3.
1.4.3.2.5.4. Pro: Even if they are able to agree, the deployment of the army has to be decided upon quickly enough to have a chance to be operationally successful.
1.4.3.3. Pro: It would be unclear what treaty obligations an EU Army would have.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Given not all EU countries are members of NATO, it would be unclear if NATO - obligations such as [Article V](https://www.history.com/news/nato-article-5-meaning-history-world-war-2) - would apply to an EU Army.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Clear definitions of obligations can be negotiated by member states before the army is formed.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Many EU member states lack the military capacity needed to form an army.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: The [Swiss army](https://www.thelocal.ch/20190221/the-swiss-armys-growing-problem-with-civilian-service) struggles to attract and hold on to military recruits.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: The Swedish military [can not retain](https://taskandpurpose.com/thelongmarch/sweden-military-retention) enough recruits to form a substantial defence.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: The fact that some European states lack the capacity to form an army appears to necessitate a common European army, not preclude it.
1.4.3.4.4. Pro: Germany's military is [virtually undeployable.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/is-germany-s-military-readiness-problem-a-critical-vulnerability-for-nato)
1.4.3.4.4.1. Pro: Only 4 of the Germany military's 128 [Eurofighter jets](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/is-germany-s-military-readiness-problem-a-critical-vulnerability-for-nato) are combat-ready.
1.4.3.4.4.2. Pro: Germany has no [operational](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/is-germany-s-military-readiness-problem-a-critical-vulnerability-for-nato) submarines.
1.4.3.4.4.3. Pro: [1 in 10](https://www.dw.com/en/1-in-10-german-military-pilots-lost-helicopter-licenses-for-lack-of-flight-time/a-43646369) helicopter pilots in the German armed forces lost their flying licences in 2017 because helicopters did not reach flight time targets.
1.4.3.4.4.4. Pro: In 2018 the German military admitted that it had [only 9 operational tanks](https://www.dw.com/en/german-military-short-on-tanks-for-nato-mission/a-42603112).
1.4.3.4.4.5. Pro: A [Parliamentary report](https://www.dw.com/en/german-military-lacks-equipment-and-recruits-says-damning-report/a-47281996) found that the German military lacks significant equipment and recruits.
1.4.3.4.4.6. Con: The development of an EU Army would introduce new standards for readiness, equipment and training, which could prompt modernising efforts in national armies. Thus the armies of member states would become more effective as the result of a European force.
1.4.3.4.5. Con: The stronger EU members have vast military capacities, which could create the basic structure of an army with minimal contributions from weaker members.
1.4.3.4.5.1. Pro: France has its own nuclear deterrent alongside a conventional military force of [215,000 troops](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/europes-4-deadliest-military-powers-12214).
1.4.3.5. Pro: Europe has an unnecessarily large number of weapon systems which will cause logistical issues.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Forming an EU army would lead to better integration of European defence technologies, lessening the confusion that is derived from the lot of different weapon systems.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: A goal of the EU defence fund is to [promote](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/pl/memo_17_1476) the standardisation of equipment.
1.4.3.5.1.2. Con: Most European countries are already [harmonising their armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Structured_Cooperation#Principles) and are constantly [improving their compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Joint_Armament_Cooperation) in weapon systems.
1.4.3.5.2. Pro: Overall, the US has only [30 separate types](https://qz.com/1004687/eu-army-europe-dreams-of-a-common-military-but-has-too-many-types-of-tanks/) of weapon systems in the white paper’s selected categories, versus 178 for the EU.
1.4.3.5.3. Pro: The EU has 17 types of main [battle tank](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-founded-as-project-of-peace-debates-a-militarized-future-nato-european-defense-fund-russia/), while the US has only one.
1.4.3.5.3.1. Con: A design error or a malfunctioning part could affect all available tanks: having different types of hardware diversifies this risk.
1.4.3.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.1.2.
1.4.4. Con: A European army would negatively affect the EU's relationships with other countries.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Other military alliances - such as the Russian dominated [CSTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization) - are likely to see the creation of a European military alliance as further escalation.
1.4.4.2. Con: A stronger, bigger, unified EU army would be a lot more capable of helping out allies in need around the globe, hence strengthening relationships.
1.4.4.3. Pro: America's former President [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) commented on the idea of a European joint military in a tweet, calling Macron’s proposal for an EU army to protect against threats from Russia, China, and even from the United States “[very insulting](https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-emmanuel-macron-eu-army-to-complement-nato/)".
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Trump has also questioned the capacity of the EU to create an army, [mocking](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/13/trump-macron-eu-army-german-second-world-war) France's military performance in the two World Wars.
1.4.5. Con: A European army could risk undermining NATO.
1.4.5.1. Pro: In 2018 the NATO Secretary General suggested that dividing resources to create an EU army would undermine the [one strong and capable command structure](https://www.forces.net/news/what-european-army-and-could-it-become-reality) of NATO.
1.4.5.2. Con: An EU army would not need to replace NATO.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: While it may not have to replace it, a European army would simply [duplicate](https://www.defenceiq.com/army-land-forces/news/will-a-european-army-compliment-nato) what NATO already does, making NATO expendable.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Angela Merkel has publicly stated that an EU army would be "[a positive extension](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/in-defiance-of-trump-merkel-backs-macron-s-call-for-eu-army)" of NATO.
1.4.6. Pro: A European army would reduce the EU's reliance on states such as the US for military assistance.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The [North Atlantic Treaty Organisation \(NATO\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) is a poor means of defending the EU.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: NATO successfully [protected Europe](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/what-is-nato-and-how-does-it-keep-europe-safe/) during [the Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_NATO#Cold_War).
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: NATO's usefulness during the Cold War does not reflect on its usefulness today.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: Moving away from reliance on NATO could create an [opportunity for the EU](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-european-army-is-exactly-what-the-eu-and-uk-needs-a7050571.html) to improve relations with Russia.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.3.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: Unlike NATO where the [US dominates](https://www.no-to-nato.org/2018/11/nato-an-extension-of-us-military-power-and-in-turn-us-economic-power/) decision-making and leads other countries into war, a European Army is much more likely to take decisions by consensus.
1.4.6.1.4. Con: NATO defends Europe through alliances as well as by providing armies. Due to Europe's association through NATO, [members](https://www.google.com/amp/s/foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/22/europes-future-is-as-chinas-enemy/amp/) are unlikely to be a threat to each other.
1.4.6.1.5. Pro: NATO is weakened by internal divisions as several members are military rivals. An EU Army would not have this problem.
1.4.6.1.5.1. Con: The chance of a military rivalry within the EU in the future cannot be ruled out.
1.4.6.1.5.1.1. Pro: Croatia, an EU member, and Serbia, which has aspirations for EU membership in the [near future](https://europost.eu/en/a/view/serbia-hopes-for-eu-membership-by-2026-29742), would present the alliance with a potential military rivalry, since open hostilities between the countries only ended in the [recent past](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-croatia-anniversary-serbia-idUSKCN0QA1MS20150805).
1.4.6.1.5.2. Pro: Territorial and sovereignty disputes in the [Aegean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_dispute) have twice led to diplomatic crises between Greece and Turkey, which came close to the outbreak of military hostilities, in [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Aegean_crisis) and [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%E2%80%93Turkish_relations#Incidents). [Incidents](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/03/greek-coast-guards-fire-turkish-vessel-aegean/) on a smaller scale have continued [ever since](https://in.reuters.com/article/turkey-greece-idINKBN1HN2BH).
1.4.6.1.6. Pro: Being tied to [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) creates substantial risks for EU countries, as it entangles them in US military intervention, which may be ill-advised.
1.4.6.1.6.1. Con: NATO membership only [obliges military action](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm) when a member state has been attacked.
1.4.6.1.6.1.1. Con: Although theoretically NATO members can only be called upon to contribute forces when a NATO member is attacked, this alone can become an unmanageable commitment. The scope of the military action taken may be vast, and it may be unrelated to the original attack.
1.4.6.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: NATO forces are still fighting in Afghanistan seventeen years after the 9/11 attacks led to the start of the conflict there.
1.4.6.1.6.2. Pro: EU foreign military policy is [much less aggressive](https://iea.org.uk/debate-should-the-eu-have-an-army/) than US policy. Should EU military policy be more independent of the US, the EU would be less likely to get entangled in US led conflicts.
1.4.6.1.6.2.1. Con: NATO's [guarantee of collective defence](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/02/nato-70-precious-asset-us-europe-russia-china) is vital to the European objective of maintaining a strong European defence.
1.4.6.1.6.2.1.1. Con: [Trump's statements](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/nato-crisis-trump-s-words-need-to-match-u-s-actions) have cast doubt on the value of the collective defence guarantee promised by NATO to its members.
1.4.6.1.6.2.1.2. Con: [The only time that](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/76784) NATO has invoked Article 5 - its collective defence guarantee - has been in support of its non-European partner the United States, in the aftermath of 9/11.
1.4.6.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.4.6.2. Con: There are better ways of reducing reliance on the US.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: It would be equally possible to strengthen the military of each state separately.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: The desire for self determination provides the clearest incentive to spend on defence. Each individual country will always have an incentive to strengthen its own military.
1.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Greece spends more than 2.5% of its GDP on its national army \([p. 13](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/3_Data%20for%20all%20countries%20from%201988%E2%80%932017%20as%20a%20share%20of%20GDP.pdf)\), and given the ongoing [economic crisis](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/greeces-debt-crisis-timeline) there, it is unlikely they will be able to spend any more on it. The Greek army can therefore not be strengthened independent of an EU army.
1.4.6.3. Pro: EU nations depend heavily on US assistance for all their military operations.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.4.6.3.2. Con: The EU is [moving away](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-europe-us-reliance/) from US dependence.
1.4.6.3.3. Pro: NATO's operations in Libya were [heavily dependent](https://euobserver.com/news/115650) on US intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities which Europe does not have.
1.4.6.3.3.1. Pro: [NATO Chief](https://euobserver.com/news/115650) Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Libyan mission highlighted "significant shortfalls" in many European capabilities, including smart munitions, air-to-air refuelling, and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance.
1.4.6.3.3.2. Pro: [In Libya and Mali](http://time.com/5451852/european-army-emmanuel-macron-trump/), French forces had to rely on the US military for aerial refueling, early warning systems, and other crucial operations.
1.4.6.4. Con: An EU army would be unable to counter a major aggressor \(such as Russia\) without US aid.
1.4.6.4.1. Con: In the event of conflict between the EU and Russia, it is not certain that the US would intervene enough to defend the EU.
1.4.6.4.1.1. Pro: The US is pulling back from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \([NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO)\) which may leave it unable to provide security to Europe.
1.4.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: Former President Trump was [reported](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/15/18183759/trump-pull-out-of-nato-nyt-mattis) to have suggested multiple times that the US should withdraw from NATO.
1.4.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: In a January 2019 Pentagon [speech](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/01/17/trump-says-us-backs-nato-100-after-report-he-discussed-withdrawal/) Trump said he was 100 percent committed to NATO.
1.4.6.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: President Trump [withdrew from a number of other military and economic partnerships](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html) such as the Paris Climate Accords and the Asia-Pacific Trade Pact.
1.4.6.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Former President Trump's calls for withdrawal were always contingent on European states not increasing defence spending to 2% of GDP, [which they have agreed to do by 2024.](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-donald-trump-angela-merkel-doctrine-of-mutually-assured-detestation-nato-huawei/)
1.4.6.4.1.1.1.3.1. Con: While in office, President Trump repeatedly demonstrated that he [does not understand](http://time.com/5335111/donald-trump-nato-spending-facts/) how these payments work \(he has referred to them as "dues" when they are nothing of the sort\), so the hope that he will understand and appreciate increases in defence spending is misguided.
1.4.6.4.1.1.2. Pro: The US' ["pivot" to Asia](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/03/the-legacy-of-obamas-pivot-to-asia/) means that it has [fewer military resources](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-european-army-is-exactly-what-the-eu-and-uk-needs-a7050571.html) deployed to the Atlantic and to Europe.
1.4.6.4.1.1.3. Con: Despite this, the US continues to spend significant amounts of money on its military involvement in Europe.
1.4.6.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: In 2018 the US spent [$4.77 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-11/the-european-union-doesn-t-need-macron-s-army) on military spending in Europe, up from $789 million in 2016.
1.4.6.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Given the U.S spends [$610 billion](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/sipri_fs_1805_milex_2017.pdf) on defence, $4.77 billion amounts to 0.78% of their budget. This is an incredibly low amount, equal to 0.024% of GDP spending.
1.4.6.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: In 2018 the US had approximately [64,000 military personnel](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44717074) in Europe.
1.4.6.4.1.2. Con: It is highly unlikely that the US would not provide military support to the EU given the importance of the US-EU relationship.
1.4.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: The EU is the USA's [largest trading partner and investor](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html).
1.4.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: Europe is the USA's best ally in [tackling issues](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html) such as drug and cyber crimes, terrorism, pandemics, and immigration.
1.4.6.4.1.2.3. Con: Not all European states might be deemed worth defending in the event of war with Russia, especially [the Baltic states](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/are-the-baltic-states-really-indefensible), where it is difficult to establish a defensive line [for geographical reasons](https://www.fpri.org/2017/06/natos-baltic-defense-challenge/).
1.4.6.4.1.3. Pro: A US military intervention to defend the EU against Russia would risk a nuclear exchange.
1.4.6.4.1.3.1. Pro: The US has been willing to reverse global military strategies in the past in order to deescalate a nuclear confrontation. It might well be willing to abandon its defence of Europe in order to avoid a nuclear exchange.
1.4.6.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: In order to end the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US agreed to [end its strategic deployment of missiles to Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis#Crisis_ends), thus reversing its previous global military strategy of aggressive deterrence.
1.4.6.4.1.3.2. Pro: Any war between Russia and the US could rapidly [escalate](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/07/were-more-at-risk-of-nuclear-war-with-russia-than-we-think-229436) into a nuclear conflict.
1.4.6.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: In the event of a crisis, the overwhelming priority of any US administration would be to avoid a nuclear strike on the USA.
1.4.6.4.1.3.3. Con: Europe is in [possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons) of nuclear weapons and, thus, the risk of a nuclear exchange is not increased by the US abstaining.
1.4.6.4.2. Con: There is [no reason](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417) why an economic giant like the EU, upon creating an army, should not be able to defend itself from Russia even without the US.
1.4.6.4.2.1. Pro: Setting aside Britain, the remaining EU’s population and defence budgets are roughly [three times](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417) Russia’s size.
1.4.6.4.2.2. Pro: [France](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417) spends almost as much as Russia on defence just by itself and operates an independent nuclear arsenal.
1.4.6.4.2.3. Pro: European governments are [raising](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417) their defence spending to get closer to the NATO target of 2% of each country’s GDP.
1.4.6.4.2.4. Con: Building up European defences to its optimal level after seven decades of American protection would take [time](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417) however, which they may not have.
1.4.6.4.2.4.1. Con: It is better to have something that is not optimal, than nothing.
1.4.6.4.3. Con: The EU is one of the [largest](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-global-weapons-trade/) weapons exporters in the world and has the assets for defending itself against major aggressors.
1.4.6.4.4. Con: The EU would have a combined army that is [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel) in numbers than that of Russia.
1.4.6.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.5. Pro: An EU army would increase political integration between member states.
1.5.1. Con: Many member states are against an EU army.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In 2018 the Dutch Defence Minister [stated](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/dutch-defense-chief-opposed-to-european-army/1312911) that the Netherlands opposes the establishment of a European Army.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: In a shift from the previous year, there were [increasing signs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/europe/germany-defense-spending-european-army.html) of Dutch cooperation on European defence projects in 2019.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Denmark's Defence Minister has [stated](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/denmark-opposes-european-army/1313073) that Denmark opposes the creation of a European army.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Portugal's Prime Minister has [stated](https://www.algarvedailynews.com/news/13147-portugal-says-no-to-a-european-army) that Portugal does not support the formation of a European Army.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: Portugal has been inconsistent on this issue: just months before the Prime Minister's speech, Portugal signed off on a [joint European military intervention force.](https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-would-you-support-the-idea-of-an-eu-army-4334752-Nov2018/)
1.5.1.4. Pro: Even when a country's leaders support an EU army, they often face domestic opposition.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Despite Angela Merkel's support for an EU Army, the German AfD Party argues that defence must remain a matter of national sovereignty. Since 2017 AfD has been the [third largest political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany) in the Bundestag, and the largest party that is not in government.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: Despite Emmanuel Macron's support for an EU Army, his rival in the 2017 Presidential election, [Marine Le Pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen), remains '[fundamentally against](https://sputniknews.com/europe/201811141069790493-france-army-criticism-le-pen/)' the idea. Le Pen won [33.9%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_French_presidential_election) of the vote in the 2017 election.
1.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.5.1.6. Con: [25 EU member states](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/12/11/defence-cooperation-pesco-25-member-states-participating/) have shown their support for increased military integration by joining [PESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Structured_Cooperation).
1.5.1.6.1. Pro: EU countries have already launched [34 PESCO projects](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-minister-wants-a-european-parliament-army/).
1.5.1.7. Con: The first results of a recent [survey](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinionmobile/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/surveyKy/2215) found that 76% of people within the EU support a common defence policy \(p. 3\).
1.5.2. Pro: More political integration is desired by EU citizens.
1.5.2.1. Con: [41%](https://eupinions.eu/de/text/what-do-the-people-want) of EU citizens do not want more political integration.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The majority of EU Citizens support [increased policy integration](https://eupinions.eu/de/text/what-do-the-people-want).
1.5.2.3. Pro: The vast majority of EU citizens have always tended to support an economic and monetary union with a single currency \([p. 25](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_first_en.pdf)\).
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: In the [Eurobar 83](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_first_en.pdf) \(p. 26\), the majority of the population \(over 50%\) supports economic and monetary union in a majority of the member states.
1.5.2.4. Pro: A majority of EU citizens support increased informational sharing and cooperation between member states \([p. 38](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinionmobile/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/surveyKy/1569)\).
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.6. Pro: Having an army would increase the EU's influence globally.
1.6.1. Con: The EU can further increase its global influence through diplomatic means: an army is unnecessary.
1.6.1.1. Con: The combination of [soft](https://softpower30.com/what-is-soft-power/) and [hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_power) power can [amplify](https://europe.unc.edu/iron-curtain/power-and-politics-the-prisoners-dilemma/the-eu-and-soft-power/) the benefits provided by soft power alone. An EU standing army could provide a "stick" to be used in conjunction with the existing "carrot" of economic benefits.
1.6.1.2. Pro: The EU has had considerable success in projecting its soft power to attain influence, notably [utilizing the Eastern Partnership](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/bjes/7/2/article-p148.xml) with Eastern European neighbors to gain currency with them.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Soft power projection gives the EU a comparative advantage in that it projects its influence in non-threatening ways, compared to the seemingly more muscular approach adopted by the United States. \([p.9](https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/15009/3/For%20IR%20Soft%20Power%20FINAL%20for%20Int%20Pols%20Oct%2008.pdf)\)
1.6.1.4. Pro: The EU has had considerable diplomatic success in expanding its influence globally through participation in international forums and programs centered on policing, security and election monitoring. \([p. 15 - 21](http://aei.pitt.edu/7882/1/ginsberg-r-07a.pdf)\)
1.6.2. Pro: The EU's capacity to increase global influence through other means - such as projecting liberal democratic values and trade cooperation - [has come under threat](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/08/the-eclipse-of-the-european-unions-global-influence/) with the rise of populism.
1.6.2.1. Pro: While economic populism is waning, cultural populism is [here to stay](https://institute.global/policy/high-tide-populism-power-1990-2020), highlighting the need for the EU's need to explore other mechanisms for increasing its global influence.
1.6.3. Pro: There is a strong correlation between military power and global influence. Many experts [credit](http://time.com/3899972/us-superpower-status-military/) the United States' position as a global superpower to its immense military strength.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Power in the international system today is still defined in terms of '[hard power](https://carnegieendowment.org/2011/09/14/importance-of-hard-power-pub-45513)' - or militaristic capacities - in which the United States dominates.
1.6.3.2. Con: [In the networked 21st century](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/a-new-theory-for-the-foreign-policy-frontier-collaborative-power/249260/), the United States owes its prestige and renown to soft power by utilizing [modern media](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/557634) to project American values, and by inspiring innovation in technology.
1.6.4. Pro: An EU Army would enable the EU to conduct humanitarian and peacekeeping missions when humanitarian crises demand a military response.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Peacekeeping missions have effectively ended humanitarian crises in the past: an EU Army could repeat such successful experiments in the future.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: A British peacekeeping mission to [Sierra Leone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_military_intervention_in_the_Sierra_Leone_Civil_War) in 2000 [effectively ended](https://warontherocks.com/2016/08/when-intervention-works-the-instructive-case-of-sierra-leone/) the civil war in the country.
1.6.4.2. Con: If one or more of the EU's major members \(such as France, the UK, or Italy\) were willing to conduct such a humanitarian intervention, it is likely that they could already do so unilaterally.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: EU member states would be more willing to act in situations where the proposed mission would be a joint European one, in which the associated risks and costs would be shared.
1.6.4.3. Con: Many humanitarian and peacekeeping missions end in costly failure.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: Historically, some interventions have ended in failure, some in success. It is impossible to draw a clear conclusion about whether or not intervention is a good thing, so it makes sense for the EU to keep the option to intervene open, and assess future interventions on a case-by-case basis.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: Military intervention in [Libya](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success) was largely successful.
1.6.4.3.1.2. Pro: Military intervention in [Sierra Leone](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success) was viewed as a success.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Acting in a humanitarian and peacekeeping role would allow the EU to increase its prestige and attain 'great power status'. Historically, the United States owes a lot of its prestige internationally to the role it has played as the ['world's policeman'.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_policeman)
1.7. Pro: An EU army would be economically beneficial for the EU.
1.7.1. Con: Creating an EU army may undermine the Union's stability which will, in turn, damage the EU's economic interests.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Even when [false](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week), some citizens of EU member states believe that the union is a financial drain on their country. Even if an army would provide benefits long term, the up front investment may encourage eurosceptic rhetoric.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: Increased information about the economic benefits of an EU army could help citizens to understand the benefits.
1.7.1.1.4. Con: There exists [sustained support](https://eda.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2021/01/28/european-defence-spending-hit-new-high-in-2019) across Europe for increasing military spending. It likely would not be particularly difficult to convince voters that a stronger military is good.
1.7.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.7.1.2. Pro: An increase in euroscepticism in a time of [growing](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/870029/eu-news-brexit-eurosceptic-europe-map-vote-election-germany-czech-republic-austria-latest) political instability risks all EU interests, especially economic.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: An increase in euro-skepticism raises the odds that another member state will leave the EU.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: Member states leaving could cause changes in the [movement of people](https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021): including migration management, coping with reduced tourism, and dealing with citizens returning home who were unable to work in the departed member state.
1.7.1.2.2. Pro: [Euroscepticism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/21/greece-europe-eu-austerity) can be seen as having contributed to the rapid ascendency to power of a number of nationalistic, xenophobic, far-right parties across the continent.
1.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: Many nationalist, [xenophobic](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-anti-immigrant-parties-are-racist-xenophobic-and-intolerant-and-could-undermine-the-european-union/) parties are against free movent \([p. 22](http://web.isanet.org/Web/Conferences/HKU2017-s/Archive/41735ccd-2484-4c72-8ef3-13ec261ad12c.pdf)\) of citizens which is a main component of the EU's policies.
1.7.1.2.2.2. Pro: Nationalist parties within Europe plan to [take apart](http://time.com/5568322/nationalism-in-europe/) the EU from within its structure as they gain popularity.
1.7.1.2.3. Pro: Brexit is predicted to affect EU member states' foreign trade negatively.
1.7.1.2.3.1. Pro: Without a post-Brexit trade deal the Flanders region of Belgium will suffer 42,000 [job losses](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-impact-on-european-regions-revealed-by-eu-report-phase-2-negotiations/), whereas a trade agreement could limit these to 10,000 jobs.
1.7.1.2.3.2. Pro: [Ireland](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-impact-on-european-regions-revealed-by-eu-report-phase-2-negotiations/) imports 89 percent of its oil products and 93 percent of its gas from the U.K.
1.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.7.2. Pro: Building a European Army would [create jobs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/how-military-spending-affects-economy.asp) both for active troops but also in associated industries.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Unemployment is a significant problem in many states in Europe.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Greece has an unemployment rate of [18.5%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/).
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Spain has an unemployment rate of [14.1%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/).
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: Italy has an unemployment rate of [10.5%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/).
1.7.2.1.4. Con: Encouraging individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds into the military is a callous method of reducing unemployment. In the US it has led to [exploitation.](https://www.mintpressnews.com/whos-joining-the-us-military-poor-women-and-minorities-targeted/43418/)
1.7.2.1.4.1. Pro: Despite chiefs denying the claims, the British army has been found to have [exploited](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/09/british-army-is-targeting-working-class-young-people-report-shows) the lack of career options open to young people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
1.7.2.1.4.2. Con: Insofar as society requires people to go out and earn a living in order to survive, there is nothing particularly exploitative about military service in comparison to any other industry which requires one to give up their liberties of time, energy and personal autonomy.
1.7.2.2. Con: Many Europeans may be [unlikely to want jobs](https://www.ozy.com/acumen/nobody-wants-to-join-the-german-army/92541) in the army.
1.7.2.3. Con: Industries associated with an EU army will get a boost at the expense of all other industries in the form of taxes, man-power, and resources.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: Workers from such industries will still spend their money in the economy, which will [benefit everyone](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1948/economics/the-multiplier-effect/).
1.7.2.3.2. Con: The raw materials for such industries such as steel are sourced from other companies meaning that other businesses will indirectly benefit.
1.7.2.3.3. Pro: Following [supply and demand](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/supply-and-demand-examples.html), businesses will have to compete with the military \(and associated industries\) for a finite amount of resources.
1.7.3. Pro: Military research and spending associated with a European Army would stimulate innovation in related areas, such as commercial technology.
1.7.3.1. Con: The same amount of money could alternatively just be invested directly into commercial technology.
1.7.3.2. Con: Military research can often be incredibly [wasteful](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-waste/pentagon-buried-study-that-found-125-billion-in-wasteful-spending-washington-post-idUSKBN13V08B).
1.7.3.3. Pro: The [microwave oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven) was created using radar technology developed during World War II.
1.7.3.4. Pro: [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), which is now used in cellphones and car navigational system, was developed by the US Airforce.
1.7.3.5. Pro: [Aerial drones](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/history-of-drones/) were first developed by the military.
1.7.4. Con: The creation and use of an EU army in Eastern Europe may antagonise Russia. Considering the EU's [dependency](https://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/eu-even-more-dependent-on-russian-gas-1.695131) on Russia for gas, retaliation would be economically damaging.
1.7.4.1. Pro: The EU imports 64.6 percent of its energy from Russia \([p. 8](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/pdfscache/46126.pdf)\). If Russia were provoked or antagonist, a cessation of production or price hike could economically cripple Europe.
1.7.5. Con: The vast amount of money needed to run an EU Army would be much more useful if invested elsewhere.
1.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.7.5.2. Pro: The US army was provided a budget of $700 billion in [2018](https://militarybenefits.info/2018-defense-budget-overview/). Armies around the globe required $1.7 trillion in funding in [2016](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/apr/17/military-spending-countries-list). Running a military requires monumental expenditure. Such a vast cost is unlikely to be recouped in the benefits provided by a military.
1.7.5.3. Pro: A European Investment Bank report recently warned that government investment in the EU's infrastructure was at a twenty-year low \([p. 6](https://www.eib.org/attachments/efs/economic_investment_report_2017_en.pdf)\), and that its absence was threatening European prosperity.
1.7.5.4. Pro: The EU's debt-to-GDP ratio was [80% in 2018](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2019/0423/1045108-eu-debt-gdp/), and governments need to focus on paying down their national debts if this burden is to be sustainable in the long run.
