Discussion Name: Democrats should support moderate presidential candidates like Biden or Obama instead of Sanders or AOC.

1. Parties should support moderate presidential candidates like Obama, Rubio, Romney, and Biden instead of extremists like Trump, Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
1.1. Con: Moderate candidates are less consistent than progressives, which is used against them in campaigns.
1.1.1. Pro: Despite endorsing the MeToo movement, Joe Biden has been publicly [accused of sexual assault](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/joe-biden-faces-sexual-assault-181441242.html) by a former employee, and accused of [unwanted touching by seven women](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-inappropriate-touching-accusations-list.html).
1.1.1.1. Con: The evidence [casts doubt](https://medium.com/\@eddiekrassenstein/evidence-casts-doubt-on-tara-reades-sexual-assault-allegations-of-joe-biden-e4cb3ee38460) on this accusation.
1.1.2. Pro: Bernie Sanders has consistently opposed economic inequality for[over 50 years](https://www.npr.org/2015/12/11/459231940/bernie-sanders-has-stuck-to-the-same-message-for-40-years).
1.1.2.1. Con: Economic inequality is a natural phenomenon and the only way to totally eliminate it is to implement anarchism.
1.1.3. Con: It is possible for a moderate to be really consistent and a so-called “progressive” to be really inconsistent. Consistency has little to do with any particular ideology.
1.1.4. Con: It is better to follow all of the facts than to follow a narrow line of argument with 100% consistency, ignoring all of the arguments from people that have different world views than you.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Violent militant communism is no better than violent militant capitalism. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes)
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: In 2017, Professor Stephen Kotkin wrote in The Wall Street Journal that communism killed at least 65 million people between 1917 and 2017: "Though communism has killed huge numbers of people intentionally, even more of its victims have died from starvation as a result of its cruel projects of social engineering."[web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20171107032519/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-communism-bolshevik-anniversary-putin-20171106-story.html)
1.2. Pro: The survival of our species requires that we walk away from the partisan demonization of the other, used by Sanders, Trump, and AOC.
1.2.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders, Trump, and AOC are playing into processes that are out of control and will destroy our country.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Trump, Bernia, and AOC are just pawns in a media and political party war that makes money off our fear, anger, and demonization of our fellow Americans.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The political parties are caught in a tit for tat retribution and demonization process.
1.2.2. Pro: Our tit for tat retaliation and demonization of the other has made us elect people who make us feel good by making the other side mad, instead of electing rational people who can fix problems.
1.2.3. Pro: We need peacemakers and diplomats, not loud-mouthed-know-it-alls who demonize the other side.
1.3. Pro: We need to keep the wide-eyed, true believers of any simplistic dogma that promises to solve all our problems, as far away from power as possible.
1.3.1. Pro: Standing up to the rich, Chinese, Mexicans, Welfare Queens, or any other "bad guy" evil other won't magically make all our problems go away. Our problems are complex and require boring careful cost, benefit, & risk analysis not simplistic political dogma that sounds good, is entertaining, or that would get anyone excited. The stuff that gets people excited, is garbage, and the people who get excited about politics are stupid. We need to make policy boring again and follow the complex data.
1.4. Pro: More extreme candidates usually tend to have more flawed and unrealistic plans and policies. Example: [Sanders' Coronavirus Relief Package](https://berniesanders.com/issues/priorities-next-coronavirus-relief-package/) would take an estimated 5 trillion dollars yearly to enforce. While his [Wealth Tax Policy](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/) would be incapable of creating enough money for even a month of his Coronavirus relief package to go into effect.
1.5. Pro: Political extremes are all about personalities and verge on cults of personality for followers of Trump and Bernie. People invest all their hopes and dreams in these emotional bomb throwers that pretend they have easy solutions to all our problems.
1.6. Pro: [\[Not sufficiently supported by evidence, but kept so people can see the reasons why\]](https://www.kialo.com/people-should-post-reasons-to-disagree-with-invalid-arguments-instead-of-deleting-them-34056?path=34056.0~34056.3): Sanders is a communist.
1.6.1. Con: Sanders is not a marxist, he's closer to a more radical form of social-democray. He's not close to any form of Communism or marxian socialism, since he does not defend a change in property relations\(The abolition of private property, for instance\).In the following article, written by John Roemer, you will find a more precise definition of socialism/communism and its branches: [What is Socialism Today?](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=922005065110002077020069072120014100030050050078068020092086096072067000101010082103029001033127027001029092096087031065016080016039074000002096115008001076028010053046094027000031097031121081101031023103002096071111089127073113118095078127029115016&EXT=pdf)
1.6.2. Con: Communism is a political theory calling for class war. Sanders doesn't call for violence.
1.6.2.1. Con: Communism does not imply actual violence. One may be a marxist social-democrat\(Like Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein\) and aim for socialism/communism through reforms in capitalism. Sanders wants to reform american capitalism, but his goal with that action is not to achieve communism.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Bernie [condemned violence](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/sanders-condemns-nevada-violence-states-democratic-party/) at a Nevada Democratic State Convention in 2016.
1.6.2.3. Con: Bernie doesn't call for violence, and so he isn't a communist, but these things are on a scale, and he seems to have a little too much communism sympathy to deserve broad support.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: Bernie seemed to excuse violence in South America, and Cuba and [tried to point out the good things](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/25/politics/bernie-sanders-defends-praise-of-cuban-social-programs/index.html) coming from brutal dictatorships with political prisoners.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: Sanders pointed out objectively positive policies; he did not praise or excuse violence or the taking of political prisoners.
1.6.2.3.1.2. Con: Recognizing the positive aspects of these regimes indicates Sanders's ability to see things complexly, rather than oversimplify them.
1.6.3. Con: Sanders would be unable to turn the country communist.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Many Americans believe anti-communist propaganda and are willing to prevent it with guns.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Turning the country communist would require the military to get rid of democracy, it's unlikely the military would obey an order to force communism on its citizens.
1.6.4. Con: Socialism and communism are [not synonymous.](https://www.history.com/news/socialism-communism-differences)
1.6.4.1. Pro: Socialism is more flexible than communism.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Socialist doctrine is less violent than communism, and most socialist have been less violent than communist.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: This is usually the case, but some people who call themselves socialist have been violent. Others might want to call them more closely aligned with communist, but it’s not a black and white thing.
1.7. Pro: Democrats and Republicans shouldn't push the far left part of their party at the national level.
1.7.1. Pro: Sanders has too often excused and aligned himself with authoritarian leftist and socialist positions in a way that isn't careful with the results of his actions.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Sanders felt that the soviet union, that was throwing people in gulags, would be a good place to spend his [honeymoon](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/02/23/bernie-sanders-honeymoon-russia-coming-scrutiny-democratic-race/). It is unamerican to be so OK with a country that was founded by hatred and murder of the rich, or any group. There is a video of him "extolling the virtues of Soviet life & culture" [politico.com](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/17/bernie-sanders-mystery-soviet-video-revealed-1330347). One of Sanders’ hosts warns the delegation to not upset the KGB: “Those who don't behave move to Siberia from here." Reaching out to the evil empire wasn't funny then or now.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: You can't shake the Devil's hand and say you are only kidding. There is a pattern with Sanders, just like Trump. Trump's friends all act like strong-arm right-wing dictators, and all of Sanders' friends just so happen to believe in a doctrine of killing the rich.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: As the source in the parent claim points out, the city Sanders visited was the sister city of the town of which he was mayor. That the city happens to be in the Soviet Union is of little real consequence.
1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Strong Bernie supports won't be convinced by a mountain of evidence. But most normal people see those pretending that cities in the Soviet Union had any political power outside of the soviet hierarchy are grasping at straws.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: As the source in the parent claim notes, Sanders also address Soviet shortcomings.
1.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: Laughing at people getting sent to Siberia for a political crime was not strong enough opposition to the soviet union.
1.7.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.3.1.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Sanders ignored violent actions by people on the left and tried to focus on their accomplishments, showing that he excuses violence as long as it is against wealthy people. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html)
1.7.1.3. Pro: Bernie Sanders' actions too often align with the belief that the ends of radical leftism justify the use of violent means.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.7.1.3.2. Con: Political leaders [should not be judged by the actions of those who support them.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-blame-politicians-for-violence-they-dont-encourage/2018/10/28/b813c760-dace-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html)
1.7.1.3.2.1. Con: It depends. Political leaders should be held responsible for the tone they set.
1.7.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Political leaders who oversimplify the issues and pretend that the problems we face are only not solved because the other side is evil set a bad tone. Our problems are difficult.
1.7.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Political leaders who are angry all the time, demonize the other side and inspire anger should be held responsible for their tone.
1.7.1.3.3. Pro: Sanders wrote a letter trying to cover for his violent supporters in Nevada that basically said: "if you don't want to see more violence, the Democratic Party should make more concessions to the far left." [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/nevada-democrats-bernie-sanders-violence)
1.7.1.3.3.1. Pro: Sanders said: “The Democratic party has a choice. It can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change – people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy.”[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/nevada-democrats-bernie-sanders-violence)
1.7.1.4. Pro: It should reflect poorly on our self-righteous leaders who demonize those who don't agree with them, like Sanders and trump, when they demonize their enemies and align themselves with extremists.
1.7.1.4.1. Con: There is reason to believe that many \(if not most\) of the so-called “Bernie Bros” are actually foreign agitators trolling social media to create discord among American citizens, further weakening our faith in each other, our government, and its institutions.
1.7.1.4.1.1. Con: The bad behavior from the Bernie bro’s forms a pattern and matches the envy, jealousy, hatred, and self righteousness coming from Bernie.
1.7.1.4.1.2. Con: Sanders supporters have been videotaped threatening violence if sanders doesn’t win, by project veritas. [washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/28/project-veritas-unearths-more-radical-bernie-sande/)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1. Con: The source in the parent claim contains no quotes or indications of individuals "threatening violence."
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Two Iowa field directors for Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign locked their Twitter accounts after a Project Veritas video showed a "top-tier organizer" saying "Milwaukee will burn" if the senator doesn't win the Democratic nomination. [washingtonexaminer.com](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bernie-sanders-aides-lock-twitter-accounts-after-project-veritas-expose)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Burning down Milwaukee would be a violent act.
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The parent claim quotes hearsay, which is inherently unreliable evidence.
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: A video is not hearsay. Here is the link. [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1217095576602529793?s=20)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: The Washington Times does not post Hearsay. Here is their link. [washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/14/project-veritas-sanders-staffer-says-cities-burn-i/)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1.2.3. Con: The Boston Harald doesn't just post hearsay. [bostonherald.com](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/02/21/the-bernie-sanders-era-get-used-to-it/)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Sanders organizer Kyle Jurek told undercover journalists that "there is a reason why Stalin had gulags," that Sanders wanted "free education" so that Trump supporters could be taught how to "not be a f---ing Nazi," and that he wants to "walk into that MSNBC studios, drag those motherf---ers out by their hair, and light them on fire in the streets." [washingtonexaminer.com](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bernie-sanders-aides-lock-twitter-accounts-after-project-veritas-expose)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Putting people in Gulags is violent.
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Dragging people by their hair and lighting them on fire is violent.
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.2.3. Con: None of the quotes in the parent claim are threats.
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.3. Con: The parent claim links to an article that quotes a Sanders supporter that says the movement would need to kill people. “I just never want to kill anybody. That scares me a lot,” Mr. Baird said. “I would say most people in the movement are in it to avoid going that far, and there’s a wing of the movement that sees that as … “Inevitable?” asked the PV undercover investigator. “Yeah,” he replied. [washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/28/project-veritas-unearths-more-radical-bernie-sande/)
1.7.1.4.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The parent claim's quote is not a "threat" by any definition.
1.7.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.7.1.4.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.7.1.4.1.2.4. Con: The only evidence is one sentence lines with no context or any threats or violence.

1.7.1.4.1.2.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.
1.7.1.4.2. Con: The "bernie bros" mythology ignores the many women, especially women of color, that support sanders.
1.7.1.4.2.1. Con: That is like saying: "I have black friends, and so I can say the N-word."
1.7.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.2.
1.7.1.4.3. Pro: Self-righteousness and anger multiply when fed by a story of how evil the other side is, and is bound to spill over into bad behavior in ways that our leaders should try to prevent.
1.7.1.4.3.1. Pro: Sanders supporters got angry and tried to prevent an organized debate and had to be removed from the Nevada Democrat convention.
1.7.1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.2.
1.7.1.5. Con: Sanders may have charitable views about the policies of some cruel authoritarians, such as Fidel Castro, But he is not himself an authoritarian and would not govern like one.[nytimes.com|https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/letters/bernie-sanders-david-brooks.html](http://nytimes.com|https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/letters/bernie-sanders-david-brooks.html)
1.7.1.5.1. Con: People who refuse to listen to others are authoritarian in their own mind. They kill the parts of themselves that can build consensus with conflicting ideas and people.
1.7.1.5.1.1. Pro: Biased thinking, demonization, hatred and oversimplified stories lead to hatred and narratives that the ends justify the authoritarian means and start movements that go out of control.
1.7.1.5.2. Con: Extreme beliefs \(like the belief that capitalist are evil, stole everything they have and are not smart, intelligent, or hardworking in ways that are good for society\) lead to authoritarian actions.
1.7.1.5.2.1. Con: That's a slippery slope logical fallacy, not logical.
1.7.1.5.2.1.1. Con: It's a tautology to say violent people commit violent actions, and that extreme people commit extreme actions. Their have been authoritarians on the right and left, and if we have more authoritarians in the future they will come from the people with extreme positions.
1.7.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim does not clearly address its parent.
1.7.1.5.2.2. Con: Those aren't authoritarian beliefs. Authoritarian beliefs are beliefs that the government should control the population or that the opposition should be suppressed, Such as preventing protesting, encouraging police brutality, denying abortions. Authoritarian beliefs are beliefs about actions.
1.7.1.5.3. Pro: "Mr. Sanders believes in the rule of law." [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/letters/bernie-sanders-david-brooks.html)
1.7.1.5.4. Pro: "Sanders would not use the power of the state against political enemies." [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/letters/bernie-sanders-david-brooks.html)

1.7.1.6. Con: His supporters are left wing, which means they're generally non-violent.
1.7.1.6.1. Con: The left has killed just as many people as the right.
1.7.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.2.
1.7.1.7. Con: If Sanders has been too often guilty of association with bad people on the right, Republicans have too often been associated with bad people on the right.
1.7.1.7.1. Pro: Republicans should have made more conditions for support than just being pro-USA.
1.7.1.7.1.1. Pro: Republicans supported pro-USA governments in South America, the Middle East, and Assia even if they weren't very good at the freedom of speech or religion.
1.7.2. Pro: Our political parties should support moderates at the national level and win with compromise and reaching out not and not by getting out the vote of die-hard angry people.
1.7.2.1. Pro: We have got to stop supporting leaders who spread resentment, hatred, and scapegoat all our problems with oversimplistic simple solutions, like Trump and Bernie.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Sanders AOC and the populist and angry parts of the democratic party share many characteristics with Trump that are harming America.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Such as what? Universal healthcare? Tuition free college? Telling the truth? Sanders and Trump are polar opposites.
1.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: Both Sanders and Trump and their staff support harmful populist and anti-intellectual and anti “elite” ideas that are harmful to our future.
1.7.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Sanders advertises himself as Western Socialist, but his desire to completely re-work everything and replace the elites is more like Eastern European, South American, or Asian communism because he wants to replace the elites with all their fancy glasses, college degrees, and books.
1.7.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Cambodia, China, Russia and South Africa have all replaced their elites \(rich farmers and capitalist\) and been thrown into chaos because their economies died and people were starving.
1.7.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Sanders and his supporters repeatedly reference Denmark, Sweden and Norway as examples of policy ideals.
1.7.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Yes, but those movements are led by educated talkers and debaters, not angry anti-intellectuals.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Sanders offers his followers too much justification for anger and resentment.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Joe Biden is wrong to not support Universal Health Care.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Joe Biden does indeed want to make healthcare universal, but has a more pragmatic approach than Sanders.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: \[Linkage or relevance disagreement / aka: I agree with the claim but don't think it supports the parent\]. Universal Healthcare is good but should be tried in the states first, and Bernie Sanders would not be effective at rolling it out.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: A person who is going to roll out Universal Healthcare is going to need cooperation from some of the people Sanders keeps calling evil.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: You shouldn't waste your time on things that are impossible, and Clinton and Obama failed to do anything more than what we have.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: There are very few truly poor people in America who graduated from high school, don't abuse drugs and alcohol, and didn't get pregnant as teenagers.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: "Marriage remains America’s strongest anti-poverty weapon, yet it continues to decline." [heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/marriage-americas-greatest-weapon-against-child-poverty)
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: The poverty rate for single parents with children in the USA is 37.1%. The rate for married couples with children was 6.8%. Being raised in a married family reduced a child’s probability of living in poverty by about 82%.[Calculated from data in U.S. Bureau of the Census, American Community Survey, 2007–2009, The relative poverty rates of married and single-parent families change very little from year to year and will be very similar in 2009 and 2010.](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_09_3YR_S1702&prodType=table)
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: "A one-unit increase in neighborhood poverty at the prior examination was associated with a 86% increase in the odds of binging." [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897210/)
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Anger is addictive and dangerous. [betterhealth.vic.gov.au](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/anger-how-it-affects-people)
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: People shouldn't just focus on the negative.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: It may feel like only focusing on the negative in people's lives is a kindness, because you are giving them sympathy but sometimes people need optimism or tough love. We shouldn't support politicians that say people's problems are always the fault of some bad group like the rich. Things are more complicated than that.
1.7.2.1.1.2.2.5. Con: Sanders also offers solutions to our problems.
1.7.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Sanders uses too much us vs them thinking.
1.7.2.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Team thinking, us good guys victims vs those bad guys, is bad.
1.7.2.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: You only have to look at sports to realize how team thinking can make you mad.
1.7.2.1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: People develop extreme hatred for those on other sports teams, and love for people who support their own sports team for invalid reasons.
1.7.2.1.1.2.3.2. Con: People like Trump are evil.
1.7.2.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Trump has too often said people in his own parties, that agree with him on important things, are evil.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4. Con: Sanders respects science and intellectuals, incorporating the latest data into legislative policy and even citing scientific findings during his rallies. This is counter to the anti-elite rhetoric Trump uses to ignore scientists.[Bernie Sanders Supports March for Science: We "cannot survive" without scientific research, By Natasha Noman Jan. 27, 2017](https://www.mic.com/articles/166926/bernie-sanders-supports-march-for-science-we-cannot-survive-without-scientific-research)
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.1. Con: The field of economics uses the scientific process, and Bernie's views are not supported by economists. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/us/politics/left-leaning-economists-question-cost-of-bernie-sanderss-plans.html)
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.2. Con: The script instructs Sanders volunteers to tell voters leaning toward the Massachusetts senator that the “people who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what” and that “she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.” [politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/11/bernie-quietly-goes-negative-on-warren-097594)
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.3. Con: Even the most committed Sanders disciples would have to exhaust a near-infinite list of adjectives to describe the frenetic Vermont socialist before they arrived at “nuanced.

1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4. Con: Sanders is wrong to encouraged students to think about small changes, and that the mere fact of extreme poverty and wealth justify extreme changes \(“I would hope that all of you are prepared to think big not small. Do not get sucked into this worldview and this debate about whether we cut education by 2% or increase it by 1%?”\). [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmaVPN9FhkY)
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: The only valid reason for government to take an action is because it will likely provide more benefits than costs or likely risks.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: Governments should not do things that have more costs or likely risks than benefits.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.1.2. Pro: Governments should do things that have more benefits than costs or likely risks.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.2. Pro: [Books that should be said to Agree:](https://www.kialo.com/it-would-be-helpful-to-have-a-list-of-the-media-that-most-strongly-be-said-to-support-or-weaken-an-argument-34034.9?path=34034.0~34034.3_34034.9&active=_34034.9) The Cost-Benefit Revolution by Cass R. Sunstein supports the belief that well managed crowd-sourced cost-benefit analysis, would do a better job than our political parties.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.3. Pro: It is better to think in terms of cost benefits and risks than political dogma and good guys and bad guys.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.3.1. Pro: Team thinking, us good guys victims vs those bad guys, is bad.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: You only have to look at sports to realize how team thinking can make you mad.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: People develop extreme hatred for those on other sports teams, and love for people who support their own sports team for invalid reasons.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.3.2. Pro: Cost-Benefit analysis is better than interest groups, anecdotes, and intuition because all political theories are true to a point and anecdotes and intuition don't tell you when to not take your theory that you love too far.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.3.3. Pro: Governments should not do things that have more costs or likely risks than benefits.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.4. Pro: It is better to make decisions with cold hard facts and math, like Yang says, than with stories, creative writing, propaganda, feelings, and emotion.
1.7.2.1.1.2.4.4.5. Pro: Sanders never tries to explain why his proposal would not result in the kinds of unintended consequences which centralized planning of complex economic systems often do.
1.7.2.1.1.3. Con: The differences between Trump and Sanders are important.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Sanders would stop or slow the growing wealth disparity.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: This wrongly implies that wealth is finite, which it’s not. The living standards of all economic classes have increased. For example, the wealthy people of the 1950’s could only dream of having access to the technology \(computers, smartphones, etc.\) available to low income people today.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.2. Con: The "let's try something new" argument applied to Trump and Hitler.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Not everything in America should change.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Some things are working well.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.4. Con: Wealth inequality is a problem. However, Bernie misrepresents the issues and oversimplifies the solutions.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Hard-working and smart self-made millionaires and billionaires are not the problem and should usually be celebrated not demonized.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.5. Con: Supporting Bernie would not slow the wealth disparity.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Let's not forget that Bernie can't just change whatever he wants. Especially after Trump. Congress and the Senate will moderate his choices and actions. The largest majority of the Senate and congress isn't old white men, it's wealth. It doesn't matter which party is in charge. Any politician who challenges that status quo will be raked through the mud in the news and in politics because a change to the status quo is what all power seekers fear the most. The Bernies of the world are rare.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Bernie's inability to get things done shouldn't be a reason to vote for him. It would seem to support the belief that he will be moderated as president. However he could waste a bunch of time and tear the country apart trying to force Congress to go along with him, or just being distracted by the less important ideological battles when he should just focus on making things more efficient like Bloomberg. Bernie is a millionaire with 3 homes. People who use socialism to get power are not unique.
1.7.2.1.1.3.1.5.1.2. Con: Moderation of dramatic change in the right direction is a necessity if you want actual change. Moderation of moderate change is how you get what you have. People are sick of pretenders and false promises. That's how Trump gained momentum. Starving people don't want change in 20 years or 50 years. They want change now. Bernie is worth $2 million+, mostly real estate. Biden is worth $9 million+ including a for profit prison. Bloomberg is 55.4 billion. Warren is $11 million+.
1.7.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Sanders is a better person and role model than trump.
1.7.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Sanders never bragged about molesting women.
1.7.2.1.1.4. Pro: The populism wings of the Republican and Democratic parties \(like Trump, Sanders, and AOC\) are too divisive.
1.7.2.1.1.4.1. Con: If someone is like someone else, doesn't really matter.
1.7.2.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: To be strictly logical, we should evaluate the merits of each thing by itself, and not do games of comparing people, and oversimplifying things.
1.7.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Sometimes well-made comparisons between people that we know are bad, and someone we like can help us see the limitations of the approach of the person we like, and re-evaluate our emotional attachment to people who might be using too much storytelling, and demonization.
1.7.2.1.1.4.2. Con: That Trump may/may not be divisive is irrelevant to the topic at hand.
1.7.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: We should learn from our past mistakes, and not keep supporting people that all have the same character flaws.
1.7.2.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Pointing out the similarities between people can highlight how characters' flaws in a president can doom the nation. If trump is continually blaming a group of people for all our problems, and we can all see that scapegoating and demonization can tear our country apart, maybe we shouldn't support another candidate that does the same things.
1.7.2.1.1.4.2.3. Con: Trump said we could solve all the world problems if we would just stand up to Mexicans, Chinese, and other people he demonized. Bernie Sanders does the same thing with rich people. Demonizing the rich or Mexicans, and then promising to stand up to them will no magically fix all our problems as Trump and Sanders pretend.
1.7.2.1.1.4.3. Con: Sanders is perceived as being divisive due to a combination of anti-communist indoctrination leftover from the Cold War era and Sanders [being painted](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/481112-trump-i-think-sanders-is-a-communist) [by the media](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bernie-sanders-social-democrat-communist-ben-shapiro) as a [pure communist](https://nypost.com/2016/01/16/dont-be-fooled-by-bernie-sanders-hes-a-diehard-communist/).
1.7.2.1.1.4.3.1. Con: All anit-communist beliefs are not "indoctrination".
1.7.2.1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The Gulag Archipelago seems to show that communism is destined to murder, failure, and destruction.
1.7.2.1.1.4.3.2. Con: All anit-communist beliefs are not "leftover from the cold war".
1.7.2.1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.3.1.1.
1.7.2.1.1.4.4. Pro: Bernie, Trump, and AOC are part of the populist wings of their party that gain power by cultivating dangerous hatred, fear, and anger towards the other side.
1.7.2.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.2.3.
1.7.2.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.2.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5. Pro: Populist wings of political parties and factions that cultivate fear, anger, and resentment of the "other" party or faction will destroy our country.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.1. Pro: If our nation becomes too divided, we will elect bad leaders who connect with us emotionally, with their hatred of the other side, instead of selecting good leaders who are able to bring our country together, see all sides of an issue, and dispassionately weigh costs, benefits, and risks.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Both Trump and Sanders were supported by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, in order to sow discord in American politics.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.1.2. Pro: A house divided against itself cannot stand.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.1.3. Pro: Russia knows that anger between the different factions in our nation will tear our nation apart, make us less effective, and less powerful.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2. Pro: The populist extremists lack tolerance for opposing viewpoints.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: They respond to opposition in a totally different manner: Sanders often answers criticism by citing statistics about the given issue, while Trump often verbally attacks the critic.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.2. Con: Trump routinely evades critical media and mostly appears on conservative friendly shows such as Fox & Friends, Bernie Sanders is the only democrat to attend a Fox town hall.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3. Pro: Sanders and Trump act as if they want to destroy those who disagree with them, instead of work with them or find common ground.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1. Pro: [\[Valid interests of those who agree\]](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-help-us-post-the-likely-interest-of-those-who-agreedisagree-organized-within-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-34049) Wanting to use friendly diologue with respect between each side to reach consensus and compromise instead of rallies of angry people demonizing the other side.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: The right and the left need to talk to each other, not about each other.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: We need a balance between the right and the left.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The right and left can go too far.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: We need the right to defend what has worked well in the past.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: A lot of ideas that sound great on a paper result in absolute disasters.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The past worked well enough to not destroy our ancestors.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.4. Pro: Sanders has made comments claiming that being pro-choice is an [essential component of being a Democrat](https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/bernie-sanderss-abortion-comments), thus showing intolerance for pro-life Americans.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.4.1. Con: It is not intolerant to state that being pro-choice is an essential part of being Democrat doesn't make one intolerant because [the Democratic party itself is pro-choice](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/). \(Enter link, download platform pdf, and search "abortion"\)
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.4.2. Con: Intolerance of anti-choice extremists is more than justifiable, because it means opposing the deprivation of human rights to privacy and personal autonomy.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.4.3. Pro: It is intolerant to devalue groups of people because of their views on one issue.
1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.4.3.1. Con: We must be intolerant of intolerance in order to promote tolerance \(e.g. not tolerate a group that is intolerant to letting women choose whether or not to have an abortion\).
1.7.2.1.1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.
1.7.2.1.1.5. Pro: Sanders Trump and AOC are too simplistic.
1.7.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Trump creates broad claims to fame on his site and is more loose with his conservative agenda. Bernie backs up his claims with better evidence in detail on his site with info.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: Sanders and Trump seem fully immersed in political dogma.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Sanders and trump oversimplify the world into black and white thinking with good guys and bad guys instead of potential costs, benefits, and risks.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: [\[Likely Interests of those who agree\]](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-help-us-post-the-likely-interest-of-those-who-agreedisagree-organized-within-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-34049) The desire for us as a society to stop making decisions by anecdote, intuition, stories, emotion, special interest, slogans, and advertising.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: Sanders and Trump seem incapable of unbiased self-reflection.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Sander's "the rich are evil" dogma, prevents him from seeing any benefits from the Google Guys, Musk, Gates, or Warren Buffet.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Trump and Sanders seem incapable of admitting error.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: Trump cannot admit when he makes mistakes. [edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/16/opinions/trump-can-never-admit-he-made-a-mistake-isenberg/index.html)

1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Any politician who praised a fascist dictator would get dragged over the coals, with good reason.
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: What if Sen. Ted Cruz had spoken positively of Augusto Pinochet’s liberalization of the Chilean economy, while downplaying or ignoring the thousands of deaths he caused?
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: What if President Trump had praised Adolf Hitler for his great work on the autobahn?
1.7.2.1.1.5.2.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: What if Sen. Marco Rubio sang the praises of Francisco Franco?

1.7.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: Trump oversimplifies the benefits of limiting illegal immigrants, and Sanders oversimplifies the harms caused by rich people and the victimhood of poor people.

1.7.2.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Bill Gates is not destroying this Country.
1.7.2.1.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5. Pro: Sanders spreads too many harmful oversimplifications of our problems.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: They both tell over-simplistic views of reality that are great for 30 second sound bites and bumper sticker mentality, but that don't hold up to detailed analysis.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2. Pro: Sanders oversimplifies the problem when he describes the world as evil exploiting demons at the top steeling from virtuous victims unfortunate at the bottom.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1. Pro: The rich are not bad guys, to the extent that Bernie says, that we must tear down \(this can assume a need to address some levels of inequality, but that Sanders would take it too far\).
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1. Pro: It is not helpful for Sanders to hate wealthy people who have worked hard, are smart, followed the rules, or made good life choices.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Sanders is wrong to say that we should improve society by removing devils, like evil capitalists and elites, from places of power.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Wealthy people often work harder, smarter \(with more skills or competency\), or place themselves in positions or industries that provide needed services.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-millionaires-billionaires-spend-time-reading-exercise-sleep-2019-2?r=US&IR=T) of wealthy people show theat they typically spend more time working and reading compared to the average American.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: We win by eliminating devils within ourselves.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Sanders shouldn't so often see different levels of success as the primary problem.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: We need a balanced economy with government regulation and a safety net, but should also let the economy reward merit.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: We need the government to prevent monopolies, regulate the economy, and reward/punish good/bad behavior.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The government shouldn't try to prevent meritocracies that reward hard work, intelligence, following the rules, and making good life choices.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: We need an economy that includes and reward the best and the brightest as well as the sick and weak.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: America has always been productive because even if we weren't at the top, we wanted our kids to have the opportunity to make it there. Sanders has a hatred for anyone at the top that, if widely adopted, would harm our societies' respect for competence, intelligence, and hard work.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: Our leaders should use moderate careful and slow changes to society to make entry into elite clubs more meritocratic.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.2. Con: It is good to hate people who are wealthy, smart, "hard-working" rule-followers who "make good life choices" when those people are exploiting others.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: It is never good to be ruled by emotion like hate.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The only valid reason to make a decision is if reason shows that the benefits likely outweigh the costs or risks.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.2.2. Con: It is inaccurate to describe America in 2020 as a system in which the wealthy exploit the less wealthy.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: [44% of Americans pay no federal income tax](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/81-million-americans-wont-pay-any-federal-income-taxes-this-year-heres-why-2018-04-16). This is a system in which the wealthy are doing a very bad job of exploiting poor people. This is a system in which only 66% of Americans are expected to contribute to society.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.3. Con: Many wealthy people did not follow all the rules.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.3.1. Con: The Perfect Solution Fallacy \(also known as the 'Nirvana Fallacy'\) is a false dichotomy that occurs when an argument assumes that a perfect solution to a problem exists; and that a proposed solution should be rejected because some part of the problem would still exist after it was implemented. Just because a system isn't perfect, doesn't mean we should throw it in the trash.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.4. Con: The choices they made were for their own interests.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.4.1. Con: People shouldn't be forced out to act outside the interest of their family and friends. You have no claim to the fruit of other people's labor.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.5. Con: Many a poor person works hard, follows the rules, and makes good choices.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Only 2% of those living in poverty in American finished high school, got a full-time job and waited until age 21 to get married or have children.[brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2. Pro: Socialists place too high a priority on trying to make life fair and inaccurately judge everything financially.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Not all economic imbalances point to injustice or require massive restructuring in society to address.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The act of giving things to people who are struggling because of their own bad decisions may reward bad behavior if done uncarefully.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: People who follow their passion, instead of the market, shouldn't demand a massive restructuring of society if the market doesn't compensate them for their actions.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: It’s not fair to people who gave up their passions because they wanted to provide for a family to have to pay for all the people who followed their passions.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: The fact that people who abuse drugs and alcohol, don’t graduate high school, or have babies struggle is a reason to support democrats, but not a reason to drastically restructure society.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: We should help hard working people overseas who are smart and disciplined and hard working before we help selfish people in America have big screen TVs and have more alcohol and go to more strip clubs.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The struggles of Americans should be compared to struggles from people who work as hard over seas.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.3. Pro: You cannot legislate the poor into success by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it or create wealth by moving it.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.4. Pro: Our society has injustice but still usually rewards good behavior.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: Our society mostly rewards intelligent, hard workers, follow the rules, are good at what they do, and make wise sacrifices.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.2. Pro: The poor are not always helpless victims or innocent angles that need every support. \(This can assume that Sanders is right in some things, like universal healthcare, but that we should look at each policy and determine its effectiveness and that Sanders would take his support for the poor too far\).

1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.2.2.2. Pro: What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.2.2.3. Pro: When half of the people get the idea that they do not need to work, because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the 2nd half gets the idea that it does no good to work because someone else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.4.1.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.3. Pro: Sometimes exploiters get to the top of capitalist societies, but they are not as bad as the exploiters in socialist societies.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4. Con: Bernie is correct that our society is mostly evil, corrupt thieves at the top of the system robbing and brainwashing everyone below them.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.1.1.2.2.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.2. Pro: Life isn't fair and the reward for hard work is that your boss gets rich.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.2.1. Con: Every system has injustice and people that exploit their position of power but it better to be oppressed by business than by the government.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: At least with capitalism, there are independent ways of measuring success and companies go out of business if they do a poor job of identifying effective hard workers.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.2.2. Con: It is wrong to measure justice with only one variable.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: Getting rich isn't the only measure of success.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.2.3. Con: Businesses do better that make effective hard workers the boss. It doesn't’ always happen, but at least their is a reward mechanism in place to encourage it.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.3. Con: It is wrong to describe CEOs, who work more than most Americans as "sitting". CEOs have to do very well at the most difficult colleges and outlive and out-compete the competition, and [CEOs worked an average of 62.5 hrs/week, while the average American works 44 hours per week.](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2018/05/09/michael-d-tanner/success-sequence-what-it-leaves-out)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.4. Con: Although culture can transmit helpful or harmful habits, nature distributes the potential for good and evil equally between the rich and the poor.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.5. Con: It is not wrong, illegal, or immoral to try to figure out the rules for making lots of money by climbing to the top of a social hierarchy and then following those rules.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.6. Con: [The top 1 percent of American earners pay almost 40% of all federal income taxes. Those taxes are used for a lot of good.](https://www.google.com/search?q=percentage+of+taxes+paid+by+the+top+1+percent&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS891US891&oq=percentage+of+taxes+payed+by+the+top+1&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l7.12399j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.5. Con: Bernie has never made this description.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.5.1. Con: Sanders was wrong and oversimplifies our problems when he said: "The greed of the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed."

1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.5.1.3. Pro: The Google Guys are not destroying this country.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.6. Pro: Sanders’ belief that "[Bloomberg is a rapacious billionaire who amassed a gross amount of wealth and became an authoritarian mayor and targeted young black men and then tried to buy his way to power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/bernie-sanders-win-2020.html)" shows that his beliefs are a dangerous oversimplification.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.6.1. Pro: It is dangerous for our political leaders to oversimplify political problems and solutions into religious dogmas that can't be questioned because they are self-evident to self-interested groups or emotional appeal.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.6.2. Pro: Corporations and those that work on Wall Street are not rapacious monsters who hoard the nation’s wealth and oppress working families.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.6.3. Pro: Any world view that can’t admit that Bloomberg is a successful entrepreneur who took his management skills into public service and then started giving his wealth away to reduce gun violence and climate change is not in touch with reality.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.3. Pro: We should not support those who drastically oversimplify or misrepresent our problems. \[Unstated assumption #1\]
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.3.1. Pro: If we can't accurately see or describe the real problem we won't be able to see the best solutions.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4. Pro: It is better to think in terms of cost benefits and risks than political dogma and good guys and bad guys.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.1. Pro: Team thinking, us good guys victims vs those bad guys, is bad.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: You only have to look at sports to realize how team thinking can make you mad.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: People develop extreme hatred for those on other sports teams, and love for people who support their own sports team for invalid reasons.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.2. Pro: Cost-Benefit analysis is better than interest groups, anecdotes, and intuition because all political theories are true to a point and anecdotes and intuition don't tell you when to not take your theory that you love too far.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.2.1. Pro: The difficulty comes in realizing that your theory that you identify with can result in more costs and risks, if pushed too far, than benefits. Weighing costs, benefits, and risks help with this because it requires you to do more than point out the benefits of your side and the costs of the other side. You must show that your point of view has more total benefits than costs or risks.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.3. Pro: Governments should not do things that have more costs or likely risks than benefits.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.4.4. Pro: Governments should do things that have more benefits than costs or likely risks.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5. Con: Life isn't fair and it's not wrong for Sanders to try to make life fairer.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.1. Con: Governments can cause harm when they take too much power and try to remove nature, society, and the consequences of wrong actions and make life fair. But they can avoid this while still trying to make its rules and regulations promote efficiency and fairness.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.1.1. Pro: There are some ways the government will never be able to make life fair.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: Nature gives people different minds, body chemistries, diseases, and levels of attractiveness. Rich people commit suicide.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.1.2. Pro: There are dangers of government becoming powerful enough to fix all of our problems. A government powerful enough to make life fair will make us slaves because nature has given us more want-to-be-slave owners than angles.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.1.3. Pro: All people who talk about making life fairer aren’t necessarily talking about giving the government more power.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.1.3.1. Pro: Ferguson Missouri is a mostly black community with an almost entirely white police force. Couldn't you push to have police forces look like the community, without promoting equality too far?
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.2. Pro: It's not fair that property taxes fund schools because that gives the rich people's kids, who already have more advantages access to better schools.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.5.3. Pro: It's OK that people who work hard get rich, but you shouldn't be rich just because your grandpa worked hard.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.6. Con: If Republicans want to hold adults responsible for their behavior, they need to do more to help kids.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.7. Pro: Sanders's level of exaggeration at the unfairness of American Society is childlike and should prevent us from taking him seriously and trying to involve him in adult conversations.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.7.1. Pro: Claims of extreme poverty and widespread deep poverty are based on incomplete information. And unfounded claims promote alarmism that generates pressure to increase welfare spending and benefits. However, we cannot base sound public policy on inaccurate alarmism. [heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/examining-extreme-and-deep-poverty-the-united-states)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.7.2. Pro: "Misinformation distracts from the real issues facing the welfare state: the prevalence of self-defeating and self-limiting behaviors such as low levels of educational attainment, low levels of marriage and work, criminal activity, drug and alcohol abuse, and poor home environments for children." [heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/examining-extreme-and-deep-poverty-the-united-states)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.7.2.1. Pro: "Welfare reform significantly reduced deep poverty as measured by 50 percent of the annual official poverty income threshold." [heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/examining-extreme-and-deep-poverty-the-united-states) Bernie Sanders wants to undo the Bill Clinton welfare reform.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.7.2.2. Pro: "Third World poverty as measured by persons having expenditures of less than $4.00 per person per day is nonexistent in the United States." [heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/examining-extreme-and-deep-poverty-the-united-states)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.7.2.3. Pro: "Conventional government statistics on poverty and inequality are highly misleading because almost the entire welfare state is excluded from the count of income." [heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/examining-extreme-and-deep-poverty-the-united-states)
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.8. Con: Sanders offers in-depth explanations and empirical evidence for his core claims about inequality.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.8.1. Con: Empirical evidence means nothing if you don't admit that the other side also has empirical evidence for their side, and you don't set up a system that independently weighs the validity of each side's empirical evidence.
1.7.2.1.1.5.5.8.1.1. Pro: Everyone can show their side has benefits, and the other side has costs, but without math and independent ways of measuring the likelihood and impact of each, both sides will walk away feeling they have won the argument.
1.7.2.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: [\[Likely interest of those who agree\]](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-help-us-post-the-likely-interest-of-those-who-agreedisagree-organized-within-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-34049) People who support Biden over Sanders are likely motivated by a desire to displace Trump.
1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: Trump will destroy Biden in the presidential debates and Bernie would offer a much stiffer opposition to Trump both mentally and psychologically.
1.7.2.1.2.2. Pro: Sanders would guarantee a Republican presidential victory.
1.7.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: He is very unpopular in the swing states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia, which he needs in order to win. He is also less likely to flip traditionally red states like Texas blue.
1.7.2.1.2.3. Con: Bernie is the most electable democrat in the general elections.
1.7.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Sanders is more vulnerable to criticism than the other democratic candidates.
1.7.2.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In order to win in the general election you must appeal to moderates republicans and independents. Sanders is too liberal to assemble a winning coalition with moderate republicans who hate trump or independents who fear extreme change.
1.7.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: One [poll](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/23/politics/bernie-sanders-leads-democrats-national-poll-february-23/index.html) places Sanders leading in the primaries.
1.7.2.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Early polling doesn’t determine who will win.
1.7.2.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Democrats have [super delegates](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/19/democratic-party-superdelegates-history-rules-changes).
1.7.2.1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: Polling only takes into account the current state of affairs and all the moderates are going after each other and have not made sustained attacks on Sanders.
1.7.2.1.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Although early polling doesn't determine who will win, it does suggest that Sanders will be the most competitive candidate amongst candidates from the Democratic Party in a Presidential election.
1.7.2.1.2.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Every election has dramatic swings in the polls. The person who stands up best against Trump right now is very unlikely to be the person who can best whether billions of dollars spent against them from the Republican.
1.7.2.1.2.3.3. Con: Whether Bernie is electable or not does not mean he will be good for the country.
1.7.2.1.2.3.4. Con: Bernie Sanders mostly appeals to the far left socialist ideologues and the youth vote. If he is put forward as the lead candidate against Trump the Democrats night as well sit out the 2020 elections and regroup for 2024.
1.7.2.1.2.3.4.1. Con: You don't have to feel that you know Bernie would lose to Trump in order to want to support someone else. I don't pretend to know what would happen with Bernie v Trump, but all the valid arguments tend to point to a moderate having a larger base and bringing in more independents.
1.7.2.1.2.3.5. Pro: Bernie would do better in a debate than Biden.
1.7.2.1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Joe Biden seems like he has Alzheimers.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6. Pro: Bernie has support from the [youth](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/this-one-chart-explains-why-young-voters-back-bernie-sanders.html) of America.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.1. Con: Just because you have the support of the youth of a country, doesn’t necessarily mean you are the right person for the country.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: Youth are famously naive and idealistic in ways that push them towards socialism.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: It is said that a conservative young person doesn’t have a heart, and a liberal old person doesn’t have a brain. This is because the goals of socialism are valid, its just that it has unintended consequences and often doesn’t work.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.1.1.2. Pro: Historical experience proves that [socialism does not work.](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/why-socialism-always-fails/)
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.2. Pro: Turning out young voters in unprecedented numbers is essential if Democrats are to have any hope of defeating Trump in the general election. Only Bernie Sanders has demonstrated the ability to do that.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.2.1. Con: Many of the other candidates have won bigger elections, that are more representative of America than Bernie.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: Joe Biden was part of a ticket that won nationally while Sanders has never won an election outside of Vermont, which isn't very representative of the USA.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.2.2. Con: Bernie Sanders will most likely just get out the vote for Republicans who are afraid of socialism.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.2.3. Con: There’s no reason that getting young voters out is any more important than getting all voters out. All votes count the same.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.2.4. Con: There is no need to go to extreme measures to beat Trump as he is one of the most politically vulnerable sitting presidents in history.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.3. Pro: In recent years, the [youth are voting more in elections.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_vote_in_the_United_States) Bernie having the support of the youth therefore may boost his electoral prospects, all other things being equal.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.3.1. Pro: During the 2018 midterms, the [youth vote increased in all 42 states](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/02/opinions/young-voters-midterm-elections-solomont-glickman/index.html) for which youth voting data is available.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.3.2. Con: Trump won four years ago. He wasn’t exactly a favorite of the youth.
1.7.2.1.2.3.6.4. Con: His ability to appeal to young voters comes at the cost of failing to appeal to almost every other voting block.
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.
1.7.4. Pro: Modern Americans should support political moderates at the local levels \(state, county, and city\).
1.7.4.1. Pro: We need the left, but we also need the right.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Moderation is better for a divided country than jumping back and forth between extremes.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Its better to get a little bit of what you want, and participate in a process in which you argue for the ultimate goal, than to jump and forth between extremes.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Truth is found in an open conversation between opposing sides, not in having pure doctrine that provides an exciting comprehensive world view.
1.7.4.5. Pro: Sound government policy requires that we move away from identifying good guys and bad guys, the way extremists want us to.
1.7.4.5.1. Pro: Good government is a process of balancing competing principles, weighing costs, benefits, and risk and not a result of applying a single world view.
1.7.4.5.1.1. Pro: It is much more challenging to structure government than extremists argue.
1.7.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: It is hard to be compassionate without rewarding bad behavior and punishing good behavior.
1.7.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: It is hard to reward hard work and intelligence without punishing the unlucky.
1.7.4.5.1.1.3. Pro: Problems aren’t caused by some group of intentionally evil people. They exist because living through a time of economic, technological, demographic and cultural transition is hard. Creating social trust across diversity is hard.
1.7.4.6. Pro: Moderates are, by definition, more capable of the virtues of caution, listening to others, and self-doubt.
1.7.4.7. Pro: History rewards countries that support moderates.
1.7.4.7.1. Pro: History rewards countries that move in the direction of consensus at the speed that reason defeats bad ideas within the minds of its citizens.
1.7.4.7.2. Pro: History punishes states that allow a portion of society to out-maneuver the other side politically and force controversial policies that are vehemently opposed by large segments of the population.
1.7.4.7.3. Pro: The British way of slowly moving towards progress is much better than other countries who bounce back and forth between extremists.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.3.1.
1.7.6. Pro: Modern Americans should support moderates in temperament and policy, like Biden \(not Sanders\) at the federal level.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Socialism causes extremely negative emotions within some Americans.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Too many Americans believe we have stood alone protecting the future from authoritarian socialist to change their views and not freak-out with Sanders as president.
1.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: Its hard to remember losing loved ones in struggles opposing deadly and fanatical Communist and Socialist in North Korean, China, North Vietnam, and proxy wars with Russia and then to change your mind and just say these are all OK.
1.7.6.1.1.2. Pro: It's too much to ask our citizens to remember losing loved ones in so many struggles against deadly and fanatical Communist and Socialists countries and then to ask them not to blame Socialism.
1.7.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Nazis were self-described socialist, and Americans lost many loved ones defeating Nazi Germany
1.7.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: Americans lost lives to Communist North Korean and Vietnam.
1.7.6.1.1.2.3. Pro: Americans lost lives in many proxy wars and lived under the threat of annihilation from communist Russia.
1.7.6.1.1.2.4. Pro: We shouldn't have asked Americans to fight so often against authoritarian socialist, if we didn't want them to blame socialism.
1.7.6.1.1.3. Pro: We fought fanatical authoritarian socialist too recently to expect our citizens with any memory to be OK with socialist leaders.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: "Better dead than red" accurately represents the view of many Americans.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Trying to force everyone to accept the virtues of big government will distract us from the more fundamental things we must support, like the rule of law, freedoms of the press, of conscience, and religion.
1.7.6.3. Con: We cannot accurately judge that moderates are inherently better for the country than someone with strong focus: the idea that "two extremes" are "jumping between one another" oversimplifies the importance of strong stances and progression in the system. There is no inherent need for gradualism.
1.7.6.4. Pro: We shouldn't let arguments about the size of government distract us at the federal level from the more essential issues of respecting the rule of law, freedoms of; the press, of conscience, and religion, and resistance to corruption. Size isn't everything.
1.7.6.4.1. Pro: Many people will harm long term goals and more important things trying to protect less important short term goals.
1.7.6.5. Con: It's [unclear](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/what-moderate-democrat-anyway-n981931) what the precise criteria is for being a moderate.
1.7.6.5.1. Con: You don't need a precise definition of moderate to know that Bernie Sanders is not one.
1.7.6.5.1.1. Pro: There are many examples of things that can not be clearly defined but are useful words and concepts.
1.7.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: The supreme court famously defined pornography as "you know it when you see it". They could not come up with a precise definition, but that didn't stop them and it shouldn't stop us. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it)
1.7.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The phrase "I know it when I see it" is a colloquial expression by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters. The phrase was used in 1964 by United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart to describe his threshold test for obscenity in Jacobellis v. Ohio.
1.7.6.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: In explaining why the material at issue in the case was not obscene under the Roth test, and therefore was protected speech that could not be censored, Stewart wrote: I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description \["hard-core pornography"\], and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.
1.7.6.6. Pro: Sanders is not balanced in temperament.
1.7.6.6.1. Pro: Sanders does not listen to and work well with others.
1.7.6.6.1.1. Pro: He can be harsh with staff — short-tempered and demanding and sometimes rude. “Some people say I am very hard to work with. They say I can be a real son of a bitch. They say I can be nasty, I don't know how to get along with people,” Bernie told his press secretary in 1990, according to a memoir by the former staffer. “Well, maybe there's some truth to it.”[buzzfeednews.com](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/you-dont-know-bernie-sanders)
1.7.6.6.1.2. Pro: Boston Globe's Christopher Rowland said: "He was completely humorless, relentlessly focused on the evils of the American corporation...."
1.7.6.6.2. Pro: Sanders is wrong to frame so many policy differences in terms of good and evil instead of potential costs, benefits, and risks.
1.7.6.6.2.1. Pro: When you frame things in good and evil often enough and long enough you start to believe yourself.
1.7.6.6.2.1.1. Pro: Once you state something publicly your ego starts to multiply the effect of confirmation bias, because of fear of embarrassment and wanting to be seen as true to one's word. Internal unconscious effects make it so you can only actually see or remember evidence that supports your previously stated beliefs.
1.7.6.6.2.2. Pro: If you believe those that disagree with you are evil, then you can justify: not listening to them, and you will justify actions you shouldn’t in opposing them.
1.7.6.6.2.2.1. Pro: If the other side is evil you will sacrifice more things than you should in trying to oppose them. You will justify destroying this or that when fighting against them, because they are so evil.
1.7.6.6.2.3. Pro: Sanders [condemned mass immigration arrests](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/this-is-evil-bernie-sanders-condemns-mass-immigration-arrests-in-the-us) as "evil".
1.7.6.7. Con: Criticisms of Sanders' temperament are invalid and are part of a biased [media assault that unfairly](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/11/corporate-media-bernie-sanders-bias-msnbc-warren-biden) attempts to discredit his campaign.
1.7.6.7.1. Pro: There is evidence that there is some liberal bias that prevents coverage of stories that would directly or indirectly benefit him such as the Tara Reade allegations against Joe Biden recently coming to light.
1.7.6.7.2. Con: It is an oversimplification to dismiss all criticism of Bernie Sander's by the media as biased, unwarranted, or unfair.
1.7.6.8. Pro: Moderate policies at the federal level ensure that states, who may have their own varying preferences, do not have to adhere to any radical viewpoints.
1.7.6.8.1. Pro: When we support candidates that the other side hates, or that hates the other side, it is terrible for the long term success of our country.
1.7.6.8.1.1. Pro: We need uniters and diplomats at the national level that are respectful of those on the other side. No one should be a political enemy. We are all from the same country and want the same thing, we just think different tactics will get us there. What unites us is greater than what divides us.
1.7.6.8.2. Pro: It is arrogantly and authoritarian to try to force everyone to have the size of government that we think is appropriate, even if they don’t want it.
1.7.6.8.2.1. Pro: National Democratic Socialism is impossible because for it to be democratic, it must respect the rights of those parts of the country that staunchly oppose Socialism. Therefore it should respect the democratic process and go back to local representation in only strong socialistic cities or states.
1.7.6.8.2.2. Pro: Conservatives shouldn’t prevent liberals from making a strong local safety net, and liberals shouldn’t force conservatives to pay federal taxes to support socialism.
1.7.6.8.2.3. Pro: If San Francisco wants to require insurance to pay for dog sex changes, we shouldn't force people in Colorado to pay for it.
1.7.6.8.3. Pro: Going national prohibits the ability to compare how things work in different regions and making scientific comparisons to the outcome in a different context.
1.7.6.8.4. Pro: If you go regional first, you can work out all the kinks and scale-up easier.
1.7.6.9. Pro: We should allow regional preferences on controversial topics and let people vote with their feet.
1.7.6.9.1. Pro: Human individuals and groups need the freedom to direct the shape of their lives.
1.7.6.9.1.1. Pro: Forcing socialism at the national level unnecessarily limits the freedom and voice of cities and states that hate socialism.
1.7.6.10. Pro: The benefits of federal socialist policies are not worth the disunity and conflict that occurs when trying to implement socialist policies in states or regions that are resistant to socialism
1.7.6.10.1. Pro: Socialist goals can be achieved at local levels better and easier than at national levels.
1.7.6.10.1.1. Pro: Massachusetts was able to experiment with healthcare without the need to force Mississippi to agree.
1.7.6.10.2. Pro: Corruption is a bigger issue than the the same old arguments about the size of Governments.
1.7.6.10.2.1. Pro: The right and left have both produced authoritarians that suppress dissent, the freedom of speech, religion, and individuals' rights and liberties.
1.7.6.10.2.2. Pro: The presence of extreme politicians on our side allows the other side to justify bad behavior on trumped-up fear of our extremist and enables them to justify bad behavior in service of their short term "size of government" goals. If we only had moderate candidates on our side, the other side wouldn't be as motivated to get while the getting is good, and they are in power.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.2.
1.7.9. Pro: People who only talk about how evil the rich are, are too far left.
1.7.9.1. Con: Implying that Bernie Sanders is a one policy man who only wants to tax the rich misunderstands the points of his campaign and his detailed policies on his website going from Housing for All to erasing all college debt.
1.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.5.5.2.4.4.
1.7.9.3. Pro: Our political system is not "grossly unfair".
1.7.10. Con: Sanders is better described as supporting "welfarism" than socialism. [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Bernie_Sanders#Academics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Bernie_Sanders#Academics)
1.7.10.1. Pro: Sanders does not advocate public ownership of the means of production.
1.7.10.2. Pro: Sanders does not seek to abolish the profit system.
1.8. Con: The people on the far left of the Democratic party \(like Sanders and AOC\) are better than the moderates \(like Biden and Obama\).
1.8.1. Con: Joe Biden's political plans don't seem to be based on hateful or anger, at the rich or establishment, as much as Sanders, which should be counted, at least a little bit, for Sander's quality as a person.
1.8.1.1. Con: Biden told a man he was ["full of s***"](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/10/politics/joe-biden-testy-gun-exchange-michigan-worker/index.html) because a misunderstanding regarding gun rights.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: It isn't related. Cussing doesn't make you politically moderate. Hitler was nice to his administrative assistants, and bought them birthday presents. Winston Churchill was mean to his assistants. Does that make Hitler a moderate or a bigger moderate than Churchill? No. When you judge politicians as "moderate" or "extreme" you can evaluate how nice they are, or their policies. You can be angry, and still not foment hatred. You can cuss, without hatred. We call each other mean words without hate.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some people need to be told when they are full of shit. Being moderate doesn't have to mean being a wimp in the face of untruths. The moderation that Biden has that Bernie doesn't, isn't about not cussing, or being nice. It just means listening to both sides and not having extreme positions. Hitler was much nicer to his secretaries, and bout them little gifts. Churchill was a jack ass to all his secretaries. That doesn't mean Hitler was better, because his policies were much worse.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Not being hateful and angry is an important part of being a good person.
1.8.2. Con: Barack Obama is [the most popular politician in America](https://today.yougov.com/ratings/politics/popularity/politicians/all). Meanwhile, AOC’s approval rating is [only 22%](https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-group-leaked-poll-unfavorable-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2019-7), which is even lower than that of Trump.
1.8.3. Pro: Sanders is a better candidate than Biden because Sanders has an objectively better civil rights record.
1.8.3.1. Con: Joe Biden [played a major role in helping pass the Violence Against Women Act](https://time.com/5675029/violence-against-women-act-history-biden/).
1.8.3.2. Con: Bernie Sanders [co-sponsored a bill that would allow Maine and Vermont to dump nuclear waste in a predominantly Latino community](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/bernies-sanders-wanted-vermont-nuclear-waste-sent-to-primarily-hispanic-texas-community/).
1.8.3.3. Pro: Sanders marched with [pro-civil rights protesters, even subjecting himself to criminal liability](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/social-posts-spin-sanders-photo/).
1.8.3.4. Pro: Biden promoted [segregationism.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/joe-biden-didn-t-just-compromise-segregationists-he-fought-their-n1021626)
1.9. Con: The far left part of the Democratic party has better policies than the moderate wing.
1.9.1. Pro: Biden's policies are just more neo-liberal theft and perpetual war.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Biden wants to cut Medicare.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Biden wants to pass TPP.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: The TPP would have been a good trade deal had Trump not ruined it.
1.9.1.3. Con: Those are meaningless buzzwords.
1.9.2. Con: Biden’s policies are more liberal, more practical, and make more efficient use of taxpayer money than Sanders’s.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Both Biden and Sanders want universal healthcare. However, Biden’s plan would build upon the Affordable Care Act and allow people to keep their private health insurance while Sanders’s plan is unnecessarily radical and costly.
1.9.3. Con: There is nothing good about extremism.
1.9.3.1. Pro: The far left fuels the far right, and vice versa.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: When each side only acts like cheerleaders and admit data and evidence that supports their site, it causes the other side to do the same instead of admit evidence that should be weighed that impartial observers would admit.
1.9.3.1.2. Pro: When one side is extreme, it gives the other side excuse to try to be extreme in hopes of compromising somewhere in the middle. However, this process of lying and exaggerating is more wasteful than just admitting when it is impractical to push your evidence and arguments too far. The only way to get both sides to stop lying and exaggerating is for one side to start the process and to point out the stupidity of the other side when they say stuff that is false.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.3.1.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.9.6. Con: Sanders was wrong to try and limit someone's maximum salary when he said, in 1974, ""nobody should earn more than $1 million" [Bernie Sanders Flirted With 100% Marginal Tax on the Rich, Maximum Wage". Bloomberg.com. 2015-11-18. Retrieved 2018-02-10.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-18/bernie-sanders-flirted-with-100-percent-marginal-tax-on-the-rich-maximum-wage)
1.9.6.1. Pro: The government shouldn't try to control people's salaries, like professional athletes.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: If you want to raise some people's wages that is fine, but it is dumb to try to limit other people's wages. If companies are making bad decisions about their leader's wages they will go out of business, if we have a competitive marketplace. If we don't, we need additional regulation and monopoly reduction.
1.9.7. Pro: Sanders was right to try and prohibiting American companies from asserting themselves as foreign companies in the event that their management and operations were based in the USA. ["Sanders offers bill aimed at preventing corporate tax avoidance". The Hill. March 9, 2017.](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/323187-sanders-offers-bill-aimed-at-preventing-corporate-tax-avoidance)
1.9.7.1. Con: The United States government has no business telling private companies where they need to locate their headquarters. They should use tax incentives to convince companies to operate in America, but companies should not have their freedom restricted to move elsewhere.
1.9.8. Pro: [Truth Support:](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-provide-each-procon-argument-with-1-truth-2-linkage-or-relevance--3-importance-or-weight-sub-arguments-34419?path=34419.0~34419.3) Sanders is right to support the estate tax.
1.9.8.1. Con: Joe Biden also wants to tax inheritance by making the second generation pay capital gains tax, with the value of the stocks at the time of death, not the time of purchase. [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/this-is-how-joe-biden-will-tax-generational-wealth-transfer.html)
1.9.8.2. Pro: Sanders was right to propose an estate tax that would have exempted the first $3.5 million on an individual’s estate from the estate tax, and a married couple could shelter $7 million. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2015/06/25/bernie-sanders-calls-for-65-top-estate-tax-rate/#296d6ab7c722)
1.9.8.2.1. Pro: An individual shouldn't be able to pass on more than $3.5 million tax-free to their children.
1.9.8.2.1.1. Pro: The government has to take money from you either when you are dead or when you are alive, and it is better to take it from your kids, who deserve it less than you. 3.5 million, or 7 million, was enough money to support needy children.
1.9.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: You could still give your kids more than 7 million dollars, it would just be taxed after $7 million.
1.9.8.3. Pro: Sanders' bill from 2019 that provided an estate tax of 45% for the value of an estate between $3.5-10 million, 50% for the value of an estate between $10-50 million, 55% on the value of an estate between $50 million and $1 billion, and 77% on the value of an estate that exceeds $1 billion.[Jagoda, Naomi \(January 31, 2019\). "Sanders offers estate tax bill topping out at 77 percent". The Hill.](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/427834-sanders-offers-bill-to-expand-the-estate-tax)
1.9.8.3.1. Con: It's odd to go from no estate tax below $3.5M and jump all the way to 45%. Why do we need brackets? Why not just define a curve with y = Mx+b?
1.9.9. Pro: Sanders was right to propose legislation to break up "too big to fail" financial institutions.[Sanders, Bernie \(May 7, 2015\). "Break Up Big Banks". The Huffington Post. Retrieved May 19, 2015.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/break-up-big-banks_b_7233284.html)
1.9.9.1. Pro: "No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure would send the world economy into crisis. If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist."
1.10. Con: The strong progressive populism wing of the Democratic party is the best way to Win.
1.10.1. Con: Biden has not publicly supported most of the "progressive" policies that other nominees are currently promoting, which may help win him many votes in the general election.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Not all Americans are in favor of "progressive" policies. Progressive activists only make up [only about 8% of the population](https://hiddentribes.us/#americas-hidden-tribes).
1.10.1.1.1. Con: The study cited uses "hierarchical clustering" to identify groups, a machine learning technique with very subjective results [\(p. 28\)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_fall2012/slides/clustering.pdf).
1.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hierarchical clustering returns a dendrogram, each level of which corresponds to a different number of clusters. The researchers in the cited study chose to split the dendrogram at 7 clusters, without explaining why. The language in the article misleads the reader to believe the algorithm gave them 7 clusters instead of choosing that number. The number of clusters would greatly effect the cited proportion of "progressive activists".
1.10.1.1.1.2. Pro: Attaching semantic labels to data clusters found with machine learning ultimately requires a [judgement call](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spector/s133/Clus.html) made by the authors based on example cases. This is subjective in nature and it's unclear how well the assigned labels generalize to the whole cluster.
1.10.1.2. Con: Many progressive policies such as Medicare for All and Free College Tuition are [very popular among the general public](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/), so not supporting them puts him at a disadvantage.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: Slightly more than half of American voters self-identify as “[moderate](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/03/25/the_democratic_party_is_the_party_of_moderates_139846.html).”
1.10.1.2.1.1. Con: Self-identifying as moderate does not preclude one from supporting Medicare for All and free college.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Biden may be able to win over [previous Obama voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama-Trump_voters) who supported Trump last time.
1.10.2. Con: It is better for our country to have each side appeal to the other side, and try to speak their language during the general election, and win converts than to continually demonize the other side.
1.10.2.1. Pro: It was Karl Rove who stopped going to the middle and decided to get out the vote by appealing to the extremes. He made the issues all about emotional issues that would appear to a fanatical base and get out his base like gay marriage.
1.10.2.2. Pro: It is better for the Republicans and Democrats to speak to each other, with honest appeals to reason, than to talk about each other, with calls to emotion and confirmation bias, in dishonest attempts to misrepresented and straw man or oversimplify the other side.
1.10.3. Con: Extremist on one side justifies extremism on the other side in an endless tit-for-tat escalation and separation.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Calling Republicans racist all the time is not a winning strategy and makes them want to support Trump even more.
1.10.3.2. Pro: AOC has brought in countless money for the Republicans and Trump.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Bernie has brought in countless money for the Republicans and Trump.
1.10.4. Con: The strong progressive populism wing of the democratic party does not have a history of winning in America.
1.10.4.1. Pro: George McGovern was from the strong progressive populism wing of the democratic party, and one exactly one state in the worst landslide of American history. It's OK to make mistakes, but it is not OK to keep making the same mistakes.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Fritz Mondale was from the strong progressive populism wing of the democratic party and lost in a historic landslide. It's OK to make mistakes, but it is not OK to keep making the same mistakes.
1.10.4.3. Pro: Michael Dukakis was from the strong progressive populism wing of the democratic party and lost in a historic landslide. It's OK to make mistakes, but it is not OK to keep making the same mistakes.
1.10.5. Pro: Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that is genuinely supported by THE PEOPLE.
1.10.5.1. Pro: The other candidates are establishment hacks being used as puppets.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Bernie Sanders has been in the federal government for over 20 years, making him an insider and part of the establishment.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Bernie will never be a Puppet.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: Being careful of not destroying important parts of your country is not being a puppet.
1.10.5.2.2. Con: Listening to others, who know better is not being a puppet. Trump doesn't listen to his advisers very well, is that what you want?
1.10.5.2.3. Con: Being controlled by reason is not being a puppet. Good people have strings on them that keep them tethered to reality. Cutting the strings that keep your policy in line with the thinking of economists is not a virtue.
1.10.5.3. Con: Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden received more votes than Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries.
1.10.5.4. Con: Discounting the value of those who don’t agree with them is a prime example of the problem with Bernie Sanders and his supporters. The people who support other candidates are just as important as you are. Discounting whole groups of people as hacks puppets is the same thing that Trump does when he calls people losers.
1.10.5.5. Con: This statement is conflating a high level of support among a vocal minority of voters with a high level of support among all voters. The United States is split almost 50/50 between Conservative and Liberals, and within each half it is further broken down by support for specific issues or candidates. He isn't supported by the sum total of Americans, just by a subset of a subset of a subset of voters.
1.10.5.6. Con: Having some level of support among a group of people does not preclude someone from being corruptible. It is nonsensical to say "He has support from X number of people, therefore he will not be able to be corrupted".
1.10.5.7. Pro: Sanders receives [large numbers of small contributions](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/02/bernie-sanders-fundraising-millions-092446).
1.10.5.7.1. Con: Populism \(a political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups\) on the right and left are powerful movements with many backers.
1.10.5.7.1.1. Pro: Popularity shouldn't matter because the only thing that should matter is the weight \(quantity and quality\) of evidence you can support your belief.
1.10.5.7.1.1.1. Pro: Popular opinion is often dumb in culture and on the right and left. Showing that things are popular is not the same as showing that things are good.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.2.3.5.1.
1.10.7. Con: Biden provides a legacy of policy achievements that have appeal across the United States compared to a maverick and divisive candidate in Trump.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Biden was former Vice President to [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) for two terms.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: [In 2018](http://www.people-press.org/2018/07/11/obama-tops-publics-list-of-best-president-in-their-lifetime-followed-by-clinton-reagan/), Obama was voted by Americans as the best President in their lifetime. This likely means the public also holds a favorable view of Biden.
1.10.7.2. Pro: Joe Biden was one of the most [influential and effective](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/18/why-joe-biden-was-a-most-unusual-and-effective-vice-president/?utm_term=.a932776976c1) vice presidents in US history.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: Joe Biden oversaw the [implementation](https://www.history.com/topics/us-politics/joe-biden#section_3) of a $787 billion economic stimulus package after the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008).
1.10.7.2.2. Pro: Joe Biden was Chairman of the [Middle Class Working Families Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Class_Working_Families_Task_Force), a government initiative which introduced solutions to solve problems faced by working families.
1.10.7.2.3. Pro: Joe Biden successfully fought to have [$6.3 billion allocated](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/joe-biden-cancer-moonshot-bill-232342) to research aiming to [find a cure for cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Breakthroughs_2020).
1.10.7.3. Con: As a [senator for the state of Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden#U.S._Senate_years_\(1973-2009\)), Biden crafted and voted for bills that have had negative consequences.
1.10.7.3.1. Pro: Joe Biden helped craft and pass an [anti-crime bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act) that led states to have [financial incentives](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/30/joe-biden-senate-record-2016-campaign/73045484/) to imprison people, which particularly affected many black and Latino youths.
1.10.7.3.1.1. Con: This same bill [also provided](https://www.history.com/topics/us-politics/joe-biden#section_2) for 100,000 more cops nationwide and banned assault weapons.
1.10.7.3.2. Pro: Joe Biden [voted in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden#Iraq) of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has historically been an issue for any democratic nominee because the war is [widely considered](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/democrats-foreign-policy-2020_us_5aa959dbe4b0f4aaa112ef0f) one of the US's biggest mistakes.
1.10.7.3.3. Pro: Joe Biden co-sponsored the [Bankruptcy Reform Act \(1999\)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/833/all-info), which was opposed by consumer groups on the basis that it would make declaring bankruptcy [more costly and complex](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/30/joe-biden-senate-record-2016-campaign/73045484/). He also helped defeat amendments to this bill which would have protected people forced into bankruptcy by medical debts.
1.10.7.4. Con: Joe Biden has a history of being in favour of a ["hawkish" foreign policy](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk). This type of foreign policy is [unpopular](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/397010-will-democrats-realize-that-americans-are-tired-of-war) with the American people, and in particular those in the midwest.
1.10.7.4.1. Pro: A study has shown that 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton may have been cost the general election because of the [level of battlefield casualties](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989040) amongst those from midwestern states.
1.10.7.4.2. Pro: He has a reputation for bad foreign affairs decisions. Bob Gates was quoted as saying "[I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/bob-gates-memoir-slams-joe-biden-for-being-wrong-on-foreign-policy/)"
1.10.7.5. Con: [Biden advocated continued school segregation](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/joe-biden-embraced-segregation-in-1975-claiming-it-was-a-matter-of-black-pride) in the United States. In 1975 he opposed the federally mandated busing policy designed to end segregation in schools.
1.10.7.6. Con: Biden has a record of wanting to impose austerity by eliminating [Social Security and Medicare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j2k7tDK1gM). [\(and here at ~1:30\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=XBHlGFZCwu8)
1.10.8. Con: Joe Biden is extremely popular with the electorate. Therefore he is likely to be competitive in the general election.
1.10.8.1. Pro: The RealClearPolitics average of [polls in July 2019](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) shows that Biden is the public's preferred candidate to be the Democratic nominee, leading with 27%.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: In December 2006, Obama was the favorite Democrat nominee of [only 12%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries) of the public. This demonstrates that the results of early polling are largely inconsequential.
1.10.8.1.1.1. Pro: At this point \(July the year prior to the election\) in the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump was polling at [only 6%](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html) in the Republican primary race.
1.10.8.2. Con: Biden has run for the Democratic presidential nomination [twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden), in 1988 and 2008, and dropped out both times.
1.10.8.3. Pro: Polling in July 2019 suggests that the American people would far [prefer](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html) to elect Joe Biden as president \(average of 49.4%\) rather than reelect Trump \(40.5%\).
1.10.8.3.1. Con: Polling in July 2019 also indicates that Bernie Sanders \(average of 49.7%\) is preferred to Trump \(average of 43.2%\). Biden is therefore nothing special in terms of his popularity and electability compared to Trump and is not uniquely positioned to win.
1.10.8.3.2. Pro: ABC News & NYT has [obtained the polling data for June](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/14/trumps-internal-poll-numbers-are-out-both-they-his-teams-response-paint-bleak-picture/?utm_term=.7b00032ccd99), which show a brighter picture for Biden than any other candidate over all. "Trump trails Joe Biden by 16 points in Pennsylvania, 10 points in Wisconsin and seven points in Florida, and the president leads by just two points in red Texas."
1.10.8.4. Con: [Research](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/polls-as-accurate-as-they-have-ever-been-study-says) shows that early Presidential polling may not be very accurate. At this stage many candidates lack [name recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_recognition), and voters are still getting information and learning about the candidates and their policies.
1.10.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.1.1.
1.10.8.4.2. Con: Democratic voters are already very familiar with some of the candidates and their platforms. For example, [91% of voters](https://news.gallup.com/poll/243539/americans-maintain-positive-view-bernie-sanders.aspx) know Bernie Sanders, and he has been [extremely consistent](https://www.npr.org/2015/12/11/459231940/bernie-sanders-has-stuck-to-the-same-message-for-40-years) in his political positions for the last 40 years.
1.10.8.4.3. Pro: Notable pollsters believe that the results of democratic nominee polls at this point are largely just [reflective of name recognition](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/415765-2020-polls-are-about-name-id-at-this-point-say-pollsters).
1.10.8.5. Pro: Joe Biden is [popular](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/12/biden-donnelly-indiana-898519) in Midwestern states which are key for a Democratic electoral college win.
1.10.8.5.1. Pro: If Hillary Clinton had won [Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania](https://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-what-happened-2017-9) she would have beaten Donald Trump.
1.10.8.5.2. Con: Joe Biden has a history of being in favour of a ["hawkish" foreign policy](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk). This type of foreign policy is [unpopular](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/397010-will-democrats-realize-that-americans-are-tired-of-war) with the American people, and in particular those in the midwest.
1.10.8.5.2.1. Pro: A study has shown that 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton may have been cost the general election because of the [level of battlefield casualties](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989040) amongst those from midwestern states.
1.10.8.5.2.2. Pro: He has a reputation for bad foreign affairs decisions. Bob Gates was quoted as saying "[I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/bob-gates-memoir-slams-joe-biden-for-being-wrong-on-foreign-policy/)"
1.10.8.6. Pro: Biden's nearly [50 years of service in Congress and as Vice President](https://www.biography.com/political-figure/joe-biden) and his [reputation as a nice person](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/03/21/joe-biden-compassion-threatens-donald-trump-president-2020-column/3221879002/) grant him unparalleled [name recognition](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/11/18302119/joe-biden-name-recognition-polling-lead) and reputational quality amongst the public.
1.10.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.2.3.
1.10.10. Con: Trump's aides are rumored [to be nervous](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-2020-presidential-election-biden-warren-b3373114-970e-4b41-ac28-2a24c5905356.html) about Biden receiving the 2020 nomination.
1.10.10.1. Con: Campaign aides have a bad track record of knowing which opposing candidates will succeed. [Hillary Clinton's team believed running against Trump would be a slam dunk.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428)
1.10.10.2. Pro: Many of Trump's signature political campaign tactics would not work with Biden as his opponent.
1.10.10.2.1. Pro: Trump often uses [white supremacist or misogynistic "dog whistle" remarks](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/) to undermine his opponents but Biden is a white male and so these concepts wouldn't directly apply to Biden.
1.10.10.2.2. Pro: Trump often insults his opponents using nicknames like "[Lying Ted](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/vbj93m/trump-lyin-ted-cruz-texas-midterms-billboard)" and "[Crooked Hillary](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/931877599034388480?lang=en)" but the best Trump seems to be able to come up with for Biden is "Sleepy Joe" which is at least [not a moral indictment](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/451691-biden-shrugs-off-heckler-calling-him-by-trump-nickname-sleepy-joe).
1.10.10.2.3. Pro: Trump often uses the concept of communism or socialism as a [derogatory epithet](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-socialists-republicans_n_5c706ea1e4b03cfdaa553c17) against his opponents but the former Vice President's reputation is that of [a political moderate](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/joe-biden-last-hurrah-moderate-democrats.html) with a record of [cooperating with conservatives](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-republicans-watergate-2020-election-1443414).
1.10.10.3. Con: Trump himself [genuinely](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-2020-presidential-election-biden-warren-b3373114-970e-4b41-ac28-2a24c5905356.html) doesn’t appear to his aides to be worried about Biden. Trump says Biden is a joke and claims that once the spotlight is on him, "bad stuff" will come out.
1.10.10.4. Pro: Joe Biden has been likened to a "[compassionate conservative](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/opinion/joe-biden-bush.html)." He poses a legitimate challenge to the reactionary conservatism that tries to win by dividing the electorate.
1.10.10.5. Pro: Polling in July 2019 suggests that the American people would far [prefer](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html) to elect Joe Biden as president \(average of 49.4%\) rather than reelect Trump \(40.5%\).
1.10.10.5.1. Con: Polling in July 2019 also indicates that Bernie Sanders \(average of 49.7%\) is preferred to Trump \(average of 43.2%\). Biden is therefore nothing special in terms of his popularity and electability compared to Trump and is not uniquely positioned to win.
1.10.10.5.2. Pro: ABC News & NYT has [obtained the polling data for June](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/14/trumps-internal-poll-numbers-are-out-both-they-his-teams-response-paint-bleak-picture/?utm_term=.7b00032ccd99), which show a brighter picture for Biden than any other candidate over all. "Trump trails Joe Biden by 16 points in Pennsylvania, 10 points in Wisconsin and seven points in Florida, and the president leads by just two points in red Texas."
1.10.10.6. Con: It wouldn't be wise to consider the opinion of Trump aides when selecting a Democratic nominee.
1.10.10.6.1. Con: Trump's campaign soundly [beat](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2016/election-results.html) the Democrats in the 2016 Electoral College lending creedence to their perspectives on a candidate's electability.
1.11. Con: [Shared & valid interest between those who agree/disagree](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-help-us-post-the-likely-interest-of-those-who-agreedisagree-organized-within-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-34049?path=34049.0~34049.3&active=~34049.3https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-help-us-post-the-likely-interest-of-those-who-agreedisagree-organized-within-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-34049?path=34049.0~34049.3&active=~34049.3): Defeating Trump.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.2.3.2.
1.11.2. Pro: Trump is a bad person.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Trump is a bad example of how to treat women.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: Trump was wrong to brag about sexually assaulting women and having affairs.
1.11.3. Pro: Trump is a bad president.
1.12. Con: [We should identify and evaluate the validity of the interests of those who agree and disagree with each belief, eg:](https://www.kialo.com/we-must-identify-shared--compatible-or-opposing-interest-and-cant-do-it-with-just-the-procon-format-34049.79?path=34049.0~34049.3_34049.79&active=_34049.79) Harming a two-party system that makes ideas without involving the public \(please post pro/con arguments why this motivation is accurate or valid\).
1.12.1. Con: The two-party system results in a restriction of political ideas and should be harmed/undone.
1.12.2. Con: The reason the Democratic and Republican parties rose to prominence while the other parties went extinct or nearly extinct is because the two major parties \(D & R\) are the fittest and have the most desirable traits. Survival of the fittest is a [natural phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest) that occurs in evolution and biology.
1.12.3. Pro: Our political parties demonize the people they need to work with.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Our political parties need us to be afraid of the other side, in order for us to give them money.
1.12.3.2. Pro: We need the left and the right to talk to respect each other, value each other's perspectives, and listen to each other.
1.12.3.2.1. Pro: We need the left.
1.12.3.2.1.1. Pro: The left pushes for change, and sometimes our society needs to change.
1.12.3.2.1.2. Pro: Change involves the introduction of chaos, and we need both order and chaos \(yin and yang\).
1.12.3.2.2. Pro: We need the right.
1.12.3.2.2.1. Pro: Bad ideas probably killed off a lot of societies in the past. All societies alive now are filled with ideas that, if nothing else, allowed the societies that carried them to out complete the societies that are lost to history. Traditional thinking, at least won't kill us off in ways that societies that are lost to the ages were killed off.
1.12.3.3. Pro: Both the left and right can go to far.
1.12.3.3.1. Pro: Extremism and authoritarianism should be our enemy, not the left or the right.
1.12.3.3.2. Pro: The left has gone too far.
1.12.3.3.2.1. Pro: The full name of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Party was the "Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" or the National Socialist German Workers’ Party. Forced socialism, is not good.
1.12.3.3.2.2. Pro: Whenever the right or the left justify bad things for a very specific view of the greater good, that doesn't listen to those who disagree, they are pushing their dogma too far.
1.12.3.3.3. Pro: The right has gone too far.
1.12.3.3.3.1. Pro: The Nazis were ethno-nationalists, something often associated with tradition and avoiding change, and the right.
1.12.3.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.3.3.2.2.
1.12.4. Pro: Both political parties make too many decisions that ignore or oppose scientific data \(by using [anecdotes](https://theweek.com/articles/855835/problem-turning-anecdotes-into-political-arguments), [intuition](https://www.apa.org/monitor/mar05/misfires), [dogma](https://highexistence.com/8-symptoms-brain-compromised-political-malware/), [interest groups](https://www.dailysignal.com/2016/08/22/government-by-special-interests-is-the-problem-not-the-solution/), and [self-interests](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/1/18139787/rome-decline-america-edward-watts-mortal-republic)\).
1.12.4.1. Pro: If our political parties were really interested in following the data, they would let people post reasons to disagree with their conclusions on their websites.
1.12.5. Pro: [We should identify and debate the best podcasts that agree. For this debate:](https://www.kialo.com/kialo-should-allow-users-to-post-media-that-can-be-said-to-agree-or-disagree-with-a-belief-34034?path=34034.0~34034.3) The Freakonomics Podcast, Episode #356: "America's Hidden Duopoly" does a good job of showing that the two-party system \(like Bernie says\) and supports insiders instead of the best policy.
1.12.5.1. Pro: Bernie does not like Establishment democrats. This podcast explains the problems with the Establishment democrats. Bernie is one of the most famous 3rd party candidates. He was independent for many years. This podcast clearly explains the valid interests of people like Bernie who believe the two-party system is broken.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The podcast shows how the two parties' real enemies are not each other but any group that tries to threaten their Duopoly \(shared monopoly\) on American power.
