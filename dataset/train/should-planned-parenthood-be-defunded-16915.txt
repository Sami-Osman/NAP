Discussion Name: Should Planned Parenthood Be Defunded?

1. Planned Parenthood should be defunded.
1.1. Con: Decreased accessibility to Planned Parenthood services will increase economic strain on publicly funded health services and taxpayers.
1.1.1. Pro: The increase in unwanted pregnancies that will result from defunding Planned Parenthood will substantially increase medical costs.
1.1.1.1. Con: Research has indicated that the current measurement techniques may be greatly overestimating the number of unintended pregnancies \([p. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5159192/pdf/nihms803878.pdf)(Proper measurement of pregnancy intention is necessary for understanding its impact at the population level, and our findings empirically demonstrate that current approaches do not fully capture its multidimensional nature leading to the underestimation of intended and overestimation of unintended pregnancies. Specifically, we observed that the rate of unintended pregnancies decreased by 6% using a new construct which relaxed certain assumptions made in the NSFG as compared to the NSFG, which corresponds to a relative 12% decrease for all pregnancies.)\).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: As discussed in the same study, pregnancy intention is generally assessed after the fact, and is therefore subject to changes in perceptions of wantedness that are associated with different pregnancy outcomes \([p. 8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5159192/pdf/nihms803878.pdf)(It is also important to note that wantedness and pregnancy intention are typically assessed retrospectively. Once the child is born reflections on that time and ‘wantedness’ have been shown to change in other studies, especially given the terms we use to describe intention, though we observed a similar prevalence of intention among both current pregnancies and live births but higher than pregnancies overall. Moreover, intention is typically reported only for live births, and there may be important differences by pregnancy outcome \(particularly terminations\).)\).
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Recent mothers may be more likely to perceive their pregnancy as intentional after the child is born \([p. 249](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/3124999.pdf)(First is the recall bias implicit in retrospective questions about intention. Once a woman has a baby, she may be more likely to say that the pregnancy occurred at the right time, regardless of how she felt when she became pregnant. And perhaps, in retrospect, it did occur at the right time, even though the conception may not have been intended.)\).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The survey employed by the widely-used National Survey of Family Growth \(NSFG\) does not take into account a woman's reasons for forgoing birth control \([p. 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5159192/pdf/nihms803878.pdf)(Of note is that here we utilized information regarding the reasons for not using birth control, whereas the traditional NSFG construct does not use this information in this case. Third, if women reported that they had stopped birth control to become pregnant, they were classified)\).
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: 340,000 women each year become pregnant while forgoing birth control because they either want or do not mind becoming pregnant \([pp. 2-3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5159192/pdf/nihms803878.pdf)(Current measures of pregnancy intention may overestimate rates of unintended pregnancy, with over 340,000 pregnancies in the United States misclassified as unintended using the current approach, corresponding to an estimated savings of $678 million in public health care expenditures. Current constructs make assumptions that may not reflect contemporary reproductive practices and improved measures are needed.\n...\nSpecifically, using the new measure: 1\) women not using birth control because they wanted to become pregnant are now classified as intended regardless of the timing of the pregnancy; 2\) women not using birth control but reported they did not mind becoming pregnant are now classified as intended; and 3\) women who stopped using birth control to become pregnant are now classified as intended regardless of timing.)\). Such pregnancies should be classified as intentional rather than unintentional.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Any pregnancy where a woman is not actively looking to become pregnant should be classified as unintended.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Defunding Planned Parenthood will increase [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) spending by an estimated [$650 million](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/defunding-planned-parenthood-would-cost-the-government-dearly-56bc43a21222/)(The additional births would have to be covered by Medicaid, as would the needs of the children as they grew up and potentially other social safety net programs. Given all of those factors, Medicaid spending alone would increase by $650 million over 10 years, and even with the estimated savings of not giving funding to Planned Parenthood, net spending would increase.) over ten years.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: If Planned Parenthood is defunded, then there would be an [additional $520 million of Medicaid funding available](https://www.liveaction.org/news/no-defunding-planned-parenthood-wouldnt-cost-much-money/)(First, the CBO letter seems to assume the subsidies Planned Parenthood stops getting would simply disappear, when in reality they would be redirected to legitimate women’s health centers. Not only would existing centers, which vastly outnumber PP locations in every state, pick up the slack, but the money would go to expanding their operations and adding locations.\n...\n$130 million is less than 0.004% of FY2015’s $3.8 trillion budget. The last edition of Sen. Tom Coburn’s annual Wastebook identified $25 billion in ridiculous and unimportant projects. Medicaid spending is itself fraught with cost issues that need to be addressed anyway regardless of what we do about Planned Parenthood. And Obamacare, which pro-aborts tend to enthusiastically support and which Planned Parenthood promotes, will cost more than a trillion dollars over the time period in question.) to other clinics. Therefore, the proposed increase in cost is actually $130 million, and this figure does not account for the same services being offered elsewhere.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Defunding Planned Parenthood would cost the US taxpayers an extra [$77 million](https://qz.com/931467/cbo-report-it-will-cost-taxpayers-77-million-to-cover-the-new-babies-if-donald-trump-and-congress-cuts-planned-parenthood-funding/)(For those women, the bean-counters estimate, Medicaid would need to pay for thousands of additional births every year. They also forecast that these women’s children will require government-subsidized health care through Medicaid. Overall, that would lead to an estimated $77 million in additional Medicaid spending over the next decade.) in order to cover the future care expenses incurred by unintended pregnancies.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Each unintended pregnancy costs taxpayers about $4800 \([p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_unintended_pregnancy_thomas_monea.pdf)(Taxpayers save an average of about $4,800 per prevented unintended pregnancy. As a thought experiment to help us develop a sense of the policy implications of these estimates, we also project the amount that taxpayers would save if all unintended pregnancies were prevented. We estimate that these savings would total $6 billion annually.)\). Since Planned Parenthood prevents an estimated [579,000](https://www-m.cnn.com/2015/08/04/health/planned-parenthood-by-the-numbers/)(Planned Parenthood says it prevents an estimated 579,000 unintended pregnancies per year.) pregnancies annually \(saving over $2.7 billion\), its [$528 million](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/05/429641062/fact-check-how-does-planned-parenthood-spend-that-government-money)(Bush is right that Planned Parenthood receives $500 million a year in government funding — or, to be more exact, $528 million last year, according to Planned Parenthood's latest annual report.) in federal funding is comparitively nominal.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Funding currently earmarked for Planned Parenthood could be used to provide free, publicly funded contraception to all, greatly reducing this figure \([p. 3](https://iwpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contraception-fact-sheet_final.pdf)(Given the success that some present-day programs have had in reducing unintended pregnancies,\npolicymakers should be looking towards these models for potential economic benefits. These economic\nmotivations, however, must be balanced with women’s own needs and preferences so that their\nreproductive autonomy is respected. Increased legal and financial access to reliable contraception will\nundoubtedly have significant implications for women—including improving their economic outcomes.)\).
1.1.2. Pro: If Planned Parenthood is defunded, it is likely it would have to [close clinics](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-would-happen-if-planned-parenthood-was-defunded-6-frightening-options-2950007)(When individual states defund Planned Parenthood, clinics have closed within months. In Iowa, for example, a health and human services budget signed in May excluded health care providers offering abortion services from receiving family planning waivers and four of the state's 12 Planned Parenthood clinics closed.\n\nTexas was no different when the state directed family planning money away from abortion providers in 2011. One-fourth of the Lone Star State's family planning clinics had closed two years later, according to a Texas Policy Evaluation Project \(TxPEP\) study.) due to lack of funds.
1.1.2.1. Pro: There are not enough private healthcare providers in America to be able to cope with demand should Planned Parenthood have to [close clinics](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M17-0217)(Proponents of Planned Parenthood defunding often assert that other providers will fill the gap. They are wrong. Our health system is completely unprepared to meet that need: Both obstetrician–gynecologists and primary care physicians face workforce shortages. Planned Parenthood health centers help minimize the gap in primary care and reproductive health services in rural and medically underserved communities—54% of their health centers are located in those areas.).
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In 68% of counties with a family planning centre, [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-statement-on-new-york-times-story)(In 21 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood health center, Planned Parenthood was the only safety-net family planning provider; and in 68 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood health center, Planned Parenthood served at least half of all safety-net family planning patients.) serves at least half of all patients seeking family planning services, and Planned Parenthood is the only family planning service provider in 21% of all counties.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Approximately 2.8 million Americans require Planned Parenthood's services each year \([p. 1](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/9313/9611/7194/Planned_Parenthood_By_The_Numbers.pdf)\).
1.1.2.1.3. Con: The [laws of economics](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_microeconomics-theory-through-applications/s19-01-supply-and-demand-in-health-ca.html)(The law of demand applies to health care as in other markets) apply to the healthcare industry. Like other markets, there would be [a fluctuation and a return to equilibrium](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newSTR_69.htm)(Demand and supply can be plotted as curves. The point at which the two curves meet is known as the market quantity supplied. The market tends to naturally move toward this equilibrium – and when total demand and total supply shift, the equilibrium moves accordingly.) as providers expand or open new locations to fill the excess demand.
1.1.2.2. Con: Planned Parenthood could continue to be funded by private donors, rather than the government.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Relying on private donors to fund Planned Parenthood would allow recouped government funds to be redistributed to other areas of the economy and society.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The US is in need of an appropriate federally-funded integration strategy for immigrants \([p. 118](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/233150241700500106)(The Office of Citizenship in DHS should also expand its activities and set up more direct lines of communication with and support to all 50 state governments and other interested partners at the county and city levels. It should provide more seed funding — perhaps with complementary support from the philanthropic sector — to state, county, and city governments that want to establish their own immigrant affairs offices. Within its mission to engage partners in welcoming immigrants, promoting English, providing civic education, and encouraging citizenship, it should work with education officials at all levels of government to provide free or low-cost instruction to immigrants wanting to acquire US citizenship.)\).
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: The [associated increase in medical costs](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/254632-cbo-defunding-planned-parenthood-increases-government-spending)(Permanently defunding Planned Parenthood would end up increasing government spending by $130 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office \(CBO\). \n\nThe CBO, Congress’s nonpartisan scorekeeper, projects that defunding Planned Parenthood would actually end up increasing government spending, because it would result in more unplanned births as women lost access to services such as contraception. Medicaid would have to pay for some of those births, and some of the children themselves would then end up qualifying for Medicaid and other government programs.) that will result from defunding Planned Parenthood mean that the government will end up spending more, not less.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Taxpayer money could be distributed to health departments and used towards supporting adoption, both of which would only save lives, not end them.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Subsidies have proven to be effective at increasing the number children adopted from foster care \([p. 11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646856/pdf/nihms75777.pdf)(While many questions about adoption policy remain to be answered \(for example, more research on family recruitment and the matching process in adoption is much needed\), this study provides key evidence on the effectiveness of offering incentives to families who adopt children from foster care. State support for an adoptive family, before and especially after, the adoption is an important part of the family’s decision to adopt a child from foster care.)\).
1.1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: In America, there were around [862,320](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-incidence-service-availability-us-2017)(In 2017, an estimated 862,320 abortions were provided in clinical settings in the United States) abortions in 2017, but only [140,000](https://adoptionnetwork.com/adoption-myths-facts/domestic-us-statistics/)(Around 140,000 children are adopted by American families each year.) children are adopted annually. This shows that adoption alone is not a complete alternative to abortion.
1.1.2.2.1.3.2.1. Con: It has been estimated that there are [over 2 million US families](https://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families)(Some sources estimate that there are about 2 million couples currently waiting to adopt in the United States — which means there are as many as 36 waiting families for every one child who is placed for adoption.) who are waiting to adopt a child.
1.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Federal funding is desperately needed to [hire additional qualified teachers](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2020/10/08/491255/public-education-opportunity-grants/)(The need for greater federal investment in education is especially critical in light of the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Current projections predict state budget shortfalls that could lead to cuts in state funding for education at a time when there are increased demands on schools.) for public schools.
1.1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: Funding for valuable projects is not zero sum. Funding Planned Parenthood and better funding for teachers are not mutually exclusive options.
1.1.2.2.1.5. Con: Taxpayer money should be used to improve peoples' quality of life; there is plenty of [evidence](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/abortion-stories)(These stories are as unique as the people who shared them, but every single one is a reminder that abortion is not up for debate. It is not like the tooth fairy — only made real if you “believe” in it. Abortion is normal. Abortion is common. Abortion is one of many reproductive outcomes that nearly one in four women — as well as trans men and other non-binary people — will experience.) to suggest that people who get abortions are able to lead better lives because of them.
1.1.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: Many women are able to achieve personal life goals after they get an abortion \([pp. 9-10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642756/pdf/12905_2015_Article_259.pdf)(This study demonstrates that women who receive a wanted abortion are better able to aspire for the future than women who are denied a wanted abortion and must carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. Support for a woman to have access to abortion is often based on a belief that when faced with an unintended pregnancy, women who have an abortion have better life course trajectories than women who carry their unintended pregnancies to term. There is a belief that access to abortion is important for equal opportunities for women and for their financial stability. These findings provide evidence to support this premise.)\).
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood received nearly $600 million in private donations in 2019 \([p. 10](https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2020-04/BG3472.pdf)\).
1.1.2.2.3. Con: Planned Parenthood cannot survive on private donations alone.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood's 2014-15 report shows that private donations accounted for only $353 million per year, compared to $553 million per year from federal, state, and local funds \([p. 33](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2114/5089/0863/2014-2015_PPFA_Annual_Report_.pdf)(For The Year Ended June 30, 2015\nOperating & Other Funds\n\[All Amounts In Millions\]\n\nGovernment Health Services Grants\n& Reimbursements...553.7\nPrivate Contributions and Bequests...353.5)\).
1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Private contributions and donations to Planned Parenthood have [declined recently](https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/planned-parenthood-sets-new-record-abortions-single-year)(Planned Parenthood’s reported private contributions fell to $591.3 million in 2019 from $630 million in 2018. Likewise, the number of unique individual contributors fell from 1.5 million in 2018 to 1.1 million in 2019.).
1.1.2.2.3.3. Con: Private donations to Planned Parenthood saw a [sharp increase](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/25/progressive-donations-us-election-planned-parenthood-aclu)(Progressive causes in the US saw a spike in donations immediately after the election on 8 November from voters dismayed, outraged or even frightened by the outcome. In the weeks since, this wave of strategic giving has compounded.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has received more than 300,000 donations in the six weeks since the election, 40 times its normal rate. Around half the donors were millennials and 70% had never given to the family planning organization before, a spokesman told the Guardian.\n\nWomen’s reproductive rights are considered under threat on many fronts from an incoming Trump administration. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has such a reputation for being anti-abortion that since the election, 82,000 of Planned Parenthood’s donations have been from pro-choice supporters making gifts to them in his name.) after the 2016 election, suggesting that private donors will rally to support the organisation when [government funding](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/541?s=1&r=2) is lacking.
1.1.2.3. Con: As demand surges, many of the healthcare staff at Planned Parenthood would be incentivized to open their own private clinics.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Opening a medical clinic requires a [substantial capital investment](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/what-is-the-cost-of-starting-a-medical-practice)(Doctorly estimates that the cost of starting a medical practice ranges from $70,000 to more than $100,000, while Physician Practice Specialists \(PPS\) projects that the average monthly cost is $6,000.), which may be outside the reach of many Planned Parenthood staff.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Many Planned Parenthood workers have expressed [discontent](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Planned_Parenthood/Reviews) at pay fairness and transparency.
1.1.3. Con: There is research suggesting that consolidation amongst health care providers and services results in greater economy of scale, reduced cost \([p. 32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371367/pdf/pone.0174533.pdf)(Studies published in Health Care Science and Services journals highlighted that the effects and the benefits of the mergers depend on the type of the organizations involved; in particular the aggregations among similar organizations appears to be very effective.)\), and shorter waiting times for patients \([p. 4](http://www.hcaf.biz/Hospital%20Beds/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Bed%20planning%20HMC.pdf)(So if we combine the bed pool from two smaller hospitals \(or specialties\) into one we will obtain a host of positive benefits, namely, shorter waiting lists, shorter waiting times and far fewer poor quality outcomes such as long A&E trolley waits and patients placed into a bed in the wrong specialty. We also achieve slightly lower costs per patient due to the higher occupancy that can be sustained by a larger bed pool.)\).
1.1.3.1. Con: Providing pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, which are [free or subsidized at Planned Parenthood](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-to-get-a-free-pregnancy-test-2759723)(Once you think you are pregnant, you typically want to know for sure right away. The trouble is, store-bought pregnancy tests, while less expensive than a doctor's visit, can still cost more than you have in your wallet. A free pregnancy test is not hard to come by in many cities. You have a few locations to try. The vast majority do urine pregnancy tests.), through hospitals will [increase medical costs](https://www.fastmed.com/services/labs-and-xrays/pregnancy-testing/)(Pregnancy test costs depend on the type of test performed and where you purchase it. Home pregnancy tests generally run anywhere from $8 to $15. A test from a licensed medical provider may cost a bit more, but it can also be more accurate. Plus, a professional pregnancy test comes with trained medical staff to explain the results and your options.\n\nUrine pregnancy tests at a doctor’s office can vary widely in price, however. Always ask about cost before having the test done. Even with a co-pay from your insurance, you could end up spending as much as $100 or more.).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: This represents a change in funding source rather than cost, since the total number of pregnancy tests performed would not change substantially and the cost to manufacture and administer the tests would remain the same.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Because they specialize in women's health, Planned Parenthood performs over a million pregnancy tests each year and is therefore able to provide them at a lower price due to higher volume \([p. 18](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/6714/1996/2641/2013-2014_Annual_Report_FINAL_WEB_VERSION.pdf#page=20&zoom=110,-207,787)\).
1.1.3.2. Con: Most evidence suggests consolidation of providers actually [increases](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/what-we-know-about-provider-consolidation/)(A wide body of research has shown that provider consolidation leads to higher health care prices for private insurance; this is true for both horizontal and vertical consolidation.) costs and reduces the quality of care \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6170097/pdf/ms112_p0004.pdf)(Hospital competition improves\nquality of care. This is true under\nboth administered price systems\nsuch as Medicare and the English\nNational Health Service, and market\ndetermined pricing such as the private health insurance market.)\).
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Consolidation of healthcare providers has been associated with increased costs because it [lowers competition](https://www.ahip.org/how-hospital-consolidation-hurts-americans/)(Everyday Americans bear the brunt of hospital consolidation. Hospitals in highly concentrated markets can charge higher prices for medical services and have greater leverage to negotiate higher prices from health insurance providers, leading to ever-increasing health care costs for individuals and families. \n\nAccording to one study, hospital concentration has been linked to average annual Marketplace insurance premiums that are 5% higher than those in less concentrated areas. Another study looked at hospital prices for those with employer-provided health coverage. It found that hospitals that do not have any competitors within a 15-mile radius have prices that are 12% higher than markets with 4 or more competing hospitals.), particularly in concentrated markets.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: While consolidation has been associated with worsened self-reported patient experiences, research has demonstrated that it has not substantially affected [clinical processes or outcomes](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)(Hospital mergers and acquisitions from 2009 through 2013 were associated with modest deterioration in performance on patient-experience measures and no detectable changes in readmission or mortality rates at acquired hospitals. Effects on performance on clinical-process measures at acquired hospitals were inconclusive. \n...\nBecause patient experiences, by definition, constitute aspects of quality that are observable to patients, they may be particularly affected by weakened competitive pressures for hospitals to attract patients. By comparison, hospital performance on clinical-process measures or on outcomes such as readmission rates may be less observable to patients and thus less sensitive to the competitive landscape.).
1.1.3.3. Pro: Merging hospitals can lead to a cost saving of up to 7% \([p. 34](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Schmitt_HospitalMergersCosts.pdf)(Analyzing a large sample of hospital mergers between 2000 and 2010, I find that hospitals that were acquired \(“target hospitals”\) realized cost savings of 4 to 7 percent in the years following the merger \(on average\).)\).
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Cost cutting in hospitals may simply translate into increased profit for the provider rather than lower costs for the patient or insurer.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: A study by the American Hospital Association found that [revenue per admission was 3.5% lower](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/strategy/hospitals-claim-their-mergers-reduce-costs-disputing-other-studies)(Displeased with the numerous studies that have shown mergers among healthcare providers tend to lead to higher costs, the American Hospital Association released its own report Wednesday to defend the rapid consolidation in which its members have participated.\n...\nThe report says hospital acquisitions benefit patients by leading to "better care at reduced cost." Rather than directly studying the cost shouldered by patients and payers, however, the report used changes in hospital revenue as a proxy. Revenues per admission at acquired hospitals fell a statistically significant 3.5% compared to non-merging hospitals, according to the report. "These results suggest that savings that accrue to merging hospitals are passed on to patients and their health plans," the report's executive summary states.) in merged hospitals, indicating that savings are being passed on to patients and insurers.
1.1.3.4. Pro: [Consolidation](https://www.admere.com/amr-blog/consolidation-in-the-healthcare-industry)(Touted benefits of consolidation in the healthcare industry include:\n\n•Increased care coordination\n\n•Reduced duplication of clinical services\n\n•Improved clinical integration and management\n\n•Reduced operating costs of 15−30 percent for acquired hospitals\n\n•Increased local access to acute care services\n\n•Reduced administrative costs) of healthcare providers is also associated with increased coordination of care and less duplication of services.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Increased coordination of care is an essential component of healthcare reform, and can [help reduce costs](https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/print-edition/2014/04/11/increased-coordination-of-care-is-essential-for.html)(What can be done about the soaring cost of health care? The increased health care needs of seniors as they age can put a significant financial strain on both seniors and their families. Co-pays, prescription costs, hospital stays – they all add up. Increased coordination of care is essential for decreasing costs.).
1.1.3.4.2. Con: The House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has found that healthcare consolidation [has largely failed](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/congressional-hearing-on-healthcare-consolidation-3-things-to-know.html)("As I have discussed, consolidation in healthcare has not delivered on lower costs, improved coordination of care or enhanced quality. What has happened is that consolidation between hospitals, physician practices and insurers who are close competitors has reduced competition, leading to higher prices and harming quality," said Dr. Gaynor.) to produce improved coordination of care.
1.1.3.5. Con: When hundreds of women are diverted to hospital emergency rooms, which are required by law to provide service, it results in [longer emergency wait times](https://www.debt.org/medical/emergency-room-urgent-care-costs/)(The main reason that so many emergency room visits are for non-urgent care is that hospital ERs are required by federal law to provide care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. Since they can’t be turned away, patients without insurance, or the necessary funds to pay out-of-pocket costs, often utilize emergency rooms as their main health care provider. This puts tremendous strain on ERs and limits their ability to attend quickly to health emergencies.) for all.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: If emergency wait times began to increase, then hospitals would adjust their staffing levels accordingly to accommodate the additional patients in a reasonable amount of time.
1.1.4. Pro: The economic cost of [unsafe and illegal abortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion), in the absence of Planned Parenthood, would be immense.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Legal and accessible abortion procedures have a long-term effect of [reducing the crime rate](https://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/)(For the period from 1973-1988, the two sets of states \(high abortion states and low abortion states\) have nearly identical crime patterns. Note, that this is a period before the generations exposed to legalized abortion are old enough to do much crime. So this is exactly what the Donohue-Levitt theory predicts. But from the period 1985-1997, when the post Roe cohort is reaching peak crime ages, the high abortion states see a decline in crime of 30% relative to the low abortion states.). This is an economic benefit to society.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: It has been estimated that the legalisation of abortion resulted in a 17.5% reduction in crime between 1998 and 2014 \([p. 1](https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The_Impact_of_Legalized_Abortion_on_Crime.pdf)(We estimate that overall crime fell 17.5% from 1998 to 2014 due to legalized abortion— a decline of 1% per year. From 1991 to 2014, the violent and property crime rates each fell by 50%. Legalized abortion is estimated to have reduced violent crime by 47% and property crime by 33% over this period, and thus can explain most of the observed crime decline.)\).
1.1.4.1.2. Con: This is a controversial theory that rests upon unproven assumptions \([p. 61](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2566965)(Even if the abortion theory is valid, it is unlikely that an increase in abortions had much effect on a crime drop in the 2000s. The first cohort that would have been theoretically affected by abortion, 10 years after the 1990s, would be well beyond the most common crime committing ages in the 2000s. Based on available data, the frequency of abortions appears to currently be fairly constant. Since the variable does not appear to be shifting, a change in crime would not be expected. Although it may have had some small residual effect, there would likely be no effect on the 2000s drop attributed to legalized abortion.)\).
1.1.4.2. Con: The absence of economic competition for Planned Parenthood means that it is unlikely to strive for the provision of best economic outcomes.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Poor financial outcomes have also been noted in heathcare providers that have substantial competition, such as amongst smaller community hospitals \([p. 12](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/1997/10/commonground.pdf)(Poor financial outcomes have been observed particularly among small, not-for-profit community hospitals. For example, a three-year study of the financial performance of 1,297 such hospitals found that one-fourth of all sampled facilities were in a “crisis or warning status” \(Prince 1991\).)\).
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Many of Planned Parenthood's [competitors](https://www.owler.com/company/plannedparenthood/competitors)(Planned Parenthood's top competitors include SHC, Catholic Health Initiatives and BWH.) in general health services are [explicitly anti-abortion](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/29/20828866/obria-medical-clinics-birth-control-planned-parenthood)(Earlier this year, Obria received a $1.7 million federal grant through Title X, a program aimed at providing family planning services to underserved Americans. The program was designed, in part, to help people get affordable contraception like birth control pills and IUDs.\n\nBut critics say Obria clinics don’t actually provide those things. Instead, the group encourages “natural family planning,” a method of birth control that relies on tracking the monthly menstrual cycle and is generally less effective than hormonal contraception.\n\nObria is run by an anti-abortion activist and has long been positioning itself as an anti-abortion competitor to Planned Parenthood.).
1.1.4.3. Pro: Treatments for complications that occur due to unsafe and illegal abortions result in [substantial costs](https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2019/what-will-happen-to-womens-health-if-abortion-is-banned/)(Countries where restrictive laws are currently making the practice less safe do indeed face thousands of deaths related to unsafe abortion. Each year, globally, at least eight percent of global maternal deaths are estimated to have been caused by complications from an unsafe abortion, with as many as 22,800 women dying annually. In addition, we know that deaths related to illegal abortion are likely just the tip of the iceberg of complications related to unsafe abortion. The most recently available data suggest that 7 million women were treated for complications from unsafe abortions, or an annual rate of about 6.9 per 1,000 women ages 15-44.).
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Women who cannot access abortion safely and who subsequently choose backstreet clinics often end up requiring [emergency hospital care](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/unsafe-abortion-forgotten-emergency)(When a woman or girl is determined to end her pregnancy she will do so, regardless of the safety and legality of the procedure. Where safe abortion care is not available, she will often risk her life with an unsafe abortion because the prospect of continuing the pregnancy is unbearable.\n\nMeanwhile, the scale of post-abortion complications is enormous, with an estimated seven million women and girls hospitalized every year. Some will be permanently disabled, and some will never be able to carry a child again.).
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Legalised abortion substantially reduces the risk of complications and [death](https://www.guttmacher.org/perspectives50/abortion-and-after-legalization)(In a 1976 article, researchers from the Center for Disease Control examined national abortion data from the three years surrounding the rulings and estimated that the number of illegal procedures in the country plummeted from around 130,000 to 17,000 between 1972 and 1974. The number of deaths associated with illegal abortion decreased from 39 to five in that same time period; women who died as a result of illegal abortions typically were black, were more than 12 weeks pregnant and had self-induced in their own community.) from unsafe abortions.
1.1.4.3.3. Con: If an abortion is illegal, this does not automatically imply that it is also unsafe \([p. 3](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/2006/07/10/PreventingUnsafeAbortion.pdf)(Illegal abortions are not necessarily unsafe, legal abortions are not necessarily safe, and clandestine abortions occur in countries where abortion is legal and free of charge. Clandestine providers may be skilled in abortion provision and provide high quality abortion care in some cases, while government certified providers may offer poor service and quality of care so that women turn to untrained abortion providers who may be more respectful of confidentiality and privacy.)\).
1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: Around 40% women who undergo an illegal abortion have [complications](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2009/11/facts-and-consequences-legality-incidence-and-safety-abortion-worldwide)(About 40% of women who have a clandestine abortion experience complications that require treatment.) that require medical treatment, compared to only 2% of [abortions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28613544/)(The total abortion-related complication rate of all sources of care including emergency departments and the original abortion facility is estimated to be about 2%.) in general.
1.1.4.4. Con: These could be reduced by governments cracking down on facilities that provide [unsafe and illegal abortions](https://www.lifenews.com/2016/06/16/kentucky-governor-can-shut-down-illegal-abortion-clinic-appeals-court-says/)(According to the state’s lawsuit, the Lexington abortion clinic tried to pass itself off as a physician’s office, but state investigators discovered that it was only doing abortions and abortion-related procedures. Kentucky requires that abortion clinics obtain special licenses from the state, and EMW did not. According to state abortion statistics, the Lexington clinic performed 411 abortions on unborn babies in 2015.\n...\nState investigators also said they found numerous health and safety violations at the abortion clinic, including a “significant quantity” of expired medication, medical equipment covered in dust, dirt and grime; and improper sanitation. It also did not have emergency agreements with a local hospital and ambulance service, as required by law, according to the state’s lawsuit.).
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Research has shown that [restricting access to abortion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/abortion)(Evidence shows that restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number of abortions; however, it does affect whether the abortions that women and girls attain are safe and dignified. The proportion of unsafe abortions are significantly higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries with less restrictive laws.) does not decrease the number of abortions. In the absence of qualified care, the number of unsafe abortions will likely [rise](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/abortion)(However, when people with unintended pregnancies face barriers to attaining safe, timely, affordable, geographically reachable, respectful and non-discriminatory abortion, they often resort to unsafe abortion.\n\nGlobal estimates from 2010–2014 demonstrate that 45% of all induced abortions are unsafe. Of all unsafe abortions, one third were performed under the least safe conditions, i.e., by untrained persons using dangerous and invasive methods.) despite efforts to prevent them.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: This could also lead to the prosecution of women seeking such abortions \([p. 66](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/2006/07/10/PreventingUnsafeAbortion.pdf)(As stated in the Declaration on Principles, which emerged from a roundtable on ethics and reproductive issues in 1994, “An example of a policy that produces a preponderance of unfavorable consequences for reproductive health is criminalization of abortion.”)\).
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: The risks posed by illegal abortions should not be used to [justify](https://secularprolife.org/2014/04/the-threat-of-illegal-abortions-doesnt/)(When a society holds that a particular course of action is wrong because it unjustifiably violates the rights of others, it must make such an action illegal. Thus, for instance, assault is illegal, as is theft, and any number of other violations of other human beings’ rights. This principle is usually so obvious that we hardly give it a moment’s thought. You can’t just hit people for no reason. Or take their stuff.\n\nBut the illegality of assault and theft doesn’t, in fact, stop those crimes from occurring. They happen anyway, although they are illegal. And we don’t argue that because people continue to commit such crimes, we should just make them legal and not worry about the morality involved.) legal abortion.
1.1.5. Con: Increased medical costs for the healthcare system can be covered through changing the the federal budget \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695931/pdf/AJPH.2015.302908.pdf)(There is no absolute measure of the optimal level of public health spending. However, an Institute of Medicine panel recently concluded that public health agencies are markedly underfunded, and that US health spending is out of balance, with spending for clinical care disproportionately high compared with spending for “population-based activities that more efficiently and effectively improve the nation’s health.” The current trajectory of health spending seems unlikely to close the funding gap identified by the Institute of Medicine panel.)\).
1.1.5.1. Con: Since every dollar Planned Parenthood receives [saves taxpayers](https://thinkprogress.org/u-s-taxpayers-save-7-for-every-dollar-the-government-spends-on-family-planning-8eb5c609401f/#.ql3citd86)(With so many fewer pregnancies among this population, appropriating funding for family planning works out to be very good deal for the government. It eliminates a significant amount of potential Medicaid spending, since states don’t have to pay as much for abortions, for miscarriages, or for maternity and infant care. “This investment resulted in net government savings of $13.6 billion in 2010, or $7.09 for every public dollar spent,” the researchers conclude.) $7 in Medicaid costs, the net benefit arguably outweighs taxpayers' investment.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The most common service Planned Parenthood provides is STI testing \([p. 7](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/71/53/7153464c-8f5d-4a26-bead-2a0dfe2b32ec/20171229_ar16-17_p01_lowres.pdf)(Impact of Planned Parenthood\nHealth Centers in 2016\n\n9.5 Million Services Provided\n\n4,434,039 STI Testing & Treatment)\). [Early detection](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00054174.htm)(Early detection and treatment of other STDs should be a critical component of national, state, and local strategies to prevent HIV infection and AIDS, in concert with the behavioral and other interventions that constitute a comprehensive HIV prevention approach. Because the United States has the highest rates of curable STDs among industrialized nations and a high prevalence of HIV infection, the potential impact of enhanced STD control on the prevention of sexually transmitted HIV infections in the United States is likely to be substantial.) drastically reduces total cost to treat the STI, and improves outcomes.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: STIs are on the [rise](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sexually-transmitted-infections-are-on-the-rise-should-you-worry-2019121118370) in America, so the importance of Planned Parenthood's testing services will continue to increase.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: Most people are [reluctant](https://www.better2know.co.uk/blog/embarrassed-about-going-to-a-sexual-health-clinic/) to go for STI testing.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Reducing the available locations and organizations for testing will not help.
1.1.5.2. Pro: In 2019-2020 Planned Parenthood received $618.1 million from government health services reimbursements and grants \([p. 38](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/67/30/67305ea1-8da2-4cee-9191-19228c1d6f70/210219-annual-report-2019-2020-web-final.pdf)(Revenue \[All amounts in millions\]\n\nGovernment Health Services\nReimbursements & Grants: 618.1)\). This money would have been more efficiently utilized by other medical providers, such as hospitals and clinics.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Due to [mergers with religiously-motivated organizations](https://www.aclu.org/other/hospital-mergers-threat-reproductive-health-services)(Motivated by the need to remain competitive in a fast-changing health care market, many nonsectarian hospitals have recently been merging with religiously controlled hospitals. As a condition of the merger, religiously controlled hospitals have often demanded that nonsectarian hospitals observe religious prohibitions against providing certain reproductive health services. The most publicized and significant prohibitions are found in the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. The Directives bar Catholic health care facilities from providing abortions, elective sterilizations, contraceptive services and supplies, most forms of assisted reproduction, comprehensive AIDS prevention and condom distribution, and "morning-after" pills \(which prevent implantation of a fertilized egg\) for rape victims.), many hospitals no longer offer common reproductive health services.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Because of specialisation, Planned Parenthood centers are [substantially more efficient](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/09/barry-loudermilk/would-gop-bill-expand-womens-health-care-curbing-p/)(First, there’s a capacity problem. Planned Parenthood centers tend to be unusually efficient in providing health services to women, because that’s their specialty. The average Planned Parenthood clinic served 2,950 patients for contraceptive services in 2015, compared to 320 for the average federally qualified health center,) than community health clinics at providing healthcare to women.
1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Research suggests that Planned Parenthood is a relatively efficient provider of family planning services \([p. 32](https://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/IPPF_Underserved_Overlooked.pdf)(Evidence suggests both women and providers recognize the merits of a ‘one stop shop’. In terms of convenience and cost efficiency for both women and providers, it makes sense to combine compatible services. In a single facility, travel expenses and service overheads are reduced for women and providers respectively. A formal relationship between geographically distant facilities carries the benefits of economy of scale.)\).
1.1.5.2.2.2. Con: Defunding Planned Parenthood would drastically change the competitive landscape; many of the existing providers would likely begin to specialize in women's healthcare because of the excess demand.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: There are [substantially more](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/09/barry-loudermilk/would-gop-bill-expand-womens-health-care-curbing-p/)(We looked at a census of clinics that provide contraceptive services published in April 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health nonprofit. The group tallied up various types of clinics, the most numerous of which are "federally qualified health centers" -- defined by the federal government as "safety-net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic." Such facilities can include community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers.\n\nFor 2015, the census tallied 5,829 federally qualified health centers nationally, compared to 676 Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nThat’s a ratio of greater than 8-to-1, so the adjective "vastly" seems appropriate.) federally qualified health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics.
1.1.5.2.3.1. Con: [Federally qualified health centers](https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/data-explorer?paramServiceId=EHB%20SITE)(HRSA programs provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, economically or medically vulnerable. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, mothers and their families, and those otherwise unable to access high quality health care. HRSA also supports access to health care in rural areas, the training of health professionals, the distribution of providers to areas where they are needed most, and improvements in health care delivery.) include a wide range of disparate providers targeting different groups. Thus, the fact that they are greater in number may not necessarily translate into the same level of organizational efficiency demonstrated by Planned Parenthood.
1.1.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: Federally qualified health centers comprise numerous independent community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers.
1.1.5.2.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood spent $364.2 million on management and fundraising in 2019-2020 \([p. 39](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/67/30/67305ea1-8da2-4cee-9191-19228c1d6f70/210219-annual-report-2019-2020-web-final.pdf)(Operating & Other Funds\n\[All amounts in millions\]\n\nSupporting Services \(Total\): 364.2\n» Management & General: 245.6 \n» Fundraising: 118.6)\). Providing the same services through hospitals and clinics would lower administrative costs.
1.1.5.2.4.1. Con: Only 24% of Planned Parenthood's 2019-2020 spending went to administrative costs \([p. 37](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/67/30/67305ea1-8da2-4cee-9191-19228c1d6f70/210219-annual-report-2019-2020-web-final.pdf)(2020 Expenses by Percentage\n\nManagement & General Support: 16%\nFundraising: 8%)\), compared to the [34.2%](https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/us-administrative-healthcare-spending-reached-812b-in-2017)(Administrative healthcare spending totaled $812 billion in 2017, representing over one-third \(34.2 percent\) of total expenditures for physician practices, hospitals, long-term care, and private payers, according to a new study.) spent on administration in US healthcare spending overall.
1.2. Con: Planned Parenthood empowers individuals, giving them greater control over their own healthcare.
1.2.1. Pro: The main beneficiaries of Planned Parenthood's crucial reproductive healthcare services are lower income individuals who may not be able to afford private clinics.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Private clinics that accept [Medicaid](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood) \(which Planned Parenthood does\) are few and far between, further complicating access for low income individuals.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is an argument for opening new clinics that accept Medicaid, rather than an argument for funding Planned Parenthood.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In 2014, 79% of Planned Parenthood’s patients had income at or below 150% of the federal poverty level \([p. 1](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/9313/9611/7194/Planned_Parenthood_By_The_Numbers.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: At least 60% of Planned Parenthood patients rely on public health programs like Medicaid and Title X for their preventive and primary care. If it were [defunded](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/how-federal-funding-works-at-planned-parenthood)(At least 60% of Planned Parenthood patients rely on public health programs like Medicaid and Title X for their preventive and primary care. So, when you hear extreme politicians talking about “defunding” Planned Parenthood, they really mean blocking patients who rely on public health care programs from getting their care at Planned Parenthood centers — patients like Casey.), these people would not have healthcare options.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: There are numerous other factors aside from access to care that contribute to poor health outcomes for lower income individuals \([p. 2](https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/factsheets/pdfs/PoorInPoorHealth.pdf)(Material factors like unhealthy housing, unemployment, and food insecurity all affect one’s health. The amount of exposure one has to pollution and other biohazards can also lead to poor health. Increased stress and social isolation can lead to conditions like heart disease and asthma. People that are poor or near poor are usually most susceptible to the material factors and psychosocial conditions that lead to poor health.)\).
1.2.1.2. Pro: In 2019, Planned Parenthood became unable to accept [Title X](https://opa.hhs.gov/grant-programs/title-x-service-grants/about-title-x-service-grants)(For 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and related preventive health services for millions of low-income or uninsured individuals and others.) family planning funds due to the Trump administration's [domestic gag order](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2019/03/04/domestic-gag-rule-to-begin-in-60-days-as-democrats-question-policys-legality/)(The policy bans Title X funds from going to health providers who perform abortions or refer patients for abortion care, and it requires clinics to physical separate Title X-funded family planning services and abortion services.) on abortion counseling and providers.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The removal of Title X funding resulted in over 1,000 health centers in 33 states [leaving the program](https://reproductiverights.org/biden-administration-to-rescind-trump-era-domestic-gag-rule/)(The rule resulted in more than 1,000 health centers across 33 states leaving the program and nearly halved the network’s capacity to serve patients.) and greatly reduced the network’s capacity to help patients.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: In Texas, when Planned Parenthood was defunded, one study reported that pregnancy-related deaths [doubled](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-pregnancy-related-deaths-double-9172022.php)(The numbers and rate of pregnancy-related deaths in Texas women has nearly doubled in the years since the state's drastic 2011 reduction in funding for Planned Parenthood and other women's health clinics, according to a new study.).
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The affected patients could gain access to care at other Title X-approved providers.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: [Six states](https://reproductiverights.org/biden-administration-to-rescind-trump-era-domestic-gag-rule/)(Six states—Hawaii, Maine, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington—are now without a single provider with Title X funding.) were left without a single Title X provider.
1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: There are numerous Title X clinics across the US \([pp. 1-103](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/title-x-family-planning-directory-November2021.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: The order required documentation of efforts to include family participation that posed a serious risk to patient confidentiality requirements, particularly for adolescent patients \([p. 2](https://degette.house.gov/sites/degette.house.gov/files/HHS.2019.2.28.%20Letter%20to%20Azar%20Title%20X%20final%20rule.HE_.OI_.pdf)(Furthermore, the final rule requires additional documentation of efforts, if any, made to encourage family participation in family planning decisions. This challenges the trust of patient confidentiality, particularly for minors, that has long been the underpinning of care offered\nwithin a Title X health center. While the Department states that this rule is “sensitive to confidentiality issues,” it does not clarify how and only references “serious risk to the minor” as a reason for a health care professional to practice appropriate discretion related to family engagement.)\).
1.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: [Parents should be involved](https://www.youthpower.org/youthpower-issues/topics/parents-youth)(Parents play a critical role in promoting healthy behaviors among youth. The roles that parents may play in adolescents’ lives can include guidance on connecting to others, behavior control, respect for individuality and roles in society, modeling of appropriate behavior, and providing for and protecting youth. Parent-child relationships can influence such issues as early sexual initiation, early marriage, substance use, and depression among adolescents.\n...\nA review by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) identified key roles parents need to play to help protect youth from unhealthy behaviors. The WHO also published a review of existing projects that are working with parents \(see links below\). Some programs for parents show promising results in improving attitudes, increasing parent-child communication, and decreasing sexual risk-taking by youth.) in the reproductive health decisions of adolescent children, since adolescent brains are significantly [less equipped](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/why-teenagers-make-bad-decisions-a-parents-guide/9349084)(Research has shown youth aged 12 to 17 years are significantly less psychosocially mature than those aged 18 to 23 years who are also less psychosocially mature than adults \(24 and older\).\n\nOverall, teenagers' psychosocial immaturity makes them more likely to:\n\n• seek excitement and engage in risk-taking behaviour\n• make choices on impulse\n• focus on short-term gains\n• have difficulty delaying gratification\n• be susceptible to peer pressure\n• fail to anticipate consequences of their choices) to make complex, rational decisions.
1.2.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Adolescents are entitled to privacy in their reproductive healthcare decisions \([p. 173](https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2020/04/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care.pdf)(Mature minor: An adolescent younger than the age of majority who, even if living at home as a dependent, demonstrates the cognitive maturity to give informed consent. The capacity of an adolescent to consent for health care as a mature minor is influenced by the minor’s developmental maturity, previous experience with illness, the gravity of the current illness, and the risks of proposed therapy. The right of a mature minor to consent to medical care without previous parental or guardian consent has been recognized in many states.)\).
1.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: The order enabled biased family planning that promoted abstinence-only and natural family planning over the use of modern contraceptive methods \([p. 2](https://degette.house.gov/sites/degette.house.gov/files/HHS.2019.2.28.%20Letter%20to%20Azar%20Title%20X%20final%20rule.HE_.OI_.pdf)(The Department also appears to be encouraging the participation of non-traditional applicants, such as those who promote abstinence-only-until\nmarriage or natural family planning but who do not or will not offer a broad range of effective contraceptive methods and services, despite the statutory requirement to do so.’)\).
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: The Title X program provides family planning services to individuals who are facing [significant barriers](https://reproductiverights.org/biden-administration-to-rescind-trump-era-domestic-gag-rule/)(The Title X program disproportionately serves people that face significant barriers to accessing health care, including people with low incomes, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, people living in rural areas, and members of the LGBTQ community.) to obtaining healthcare, including people with lower incomes, ethnic minorities, rural residents, and LGBTQ individuals.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The [affected services](https://reproductiverights.org/biden-administration-to-rescind-trump-era-domestic-gag-rule/)(The Title X program is the nation’s only dedicated family planning safety net, providing reproductive health care services to over four million people living on low incomes who are under-and uninsured. Health centers that make up the Title X network play an essential role in ensuring access to contraceptive care and counseling, STI testing and treatment, HIV services, cancer screenings, and other preventive health care. \n\nThe Title X program was created by Congress in 1970 to provide family planning and preventive health screenings that would otherwise be out of reach for many people.) were entirely unrelated to abortion procedures.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: In 2021, the Biden administration reversed the gag order, since it had been found to pose [a risk to women's health](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/28/memorandum-on-protecting-womens-health-at-home-and-abroad/)(The Title X Rule has caused the termination of Federal family planning funding for many women’s healthcare providers and puts women’s health at risk by making it harder for women to receive complete medical information. \n\nIt is the policy of my Administration to support women’s and girls’ sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally.).
1.2.1.2.2.3. Con: Family planning services are not an [essential element of healthcare](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/what-marketplace-plans-cover/)(All plans offered in the Marketplace cover these 10 essential health benefits:\n\n-Ambulatory patient services \n-Emergency services\n-Hospitalization \n-Pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care\n-Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment \n-Prescription drugs\n-Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices \n-Laboratory services\n-Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management\n-Pediatric services, including oral and vision care\n...\nEssential health benefits are minimum requirements for all Marketplace plans.); other services are far more important to these groups.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: Because there is a restriction on federal funding of abortion, it is reasonable to require that family planning clinics be physically separated from clinics that perform abortions or abortion counselling in order to receive Title X funding.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: The rule removed Title X funding for non-abortion related services based on activities that are completely outside the scope of Title X \([p. 2](https://degette.house.gov/sites/degette.house.gov/files/HHS.2019.2.28.%20Letter%20to%20Azar%20Title%20X%20final%20rule.HE_.OI_.pdf)\).
1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: It is more difficult for clinics that offer services both related and unrelated to abortion to accurately account for the utilisation of funds from different sources.
1.2.1.2.3.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that Planned Parenthood was using Title X funds for abortion-related services.
1.2.1.2.4. Con: Because the federal funding of abortion is restricted, Title X funded family planning services should not be able to recommend or refer patients for abortion.
1.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: It is reasonable for the US government to demonstrate a preference for minimizing the number of nontherapeutic abortions because the state has a [compelling interest in promoting childbirth](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/464/)(The Connecticut regulation does not impinge upon the fundamental right of privacy recognized in Roe, supra, that protects a woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. That right implies no limitation on a State's authority to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.\n...\nConnecticut's regulation is rationally related to and furthers its "strong and legitimate interest in encouraging normal childbirth,"\n...\nThe subsidizing of costs incident to childbirth is a rational means of encouraging childbirth. States, moreover, have a wide latitude in choosing among competing demands for limited public funds.).
1.2.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The Hyde Amendment [saves lives and represents the conscience](https://diopitt.org/hyde-amendment-a-catholic-call-to-action)(Research shows that that the Hyde Amendment has saved over 2.4 million children since its adoption. By reducing abortion, mother’s lives are also saved as it eliminates the complications that can follow abortion. \n\nThe majority of Americans oppose the use of their taxpayer dollars for abortion. Many are opposed for reasons of moral convictions or religious belief. The Hyde Amendment does not interfere with the state legislatures or the people of each state deciding whether or not to use state funding for abortions. In fact, most states have decided to follow the amendment’s policy, sometimes by direct vote of the populace. The elimination of the Hyde Amendment could force every state to include elective abortions as part of their Medicaid benefits.) of the American public; in 2005, Hyde was expanded to include the Weldon Amendment, a [conscience clause](https://firstamendmentlawreview.org/2020/02/03/tipping-the-balance-the-conscience-rule-religious-freedom-and-health-care/)(The Church Amendments bar the federal government from withholding funding from medical providers who refuse to perform or assist in abortions or sterilization and protects those providers from retaliation by their employers. The Weldon Amendment and Coats-Snowe Amendment prevent state governments from imposing similar requirements on providers objecting to abortion.\n...\nThe groups state that protecting the religious consciences of a broad array of healthcare workers accords with historical protections under the First Amendment. They argue that “complicity in an act creates an unconstitutional conscience burden,” that providers have lost their jobs because of their commitment to their faith, and that “\[c\]onscience rights are not based on one’s professional status.” The groups argue that medical professionals must heal and “do no harm,” citing the Hippocratic Oath.) protecting the rights of healthcare providers to abstain from abortion-related procedures on moral grounds \([p. 1](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/weldon-amendment.pdf)(The Weldon Amendment bars funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \(HHS\) from going to federal agencies and programs or state and local governments that “discriminate” against health insurance plans, health care institutions or health care professionals that refuse to “provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.” It has been included in annual spending bills for HHS, alongside the Hyde Amendment, since fiscal year 2005.)\).
1.2.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: The state's interest in promoting childbirth has been legally interpreted as comprising four distinct categories: prenatal welfare interests; postnatal welfare interests; social values; and social effects \([p. 346](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2599680)(It is important to distinguish prenatal welfare, postnatal welfare, social values, and social effects interests because some provide relevant reasons to regulate under circumstances in which others do not, and courts have appropriately treated some as stronger sources of justification than others.)\).
1.2.1.2.4.1.3. Con: The state's interest in childbirth should not override a [woman's fundamental rights](https://www.aclu.org/other/whats-wrong-fetal-rights)(Permitting legal actions on behalf of stillborn fetuses or enacting laws to protect fetuses opens a Pandora's box in terms of how the law treats pregnancy and childbirth.

1.2.1.2.4.1.4. Con: If people are unable to have an abortion due to economic reasons, any child\(ren\) they have may require [state care](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/focus-areas/foster-care). This costs the government and taxpayers [millions](https://crosscut.com/2017/10/short-term-foster-care-costs-washington-state-taxpayers-millions) of dollars.
1.2.1.2.4.2. Con: The federal restrictions only prevent the funding of abortion procedures; family planning services are remiss in their duty to the patient if they fail to discuss abortion as a possible option.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: The Affordable Care Act prevents the Department of Health and Human Services \(HHS\) from creating rules that [interfere with communications](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/09/title-x-trump-abortion-argument-9th-circuit.html)(Affordable Care Act explicitly prohibits HHS from making any rule that “interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment options between the patient and the provider,” “restricts the ability of health care providers to provide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions,” or “impedes timely access to health care services.”) between a healthcare provider and patient regarding the available treatment options.
1.2.1.3. Con: Low income individuals are not empowered by the existence of Planned Parenthood; their overreliance on a single provider for reproductive health is a sign of their disempowerment.
1.2.1.4. Con: Low-income individuals have a number of [free](https://blog.healthsherpa.com/free-or-low-cost-medical-care/) [healthcare](https://institute.org/health-care/services/free-clinics-for-the-uninsured/) [clinic](https://www.nafcclinics.org/) options besides Planned Parenthood.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Planned Parenthood may be the only clinic in a [rural area](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-would-happen-if-planned-parenthood-was-defunded-6-frightening-options-2950007)(When Texas clinics were forced to shutter, women who lost their closest clinic had to drive an average of 85 miles to get an abortion, the TxPEP study found. Some had to drive more than 250 miles.\n\nObstacles such as distance compound for low-income women who can't afford to take off work, secure childcare, and stay in a hotel in order to end a pregnancy, especially considering 27 states require women to wait at least 24 hours after receiving mandatory counseling to actually have an abortion. This forces women to drive hours in each direction more than once or pay to stay near the clinic.). Closing these clinics would have a significant effect on the reproductive health of rural America.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: The National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics \(NAFC\) has [more than 1,400 free clinics and pharmacies](https://nafcclinics.org/)(The National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics \(NAFC\) is the only nonprofit 501c\(3\) organization whose mission is solely focused on the issues and needs of medically underserved people throughout the U.S. and the more than 1,400 Free and Charitable Clinics and Charitable Pharmacies that serve them. NAFC programs provide a wide range of support to our members and in turn patients through funding, education and training, advocacy, standards, disaster relief, and more.) to serve those who are unable to afford healthcare.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: Most free healthcare clinics for low-income individuals, such as the [Institute for Family Health](https://institute.org/health-care/services/free-clinics-for-the-uninsured/)(The Institute for Family Health receives generous support from Robin Hood to operate two free clinics, one in the Bronx and one in Manhattan.), are geographically limited in their reach.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Planned Parenthood offers [free condom programs](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-tennessee-and-north-mississippi/newsroom/planned-parenthood-participating-city-wide-free-condom-program) that support the human right to [sexual and reproductive health](https://sexualrightsinitiative.com/sexual-rights)(Under international human rights law, all persons have the right to control and decide freely on matters related to their sexuality; to be free from violence, coercion, or intimidation in their sexual lives; to have access to sexual and reproductive health care information, education, and services; and to be protected from discrimination based on the exercise of their sexuality.).
1.2.1.5.1. Con: Condoms are [not always effective](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/effective-condoms.html)(No type of condom prevents pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases \(STDs\) 100% of the time.).
1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: Not all people understand what the function, need, or point of a condom is.
1.2.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Over the years, [multiple awareness campaigns](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/programresources/guidance/condoms/index.html)(Individual and group-level interventions help do this by directly addressing individual’s knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors related to condom use, while community-level interventions give a strong emphasis to changing social norms.) have promoted the functions and correct usage of condoms.
1.2.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Studies have found that incorrect condom use is a worldwide problem \([p. 81](https://www.publish.csiro.au/sh/pdf/SH11095)(Condom use errors and problems are common worldwide, occurring across a wide spectrum of populations.)\).
1.2.1.5.1.2. Con: Even though condoms are not perfectly effective every single time, they are [98% effective](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms)(If you use condoms perfectly every single time you have sex, they’re 98% effective at preventing pregnancy.).
1.2.1.5.1.3. Pro: Studies have found that condoms tend to diminish the pleasure of sex for both men and women, making people less likely to use them \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2410083/pdf/nihms47515.pdf)(Both women and men rated unprotected vaginal intercourse as more pleasurable than protected vaginal intercourse.)\).
1.2.1.5.2. Con: The human right to have safe sex is already protected by the [availability of free condoms](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-do-i-get-condoms)(Affordable or free condoms are often available at Planned Parenthood health centers, family planning clinics, your local health department, community centers, college health centers, or your doctor’s office.) at family planning clinics, local health departments, community centers, college health centers, and doctors' offices.
1.2.1.5.3. Pro: Safe sex has been recognized as a human right by the UN Office for Human Rights \([p. 18](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Publications/NHRIHandbook.pdf)(Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capacity to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are: the rights of men and women to be informed, have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning including methods for regulation of fertility, which are not against the law; and the right of access to appropriate health care services to enable women to have a safe pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. Reproductive health is a component of reproductive rights)\).
1.2.1.5.4. Pro: Free condom programs support the human right of people who cannot afford condoms to have safe sex.
1.2.1.5.4.1. Con: Condoms are [cheap](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-do-i-get-condoms)(Condoms are sold in lots of different stores, and you can even get them for free from many health centers. Boxes of 3 cost about $2 to $6. Condoms usually cost less than $1 each if you buy packs of 12 or more.) and widely available.

1.2.1.5.4.2. Pro: People in the US who live below the [poverty line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-poverty-line.asp)(The federal poverty level \(FPL\), also known as the poverty threshold or guidelines, in the U.S. is an annual income level based on the number of members in the household.

1.2.1.6. Con: Just because a service benefits a minority of the population, it should not be continued at the expense of the majority.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: Since, as of 2019, low-income individuals in the US only make up [10.5% of the population](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html)(The official poverty rate in 2019 was 10.5 percent, down 1.3 percentage points from 11.8 percent in 2018.), Planned Parenthood only benefits a minority.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: Health care costs in the US are [regressive](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/525788)(Households in the bottom fifth of income groups pay an average of 33.9% of their income toward health care, while families in the highest income group pay 16% of their income toward health care.\n\nThe analysis finds that households in the middle three income tiers pay between 19.8% and 23.2% of their income toward health care. The analysis considered all payments made by households to support health care, including taxes and employer contributions.). Households with incomes in the bottom 20% are paying the highest portion \(33.9%\) of their income for health care.
1.2.1.6.2. Con: Most individuals are happy to contribute to health services and research to support others, even when they are not directly affected.
1.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: Although [only 11.3% of people age 65 and older](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures)(One in nine people age 65 and older \(11.3%\) has Alzheimer's dementia.) suffer from Alzheimer's disease, 83% of polled US registered voters support increasing funding for Alzheimer's research and treatment \([p. 3](https://www.alz.org/media/documents/national-tracking-poll-alz-media.pdf)(Strongly support 1096 55%\nSomewhat support 565 28%)\).
1.2.1.7. Pro: Planned Parenthood's services are provided on a [sliding fee scale](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-southern-new-england/patient-resources/pricing-insurance), allowing people [without insurance](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-274.html) to obtain medical services. This could reduce people's healthcare burden.
1.2.1.7.1. Pro: In 2014, 20 million women required access to [publicly funded](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a19995608/defunding-planned-parenthood/)(in 2014, 20 million women needed access to publicly funded contraceptive services because they were poor or low-income \(77 percent\) or younger than 20 \(23 percent\)) contraception—such as that provided by Planned Parenthood—due to poverty, low income, or being under 20 years old.
1.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood estimates that 216,000 abortions are averted each year as a result of their contraceptive services \([p. 1](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/9313/9611/7194/Planned_Parenthood_By_The_Numbers.pdf)\).
1.2.1.7.1.2. Con: The public should not be forced to pay for contraception for low income individuals.
1.2.1.7.1.2.1. Con: The cost of contraception is substantially lower than the cost of maternal care, pre- and post-natal care, or abortion. Funding contraception is financially efficient.
1.2.1.7.1.3. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides contraception services to nearly [one-third](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/publicly-supported-FP-services-US)(Nearly one-third \(32%\) of women who obtained contraceptive care from safety-net clinics in 2015 received services from Planned Parenthood sites, 30% from federally qualified health centers, 20% from health departments, 10% from hospital outpatient facilities and 8% from other independent clinics.) of all those seeking care from safety-net providers.
1.2.1.7.2. Pro: A sliding fee scale allows women without stable income or family support access to safe abortions.
1.2.1.7.3. Con: In November of 2019, the sliding fee scale changed in some Planned Parenthood centers, such as those in [Michigan](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-michigan/healthcare/fees).
1.2.1.7.4. Con: The high number of uninsured people and reliance on charitable services for common procedures, such as the detection and treatment of cancer, indicate the need to address the [failure](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/423865-us-health-care-is-an-ongoing-miserable-failure) of the US healthcare system, rather than a reason to support the continued funding of Planned Parenthood.
1.2.1.7.4.1.

1.2.1.7.4.2. Pro: America's healthcare system faces a number of [critical problems](https://www.medifind.com/news/post/problems-us-healthcare-system) more pressing than the continued existence of Planned Parenthood.
1.2.1.7.4.3. Con: The continued funding of Planned Parenthood would maintain reproductive healthcare for low-income individuals during the implementation of the complex changes required to overhaul and improve the US healthcare system.
1.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides women with vital tools that afford them more control over healthcare decisions that affect their lives.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides women with increased reproductive and sexual health care, [education](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/campaigns)(On campuses and online, in schools and community settings, in health centers, and in the media, Planned Parenthood is a visible and reliable source of expert reproductive and sexual health care, education, and information.), and awareness.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: There are numerous other methods for providing these services, which could be expanded if Planned Parenthood were defunded \([p. 100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562751/pdf/phr128s10096.pdf)(Despite the obvious challenges of better training and educating health-care providers and patients about sexual health, the contributions of such efforts to improving sexual health nationally could be quite important. Across various levels of society—from individuals and their relationships to school, community,\nand clinical settings—normalized discussions of sexual health could help all types of providers and patients become more informed and thoughtful about sexual health. \n... \nIf providers throughout the U.S. could better address sexual health issues, they could increase the availability of preventive health services and treatment to avoid poor sexual health outcomes. Likewise, greater patient interest in open dialogue with their providers about sexual health could enhance patients’ seeking of needed services and their satisfaction with care.)\).
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Other [organisations](https://womendeliver.org/lets-talk-sex-education/)(Women Deliver is a leading advocate of Comprehensive Sexuality Education. We know that when girls and women have the ability to choose if, when, and how many children they have, they take control of their lives and pursue a brighter future for themselves, their families, and their communities. \n...\nTo support CSE advocates, including young people, the United Nations recently released updated international technical guidance on sexuality education. These guidelines offer a more progressive approach to CSE with a greater focus on gender, power dynamics, avoiding early pregnancy, and rights. \n...\nThe movement to increase access to CSE programs is growing but there are many places where sexuality education remains forbidden and taboo.

1.2.2.1.2. Con: By failing to provide abstinence-based education, Planned Parenthood does a disservice to women since abstinence is the only 100% safe and effective way to avoid pregnancy and STIs \([p. 374](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240060/pdf/lnq-81-372.pdf)(Recently, abstinence education has been criticized for not providing critical health information about condom use. Abstinence education curricula, however, do not discourage the use of condoms; rather they note that chastity obviates the need for condoms. Abstinence education programs do not claim that condoms have no place in preventing STIs. Comprehensive programs, on the other hand, are misleading in the emphasis they place on condom use. These programs give teens the impression that condoms make sexual activity safe. In reality, there has been much conflicting medical literature on the effectiveness of condoms in preventing STIs since the 2000 NIH report on the subject and much of the controversy remains unresolved. Teens must be informed that condoms do not offer complete protection from either pregnancy or STIs.)\).
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The higher teen pregnancy rates observed in places where abstinence-based sex education is emphasized suggest that it is ineffective \([p. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/pdf/pone.0024658.pdf)(After accounting for other factors, the national data show that the incidence of teenage pregnancies and births remain positively correlated with the degree of abstinence education across states: The more strongly abstinence is emphasized in state laws and policies, the higher the average teenage pregnancy and birth rate.)\).
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Planned Parenthood has helped women combat [sexually transmitted infections](https://theconversation.com/how-planned-parenthood-has-helped-millions-of-women-including-me-71672)(In fact, even today the largest percentage \(41 percent\) of Planned Parenthood’s budget is spent on testing and treating STIs, followed by contraceptive services \(31 percent\) for both women and men.) \(STIs\).
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.2.2.1.3.2.

Programs should provide students with accurate information about the prevention, transmission, symptoms and treatment of STIs. They should also equip students with skills to foster healthy relationships and express their sexual autonomy in a healthy way, such as by understanding consent and being able to advocate for condom use. The sexual health information provided should be age appropriate as well as responsive to and respectful of a range of cultural backgrounds, sexual orientations and gender identities.)\).
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides women with access to contraception.
1.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: 56% of female small business owners agreed that having access to contraception was empowering, as it allowed them to advance their [businesses and careers](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-would-happen-if-planned-parenthood-was-defunded-6-frightening-options-2950007)(Having control over their own reproductive lives allows women to start a family when it's right for them and their career.

Con: The referenced study was limited to [9,256 women and adolescents](https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/access-to-free-birth-control-reduces-abortion-rates/)(This study, called the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, enrolled 9,256 women and adolescents in the St. Louis area between 2007 and 2011.) in the St. Louis area between 2007 and 2011; these results should not be generalized.
1.2.2.1.4.3.2. Con: Since Planned Parenthood is often the only avenue by which individuals can access affordable [birth control](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-do-i-get-birth-control-pills), especially in many [underserved areas](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/access-to-care-at-planned-parenthood-health-centers-at-risk-in-nearly-half-the-country), defunding it will reduce access further.
1.2.2.2. Con: Women should not have to depend on Planned Parenthood to be in control of decisions that affect their lives.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Independent social efforts to [empower women](https://www.unfpa.org/resources/issue-7-women-empowerment)(The empowerment and autonomy of women and the improvement of their political, social, economic and health status is a highly important end in itself. In addition, it is essential for the achievement of sustainable development. The full participation and partnership of both women and men is required in productive and reproductive life, including shared responsibilities for the care and nurturing of children and maintenance of the household.) should be initiated so women do not have to depend on organizations such as Planned Parenthood.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Although women should not need to depend on Planned Parenthood for reproductive health services, many women currently do. Defunding Planned Parenthood will deprive women of vital services.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Planned Parenthood has been proactive in its fight against strict anti-abortion laws that harm women's empowerment.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: This is not evidence of individual empowerment; it is simply Planned Parenthood protecting its own [interests](https://abort73.com/abortion/abortion_for_profit/)(What this means to the abortion debate is that the people and organizations who defend the morality of abortion the most vehemently are generally the very same ones who rake in huge profits from its continued availability. This sets up a significant conflict of interest and should immediately call into question any claims they might make about their desire to reduce the number of abortions. When Planned Parenthood argues that they're working hard to reduce the frequency of abortion, the fact remains that their financial livelihood is built on abortion. Planned Parenthood, then, is just like the big tobacco companies. Does anyone really believe that tobacco companies want people to stop smoking?).
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood [profits](https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/planned-parenthood-sets-new-record-abortions-single-year)(The increases came from fees for services, not donations. Planned Parenthood’s reported private contributions fell to $591.3 million in 2019 from $630 million in 2018. Likewise, the number of unique individual contributors fell from 1.5 million in 2018 to 1.1 million in 2019. \n...\nOnce again, Planned Parenthood’s annual report reveals that the organization will continue prioritizing abortion as other services decline—it is its most profitable line of business.) from the fees they charge for abortion services.
1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood charges patients up to [$1,500](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/ask-experts/if-i-want-to-get-an-abortion-do-i-have-to-have-my-mom-or-dad-present-to-get-one-and-are-they-free-if-not-how-much-do-they-cost)(The cost of an abortion depends on what kind of abortion you have, how long you’ve been pregnant, where you go for your abortion, and what your financial situation is. An in-clinic abortion costs up to $750 in the first trimester, and up to $1,500 later in pregnancy. In general, an abortion costs more the longer you have been pregnant. And hospitals generally cost more than health centers.) per abortion.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: Planned Parenthood consistently fights against laws that [disempower women](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/abortion-bans-womens-health/)(“When women don’t control their own reproduction, they don’t control their own health, their economic prospects, or their ability to reach their full potential,” she wrote. That disempowerment “exacerbates health disparities and perpetuates inequality. And the consequences for public health will be far-reaching and detrimental to us all—unless we stand up, together, and stop this madness.”) and promote inequality; even if their motivation for doing so is selfish, the result is still the empowerment of individuals.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Abortion is antithetical to [women's empowerment](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/01/18/why_abortion_is_antithetical_to_womens_empowerment_142182.html)(The first feminist suffragists proposed an equal rights amendment, but would disavow today’s ERA because they saw abortion as trampling on the rights of the unborn and degrading to women. These celebrated first-wave feminists from Mary Wollstonecraft to Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton recognized that abortion was, in the words of their movement’s leader, Alice Paul, “the ultimate exploitation of women.” \n...\nThe vision of women’s equality promoted by Roe v. Wade, Michelle Williams, and today’s ERA is far too narrow. It assumes women need to be more like men. But women bear children, and that gift is not a deficiency; humanity’s very existence depends on our life-giving capacity. Women ought to be valued as they are, and Mom Power embraced. In a culture of true equality and authentic female flourishing, women would not be told to choose between their children and their success.).
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: The pro-life position [empowers women](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/11/spopinion-abortion-does-not-empower-women)(Hawkins said that between the two movements, the pro-life movement is actually about empowering women. This is because while abortion teaches women they can’t be successful without ridding themselves of a living being, the pro-life movement teaches women they don’t have to choose between raising a child and fulfilling their goals in life.\n\n“Abortion tells women, ‘No, you can't, you're not strong enough to finish your college degree and become a mother. You have to choose, pick one or the other.’ It's the very opposite of empowerment,” Hawkins said.\n\nI don’t plan on having children for many years. However, were I to become pregnant, why should I have to choose between having a child and finishing my degree? \n\nI can and should be able to do both — in fact, students can under ASU’s Title IX rule, which promises not to discriminate against students on the basis of pregnancy and offers accommodations for those students in their classes.) because it supports the belief that women should not have to choose between motherhood and their other goals.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: Access to abortion empowers women by improving women's health and reducing maternal mortality \([p. 49](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09682869308520011)(Unsafe abortion kills and contributes to 40% of maternal mortality worldwide or an estimated 200,000 deaths/year. More than 50% of abortions are performed by unskilled persons. Legal abortion is 11 times safer than childbirth in the USA. \n...\nWomen are frequently denied autonomy to prevent pregnancy. When contraception is denied, the only possible option for women to take control of their lives and destiny is abortion. \n...\nThe abortion issue should be viewed as an issue of human rights and women's empowerment, and unsafe abortion must be addressed as part of health policy.)\).
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: The US is [still recovering](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-readies-sweeping-rollback-trump-era-abortion-crackdown-n1254552)("We have a ton of work to do to undo the harm over the last four years, but knowing we have champions there who understand what needs to happen in the first 100 days is tremendously exciting," said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood.) from the Trump administration's [anti-woman agenda](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/04/25/430969/100-days-100-ways-trump-administration-harming-women-families/), against which Planned Parenthood was vocally [critical](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-condemns-u-s-anti-womens-agenda-laid-out-at-commission-on-the-status-of-women).
1.2.2.3.3.1. Con: The Trump administration was [not anti-woman](https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/05/21/donald-trump-women-vote/84674194/)(Because among the 51 percent of women supposedly being assaulted by His Mighty Orangeness, a large proportion are thinking creatures who do not feel singled out for his obnoxious attention. We’ve seen what he’s done to Jeb, Marco, Chris \(before he loved him,\) John, Lindsey and most especially, poor “Lyin’ Ted.”\n\nWomen aren’t special. We have eyes and ears. We really don’t think Trump is on a crusade against the ladies.\n...\nMostly, it’s about the lazy thinking that goes into the “war on women” shtick, the fraudulent and awkward attempt to enlist people of vastly divergent philosophies, principles and experiences into one happy sorority of solidarity.); many women supported its policies.
1.2.2.3.3.2. Pro: The Trump administration's anti-woman agenda threatened to [deny women access to vital health services](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2017/07/06/435427/exportation-trumps-anti-woman-agenda/)(The Trump administration’s anti-woman agenda seeks to deny women access to vital health services and stifle their economic security. That agenda—no longer aimed solely at women in the United States—is now transcending borders. Whether it’s the elimination of funding for vital women’s health programs, expansion of the Global Gag Rule, or failure to appoint an ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, President Donald Trump has made it clear that women’s health and livelihoods are not even being considered as this administration develops its policy priorities.).
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood joined hands with the American Civil Liberties Union to [file a lawsuit](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/planned-parenthood-aclu-sue-block-arkansas-ban-most-abortions-2021-05-26/) challenging Arkansas' ban on all abortions except for medical emergencies.
1.2.2.3.5. Pro: Planned Parenthood Texas has [condemned](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/998237349/the-governor-of-texas-has-signed-a-law-that-bans-abortion-as-early-as-6-weeks)(Planned Parenthood Texas Votes and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund released a statement condemning the law as "dangerous" and among the "harshest abortion bans in the country.") the state's law prohibiting abortion as early as six weeks into the pregnancy.
1.2.2.3.6. Con: Since Planned Parenthood is [not involved in legislation](https://www.usa.gov/how-laws-are-made), it is unlikely that these fights will be able to bear much fruit.
1.2.2.3.6.1. Pro: Overturning Roe v. Wade has long been a [primary goal](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/politics/roe-v-wade-supreme-court/index.html)(Overturning Roe would be the culmination of a decades-long project of the conservative legal moment.\n...\nCelebrated by supporters of abortion right and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability, which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. A majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion, which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”) of American conservatives.
1.2.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: According to a [leaked draft](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)(The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, according to an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito circulated inside the court and obtained by POLITICO.\n...\nThe court’s holding will not be final until it is published, likely in the next two months.\n\nThe immediate impact of the ruling as drafted in February would be to end a half-century guarantee of federal constitutional protection of abortion rights and allow each state to decide whether to restrict or ban abortion. It’s unclear if there have been subsequent changes to the draft.\n...\nThe overturning of Roe would almost immediately lead to stricter limits on abortion access in large swaths of the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately impose broad abortion bans. Any state could still legally allow the procedure.) in May 2022, the current Republican-influenced US Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.
1.2.2.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: Six of the nine current US Supreme Court justices were [appointed by Republicans](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)(A person familiar with the court’s deliberations said that four of the other Republican-appointed justices – Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – had voted with Alito in the conference held among the justices after hearing oral arguments in December, and that line-up remains unchanged as of this week.\n\nThe three Democratic-appointed justices – Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan – are working on one or more dissents, according to the person. How Chief Justice John Roberts will ultimately vote, and whether he will join an already written opinion or draft his own, is unclear.); the five justices who have expressed support for overturning Roe v. Wade were Republican-appointed.
1.2.2.3.6.1.1.2. Con: The information about the decision comes from a [leaked draft](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/02/us/roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court#roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court)(The release of the 98-page document is unprecedented in the court’s modern history: Early drafts of opinions have virtually never leaked before the final decision is announced, and never in such a consequential case. And early drafts of opinions often change by the time the decision from the court is announced.). The release of a Supreme Court draft prior to a formal decision is highly unusual, and early drafts of decisions often change prior to the court's final decision.
1.2.2.3.6.1.2. Con: Only 30% of polled Americans support overturning Roe v. Wade, while [69% are opposed](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/politics/roe-v-wade-supreme-court/index.html)(According to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in January, most Americans oppose overturning Roe, with a majority saying that if the decision was vacated, they’d want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws.\n\nJust 30% of Americans say they’d like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe vs. Wade decision, with 69% opposed – a finding that’s largely consistent both with other recent polling and with historical trends.) to doing so.
1.2.2.3.6.1.3. Pro: Republicans in the US have often [attempted to pass laws](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/states-with-early-abortion-bans-a-comprehensive-list.html)(The first six months of the 2019 saw relentless attacks on abortion rights at the state level. Five states passed bills banning the procedure after six weeks, before many women even realize they’re pregnant. And in May, Alabama signed into law a near-full ban on the procedure. The same month, Missouri — a state with only one abortion clinic — passed an extreme eight-week ban that didn’t include any exceptions for instances of rape, incest, or human trafficking. In all, seven states passed similarly stringent laws in 2019, and more are currently considering them.) aimed at undermining the legitimacy of Roe v. Wade.
1.2.2.3.6.1.3.1. Con: Through the use of their [action fund and political action committee](https://ballotpedia.org/Planned_Parenthood_Action_Fund), Planned Parenthood has worked tirelessly to counteract and neutralise such legislation.
1.2.2.3.6.1.3.2. Pro: Since 2010, US states have enacted [over 288 restrictions on abortion](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2016/01/last-five-years-account-more-one-quarter-all-abortion-restrictions-enacted-roe#)(In the 43 years since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down Roe v. Wade, states have enacted 1,074 abortion restrictions. Of these, 288 \(27%\) have been enacted just since 2010. This gives the last five years the dubious distinction of accounting for more abortion restrictions than any other single five-year period since Roe.) that have undermined the standard set by Roe v. Wade.
1.2.2.3.6.2. Con: As a highly-visible organisation, Planned Parenthood's press releases and position statements help to inform the public about reproductive rights issues.
1.2.2.4. Con: Women can gain [healthcare insurance](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2017/aug/how-affordable-care-act-has-helped-women-gain-insurance-and)(Women ages 19 to 64 who shopped for new coverage on their own found it significantly easier to find affordable plans in 2016 compared to 2010. The percentage of women who reported delaying or skipping needed care because of costs fell to an all-time low.) to be in greater control of their healthcare decisions.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Despite most private insurance plans being willing to provide coverage for abortion \([p. 1](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4114/0027/5781/myth_vs._fact_sheet.pdf)(First, the majority of private insurance plans today cover abortion\ncare.)\), many states have restrictions that [limit private insurance coverage](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/regulating-insurance-coverage-abortion) for abortion.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: The Affordable Care Act \(ACA\) has greatly [expanded women's access](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/womens-health-care-utilization-and-costs-findings-from-the-2020-kff-womens-health-survey/)(For many women, the ACA helped strengthen access to coverage and protected them from many out-of-pocket costs.) to high-quality health insurance.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: Under the ACA, most health insurance plans are now [required to cover birth control](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/health-care-equity/affordable-care-act-aca)(One of the most immediate changes for reproductive health was the ACA’s birth control benefit, which ensured that nearly 63 million women now have birth control without a copay, and helped women save an estimated $1.4 billion on the pill in the ACA’s first year alone.).
1.2.2.4.2.2. Con: Planned Parenthood is [unrivaled in providing access](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M17-0217)(Planned Parenthood addresses the access issue. It is unparalleled in its ability to meet the preventive, contraceptive, and primary care needs of women who rely on Medicaid and other safety net programs. In fact, other safety net health centers that cannot offer the same level of contraceptive care often refer women to Planned Parenthood clinics. Although its centers accounted for only 10% of publicly funded clinics in 2010 \(the last year with available data\), Planned Parenthood provided contraceptive care to 36% of publicly funded contraceptive clients that year. As a result, contraceptive services provided by Planned Parenthood prevent approximately 579 000 unintended pregnancies annually.) to the expanded women's health services offered by the ACA. Defunding them would nullify such gains.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: There are multiple ways to obtain healthcare coverage, and the number of uninsured women has been [falling](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2017/aug/how-affordable-care-act-has-helped-women-gain-insurance-and)(By 2016, the number of working-age women \(ages 19–64\) lacking health insurance had fallen by almost half since 2010, from 19 million to 11 million, or from 20 percent to 11 percent of this population. Women with low incomes have made particularly large gains: uninsured rates for those with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level \($23,760 for an individual or $48,600 for a family of four\), fell from 34 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2016. The findings are similar for low-income women of all races and ethnicities.).
1.2.2.4.4. Con: Because of [gender bias in healthcare](https://open.lib.umn.edu/socialproblems/chapter/13-4-problems-of-health-care-in-the-united-states/)(Gender bias also appears to affect the quality of health care \(Read & Gorman, 2010\). Research that examines either actual cases or hypothetical cases posed to physicians finds that women are less likely than men with similar health problems to be recommended for various procedures, medications, and diagnostic tests), even if women gain insurance, it is unlikely that they will be in greater control of their healthcare decisions.
1.2.3. Con: Women can more easily be coerced into aborting unplanned pregnancies because of Planned Parenthood.
1.2.3.1. Con: Women are overwhelmingly more likely to experience [reproductive coercion](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/432908-anti-choice-movement-is-like-reproductive-coercion-but-on-a-broader-scale)(A recent review of nine studies found that up to 30 percent of women in the United States experience reproductive coercion. Women around the world are also at serious risk of reproductive coercion. Reproductive coercion is the control of a person’s reproductive choices by another person, most often an intimate partner.\n\nThe most widely known type of reproductive coercion is a partner forcing or preventing someone from getting an abortion, but it can be much subtler and varied. Some partners may try to force a woman to get pregnant or not use a certain type of birth control. This type of behavior can include: hiding or stealing birth control pills, preventing women from obtaining hormonal contraceptives, sabotaging condoms or even removing condoms during sex.\n\nThe anti-choice movement seeks to facilitate reproductive coercion on a broad and massive scale. Laws that make it more difficult to access birth control and abortion services constrain women’s reproductive choices.) from an intimate partner; defunding Planned Parenthood will facilitate widespread reproductive coercion.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood can ensure that women who are considering abortions are sufficiently informed on reproductive coercion and know where to seek guidance and support \([p. 4](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/fb/70/fb70f966-e4a2-46e8-900c-9137fed3e636/ipv_and_reproductive_coercion_fact_sheet_2012_final.pdf)(Intimate partner violence and reproductive health are closely connected issues and one cannot be properly addressed without addressing the other. With IPV affecting rates of unplanned pregnancies, repeat abortions, second-trimester abortions, STIs, and inconsistent condom use, IPV itself is a reproductive health problem. Planned Parenthood is committed to reducing rates of intimate partner violence and reproductive coercion through education, training, screening, and advocacy.)\).
1.2.3.2. Pro: In one study, 55% of women who responded said they felt [forced to have an abortion](http://www.theunchoice.com/articles/howcommoniscoercion.htm).
1.2.3.2.1. Con: The survey referenced above is referring to the percentage of women who felt [pressure to abort from any source](https://afterabortion.org/a-survey-of-aborted-women/)(Of women who report post-abortion problems, 53% felt ‘forced’ to abort by one or more other people, and 39% report feeling very much ‘forced’ to abort by others.), including family or partner, and not to coercion from Planned Parenthood.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Some women have claimed that Planned Parenthood had not given them enough information to make an [informed choice](https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2012/08/30/health-experts-challenge-coerced-abortion-laws/)(In the months and years that followed, Brittany would say in federal court that her boyfriend had forced her to have an abortion she didn’t want. She blamed Planned Parenthood for letting it happen. \n...\nIn her testimony–given during a deposition under oath and later in a handwritten declaration–Brittany asserted that Planned Parenthood had not given her enough information to help her make an informed decision. She also said that after her abortion, she had an emotional breakdown and started drinking heavily; she indicated that she had already been taking medicine to treat depression before the abortion.) when pressured into abortion by partners and family.
1.2.3.4. Con: Women will choose to have, or be coerced into, [abortions](https://sports.yahoo.com/majority-women-want-home-abortions-124000612.html)(“One argument I hear time and again is that changing abortion laws makes it ‘easier’ to get an abortion and will lead to more women choosing to have one. Indeed, some may believe that keeping abortion difficult to access, more unpleasant to undergo and more dangerous, will persuade women to continue their unwanted pregnancy. \n\n“You just have to look around the world to recognise this claim is invalid. Everyday scores of desperate pregnant women put themselves in extreme danger by undergoing illegal and unsafe abortion. Reducing access to abortion doesn’t make it any less common, but it does make it less safe.”) regardless of whether there is publicly funded access to them.
1.2.4. Con: The choices made available by Planned Parenthood, such as [abortion](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38775641), can cause women [psychological trauma](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/11/spopinion-abortion-does-not-empower-women).
1.2.4.1. Con: A 2016 study concluded that being denied an abortion is [more psychologically traumatising](https://www.yahoo.com/news/being-denied-abortion-more-harmful-to-womens-mental-health-than-having-one-study-171914070.html)(Sherwood’s emotional response to her abortion decision falls in line with a new study from the University of California at San Francisco, which found that women who underwent an abortion were at less risk of adverse mental health effects \(such as depression, anxiety, and dissatisfaction of life\) than those who were denied an abortion because their pregnancy was further along than the facility’s gestational limit.) than having one.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Despite experiencing initial regret, many women feel that seeking abortion was the right decision \([p. 122](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Corinne-Rocca/publication/256488797_Women's_Emotions_One_Week_After_Receiving_or_Being_Denied_an_Abortion_in_the_United_States/links/5da880c14585159bc3d5a15b/Womens-Emotions-One-Week-After-Receiving-or-Being-Denied-an-Abortion-in-the-United-States.pdf)(Experiencing negative emotions postabortion is different from believing that abortion was not the right decision.)\), and evidence shows that negative feelings around abortion [decline over time](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/01/416421/five-years-after-abortion-nearly-all-women-say-it-was-right-decision-study)(But the researchers at UCSF’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health \(ANSIRH\) found no evidence that women began to regret their decisions as years passed. On the contrary, the women reported that both their positive and negative feelings about the abortion diminished over time. At five years, the overwhelming majority \(84 percent\) had either positive feelings, or none at all.).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Many men have also reported [negative psychological effects](https://www.usccb.org/committees/pro-life-activities/hollow-men-male-grief-trauma-following-abortion)(Psychological injury in men following abortion is likely underestimated due to men’s propensity to avoid self-disclosure. Preliminary findings in a new study found four out of ten men experienced chronic post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) symptoms, occurring on average 15 years after the abortion. Other disconcerting findings included: 88% feeling grief and sadness, 82% guilt, 77% anger, 64% anxiety, 68% isolation, 31% helplessness, 40% sexual problems. Certain factors predict whether men are more likely to experience abortion as traumatic: where the pregnancy was desired by them or their partner, where someone else pressured their partner into abortion, where the abortion occurred against his wishes or he didn’t know about it until afterwards \(Rue, Coyle, & Coleman, 2007\).) after their partner has an abortion.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Men can suffer a range of negative emotions in response to an abortion, which they often neglect and repress \([p. 12](https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/3683)(Several commonalities are apparent in the findings of the studies reviewed here. Many report that men desire some form of counseling concerning abortion and that the men themselves do not perceive abortion as a benign experience. At the least, these men struggle with ambivalence both before and after abortion. While abortion seems to bring a sense of relief, other emotions including anxiety, grief, guilt, and powerlessness are also reported consequent to abortion.\nSeveral authors have noted a tendency among men to defer the abortion decision to their female partners as well as a tendency to repress their own emotions in an attempt to support their partners.)\).
1.2.4.3. Pro: The experiences surrounding abortion can both trigger and exacerbate mental health issues in women \([p. 29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6207970/pdf/10.1177_2050312118807624.pdf)(Common ground exists regarding the very basic fact that at least some women do have significant mental health issues that are caused, triggered, aggravated, or complicated by their abortion experience. In many cases, this may be due to feeling pressured into an abortion or choosing an abortion without sufficient attention to maternal desires or moral beliefs that may make it difficult to reconcile one’s choice with one’s self-identity.)\).
1.2.4.3.1. Con: There is a wealth of evidence that suggests - to the contrary - that abortion does [not increase](https://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion)(Research has shown that having an abortion does not increase a woman's risk for depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder. A review of the scientific literature conducted by an APA task force and released in 2008 indicated that the relative risk of mental health problems following a single elective first-trimester abortion of is no greater risk to mental health than carrying an that pregnancy to term.) mental health risks in women.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Mental health issues are common in the [post-abortion period](https://theawarenesscentre.com/what-to-do-if-you-are-struggling-post-abortion/)(It is quite common to have unexpected reactions and emotions after an abortion. These can occur within hours or surface weeks or months later, and can include sadness, depression, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, low self-esteem, emotional numbing and re-living the pregnancy, the decision, the abortion in recurring thoughts, dreams or flashbacks.\n\nIn the first few days, your hormones are changing back to their pre-pregnancy state. This chemical change can cause feelings of sadness and weepiness, but if you are unable to work through these and the other very natural reactions you might be experiencing, it can lead to post-abortion syndrome, which is a form of complicated grief or post-traumatic stress.).
1.2.4.4. Con: Abortion will [prevail](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/10/what-life-when-abortion-banned)(Research from around the world has shown that banning abortion doesn’t stop it from happening — it just drives it underground.) regardless. Planned Parenthood decreases the likelihood of women choosing [dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-induced_abortion), at-home abortion methods, or risking serious complications from an unwanted [live birth](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abortion-idUSTRE80M2BS20120123)(Getting a legal abortion is much safer than giving birth, suggests a new U.S. study published Monday.\n\nResearchers found that women were about 14 times more likely to die during or after giving birth to a live baby than to die from complications of an abortion.\n\n\n...between 1998 and 2005, one woman died during childbirth for every 11,000 or so babies born.\n\nThat compared to one woman of every 167,000 who died from a legal abortion.), both of which can be far more damaging than the psychological effects of abortion.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: In some areas, women perform medical abortions by obtaining illegal [misoprostol](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/how-many-women-die-illegal-abortions/572638/). However, without medical knowledge of the correct dosage and care, this can lead to severe complications \([p. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782417305310/pdfft?md5=db1bfb5d3483d9389bc8bb213708fc35&pid=1-s2.0-S0010782417305310-main.pdf)(The 19 women were aged 16–40, with an average age of 21–26 at interview and average age of 18–21 at abortion. To obtain an abortion, they sought advice from partners, friends, family members, and/or traditional practitioners and health care providers. Misoprostol was easily accessible through the formal and informal sectors, but the dosages and regimens the women used on the advice of others were extremely variable, did not match WHO guidelines and were apparently ineffective, resulting in failed abortion, incomplete abortion, heavy\nbleeding/hemorrhage, strong pain and/or infection.)\).
1.3. Pro: Planned Parenthood engages in unethical activity.
1.3.1. Con: Planned Parenthood claims that accusations of unethical behavior on their part are ideologically driven and unsupported by fact \([p. 1](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4814/4710/8959/The_Fanatical_Crusade_Against_Planned_Parenthood.pdf)(Throughout its history, Planned Parenthood and the women it serves have repeatedly come under attack from ideologues opposed to family planning, birth control, and safe and legal abortion.\n...\nWhen it releases the facts, it becomes clear the initial accusations and promised evidence are without merit.)\).
1.3.1.1. Pro: Ideologically motivated attacks upon family planning and women's health providers are common \([p. 1897](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5678404/pdf/AJPH.2017.304124.pdf)(Federal and state policymakers must work together to blunt ideological attacks that threaten to dismantle programs and providers that have for years yielded important public health benefits to women, their families, and society as a whole. This means stopping efforts to reduce access to high-quality family planning services for Medicaid enrollees, turning back efforts to slash Title X funding, and standing firm against attempts to undermine women’s access to Planned Parenthood health centers and other critical safety-net providers. Doing so would help ensure that US women have access to the basic health care they need—and deserve.)\).
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood clinics, employees and patients have faced [illegal violence, vandalism, harassment and intimidation](https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/issue/anti-abortion-violence/)(Between 1977 and 2015, anti-choice extremists directed more than 7,200 reported acts of violence at abortion providers. This included 42 bombings, 185 arson attacks, and thousands of death threats, bioterrorism threats and assaults. In addition, more than 234,300 acts of disruption were reported, including bomb threats, hate mail and harassing calls.\n...\nThis violence can hinder access to abortion services and threatens the lives of those dedicated to protecting and providing reproductive-health care. Some abortion providers are forced to take extreme steps to protect themselves, their families, their staff and their patients—such as wearing bulletproof vests to work, hiring private security, and installing bulletproof glass in their homes and offices.) at the hands of ideologically-motivated perpetrators.
1.3.1.2. Con: Planned Parenthood's denial does not prove that they are not behaving unethically.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The burden of proof of unethical or illegal activity committed by Planned Parenthood rests with those making the accusations.
1.3.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood has been accused of supporting racism and eugenics.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, has been portrayed as a [proponent of eugenics](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/247330/pro-life-advocates-planned-parenthood-cant-just-wish-away-margaret-sangers-racism-eugenics)(The document acknowledges her association with the eugenics movement, but describes the ideology as “a theory accepted by most American scientists and physicians” at the time.\n...\nSanger also endorsed the Supreme Court’s 1927 Buck v. Bell decision “which allowed states to sterilize people deemed ‘unfit’ without their consent and sometimes without their knowledge — a ruling that led to the sterilization of tens of thousands of people in the 20th century,”) and supporter of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/247330/pro-life-advocates-planned-parenthood-cant-just-wish-away-margaret-sangers-racism-eugenics)(It also acknowledges Sanger gave a speech to a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, which Sanger herself referenced in her autobiography. \n\n“In the 1920’s, the KKK was a mainstream movement and was considered a legitimate anti-immigration organization with a wide membership that included many state and local officials. At that time, it defined its enemies as Blacks, Catholics and Jews. Planned Parenthood today denounces Sanger’s address to the Ku Klux Klan,” it states.).
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Even if this were true, the personal politics of the company's founder 100 years ago do not necessarily represent the views of the organisation or its employees.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Sanger's beliefs are [woven into the mission and ideology](https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/even-removing-margaret-sangers-name-planned-parenthood-still-influenced-racist)(On the other hand, Sanger’s open racism, her promotion of eugenics and her advocacy of forced sterilizations to keep those she deemed “unfit” from “breeding” was her vision. Planned Parenthood was formed on that vision, and much of that vision still exists at Planned Parenthood today.\n\nPlanned Parenthood still considers certain people less than human and rejects the science of prenatal development by calling babies in the womb “clumps of cells,” “tissue masses,” and “products of conception.”\n...\nUntil Planned Parenthood stops dehumanizing living, growing children in the womb; until it ceases performing abortions; and until it stops locating facilities and advertising heavily in and around minority communities, it will continue carrying out Margaret Sanger’s original vision.) of Planned Parenthood; the organization inherently supports these positions.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Sanger's personal politics have been utilized by anti-abortion activists as a way to [discredit Planned Parenthood](https://time.com/5869743/planned-parenthood-margaret-sanger/)(In recent years, antiabortion activists and conservatives have often brought up Sanger’s views on eugenics to criticize Planned Parenthood and the abortion rights movement, even though Sanger did not advocate for abortion rights.), although Sanger herself did not advocate for abortion.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Sanger worked closely with NAACP founder W.E.B. DuBois to [improve African American access to birth control](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/14/432080520/fact-check-was-planned-parenthood-started-to-control-the-black-population)(Sanger's birth control movement did have support in black neighborhoods, beginning in the '20s when there were leagues in Harlem started by African-Americans. Sanger also worked closely with NAACP founder W.E.B. DuBois on a "Negro Project," which she viewed as a way to get safe contraception to African-Americans.\n\nIn 1946, Sanger wrote about the importance of giving "Negro" parents a choice in how many children they would have.) to [avoid unwanted pregnancies](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/14/432080520/fact-check-was-planned-parenthood-started-to-control-the-black-population)("That Sanger was enamored and supported some eugenicists' ideas is certainly true," said Susan Reverby, a health care historian and professor at Wellesley College. But, Reverby added, Sanger's main argument was not eugenics — it was that "Sanger thought people should have the children they wanted."\n\nIt was a radical idea for the time.\n\nSanger wrote about this mission herself in 1921: "The almost universal demand for practical education in Birth Control is one of the most hopeful signs that the masses themselves today possess the divine spark of regeneration."); this [increased the autonomy and social standing](https://iwpr.org/iwpr-issues/reproductive-health/the-economic-effects-of-contraceptive-access-a-review-of-the-evidence/)(The literature reviewed here uses historic changes in contraception policy and family planning funding to identify the causal effects of contraceptive access and generally finds improved economic outcomes. \n...\nHaving access to contraception by age 20 reduces the probability that a woman is in poverty by one percentage point to 12.2 percent. \n...\nBoth of the studies that rely on changes in federal family planning funding \(Bailey et al 2014 and Bailey et al 2018\) find that these programs reduced childhood poverty, and that these effects were up to twice as large among non-White households. \n...\nThey do find that the mechanisms by which contraception affects poverty may differ by race: they find that changes in fertility, household structure, and education fully accounted for the impacts of ELA on poverty for Black women but not for White women.) of African American women and families.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: DuBois [promoted the use of birth control](https://libex.smith.edu/omeka/items/show/491) among African Americans as essential to improving quality of life.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Although African Americans intended to make use of eugenics to improve their quality of life and social standing, they continued to be [unfairly targeted by eugenics legislation](https://nursingclio.org/2017/06/01/the-black-politics-of-eugenics/)(Although African American engagement in eugenics complicates the ways in which we understand its legacy, we also cannot forget that eugenics legislation disproportionately targeted African Americans in violent ways. For example, North Carolina’s Eugenics Commission sterilized approximately 8,000 people during the 1930s and 1940s. 5,000 were African American.\n...\nEugenics created dual realities of racial improvement and racial violence for African Americans in the twentieth century. African Americans sought to mobilize eugenics for racial improvement, but were ultimately disproportionately targeted by eugenics legislation. These dual realities produced the complex landscape of the American eugenics movement, and show that African Americans were invested in the dynamic possibilities of eugenics.) well into the 20th century.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Planned Parenthood has [publicly acknowledged](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-greater-new-york/about/news/planned-parenthood-of-greater-new-york-announces-intent-to-remove-margaret-sangers-name-from-nyc-health-center)(The removal of Margaret Sanger’s name from our building is both a necessary and overdue step to reckon with our legacy and acknowledge Planned Parenthood’s contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color,” said Karen Seltzer, Board Chair at PPGNY. “Margaret Sanger’s concerns and advocacy for reproductive health have been clearly documented, but so too has her racist legacy. There is overwhelming evidence for Sanger’s deep belief in eugenic ideology, which runs completely counter to our values at PPGNY. Removing her name is an important step toward representing who we are as an organization and who we serve.) Sanger's involvement in the eugenics movement and association with white supremacist groups.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Planned Parenthood's acknowledgement of Sanger's activities is intended as an honest appraisal of the facts, and should not be construed as support for such beliefs.
1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood's acknowledgement of this history comes after years of attempting to whitewash Sanger's unethical beliefs, and does nothing to address the organization's [continued unethical practices](https://breakpoint.org/planned-parenthoods-reckoning-with-margaret-sangers-racism-doesnt-go-far-enough/)(Acknowledging a racist history does not absolve them of the blood on their hands, as they continue to take full advantage of victims of the racism they decry. Quite frankly, how much of a racist or eugenicist Sanger was or wasn’t is of no real consequence right now as children die daily. The issue is that the profitability of abortion makes it a difficult cash cow to forgo. I urge Planned Parenthood to continue this ‘reckoning,’ not simply by calling out racism and combating white supremacy, but by using their wealth to meet the needs of mothers and their influence to halt, not perpetuate, the ultimate goal of a eugenic agenda, extermination of an undesirable’s offspring.).
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: For many years, some of Planned Parenthood's [board members](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-planned-parenthood-can-atone-for-margaret-sanger-11619044855?mod=article_inline)(In fact, Planned Parenthood’s board overlapped with that of the American Eugenics Society for decades, even after Sanger’s retirement as president in 1959. In the 1960s, her successor, Alan F. Guttmacher, was the society’s vice president while also Planned Parenthood’s president. In 1952 Sanger helped secure a leadership position in Planned Parenthood’s German affiliate for Hans Harmsen, who had served as an officer in Nazi Germany’s Hereditary Health Court, which ordered mandatory sterilizations in the name of “racial hygiene.”) also sat on the board of the American Eugenics Society.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: This implies that the two societies had common goals and ideology.
1.3.2.1.4.2. Con: Shared board members [between large organizations](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/50-largest-u-s-companies-board-members/)(Elected by the company’s shareholders, the board is meant to represent shareholder interests – it ultimately hires the CEO, sets strategic objectives, approves annual budgets, and provides accountability to the shareholders regarding the performance of the organization.\n\nThese duties are no cakewalk, and finding capable and experienced board members to help run a multi-billion dollar corporation just isn’t easy.) are exceptionally common; this may simply indicate that the people in question were more experienced leaders and provided better organizational governance and shareholder accountability.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood [contributes to systemic racism](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2021/02/systemic-racism-at-planned-parenthood)(This is troubling: Black women constitute 13 percent of the female population, but they are getting 36 percent of the abortions. Planned Parenthood argues that black and Hispanic women get more abortions because of a higher rate of unwanted pregnancies, not because of “aggressive marketing by abortion providers to minority communities.” But all of Planned Parenthood’s high-volume abortion clinics are disproportionately located in or near minority communities.) by marketing abortion services to minority women.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The [rate of abortion](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/abortions-racial-gap/380251/)(An African-American woman is almost five times likelier to have an abortion than a white woman, and a Latina more than twice as likely, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) among women of color is substantially higher than among white women.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Higher abortion rates among women of color are attributable to ethnic disparities in access to reproductive care and contraceptive use, not to marketing by Planned Parenthood \([p. 2](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/gpr110302.pdf)(These higher unintended pregnancy rates reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time. Moreover, these realities must be seen in a larger context in which significant racial and ethnic disparities persist for a wide range of health outcomes, from diabetes to heart disease to breast and cervical cancer to sexually transmitted infections \(STI\), including HIV.)\).
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: A high abortion rate has prevented African Americans from gaining increased political agency \([p. 9](https://www.congress.gov/115/meeting/house/106562/witnesses/HHRG-115-JU10-Wstate-ParkerS-20171101-SD001.pdf)(Consider this: if those ten million children had not been aborted, the voting power of the black community would now be at 16 percent nationally rather than the current 13 percent. Blacks who cry in desperation for political change must recognize that the majority of their civic leaders support policies which destroy their future constituency. It is not beyond reason to conclude that today there could be more black Senators and Representatives in the halls of Congress had it not been for the abortion platform supported by so many liberal black and white leaders. Today, as a result of an abortion, blacks have prevented themselves from gaining greater political opportunity.)\).
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Protecting and expanding the reproductive health options of women of color is an essential element of [promoting racial equity](https://www.lwv.org/blog/there-no-equality-without-reproductive-rights)(Reproductive choice is not only a dire issue concerning the rights of women and all people who may become pregnant, but one of racial and economic justice. Limits on reproductive health services disproportionately impact Black, brown, and low-income communities, therefore upholding and perpetuating income inequality and white supremacy.).
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Studies have shown that maternal health outcomes for African American women remain poor due to systemic racism and disparities in reproductive health access \([p. 2](https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/health-care/maternity/black-womens-maternal-health-issue-brief.pdf)(Black women in the United States are more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth than women in any other race group.\n...\nBlack women are more likely to experience complications throughout the course of their pregnancies than white women.\n...\nSeventy-five percent of Black women give birth at hospitals that serve predominantly Black populations.\n...\nAccess to reproductive health care, which helps women plan their families, improves health outcomes for women and children.)\).
1.3.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood is a leading provider of reproductive healthcare to African American women \([p. 1](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2214/3638/1447/WhoWeAre_AfAm.pdf)(• In 2013, 14 percent of Planned Parenthood patients were African\nAmericans — more than 370,000 people.\n• Between 2003 and 2013, the number of African-American\npatients increased by 12 percent\n...\nEvery year, Planned Parenthood affiliates provide family planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 million patients, including more than 280,000 African-American women.)\).
1.3.2.2.2.2. Con: If Planned Parenthood was truly supporting racial equality and recommending the same options to everyone regardless of ethnicity, then there would not be such a large disparity in abortion rates. This is evidence that the organization contributes to racism.
1.3.2.3. Con: This portrayal has been described as [pandering to anti-abortion extremists](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/14/432080520/fact-check-was-planned-parenthood-started-to-control-the-black-population)(It's a shame that a doctor, who should understand the barriers black women face accessing high-quality preventive and reproductive health care services, would pander so clearly to anti-abortion extremists on the right.), and has been discredited.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: The politician responsible for the accusation - [Ben Carson](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34641563)("I know that's one of those words you're not supposed to say, but I'm saying it," Mr Carson began. "During slavery, a lot of slave-owners thought they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave, anything that they chose. And what if the abolitionists had said, 'I don't believe in slavery, but you guys do whatever you want'? Where would we be?"\n...\nThe retired doctor has said President Barack Obama's healthcare reform was "the worst thing" since slavery and that the US government is acting like Nazi Germany.) - is known for using controversial metaphors when discussing his anti-abortion stance.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: Rather than pandering, Carson is drawing attention to the historical [targeting of African Americans](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/14/432080520/fact-check-was-planned-parenthood-started-to-control-the-black-population)(Carson is tapping into a more subtle sentiment — the targeting of African-Americans in health care systems. There have been documented cases of that happening, including the now-infamous Tuskegee study. Starting in the 1930s, the Tuskegee Institute enrolled black sharecroppers in experiments and allowed them to suffer from syphilis untreated, though they were told they were getting treatment.\n\nAnd, Wellesley's Reverby said, that was sometimes the case for birth control clinics historically, too. They may have been available in communities where more general health care was not, raising some ethical questions.) in the US healthcare system.
1.3.2.4. Con: Planned Parenthood has actively [collaborated with the NAACP](https://naacp.org/articles/planned-parenthood-naacp-and-congresswoman-underwood-join-more-250-women-color-calling-dc)(Today, Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America; Dr. Serina Floyd, medical director/vice president of medical affairs at Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, DC; Akosua Ali, president of the NAACP Washington, DC; and U.S. Rep.

The letter, released one week after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, highlights how D.C.'s lack of statehood creates health care disparities and denies District residents reproductive freedom.) to promote racial equity in reproductive healthcare.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Research has identified a number of [substantial racial disparities](https://www.kff.org/report-section/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-an-overview-issue-brief/)(Black and AIAN women have pregnancy-related mortality rates that are over three and two times higher, respectively, compared to the rate for White women \(40.8 and 29.7 vs. 12.7 per 100,000 live births\). This disparity persists even in California, where maternal mortality rates are lower than the national average and have been on the decline; yet, the rate is more than three times higher among Black women compared to White women. There were small differences in the rate pregnancy-related death between Asian and Pacific Islander and White women \(13.5 vs. 12.7 per 100,000\), and the rate for Hispanic women was lower compared to that of White women \(11.5 vs. 12.7 per 100,000\). These findings may mask underlying differences in subgroups of these populations. Further, other research also shows that Black and Hispanic women are at significantly higher risk for severe maternal morbidity, such as preeclampsia, which is significantly more common than maternal death.) in US reproductive health.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Defunding Planned Parenthood will result in greater racial disparity in reproductive healthcare access \([p. 3](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4314/8183/5009/20161207_Defunding_fs_d01_1.pdf)(Blocking access to care at Planned Parenthood would have a disproportionate impact on\ncommunities of color.)\).
1.3.2.4.2. Con: Some conservative African American groups have accused Planned Parenthood of [contributing to the genocide](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2016/02/22/planned-parenthood-accused-targeting-blacks/80629308/)(Invoking the specter of genocide and Nazi Germany, a group called Sisters for Life held a press conference on Monday to blast Planned Parenthood for offering abortions in Louisville, saying it is targeting African-American women.\n\n"Abortion has become black genocide in this country," said Angela Minter, president of the predominantly African-American organization that opposes abortion and offers alternative services to pregnant women.) of Black people.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: This myth is predicated on the erroneous assumption that African American women are not competent to make their own decisions regarding abortion \([pp. 86-87](https://escholarship.org/content/qt0988p9xp/qt0988p9xp.pdf)(Some anti-choice and self-proclaimed anti-racists believe that abortion is yet another tool of white supremacy being used to commit genocide against the Black race. The underlying assumption of this myth is that Blackwomen lack the critical thinking skills to avoid falling into the pitfall of “murdering their babies”.)\).
1.3.2.4.2.2. Pro: This claim was supported by 2012 presidential candidate [Herman Cain](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/herman-cain-planned-parenthood-should-be-called-planned-genocide)(“Here’s why I support de-funding Planned Parenthood, because you don’t hear a lot of people talking about this, when Margaret Sanger – check my history – started Planned Parenthood, the objective was to put these centers in primarily black communities so they could help kill black babies before they came into the world,” Cain, who is African American, was quoted as saying to CNSNews.com.\n\n“You don’t see that talked that much about,” he was also quoted as saying. “It’s not Planned Parenthood. No, it’s planned genocide. You can quote me on that.”).
1.3.3. Con: Even if individuals within Planned Parenthood have engaged in inappropriate behaviour, this should not be used to gauge the entire organization.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Evidence of leadership encouraging or making policy in violation of the law would likely be needed to claim that the entire organization is engaged in such activities.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Even if individual employees or clinics were found to be participating in illegal activities, this would not demonstrate that the entire organization is doing so.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: If one were to show a pattern of illegal activities in multiple Planned Parenthood locations, then it would be reasonable to infer that the organization itself was involved.
1.3.3.2. Con: Planned Parenthood's management has a negative reputation amongst many of its employees. This suggests there may be company-wide problems.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Job dissatisfaction amongst [healthcare workers](https://journals.lww.com/em-news/Fulltext/2006/03000/Health_Care_Workers_Report_Job_Dissatisfaction_in.53.aspx)(One in four health care workers plans to change jobs in 2006, according to a survey by CareerBuilder.com.

1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood pays its employees [less](https://www.zippia.com/planned-parenthood-careers-35049/#)(The average employee at Planned Parenthood makes $36,549 per year. Pay at Planned Parenthood is significantly lower than some of its highest paying competitors, like SIH, Pathfinder International, and Population Council, which pay $79,775, $65,265, and $59,931, respectively.) than other, similar organizations.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Defunding Planned Parenthood will not improve these salaries.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Some Planned Parenthood branches' high turnover rates have been attributed to a "[toxic](https://www.kcur.org/news/2020-07-09/planned-parenthood-great-plains-cuts-staff-amid-complaints-of-chaos-and-toxicity)(The workforce reductions come in the wake of a sharp drop in patient demand caused by the pandemic, which led to canceled appointments from March through June, and a corresponding drop in revenues and fundraising.\n\nThe reductions also come atop significant employee turnover in the past year, with many current and former workers describing a toxic work culture that has added to the stress of working for an organization that finds itself under unremitting attack by abortion opponents.)" work environment.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Reports of toxic work culture at a single office are not necessarily representative of an entire organization.
1.3.3.2.4.

1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Only 42% of Planned Parenthood employees [recommend](https://www.comparably.com/companies/planned-parenthood/employees) working at the company.
1.3.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Despite Cisco having been listed by Fortune as the [best company to work for in 2021](https://fortune.com/company/cisco-systems/best-companies/)(The company that makes much of the gear powering the Internet tops this year’s list after dealing with the pandemic better than most. When the world started shutting down, Cisco delayed already announced layoffs and extended pay and benefits for affected workers. Cisco also continued to pay hourly employees even when office shutdowns kept them from coming to work. Placing a focus on employee well-being, Cisco ramped up communications, expanded benefits and access to mental health services, and provided multiple “Days for Me” for employees to step back and recharge. Long known for its community engagement, Cisco created a website to help remote students and donated unused videoconferencing gear to bolster telemedicine offerings at local medical facilities. “The attention that the executive team pays to the health and welfare of the surrounding community is extraordinary,” one employee notes.), the same site claims only [a low percentage of its employees](https://www.comparably.com/companies/cisco) would recommend working at the company.
1.3.3.2.4.2. Con: Planned Parenthood offers [professional development and training](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-north-central-states/education/training), which helps its employees develop the skills needed to excel in their profession.
1.3.3.2.5. Con: Planned Parenthood's [leadership](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/our-leadership) is predominately women; this helps to overcome the [gender imbalance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2019/12/15/the-executive-gender-gap/) in corporate leadership.
1.3.3.2.6. Con: Poor management would not be improved by defunding the organization. Better accountability is needed.
1.3.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood benefits from its affiliates, who use taxpayer money to engage in [political campaigning](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/05/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-planned-parenthood-gives-millio/)(Fiorina said Planned Parenthood "is an organization that funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates."\n\nFiorina glossed over the difference between the operational arm of Planned Parenthood, which receives federal funding and cannot take part in electoral activities, and its affiliates, which can legally spend money on politics.\n\nStill, she is right that a variety of affiliates of Planned Parenthood -- usually with "Planned Parenthood" in their name -- have legally spent "millions" on politics in recent years, both for candidates specifically and on other electoral activities.). This makes the organization unethical.
1.3.4.1. Con: There are [many organizations](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/96-809.html)(Public charities, religious groups, social welfare organizations and other non-profit organizations which are exempt from federal income taxation are not generally prohibited from engaging in all lobbying or public policy advocacy activities merely because of their tax-exempt status. There may, however, be some lobbying limitations on certain organizations, depending on their tax-exempt status and/or their participation as federal grantees in federal programs. Additionally, organizations \(other than churches or their affiliates\) which meet specified threshold expenditure requirements on lobbying activities and which engage in direct lobbying of federal officials must register employees who are paid to lobby, and must file reports on lobbying activities, under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended.) that benefit from government dollars and engage in [political campaigning](https://ballotpedia.org/Taxpayer-funded_lobbying)(Taxpayer-funded lobbying is defined as the practice of using funds that come directly or indirectly from taxpayers for political lobbying purposes.) of some sort. Planned Parenthood should not be singled out as particularly unethical.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Churches receive special [tax benefits](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-integrated-auxiliaries-and-conventions-or-associations-of-churches)(Churches \(including integrated auxiliaries and conventions or associations of churches\) that meet the requirements of section 501\(c\)\(3\) of the Internal Revenue Code are automatically considered tax exempt and are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of exempt status from the IRS. Donors are allowed to claim a charitable deduction for donations to a church that meets the section 501\(c\)\(3\) requirements even though the church has neither sought nor received IRS recognition that it is tax exempt.), and many endorse candidates or political positions.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Churches are held to the same standard as other tax-exempt charities, and can have their [exempt status revoked](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/972/taxation-of-religious-entities)(In recent years, the Internal Revenue Code sec. 501\(c\)\(3\), which prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including religious entities, from engaging in campaign activities has garnered increased public attention. For example, in Branch Ministries v. Rossotti \(D.C. Cir. 2000\), the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the Internal Revenue Service’s revocation of the tax-exempt status of a church that had engaged in political campaign activity, in violation of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibited such churches from endorsing political candidates. Although this issue has prompted much comment in both the media and Congress, neither Congress nor the courts have altered the rule.) for violating the rules on political campaigning.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Religious advocacy groups spend approximately $350 million per year on lobbying activities \([p. 13](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2011/11/ReligiousAdvocacy_web.pdf)(These groups collectively employ at least 1,000 people in the greater Washington area and spend at least $350 million a year on efforts to influence national public policy.)\).
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: The Salvation Army receives federal funding, yet they have lobbied to circumvent rules against [anti-LGBTQ discriminiation](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/16/21003560/salvation-army-anti-lgbtq-controversies-donations)(In 2001, the organization tried to strike a deal with the Bush administration, which would have allowed religious charities that receive federal funding to circumvent local ordinances against anti-LGBTQ discrimination.).
1.3.4.1.3. Con: Any organisation should be held accountable for unethical actions, Planned Parenthood included.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood makes political expenditures that are intended to [support or defeat specific candidates](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/21/740/2577817/)(PPAM communicates frequently with the public to urge them to contact legislators to support or oppose legislation of interest to PPAM. Often this grass roots lobbying is carried on forty-five days before an election, and some of the legislators whose votes or positions are reported upon or whom the public is urged to contact, may at that time be candidates for public office.) in state elections.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: As a public charity, Planned Parenthood is allowed to conduct limited [lobbying activities](https://www.bairdholm.com/blog/501c3-organizations-political-activity-and-lobbying/)(With respect to lobbying, the Code imposes different requirements depending upon the type of 501\(c\)\(3\) organization conducting the activity—public charities or private foundations. While a comprehensive description of the difference between public charities and private foundations is beyond the scope of this article, generally public charities are supported by a variety of sources and private foundations are funded by a single source \(typically an individual, family, or corporation\).\n\nA public charity may engage in lobbying, so long as those activities do not amount to a “substantial” part of the charity’s activities. When an organization engages in substantial lobbying, it is deemed an action organization and no longer qualifies for 501\(c\)\(3\) status.).
1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: Such activities include [issue advocacy](https://nonprofitlawblog.com/charities-issue-advocacy-right-part-one/)(Another form of advocacy is known as issue advocacy, which includes public support for or opposition to a particular cause or policy without a call to action on specific legislation \(lobbying\) or a candidate for elected office \(political campaign intervention\). Charities can engage in unlimited issue advocacy that does not fall within the definition of lobbying or political campaign intervention.), which includes the publicisation of candidate positions without an express recommendation to vote for or against a candidate.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Con: The purpose of a charity should be to help those in need, not to participate in political lobbying.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood does not [meet the qualifications](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/21/740/2577817/)(Section 54 of the Act, M.C.L. § 169.254 prohibits corporations from making expenditures to support or defeat any candidate for election to state office. Rule 169.39\(b\) excepts certain non profit organizations. However, Plaintiff does not meet the qualifications for a non profit organization under the Act.) for an exemption to this rule.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Campaign laws in some states place [restrictions](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/21/740/2577817/)(Rule 169.39\(b\) provides in part:\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this rule, an expenditure for a communication that uses the name or likeness of 1 or more specific candidates is subject to the prohibition on contributions and expenditures in Section 54 of the Act, if the communication is broadcast or distributed within 45 calendar days before the date of an election in which the candidate's name is eligible to appear on the ballot.) on communications that use the name or likeness of a candidate within 45 days of an election.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood has publicised the reproductive health positions of [individual political candidates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-endorsement-idUSKBN23M2GJ)(“This election we have a choice — between Donald Trump, whose incompetence and disregard for the law are a danger to us all, and Joe Biden, who is committed to fighting for reproductive health and rights for all,” Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s acting president, said in a statement.) during campaign seasons.
1.3.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Such publicisation was not accompanied by the express endorsement or disavowal of specific candidates, and as such is allowable.
1.3.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: This practice unfairly biases voters [against pro-life](https://www.cbsnews.com/dfw/news/planned-parenthood-voter-guides-candidate-records-reproductive-rights/)(In an effort to highlight the reproductive rights records of candidates in the upcoming election Planned Parenthood has launched two new voter guides.\n...\nThis year's effort also comes following a slew of anti-abortion bills coming out of state legislatures in 2019, as well as a key Supreme Court abortion decision in June that struck down a Louisiana abortion restriction while seeing Chief Justice John Roberts in a concurring opinion leave the door open to more state limits on abortion.) candidates.
1.3.4.2.3.2. Con: Courts have determined that Planned Parenthood has the right to produce nonpartisan voter education materials under the [First Amendment](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/21/740/2577817/)(The Rule as drafted infringes on protected speech by prohibiting expenditures for issue advocacy. Interpreting the language of the statute, it is easy to envision that protected speech, in the form of issue advocacy, would be stifled by a fear of violating this rule, and the possible ramifications of such a violation.).
1.3.4.3. Con: These affiliates are distinct from Planned Parenthood medical clinics, and [do not receive federal funding](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/05/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-planned-parenthood-gives-millio/)(It’s important to note that all of the reported expenditures on this list come from entities that are legally allowed to spend money in politics. While the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics, all the affiliates listed in the table are organized in such a way that they are allowed to make campaign donations or spend money in other ways on elections. Also, federal dollars flow only to the operational arms of Planned Parenthood, which by law are not allowed to spend money on politics.).
1.3.4.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood affiliates [donated](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/planned-parenthood/totals?id=D000000591)(Contributions by Party of Recipient\n2020 \n\nDemocrats $1,750,179\nRepublicans $5,562) $1.7 million to Democrats and only $5,562 to Republicans in 2020. It is unfair for Republican taxpayers to support this kind of spending.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: It would be unreasonable to expect equitable spending by affiliates given the unilateral partisan attacks on Planned Parenthood.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood affiliates should not be obligated to politically support those who are working contrary to their interests.
1.3.4.4.1.2. Con: Political contributions from not-for-profit organisations should be nonpartisan.
1.3.4.4.1.2.1. Con: This is unreasonable, since the raison d'etre of many not-for-profit advocacy groups are politicised, partisan issues. For example, this would require the [NRA](https://home.nra.org/)(The National Rifle Association is America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights. We're proud protectors of history's patriots - advocating the right to keep and bear arms, advancing the shooting sports and championing gun safety, education and training.) to contribute to politicians that support increased restrictions on gun ownership.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: Political spending is not regulated on the basis of fairness.
1.3.4.4.3. Pro: The Planned Parenthood Action Fund \(PPAF\) claims that they are [nonpartisan](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/about-us)(Planned Parenthood Action Fund is a nonprofit, non-partisan group. PPAF is backed by more than 7 million activists, donors, and other supporters working to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights. While PPAF works at the national level, local Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations are fighting to defend reproductive rights in states across the country.).
1.3.4.4.3.1. Pro: If a not-for-profit advocacy group is truly nonpartisan, then this should be reflected in their political spending.
1.3.4.4.3.2. Con: PPAF spending is focused on supporting their mission: advocacy of sexual health care and reproductive rights. PPAF bears no responsibility for the politicisation and partisanship that have become associated with this issue.
1.3.4.4.4. Con: Since Planned Parenthood does not dictate how its affiliates donate money, these donations should not impact the future of the organization.
1.3.4.4.5. Pro: During the 2020 election cycle, Planned Parenthood launched a [$45 million program](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/planned-parenthood-2020-electoral-program/index.html)(Planned Parenthood's super PAC kicked off a $45 million electoral program targeted toward battleground states for the 2020 election, the reproductive rights giant announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe funding effort, launched by Planned Parenthood Votes, clocks in at more than triple what the group spent during the last presidential election year and eight times what it spent during the 2018 midterms -- a telling sign of Planned Parenthood's anticipated full court press in the coming election after recent state and federal efforts to curtail reproductive rights including abortion.) targeting reproductive rights issues in battleground states.
1.3.4.5. Pro: Planned Parenthood [lobbied](https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/96dbe62b-3d1b-4706-afdd-ea6d4af42dd5/print/) against the "[Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/25/18239964/born-alive-abortion-survivors-protection-2020-sasse)(The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday is hearing testimony on a bill that would put in place requirements for the care of infants born after failed abortions — and could send doctors to prison if they fail to comply.\n...\nSasse says the legislation is necessary to guarantee the best care for infants.

1.3.4.5.1. Con: Since the [2002 Born-Alive Infants Protection Act](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/the-facts-on-the-born-alive-debate/)(Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine argued that the bill was unnecessary, as a 2002 born-alive bill had “reaffirmed” that “infanticide is already illegal in every state.” Kaine said in a statement: “I support that law, which is still in effect. There is no need for additional federal legislation on this topic. “\n\nIn 2002, the “Born-Alive Infants Protection Act” easily passed Congress — through a voice vote in the House and unanimous consent in the Senate. It became law on Aug. 5, 2002. It defined a “person” \(or “human being,” “child” and “individual”\) for the purposes of any act of Congress or any agency ruling/regulation as “every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.“) already protects the right to life for infants who survive abortions, the new law was not necessary and was intended to stir up anti-abortion sentiment over a non-existent issue.
1.3.4.5.2. Pro: Supporters of the act claim that there is a [legitimate need](https://www.frc.org/op-eds/why-we-need-the-born-alive-abortion-survivors-protection-act)(To date, there have been no prosecutions under the 2002 Born-Alive Infants Protection Act for those 143 infants who clung on to life for hours. The 2002 law lacks adequate enforcement mechanisms. This is why we need the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This act would require health care practitioners to exercise the same degree of skill, care, and diligence that would be offered to any other child born at the same gestational age and ensure that the child be transported and admitted to a hospital.) for a law requiring the provision of medical care to infants born alive after a failed abortion that also includes provisions for prosecuting anyone who fails to provide such care.
1.3.4.5.2.1. Pro: Infants that are born alive after a failed abortion are entitled to [the same rights and protections](https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/congress-delivers-born-alive-infants-protection-act)(Reintroduced in the 107th Congress, the measure \(now H.R. 2175\) was again passed by voice vote. The Senate agreed to the bill by unanimous consent on July 18, 2002. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act became law on August 5...\n\nFirst, the Act establishes a bright line at birth. From that point forward, a child born alive \(irrespective of his being "pre-viable" or "unwanted"\) will be accorded the same rights and protections under federal law as any other "person," "human being," "child," or "individual."\n\nSecond, the Act establishes that a child who survives an abortion has an intrinsic worth and dignity as a human person irrespective of whether she is wanted by her mother.) as any other human.
1.3.4.5.2.2. Con: [Less than 1% of abortions](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/)(Abortions at or after 21 weeks are uncommon, and represent 1% of all abortions in the US. Typically, these procedures cost well over $1,000, excluding the cost of travel and lost wages. They normally require treatment over multiple days, and are only performed by a subset of all abortion providers.\n\nReasons individuals seek abortions later in pregnancy include medical concerns such as fetal anomalies or maternal life endangerment, as well as barriers to care that cause delays in obtaining an abortion.) in the US are performed once the fetus is viable \(after 21 weeks\) and of these, many are necessary because the fetus has a fatal condition or the woman's life is at risk.
1.3.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: The CDC identified only 143 cases between 2003 and 2014 in which a child was born alive after an abortion attempt and subsequently died from any cause \([p. 1](https://www.usccb.org/resources/Born-Alive-Basics.pdf)(Between the years 2003-2014, the CDC analyzed death certificates from those states that report this information and found that at least 143 babies were born alive and subsequently died \(the cause was not provided\) after an attempted abortion.)\).
1.3.4.5.2.2.2. Con: There were [629,898 legal abortions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8654281/)(A total of 629,898 abortions for 2019 were reported to CDC from 49 reporting areas.) performed in 2019; 1% of these represents 6,298 possible cases per year in which such a law could be relevant.
1.3.4.6. Con: Planned Parenthood has not been found guilty of any ethical violations involving their political campaigning in a court of law.
1.3.5. Pro: Planned Parenthood has been accused of engaging in illegal activities.
1.3.5.1. Pro: There have been accusations that Planned Parenthood performs illegal medical procedures.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: The safe, legal abortions provided by Planned Parenthood have helped prevent innumerable unsafe [illegal procedures](https://www.guttmacher.org/perspectives50/abortion-and-after-legalization)(It is easy for Americans to forget that illegal abortion was common before the 1973 Supreme Court decisions that legalized the procedure across the nation—and that denying women access to legal abortion does not prevent them from having abortions, but just increases the likelihood that they will resort to an illegal abortion carried out under unsafe conditions. In a 1976 article, researchers from the Center for Disease Control examined national abortion data from the three years surrounding the rulings and estimated that the number of illegal procedures in the country plummeted from around 130,000 to 17,000 between 1972 and 1974. The number of deaths associated with illegal abortion decreased from 39 to five in that same time period; women who died as a result of illegal abortions typically were black, were more than 12 weeks pregnant and had self-induced in their own community.).
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: In 2011, Planned Parenthood of Iowa was accused of providing abortion-inducing drugs without any [in-person examination](https://adflegal.org/press-release/webcam-abortions-put-planned-parenthood-profits-ahead-womens-health)(Planned Parenthood and other abortionists must be held to basic medical standards of care, and little is more basic than an in-person examination by a physician before a procedure that poses serious health risks,” said ADF Senior Counsel Michael J. Norton. “The court was right to uphold the Iowa Board of Medicine’s rule, which requires a licensed professional to personally meet with women who want to undergo this potentially life-threatening procedure.) by a licensed physician.
1.3.5.1.2.1. Con: The ban on telemedicine abortion in Iowa was ruled to be unconstitutional, as it placed an undue burden on a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy as defined by the United States Supreme Court \([pp. 1, 31](https://medicalboard.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/11/press_release_-_iowa_supreme_court_determines_medical_abortion_rule_is_unconstitutional_-_june_19_2015.pdf)(The Iowa Supreme Court today \(June 15, 2015\) said the Iowa Board of\nMedicine’s standard of practice for physicians who prescribe and administer abortion-inducing\ndrugs in Iowa is unconstitutional.\n\nThe court, in a 6-0 opinion, writes, “After careful consideration, we hold that rule 653—13.10\(2\) through 13.10\(4\) place an undue burden on a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy as defined by the United States Supreme Court in its federal constitutional precedents. Because the Board agrees the Iowa Constitution protects a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy to the same extent as the United States Constitution, we find the rule violates the Iowa Constitution.”)\). The rule was subsequently [permanently enjoined](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion#) by court order.
1.3.5.1.2.2. Con: Many common medical services are now offered via [telemedicine](https://telehealth.hhs.gov/patients/understanding-telehealth/), including abortion procedures. In the majority of US states, Planned Parenthood locations are legally able to provide [provide these](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-massachusetts/campaigns/telemedicine-abortion).
1.3.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: Studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of using telemedicine in surgical care \([p. 205](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195401/pdf/AIM-26-201.pdf)(Our study finds that telemedicine in surgical care can provide benefits to both patients and healthcare providers.

In addition, telemedicine can play an important role in improving care through the collaboration of surgical teams located at different sites.)\).
1.3.5.1.2.2.2.

This information may help providers plan services. \n....\nIn clinic, the necessary blood tests are done in the same building, and those patients getting serial hCGs receive paper requisitions with the address of the lab close to their homes. The pharmacy dispensing the mifepristone is also in the building. For telemedicine abortions, the addresses and fax numbers of the labs and pharmacies in the many different communities must be found. Not all pharmacies will dispense mifepristone; when this occurs, another pharmacy must be found or the medications must be couriered. Finding anti-D for Rh negative women was sometimes a challenge.)\).
1.3.5.1.2.3. Pro: In 19 states, a clinician providing a medication abortion [must be physically present](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion#)(19 states require the clinician providing a medication abortion to be physically present when the medication is administered, thereby prohibiting the use of telemedicine to prescribe medication for abortion.) when the medication is administered.

1.3.5.1.3.1. Con: A House Oversight Committee investigation found [no credible evidence](https://oversight.house.gov/planned-parenthood-fact-v-fiction)(Claim:\nPlanned Parenthood conducts partial birth abortions in violation of federal law.\n\nFacts:\nPlanned Parenthood does not conduct partial birth abortions.\n\nThe Committee has obtained no credible evidence that “any physician employed by Planned Parenthood affiliates has performed an ‘intact’ dilation and evacuation \(D&E\) \[abortion\] to preserve fetal tissue for research.”) that Planned Parenthood had performed partial-birth abortions.
1.3.5.1.3.2.

1.3.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court upheld the ban in the 2007 [Gonzales v. Carhart](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/550/124.html) case.
1.3.5.1.3.3.

The US Constitution guarantees the right to [due process](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process)(The Constitution states only one command twice. The Fifth Amendment says to the federal government that no one shall be "deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."

1.3.5.5.

1.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood supports abortions. These should not be funded by the government.
1.4.1. Pro: A substantial percentage of US citizens object to abortion.
1.4.1.1. Con: The preferences of some citizens should not dictate the choices of others.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: A prospective parent's decision to abort allows their preference to dictate whether or not their child can live.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The pro-choice position allows others to make their own decision regarding abortion, whilst the pro-life position imposes moral beliefs on others.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Forcing children to be born to parents who do not want them is unethical.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Many [children](https://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/famous-people-who-were-adopted-60203513/#/ms-20772/1) given up for adoption have happy, meaningful lives.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1.

Pro: Even if it is a given that a child's life will be unhappy, most would agree that this is preferable to not living at all \([pp. 351-352](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/3/338/2979213)(Conclusively, wrongful life suits are alleged to be predicated on the devaluation of life with disability, i.e. that non-existence is preferable to life with disability. The injury is therefore life with disability. Wrongful life claims seek to compensate the child \(the victim\) by comparing his/her rightful condition had the defendant not acted negligently, with her actual conditions of life. As we have seen above, this comparison \(where the alternative would be non-existence, the\ntermination of a pregnancy\) draws the most bioethical and juridical criticisms and is largely responsible for the fact that many courts, internationally, deny the feasibility and the lawfulness of wrongful life suits. The claim that non-existence is preferable to life with disability stands as the major obstacle and is the main justification for the dismissal of many cases of wrongful life claims.)\).
1.4.1.1.3.2.2. Con: A theoretical "possible" child is not the same thing as a living child.

Relations between pregnancy intention and maternal depression, maternal depression score and parenting stress score were moderately explained by marital conflict and fathers’ participation in childcare.)\).
1.4.1.1.3.3.2.

1.4.1.2. Con: Pro-life Americans appear to be increasingly in the [minority.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx)
1.4.1.2.1.

1.4.1.2.2. Con: Change does not inherently imply progress; some would consider this a symptom of [moral regression](https://ronrolheiser.com/moral-progress-and-regression/)(What all this highlights is that our moral judgments may not be simple: The past we sometimes idealize, for all its moral strengths \(its faith in God, in church, in family, in sacrifice, in self-renunciation, in sexual responsibility\) was, because of racism, sexism, and dogmatic intolerance, less of a golden age for some than for others. We once too had our “Taliban” that declared that error had no rights and killed people in the name of God and of purity of doctrine. Conversely, today, our secularized liberal culture, for all its heightened moral sensitivity within the areas of race, gender, justice, tolerance, and the integrity of creation, has its own glaring moral blind-spots in the areas of abortion, end of life issues, church, family values, and sexuality.).
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: As of 2020, young people in the US are [increasingly supporting a pro-choice position](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2020/01/15/abortion-is-public-opinion-changing/?sh=6720d93e294b)(Recent data would seem to suggest that the young, who often give us a sense of where the country is heading, are moving the public opinion needle in a more pro-choice direction.) on abortion.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Pro: Young people in the US are more likely than their elders to support abortion since they do not grow up in [predominantly religious homes](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-decline-of-religion-in-american-family-life/)(Young adults \(age 18 to 29\) are far more likely to have been raised without religion than are seniors \(age 65 or older\). Roughly one in five \(22 percent\) young adults report that they were not raised in any particular religion, compared to only 3 percent of seniors. Notably, the proportion of young adults who have always been religiously unaffiliated is nearly as large as those who have left religion to become unaffiliated.).
1.4.1.2.3.2. Con: Young people only make up [13% of the total US population](http://actforyouth.net/adolescence/demographics/)(According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, there were 41,852,838 youth age 10-19 in the United States, 13% of the total U.S. population, in 2019.); thus, their support does not constitute a majority.

1.4.1.3.2. Con: Pro-life organisations in the US are outnumbered by those that are pro-choice, of which there are over [140](https://www.causeiq.com/directory/pro-choice-organizations-list/#search_section). This suggests that opposition to abortion is a minority view.
1.4.1.4.

It is not recognition by another that constitutes this right. This right is antecedent to its recognition; it demands recognition and it is strictly unjust to refuse it.).
1.4.1.4.1.

1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Since religions are defined by non-negotiable theological dogma and not personal interpretations, denying a central dogma of a tradition disqualifies one as a follower of that tradition \([pp. 27, 30](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/berkhof/IntrotoSystematicLouisBerkhof.pdf)(Personal opinions, however true and valuable they may be, do not constitute Christian dogmas. Some extremists object to the social element of dogmas. They admit the necessity of reflecting on the truth, but are of the opinion that personal self-respect should prompt each one to decide for himself what is true. Each one should construct his own system of the truth, and should not concern himself about the ideas of others. It cannot be said, however, that they represent the prevailing tendency of our day in theological thought.\n...\nThe Vatican Council declared: "If any one shall assert it to be possible that sometimes, according to the progress of science, a sense is to be given to the doctrines propounded by the Church different from that which the Church has understood and understands: let him be anathema.")\). The prohibition of abortion is dogmatic in the Christian tradition \([pp. 44-45](https://www.baylor.edu/ifl/christianreflection/CloningarticleTheologiansBrief.pdf)(I. Though penalties have varied, the Christian tradition has always extended the principle of the sacredness of human life to the very beginning of each human being, and never allowed the deliberate destruction of the fruit of conception.\n\nII. The origin of each human being is not only a work of nature but is a special work of God in which God is involved from the very beginning.\n\nIII. The Christian doctrine of the soul is not dualistic but requires one to believe that, where there is a living human individual, there is a spiritual soul.\n\nIV. Each human being is called and consecrated by God in the womb from the first moment of his or her existence, before he or she becomes aware of it. \n\nV. Jesus, who reveals to Christians what it is to be human, was a human individual from the moment of his conception, celebrated on the feast of the Annunciation, nine months before the feast of Christmas.)\).
1.4.1.4.2. Con: The US is [not a theocracy](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-history-of-religion-in-the-united-states-liberty-and-theocracy)(I make these points not to castigate any faith or believer, but rather to show that we found a way out of theocracy into a new universe of peaceful coexistence. That way was the First Amendment, which requires the free exercise of religion and its disestablishment—in other words, freedom and restriction. No religion can be the government or run the government. Rather, these two most authoritative forces in human existence have been warned to co-exist without either taking over the other.\n\n \n\nIn the culture wars today—and particularly the Religious Freedom Protection Acts, where those making demands for “religious liberty” often ignore or minimize the harm that is too often done in the name of religion—it is easy to lose sight of what the framing generation, with its fresh experience of theocracy, understood: there is such a thing as too much liberty. They called it “licentiousness,” and early state constitutions set limits on the free exercise of religion, including “peace or safety.”), so [evangelical religious belief](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-abortion/) is an illegitimate basis for shaping American law.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: Although the US Constitution prohibits the [establishment of religion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause)(The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law “respecting an establishment of religion.” This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. It also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion.), people are free to support laws that correspond with their religious beliefs. US law is shaped by [both religious and secular](https://www.pewresearch.org/2007/12/03/religion-and-secularism-the-american-experience/)(That congruency, that mingling, is a key element in the genius of American politics and of American religion.\n...\nWe enshrine the separation of church and state, but at the same time we practice the mingling of religion and public life. It’s not always logical, but there are times when it makes good sense. There are almost no examples in the American past of successful, widely accepted reforms that do not pay their respects to both America’s religious and secular sensibilities. The way I like to put this \[is that\] they are required to pass through a bicameral body politic, both religious and secular.) forces.
1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Based on the US Constitution, US law should be entirely [secular](https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/first-amendment-and-religion)(Today, what constitutes an "establishment of religion" is often governed under the three-part test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 \(1971\). Under the "Lemon" test, government can assist religion only if \(1\) the primary purpose of the assistance is secular, \(2\) the assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion, and \(3\) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state.) and [free from any religious influence](https://ffrf.org/about)(The history of Western civilization shows us that most social and moral progress has been brought about by persons free from religion. In modern times the first to speak out for prison reform, for humane treatment of the mentally ill, for abolition of capital punishment, for women's right to vote, for death with dignity for the terminally ill, and for the right to choose contraception, sterilization and abortion have been freethinkers, just as they were the first to call for an end to slavery.) whatsoever.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Although abortion is not expressly mentioned in the Bible, there are many Bible passages consistent with the [pro-life position](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resource/55398/the-bibles-teaching-against-abortion)(The Bible clearly teaches that abortion is wrong. This teaching comes across in many ways and for many reasons. Some people point out that the word "abortion" is not in the Bible, and that is true. Nevertheless, the teaching about abortion is there. This is the case with many teachings. The word "Trinity" is not in the Bible, but the teaching about the Trinity is there. In any case, a person who wants to deny the teaching about abortion would deny it even if the word were there.).
1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Since the Bible is often cited as a moral authority for banning and defunding abortions, it is important to note that it also provides [support for abortion](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+5%3A27&version=NIV)(If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.). This suggests that religious objections to abortion based on scripture are hypocritical.
1.4.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The Christian Bible contains [instructions on when and how to induce a miscarriage](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2018/02/03/bible-commands-abortion-part-1/). Thus, the Bible supports a pro-abortion stance.
1.4.1.4.3.1.2. Con: The Bible recommends abortion in cases of [suspected infidelity](https://www.str.org/w/did-god-ordain-abortion-as-punishment-for-infidelity-)(Though abortion is inconsistent with the Christian worldview, some people point to a Bible passage they believe ordains abortion. Numbers 5:11–31 cites an unusual test for adultery. If a husband suspects his wife is unfaithful, he’s to bring her before a priest, where a ritual takes place to determine her guilt or innocence. The woman takes an oath and drinks bitter water—a concoction of holy water and dust from the tabernacle floor. Verse 27 describes one possible outcome.\n...\nThis procedure employs a providential sign from God to indicate infidelity. If the woman is guilty, “her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry,” a curse that some suggest amounts to an “intentional miscarriage.”). This is not pro-choice since it does not allow the couple any agency in the decision to abort.
1.4.1.4.3.2. Con: There are also Bible passages that have been used to [support slavery](http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/uniontodisunion/exhibits/show/scripture-passages)(The biblical defense of slavery was built around three main scripture passages. These passages ranged from Old Testament to New Testament and were used to support various aspects of slavery, such as the buying and selling of slaves as well as the Fugitive Slave Act. The focus on religion at this time deeply influenced the turn to the bible in order to defend this practice. The bible was held highly in many people's lives and living life in a moral way was extremely important. Since slavery on the ground level seemed oppressive and immoral, many thought that if they found places in the bible where slavery was addressed, and sometimes even supported, that they could continue this practice without living an immoral life. They believed that if God addressed slavery in any positive way, it could not be an immoral practice.); there is no reason to assume that the biblical position is morally superior.
1.4.1.4.3.3. Pro: Christian scripture includes [references](https://friends.carenetdane.org/2019/01/17/what-does-the-bible-say-about-abortion/)(The answer is: the Bible doesn’t mention the word abortion. That doesn’t mean it is silent on the matter though, because it has a great deal to say about when life begins.\n\nThe Bible is clear that the unborn child is a valuable life.) to life inside the womb, which some interpret as supporting the protection of [unborn children](https://www.adventist.org/official-statements/statement-on-the-biblical-view-of-unborn-life-and-its-implications-for-abortion/)(Jesus speaks of the least of His brothers \(Matthew 25:40\), for whom His followers are responsible, and of the little ones who should not be despised or lost \(Matthew 18:10-14\).

Viability is usually placed at about seven months \(28 weeks\) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.)\).
1.4.1.4.4.2. Con: The [morality](https://theconversation.com/when-human-life-begins-is-a-question-of-politics-not-biology-165514)(Abortion rights opponents know that Americans have widely differing values and religious beliefs about abortion and the protection of human life. So they seek to use science as an absolute standard in any discussion of abortion’s constitutionality, setting a definition of human life that they hope will be immune to any counterargument.\n\nWhile possibly well-intentioned, this appeal to scientific authority and evidence over discussions of people’s values is based on faulty reasoning.

The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause...\nBut in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only post-natally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application.\n\nAll this, together with our observation, supra, that, throughout the major portion of the 19th century, prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word "person," as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.)\).

Nearly 1.2 million pregnancy tests were given to women, some of whom may have been pregnant at the time. And 17,817 men and women received “other procedures,” including services for low-income pregnant women through the Women, Infants, and Children federal program.\n\nAlso, a Planned Parenthood spokesman told us that some clinics don’t provide prenatal care, so pregnant women are referred elsewhere for that service.

1.4.2.3.1.2.

1.4.2.4. Con: Regardless of how the funds are earmarked, government funding of Planned Parenthood for other medical services indirectly supports abortion.

Con: Community health centers in the US are already [overworked](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20150902.050150/full/)(Community health centers struggled to meet a surge in need; it is not known how many women faced delays in securing access to care, including life-saving cancer screenings and essential birth control services, as a result.).
1.4.2.5.1.2. Pro: The quality of care at community health centers in the US is comparable to the quality of care provided by private physicians \([p. 768](https://www.jabfm.org/content/jabfp/26/6/768.full.pdf)(As safety-net providers for vulnerable populations, HCs provide high-quality primary care and do not exhibit the extent of disparities that exist in other US health care settings. Continued efforts are necessary to address insurance-related disparities, particularly among uninsured patients.)\).
1.4.2.5.2. Con: It is beneficial for patients to have increased access to health clinics \([p. 1](https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/insurance-access-health-system-benefits-2017-08.pdf)(The health care system’s ability to serve both insured and uninsured consumers is compromised when a significant number of people are uninsured. Expanding access to affordable health care benefits both insured and uninsured community members.\nIn communities with high rates of uninsurance:\n• residents are more likely to have unmet health care needs,\n• vital health services are less likely to be available, and\n• hospitals are more likely to close, causing adverse health and economic impacts.)\).
1.4.2.6. Pro: Studies indicate that defunding Planned Parenthood will have [devastating medical consequences](https://oneequalworld.com/2017/01/18/planned-parenthood/)(With limited access to these types of services, the number of unwanted pregnancies would increase. STD rates would sky rocket. Thousands of cancer cases would go undiagnosed. And abortion? That would still be a thing, except thousands of women would seek out back-alley abortions instead of having a licensed medical professional perform the operation. Does that sound like something that’s in the public’s best interest?).
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: In the absence of Planned Parenthood, many [vulnerable communities](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/american-medical-association-opposes-house-bill-to-repeal-aca-and-block-care-for-planned-parenthood-patients)(Blocking access to Planned Parenthood hurts people in communities who are struggling to get by the most – especially those with low incomes and those living in areas with no other health care providers. This disproportionately impacts people who already face structural barriers to accessing care including people of color, immigrants, young people, and members of the LGBTQ community -- with those whose identities overlap facing multiple barriers.) will face additional barriers to health care.
1.4.2.6.1.1. Con: While unideal for these communities in the short term, removing access to Planned Parenthood would highlight this inequality and thus the need for reforms in healthcare access.
1.4.2.6.1.2. Pro: There are no healthcare services that serve patients who rely on safety-net providers in more than [20% of the counties](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-statement-on-new-york-times-story)(In 21 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood health center, Planned Parenthood was the only safety-net family planning provider;) where Planned Parenthood health centers operate \([p.

It can also be understood as population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to healthcare. Another useful definition has been provided by the Institute of Medicine that suggests that health disparities are racial or ethnic differences in the quality of healthcare that are not due to access-related factors or clinical needs, preferences, and appropriateness of intervention.)\).
1.4.2.6.2. Con: [Federally qualified health centers](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/what-is-a-health-center/index.html)(Health centers are community-based and patient-directed organizations that deliver comprehensive, culturally competent, high-quality primary health care services to the nation’s most vulnerable individuals and families, including people experiencing homelessness, agricultural workers, residents of public housing, and veterans.\n\nHealth centers integrate access to pharmacy, mental health, substance use disorder, and oral health services in areas where economic, geographic, or cultural barriers limit access to affordable health care. By emphasizing coordinated care management of patients with multiple health care needs and the use of key quality improvement practices, including health information technology, health centers reduce health disparities.) \(FQHCs\) could take the place of reproductive healthcare provided by Planned Parenthood.
1.4.2.6.2.1. Con: FQHCs have a very limited reach, and serve about 10 contraceptive clients each year \([p. 1897](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5678404/pdf/AJPH.2017.304124.pdf)(At the federal level, attempts by Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and spending proposals for fiscal year 2018 from both the US House of Representatives and the Trump administration would bar Planned Parenthood from federally funded programs including Medicaid and Title X. Recent Guttmacher analyses show that doing so would place unrealistic expectations on other safety-net family planning centers and jeopardize women’s access to publicly funded contraceptive care.\n\nFor example, in justifying efforts to exclude Planned Parenthood, many in Congress argue that federally qualified health centers \(FQHCs\) could readily meet women’s needs. These claims ignore the fact that only 60% of all sites operated by FQHCs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia report serving at least 10 contraceptive clients each year \(and are so are counted among the nationwide network of safety-net family planning centers\).)\).
1.4.2.6.3. Pro: There would be a [rise in unsafe abortions](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/limiting-abortion-access-contributes-poor-maternal-health-outcomes/)(Limiting abortion through various restrictions—such as waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds, and parental consent—has been shown to increase rates of unsafe abortion rather than eliminate the need for abortion. Limitations place women in desperate situations, and some may attempt to have abortions through unsafe methods as a result.\n...\nReproductive health experts linked the uptake in maternal deaths to state-based limitations on abortion and reproductive health funding—including cuts to family planning services and a defunding of Planned Parenthood—that occurred during the same window of time.) if Planned Parenthood is defunded.
1.4.2.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.
1.4.2.6.4. Pro: Defunding Planned Parenthood will increase the prevalence of preventable diseases and decrease the early detection of cancer.
1.4.2.6.4.1. Con: These same services can be offered elsewhere.
1.4.2.6.4.1.1. Con: [Access](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/leading-health-indicators/2020-lhi-topics/Access-to-Health-Services)(Access to health services affects a person’s health and well-being. Regular and reliable access to health services can:\n\n•Prevent disease and disability\n•Detect and treat illnesses or other health conditions\n•Increase quality of life\n•Reduce the likelihood of premature \(early\) death\n•Increase life expectancy) is a key component of improving healthcare; a decrease in the number of providers will reduce patient access to these services.
1.4.2.6.4.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides vaccine clinics, which are essential for the management of preventable disease in America.
1.4.2.6.4.2.1. Pro: During the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-orange-san-bernardino/about-us/blog/proudly-offering-covid-19-vaccines-to-the-community), Planned Parenthood began offering vaccination clinics to help stop the spread of the virus.
1.4.2.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Since the Covid-19 vaccines were accessible from a wide range of [healthcare providers](https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/get-vaccinated/where/index.html)(You can get most recommended vaccines at your doctor’s office, and many recommended vaccines are also available at local pharmacies, health centers, health departments, and travel clinics.), very few people are likely to have been vaccinated at a controversial institution like Planned Parenthood.
1.4.2.6.4.2.1.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood [launched](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-launches-two-million-dollar-covid-19-vaccine-campaign) a $2 million bilingual campaign to inform and encourage people to get the Covid-19 vaccine.
1.4.2.6.4.2.1.3. Pro: Some Planned Parenthood centers, such as [those in Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley](https://www.pasadenanow.com/main/planned-parenthood-offers-covid-19-vaccine-clinics-in-san-gabriel-valley/), rolled out regular rotating Covid-19 vaccination clinics.
1.4.2.6.4.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood provided 31,624 HPV vaccinations in 2019-2020 \([p. 35](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/67/30/67305ea1-8da2-4cee-9191-19228c1d6f70/210219-annual-report-2019-2020-web-final.pdf)\).
1.4.2.6.4.2.3. Con: If [Americans are unwilling to get vaccinated](https://www.biospace.com/article/47-percent-of-americans-still-hesitant-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-new-poll-says/), then Planned Parenthood vaccine clinics cannot be effective.
1.4.2.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.7.4.
1.4.2.6.4.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood clinics have a positive effect on patient health by reducing the risk of STDs and their associated negative effects. Areas where Planned Parenthood offices have closed have experienced [a rise in STD rates](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/planned-parenthood-congress-wisconsin-texas)(So when the Planned Parenthood clinic in Midland closed down in late 2013 – a casualty of legislative cuts that targeted Planned Parenthood directly – it served as an isolated experiment in what happens when the government defunds the largest women’s healthcare provider around.\n\n“I hate to say it, but I think an awful lot of women just opted to go without care,” said Mike Austin.\n\n“We are seeing a subsequent rise in STDs and a subsequent rise in unplanned pregnancies,” Austin said. He believes they could be linked. “And I’m sitting here going, ‘See? I told you so. This is what happens.’”).
1.4.2.6.4.4.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood is a leading provider of [HIV](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-doubles-down-on-hiv-aids-prevention-on-world-aids-day)("As one of the nation’s leading HIV testing providers, Planned Parenthood has provided nearly 6.5 million HIV tests over the past decade.") management and prevention services, which are vital to America's health.
1.4.2.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides access to [PrEP](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids/prep)(PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It’s a daily pill that can help prevent HIV. If you don’t have HIV, taking PrEP every day can lower your chances of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%.), which has been shown to be up to [99% effective](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/prep-effectiveness.html)(PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken as prescribed.) at preventing the spread of HIV.
1.4.2.6.4.4.1.2. Con: HIV infection rates in the US have been [declining](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics)(HIV incidence declined 8% from 2015 to 2019. In 2019, the estimated number of HIV infections in the U.S. was 34,800 and the rate was 12.6 \(per 100,000 people\).). Planned Parenthood is not needed to successfully test and treat HIV, as there are [other services](https://www.kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/hiv-testing-in-the-united-states/)(HIV testing is offered at CDC-funded testing sites \(accounting for more than 3 million tests\) and in other public and private settings, including free-standing HIV counseling and testing centers, health departments, hospitals, private doctor offices, STD clinics, and mobile testing units.) available.
1.4.2.6.4.4.2. Con: The CDC has a searchable database of nationwide [STD testing](https://gettested.cdc.gov/) facilities.
1.4.2.6.4.5. Pro: Planned Parenthood offers various cancer screening services.
1.4.2.6.4.5.1. Con: There are numerous [options for cancer screening](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/how-to-get-screened-for-cancer-if-you-dont-have-a-doctor.html)(Screening tests are used to find cancer in people who have no symptoms. Screening increases the chances of finding certain cancers early, when they are small, have not spread, and might be easier to treat.\n...\nSome cancer screening tests need to be ordered by a doctor or another health care provider who can order them. If you don’t have a doctor, there are things you can do and places you can call to find out how to get the screening tests you need. Here is information about recommended cancer screening tests and other information you might need to know so you can get screened.), including private doctors, local hospitals, medical clinics, and local health departments.
1.4.2.6.4.5.2. Con: While Planned Parenthood does offer [clinical breast examinations](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/cancer/breast-cancer/what-breast-exam)(Clinical breast examinations can detect a lump in your breast and other changes that might require more testing. Breast exams are one of the most important early breast cancer screenings.), [less than 1%](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/mar/09/fact-check-schumers-claim-that-millions-of-women-t/)(In 2014, there were 363,803 breast exams at Planned Parenthood clinics, and about 11,000 \(3 percent\) resulted in a client referral for mammography and other specialized providers, according to Planned Parenthood. That means the number of mammogram referrals comprised less than 1 percent of total Planned Parenthood patients in 2014.) of their patients are referred for a mammogram to screen for cancer.
1.4.2.6.4.5.3. Pro: Men can visit clinics for prostate, colon, and testicular [cancer screenings](https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/misconceptions-about-planned-parenthood.html)(While services vary depending on location, men can visit clinics for prostate, colon, and testicular cancer screenings, vasectomies, male infertility screenings, and sexual-health services, among other necessary health treatments.).
1.4.2.6.4.5.4. Pro: In Wisconsin, fewer women were able to access lifesaving cancer screenings following the closure of Planned Parenthood health centers \([p. 7](http://ppfa.pr-optout.com/ViewAttachment.aspx?EID=mr9WXYw4u2IxYnni1dBRVrqzCGiEBfZUdxhn2b/Dzz4=)(In Wisconsin, in 2011, Governor Scott Walker signed a budget that eliminated state and federal funding to several women’s health centers. These cuts disproportionately affected organizations affiliated with abortion, despite the fact that many if not all of the defunded centers did not actually provide abortion services themselves. Furthermore, the language of the budget is written in such a way that defunded clinics also cannot work with public \(state\) labs to read the tests that are part of their cancer screening process.)\).
1.4.3. Con: Many common medical procedures are funded in whole or part by government spending; abortion should be no different.
1.4.3.1. Con: The moral considerations associated with abortion make it substantively different from other medical procedures; the Hippocratic Oath forbids performing abortions as they are contrary to the spirit of medicine \([p. 70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6027113/pdf/10.1177_0024363918756389.pdf)(History has lessons to teach us and to relinquish a noble profession to a truncated paradigm of medicine devoid of Hippocratic principles hardly seems in the best interests of current or future patients.\n...\nI will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity and holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art.)\).
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: There are a number of [ethical concerns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/philosophical/introduction.shtml) that are unique to abortion, which are not factors in other medical procedures.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Similar ethical concerns are involved in the consideration of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide \([p. 176](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5402774/pdf/IJPH-46-173.pdf)(The supporters of this attitude \(most commonly in the sphere of philosophy and religion\) found one of the main reasons for the immorality of ADE in the assertion that human life is sacred \(although this term usually belongs to the religion -“traditional ethical principle”\) that one cannot and must not take. They bypass a debate about the reasons that led to killing by using ADE. They do not put an accent on the quality and content of life.)\).
1.4.3.2. Pro: The access to safe abortion is a fundamental right.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: The right to abortion does not include the right to [financial support for abortion](https://lozierinstitute.org/the-hyde-amendment-is-constitutional-and-remains-critically-important/)(In short, a legal “right” to abortion does not equal a right to payment for an abortion. The Court’s jurisprudence on this point is unequivocal.\n\nEqually clear, however, is the need for prolife members of Congress to defend the Hyde Amendment. Congress has never succeeded in passing a law that comprehensively prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion, instead enacting a patchwork of federal funding restrictions, many of which must be passed annually. Without these laws, courts and administrative agencies are likely to interpret any and all publicly funded healthcare as including abortion.).
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Bans on government funding of abortion effectively [act as an obstacle to abortion access](https://www.aclu.org/other/access-denied-origins-hyde-amendment-and-other-restrictions-public-funding-abortion)(Federal and state restrictions on public funding for abortion make it extremely difficult and, often, impossible for Medicaid recipients to exercise their constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. In practice, these women do not have the same rights as other American women who can finance an abortion out-of-pocket or through private insurance coverage. Nor do Medicaid-eligible women have the same rights as men who depend on publicly funded health care. For no covered medical service that men need does the federal Medicaid program restrict the standard for reimbursement as it does for abortions.) for low-income women. Such barriers violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \([p. 264](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=mjgl)(Worse yet, the Hyde Amendment does not foist that majoritarian viewpoint with equal measure upon everyone in our Nation, rich and poor alike; rather, it imposes that viewpoint only upon that segment of our society which, because of its position of political powerlessness, is least able to defend its privacy rights from the encroachments of state-mandated morality. The instant legislation thus calls for more exacting judicial review\nthan in most other cases.)\).
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: The US Supreme Court has held that the state has no obligation to fund nontherapeutic abortions, and that denying funding in such cases does not constitute interference with a woman's right to seek an abortion \([p. 16](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL33467.pdf)(Similarly, in Maher v. Roe, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not require a state participating in the Medicaid program to pay expenses incident to nontherapeutic abortions simply because the state has made a policy choice to pay expenses incident to childbirth. More particularly, Connecticut’s policy of favoring childbirth over abortion was held not to impinge upon the fundamental right of privacy recognized in Roe, which protects a woman from undue interference in her decision to terminate a pregnancy.)\).
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed abortion as a [right](https://nwlc.org/resource/roe-v-wade-and-the-right-to-abortion/)(In the 1973 landmark case Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 7-2, recognized an individual’s right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. The Court made clear that the Due Process Clause’s guarantee that no individual shall be deprived of “liberty” applies to the decision of whether to have an abortion. As the Court said, the constitutional right “is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”\n\nThe Court also held that the right to abortion is “fundamental,” meaning that governmental attempts to interfere with the right are subject to the highest level of review by courts. The Court recognized “the detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether” including psychological harm, harm from pregnancy complications, a possible “distressful life and future,” and “the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it.”) of US citizens.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Roe v. Wade asserts that medical professionals should be free to determine whether a patient's pregnancy should be terminated without interference from the state \([p. 163](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep410/usrep410113/usrep410113.pdf)(This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this "compelling" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.)\).
1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.1.
1.4.3.2.2.3. Pro: In Roe v. Wade, the US Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal for states to ban abortion as doing so would [violate a woman’s constitutional right to privacy](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/what-does-codify-roe-v-wade-mean-from-democratic-debate.html)(In the 1973 case Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal for states to ban abortion before fetal viability, because doing so violated a woman’s constitutional right to privacy.).
1.4.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: The constitutional right to privacy includes the right to choose whether or not to bear a child \([p. 1](https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/factsheets/Constitutional-Protection-for-the-Right-to-Abortion-Fact-Sheet2.pdf)(Eisenstadt elaborated on the right to privacy as “the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.”)\).
1.4.3.2.2.3.2. Con: This right is not absolute and can only be exercised [prior to the viability of the fetus](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/roe_v_wade_\(1973\))(The Court divided the pregnancy period into three trimesters. During the first trimester, the decision to terminate the pregnancy was solely at the discretion of the woman. After the first trimester, the state could “regulate procedure.” During the second trimester, the state could regulate \(but not outlaw\) abortions in the interests of the mother’s health. After the second trimester, the fetus became viable, and the state could regulate or outlaw abortions in the interest of the potential life except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.).
1.4.3.2.2.4. Con: Even though Roe v. Wade established the right to abortion, it [never guaranteed access to safe abortion](http://bostonreview.net/gender-sexuality/rachel-rebouche-codifying-roe)(Though the 1973 case Roe v. Wade established a constitutionally protected right to abortion, it never guaranteed abortion access.), which remains a huge [problem](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion-un-idUSKCN1SR1I3)(“We are very concerned that several U.S. states have passed laws severely restricting access to safe abortion for women, including by imposing criminal penalties on the women themselves and on abortion service providers,” U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told Reuters Television in Geneva.\n\nEvidence and experience have shown that complete bans on abortions do not reduce their number, but drive them underground “jeopardizing the life, health and safety of the women concerned”, she said.) in the US.
1.4.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: Limiting access to abortion increases the number of unsafe abortions and contributes to [poor maternal health](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2018/06/13/451891/limiting-abortion-access-contributes-poor-maternal-health-outcomes/)(Limiting abortion through various restrictions—such as waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds, and parental consent—has been shown to increase rates of unsafe abortion rather than eliminate the need for abortion.

In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion\nin all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do not have to undertake unsafe abortions, and they should revise their abortion laws\naccordingly.)\).
1.4.3.2.3.1. Con: The UN has no particular authority in moral matters.
1.4.3.2.3.2. Pro: Lack of access to safe abortion is globally associated with [poor health outcomes for women and girls](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/abortion)(Inaccessibility of quality abortion care risks violating a range of human rights of women and girls, including the right to life; the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the right to benefit from scientific progress and its realization; the right to decide freely and responsibly on the number, spacing and timing of children; and the right to be free from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment.\n\nEach year, 4.7–13.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion. In developed regions, it is estimated that 30 women die for every 100 000 unsafe abortions. In developing regions, that number rises to 220 deaths per 100 000 unsafe abortions. Estimates from 2012 indicate that in developing countries alone, 7 million women per year were treated in hospital facilities for complications of unsafe abortion.).
1.4.3.2.3.3. Con: The UN's support of abortion does not prove it is a fundamental right.
1.4.3.2.4. Con: Regardless of its legal status, abortion [should not be considered a right](https://eclj.org/abortion/un/pourquoi-lavortement-nest-pas-un-droit-de-lhomme)(Indeed, a right aims at guaranteeing the faculty of a person to act for his/her good as a human being. Everything that we recognise as fundamental rights: think, associate, pray, speak, are faculties through which every person expresses his humanity. These are faculties that animals do not have and that define “human” rights. The fundamental rights protect the exercise of these noble faculties, specifically human. They protect what every person realises his or her humanity in. Which means that by exercising these fundamental rights, man becomes more human.).
1.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court position on abortion is a [compromise](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/)(State criminal abortion laws, like those involved here, that except from criminality only a life-saving procedure on the mother's behalf without regard to the stage of her pregnancy and other interests involved violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects against state action the right to privacy, including a woman's qualified right to terminate her pregnancy. Though the State cannot override that right, it has legitimate interests in protecting both the pregnant woman's health and the potentiality of human life, each of which interests grows and reaches a "compelling" point at various stages of the woman's approach to term.) between a woman's right to privacy and the government's interest in protecting maternal health and prenatal life.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Since Medicaid provides full or partial coverage for a wide range of [medical procedures](https://eligibility.com/medicaid/what-services-does-medicaid-cover), including those treating conditions that - like pregnancy - are a product of [lifestyle choices](https://www.medicinenet.com/lifestyle_disease/definition.htm), individual responsibility is irrelevant to whether or not the government should fund abortions.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: The care and treatment of lifestyle diseases is a [major burden](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/lifestyle-diseases-economic-burden-health-services) on healthcare services.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: The costs associated with [obesity-related disease](http://www.healthycommunitieshealthyfuture.org/learn-the-facts/economic-costs-of-obesity/)(In addition to its serious health consequences, obesity has real economic costs that affect all of us. The estimated annual health care costs of obesity-related illness are a staggering $190.2 billion or nearly 21% of annual medical spending in the United States. Childhood obesity alone is responsible for $14 billion in direct medical costs. Obesity-related medical costs in general are expected to rise significantly, especially because today’s obese children are likely to become tomorrow’s obese adults. If obesity rates were to remain at 2010 levels, the projected savings for medical expenditures would be $549.5 billion over the next two decades.) in the US is over $190 billion annually, accounting for 21% of medical spending.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Unlike pregnancy, the treatment of other conditions that are a result of lifestyle choices rarely has a fatal impact on another human's life.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: Lifestyle diseases are [treated](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/lifestyle-diseases/article18107669.ece)(There are three approaches to treat any lifestyle disease 1\) medicines only, 2\) lifestyle changes only or 3\) combination of medicines and lifestyle changes.) by encouraging lifestyle change in the patient, medical interventions such as surgery or medication, or a combination of both. Such treatment affects only the patient and does not impact others.
1.4.3.3.2.2. Con: The [high cost](http://www.healthycommunitieshealthyfuture.org/learn-the-facts/economic-costs-of-obesity/)(The estimated annual health care costs of obesity-related illness are a staggering $190.2 billion or nearly 21% of annual medical spending in the United States.) of treating lifestyle disease takes up an inordinately large share of medical funding, which could otherwise be used to prevent deaths from other causes.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: Many illnesses labeled as "lifestyle diseases" are caused by the increasing age of the population in developed countries, rather than by lifestyle choices \([p. 774](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51676022_Why_the_concept_lifestyle_diseases_should_be_avoided)(So-called lifestyle diseases have become more common as causes of death mainly because people live longer since they do not die of infectious diseases at younger ages; this is because of changes in living conditions as well as changes in people’s behaviours. A similar change is taking place in low-income countries today, with decreasing child mortality because of a decline in infectious disease mortality and increasing prevalence of diabetes, coronary heart diseases, and cancers.All diseases, both so-called lifestyle diseases and infectious diseases, have multiple causes. Focusing on only one type of cause, as the concept of lifestyle diseases implies, impairs public health policies.)\).
1.4.4. Pro: Under the [Hyde Amendment \(1976\)](https://www.thelily.com/the-hyde-amendment-and-abortion-why-its-in-the-news-and-what-you-need-to-know/)(The Hyde Amendment is a long-standing restriction that bans federal funding for most abortions. Named for then-Rep. Henry Hyde \(R-Ill.\), the rule was first passed in 1976, shortly after the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. It is not a law, but a congressional “rider” tacked onto the Health and Human Services budget, which is renewed every year.), it is illegal in the United States to allocate federal funding to abortions.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.4.4.2. Con: Federal funds allocated to Planned Parenthood for women's health already specifically exclude termination procedures.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: The [cost](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/ask-experts/how-much-does-an-abortion-cost)(An abortion costs up to $750 in the first trimester, and up to $1,500 later in pregnancy. The cost of abortion depends on a few different things about you and your situation. Here are some of the things that can affect how much it costs:\n\n-Your health insurance. \n-Your income and financial support programs available in your area. \n-Where you live. \n-The type of abortion you get. \n-How far along your pregnancy is.) of abortion at Planned Parenthood is covered by a combination of [private donations](https://www.euronews.com/2019/01/24/what-planned-parenthood-how-exactly-it-funded-n955921)(Private donations and grants make up a small share of the nonprofit's funding. These donations help Planned Parenthood maintain its sliding-scale fee system, which allows it to charge for its services based on a patient's income.), non-government health insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: Since donations to Planned Parenthood are [tax-deductible](https://www.weareplannedparenthood.org/onlineactions/2U7UN1iNhESWUfDs4gDPNg2?sourceid=1000063), they [reduce the taxable income](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/tax-credit-vs-tax-deduction)(Tax deductions, on the other hand, reduce how much of your income is subject to taxes. Deductions lower your taxable income by the percentage of your highest federal income tax bracket. So if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction saves you $220.) of donors and thus the total amount of federal tax collected. This redirection of funds constitutes an indirect funding of Planned Parenthood.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: The same is true of donations to many [charities and nonprofit](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-types) organisations. There is no reason to treat Planned Parenthood differently.
1.4.4.2.3. Pro: Medicaid [does not cover](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid)(First implemented in 1977, the Hyde Amendment, which currently forbids the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest, has guided public funding for abortions under the joint federal-state Medicaid programs for low-income people.) abortion in the majority of cases.
1.4.4.3. Con: The original Hyde Amendment allowed exceptions in cases where the mother's life was in danger \([p. 1434](https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-bill/14232/text)(SEC. 209. None of the funds contained in this Act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.)\). The exceptions have since been expanded, and many states now allow the use of federal funds for abortions in cases of [life endangerment, rape, or incest](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid).
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Thirty-three US states and the District of Columbia follow the established [federal guidelines](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid)(33 states and the District of Columbia follow the federal standard and provide abortions in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest.) and provide state funds for abortion in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Seven states go beyond the federal guidelines and also provide funds for abortion in cases of [fetal impairment](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid)(4 of these states also provide state funds for abortions in cases of fetal impairment.) or [serious injury](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid)(4 of these states also provide state funds for abortions that are necessary to prevent grave, long-lasting damage to the person's physical health.) to a person's physical health.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: The exemptions established by the Hyde Amendment should only apply to 5% of all abortions, yet individual state exemptions allow for the public funding of [24% of all abortion costs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2015/10/02/are-american-taxpayers-paying-for-abortion/?sh=68c62836a4bd)(According to a survey by Guttmacher Institute of self-reported reasons for abortions, only 1% of abortions are due to rape and another 1/2% due to incest; 12% are due to mothers reporting "physical problems with my health" although probably only 2.8% represent "life-endangering" situations. So it's fair to say that the vast majority of abortions--more than 95%--would not meet the stringent Hyde Amendment standards.\n...\nAs best I can determine, taxpayers subsidize roughly 24% of all abortion costs in the U.S. with 6.6% borne by federal taxpayers and the remaining 17.4% picked up by state taxpayers. If we apply the 24% figure to the total number of abortions, this is equivalent to taxpayers paying the full cost of 250,000 abortions a year, with about 70,000 financed by federal taxpayers and 180,000 financed by state taxpayers.).
1.4.4.3.2. Con: South Dakota is in violation of the federal law, since it refuses to allow the expanded exceptions and will only provide funding for abortion in cases of [life endangerment](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid).
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: Sixteen states currently go beyond the federal guidelines and allow Medicaid to pay for most medically necessary abortions, 7 of which do so [voluntarily](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid)(16 states have a policy that directs Medicaid to pay for all or most medically necessary abortions.\n\n• 7 of these states provide such funds voluntarily.\n• 9 of these states do so pursuant to a court order.).
1.4.4.3.4. Con: Nine states have been forced to provide state funds for medically necessary abortions by [court orders](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid)(16 states have a policy that directs Medicaid to pay for all or most medically necessary abortions.\n\n• 7 of these states provide such funds voluntarily.\n• 9 of these states do so pursuant to a court order.) after refusing to do so initially.
1.4.4.3.5. Pro: [Rape-related pregnancy](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/understanding-RRP-inUS.html)(• Almost 3 million women in the U.S. experienced RRP during their lifetime.\n• The prevalence of RRP was similar across racial and ethnic groups \(i.e., Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and other non-Hispanic\).) is a pervasive and serious issue for many rape victims.
1.4.4.3.5.1. Pro: Women who have given birth to their rapist's baby have reported how it later negatively affected their relationship with their child \([p. 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288974007_Parenting_an_Infant_Born_of_Rape)(If the infant is experienced as an alien object invading her body there may be a transgenerational transmission of trauma.\n...\nHarmless acts that resonate with the trauma, eg, a mother’s tears, may dysregulate feelings and activate insecure or disorganised attachment behaviours. A denial of the impact of the rape can lead to mothers avoiding intimacy in the relationship with their infant; they encourage early independence. Some mothers transmit difficulties with self esteem, assertion and joyful sexuality.)\).
1.4.4.3.5.1.1. Con: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many victims who have gone on to give birth to their rapist's baby have [happy and fulfilling](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/a-baby-from-rape-is-something-beautiful-from-something-terrible-1.3269157)(One thing that she insists does not remind her of the trauma, however, is her three-year-old son.\n\n“I’ve noticed that women who have had children after rape all say the same thing. They say our children have been healing, they have been light and they have been joy,” she says.) relationships with their child.
1.4.4.3.5.2. Con: Only 1% of those who get abortions report having been raped \([p. 113](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf)(In both surveys, 1% indicated that\nthey had been victims of rape, and less than half a percent said they became pregnant as a result of incest.)\).
1.4.4.3.5.2.1. Con: Women seeking abortion after having been raped often do not report the assault. Research suggests that rape is the most under-reported crime \([p. 2](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf)(More than 90% of sexual assault victims on college campuses do not report the assault.\n\nRape is the most under-reported crime; 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to police.)\).
1.4.4.3.6. Con: The additional exemptions that have been added to the Hyde Amendment have undermined the purpose and integrity of the law \([p. 36](https://weblaw.usc.edu/centers/class/class-workshops/usc-legal-studies-working-papers/documents/03_16_paper.pdf)(Finally, and perhaps most problematically, the law can be morally incoherent. The law is morally incoherent if its various prescriptions and their underlying justifications cannot be subsumed under one coherent moral theory. Or, we could say that in such cases there isn’t a conceivable single rational moral agent whose moral point of view could justify the entire set of prescriptions under consideration.\n\nDworkin asks us to envisage what he calls a ‘checkerboard’ type of legislation which would prescribe, for instance, that abortions are legally permitted for women who were born on even days of the month, and forbidden for women who were born on uneven days. The reason we would find such checkerboard laws unacceptable, Dworkin claims, is because they would violate the integrity of the law.)\). The law should be honoured as written.
1.4.4.4. Con: In his 2022 national budget proposal, President Biden [dropped](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-budget-drops-hyde-amendment-allow-public-funding-abortion-2021-05-28/) the Hyde Amendment, which could reverse the policy for the first time in decades.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: This has attracted criticism from [Republicans](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/biden-health-pick-taking-heat-support-abortion-rights-76219127)(President Joe Biden’s pick for health secretary is taking heat for his defense of abortion rights from Republicans looking to define him as out of the mainstream.\n...\nBecerra is paying a price for defending, as California's attorney general, some of the nation’s most liberal laws and policies on abortion rights. The battle is also a test for abortion opponents.\n...\nDemocrats in Congress don't appear to have the votes to overturn the Hyde Amendment, the term for a series of federal laws that bar taxpayer funding of abortion except in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the woman.) and [religious groups](https://www.catholicsun.org/2021/05/11/bishops-urge-catholics-to-sign-petition-against-hyde-amendments-repeal/)(Diocesan Respect Life coordinators and the Pro-Life Secretariat of the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops are encouraging Catholics to speak out against the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, legislation which bans federal Medicaid funding of abortions.\n\n“It is so important for people in our parishes to learn about the Hyde Amendment and the life-saving, conscience-protecting impact it has had for the past 45 years. Without this protection, our federal tax dollars will contribute to millions more abortions around our nation and beyond,” said Rachel Hendricks, diocesan Respect Life coordinator for the Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey.), and might not make its way into the final budget.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Biden [indicated](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/31/1001881788/bidens-budget-proposal-reverses-a-decades-long-ban-on-abortion-funding)(But he suggested that for low-income women who rely on federal programs, Hyde had become an obstacle to full healthcare access.) that his motivation for dropping the amendment was that it disproportionately affects low-income individuals' access to healthcare.
1.4.4.4.2.1. Pro: The Hyde Amendment [unfairly restricts abortion coverage](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121402281?storyId=121402281)(There have been only sporadic efforts to drop it, but the House and Senate did battle repeatedly over the specific language of the Hyde amendment in the late 1970s and early 1980s. And meanwhile, Hyde-type funding bans were extended to other annual spending bills as well. Eventually, federal abortion funding would be banned in federal worker health plans, women in federal prisons, women in the military, peace corps volunteers and international family planning programs that use non-U.S. funds to perform or advocate for abortion.) for federal workers, women in federal prisons, women in the military, peace corps volunteers, and those who rely on federally funded [Medicaid](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-hyde-amendment-and-coverage-for-abortion-services/) health care.
1.4.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: In 2009, more than half of the women enrolled in Medicaid had incomes [below the poverty level](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-the-hyde-amendment-discriminates-against-poor-women-and-women-of-color/)(Abortion costs between $300 and $950 in the first trimester, making it unaffordable for poor women without insurance coverage. In 2009 more than half of nonelderly adult women enrolled in Medicaid had family incomes below the poverty level; one-quarter had incomes below 50 percent of the poverty level. The monthly income for a family of three living at half the current poverty level is $813.75.). Thus, out-of-pocket abortions are beyond the means of poor women relying on federally funded healthcare.
1.4.4.4.2.2. Con: In 2008, 42% of surveyed women who had an abortion were [poor](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2008)(Most women having abortions \(61%\) already had at least one child, including 34% who had two or more children. n Some 42% of women having abortions were poor, a substantially greater proportion than were poor in 2000 \(27%\).\n\nWomen obtaining abortions in 2008 were less likely than their counterparts in 2000 to be married or to have a religious affiliation, and were more likely than the earlier cohort to have a college degree. These patterns largely reflect changes in the population of all women of reproductive age.): this contradicts the idea that poor women are disproportionately disadvantaged in their access to abortion.
1.4.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Poor women experience unwanted pregnancy at [five times the rate](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-the-hyde-amendment-discriminates-against-poor-women-and-women-of-color/)(Poor women face significant disparities when it comes to reproductive health. Compared with higher-income women, poor women’s rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion are each five times as high, and their unplanned birth rate is six times as high. These disparities are rooted in deeply entrenched inequities in the areas of health-insurance coverage, health care, and medically accurate sex education, as well as other health-promoting resources.) of higher-income women. The disproportionately high percentage of poor women who have abortions is due to disparities in reproductive health, rather than to easier access to abortion.
1.4.4.4.3. Con: Since a Harvard poll in 2016 indicated that 58% of the American public did not support the use of Medicaid funding for abortion services, this move could face backlash, preventing its inclusion into the final budget \([p. 17](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000158-039b-d881-adda-77db04b70000)(Overall, only 36% of likely voters favor allowing Medicaid funding to be used for abortion services, while a majority \(58%\) oppose. Clinton voters are slightly in favor \(57% support, 36% oppose\), while Trump voters are decidedly against \(19% support, 77% oppose\).)\).
1.4.4.5. Pro: Since pregnancy is preventable though the use of adequate [birth control](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-failure-why), and many abortions are considered [elective procedures](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/438/)(Title XIX of the Social Security Act does not require the funding of nontherapeutic abortions as a condition of participation in the Medicaid program established by that Act.\n...\nNothing in the language of Title XIX requires a participating State to fund every medical procedure falling within the delineated categories of medical care. Each State is given broad discretion to determine the extent of medical assistance that is "reasonable" and "consistent with the objectives" of Title XIX. \n...\nAlthough serious statutory questions might be presented if state Medicaid plans did not cover necessary medical treatment, it is not inconsistent with the Act's goals to refuse to fund unnecessary \(though perhaps desirable\) medical services.), funding abortion should not be the responsibility of the state.

1.4.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.4.3.
1.4.4.5.3.

1.4.4.5.4. Con: Birth control pills carry a number of [side effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290196#risks)(The pill may not be safe for people who:\n\n have untreated hypertension\n smoke and are over the age of 35 years\n have a history of heart disease\n have migraine with aura\n have a history of breast cancer or endometrial cancer) and [aren't suitable](https://students.umw.edu/healthcenter/clinics/womens-clinic/who-shouldnt-take-the-pill/)(…there are some medical conditions that exclude women from taking birth control pills, either progesterone only or a combination of estrogen and progesterone.\n...\nYou should not take Combination birth control pills if you have any of the following:\n\n • Blood clots or history of blood clots\n • History of stroke or heart attack\n • Coronary artery disease\n • Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of uterus, cervix, or vagina\n • Unexplained vaginal bleeding\n • Jaundice \(yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin\) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill\n • Liver tumor\n • Known or suspected pregnancy\n • If you plan to have surgery with prolonged bed rest\n • Smoke and have high blood pressure\n • Uncontrolled high blood pressure or Diabetes\n • Have Lupus\n • Migraines with aura\n • Smoke and are over the age of 35\n\nYou should not take Progestin-only birth control pills if you have blood clotting problems that are not successfully being treated.) for all women.
1.4.4.5.4.1. Pro: Birth control pills consist of [synthetic hormones](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-do-birth-control-pills-work)(Birth control pills are synthetic steroid hormones, usually consisting of either a single hormone, progestin, or two hormones, progestin and estrogen. These hormones suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone \(FSH\) and luteinizing hormone \(LH\) from the pituitary gland in the female body. FSH and LH normally trigger the release of estrogen from the ovaries, which in turn stimulates ovulation—the release of a mature egg from the female ovary. However, when FSH and LH are suppressed, the chances of ovulation, and therefore fertilization by a male sperm cell, are significantly reduced. Progestin-only birth control pills also cause mucus in the cervix to thicken, making it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg in the event that ovulation occurs.) that interrupt the normal process of ovulation to reduce the odds of fertilization and as such are associated with a number of [adverse effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430882/)(The most common adverse effect of combined oral contraceptive pills is breakthrough bleeding. Women will also complain of nausea, headaches, abdominal cramping, breast tenderness, and increased vaginal discharge or decreased libido. Nausea can be avoided by taking the medication at night before sleep. The majority of the other consequences will resolve with time or switching OCP to a different preparation.\n\nWomen who have a pre-existing cardiovascular condition or smoke should not use OCs. For the first six months, OC progestogens can impair glucose metabolism in healthy adult women. Women with diabetes mellitus might need to increase insulin intake to regulate blood glucose levels within the desired range. \n\nOral contraceptive pills can cause hypertension in 4-5% of healthy women and exacerbate hypertension in about 9-16% of women with pre-existing hypertension.).
1.4.4.5.4.2. Con: There are [other methods](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11427-birth-control-options)(Intrauterine device \(IUD\)\nDiaphragm\nCervical cap\nFemale condom\nSponge) of birth control available to women for whom hormonal birth control is contraindicated.
1.4.4.5.4.2.1. Con: Alternative forms of birth control may be [less affordable](https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/birth-control/annual-cost-of-birth-control)(The annual cost of birth control can vary from $0 to over $2,000 depending on the type of birth control used.) than the contraceptive pill.
1.4.4.5.5. Con: Treating abortion as an elective procedure is motivated more by [ideology](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-we-should-stop-using-term-elective-abortion/2018-12)(Ultimately, the term elective abortion is moral judgment dressed up as medical judgment. Medical versus elective is code for morally justified versus morally unjustified, as decided by someone other than the patient and her physician. Yet the patients’ rights and medical ethics revolutions of the 1970s were premised on the idea that ordinary people were serious moral thinkers entitled to request or refuse medical care according to their own values, and patients’ expressions of values and priorities in this area of medicine are as worthy of respect as in any other.) than the underlying medicine.
1.4.4.5.6. Con: Even with perfect use, the effectiveness of contraception can be [as low as 92%](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/how-effective-contraception/).
1.4.4.5.6.1. Pro: Even the best contraceptive methods, such as [surgical sterilisation](https://www.medicinenet.com/sterilization_surgical/definition.htm)(Surgical sterilization is a contraceptive option for people who do not want children in the future. It is considered permanent because reversal requires major surgery that is often unsuccessful.), can [fail](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/female-sterilisation/).
1.4.4.5.6.2. Con: Those who use contraception are informed of this in advance \(by way of patient information leaflets\) and therefore, by choosing to have sex regardless, acknowledge and bear responsibility for this risk.
1.4.4.5.6.2.1. Con: Not all pregnancies are a result of an individual [voluntarily choosing to have sex](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/understanding-RRP-inUS.html)(Almost 3 million women in the U.S. experienced RRP \(rape-related pregnancy\) during their lifetime.).
1.4.4.5.6.2.2.

1.4.4.5.6.2.3. Con: Such beliefs perpetuate the notion that pregnancy is a punishment that women must endure for wanting, enjoying, and having sex.
1.4.4.5.6.3. Pro: Birth control pills [are not 100% effective](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/can-i-get-pregnant-if-on-pill)(Birth control pills are considered effective, but not foolproof.
