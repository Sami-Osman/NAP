1.1.1. Pro: A nation should be allowed to have whatever name it wants.
1.1.1.1. Con: A country's name has to be accepted by third party countries as well in order to persist and be [internationally recognised](https://www.euronews.com/2017/10/01/how-do-you-become-an-internationally-recognised-state).

1.1.3. Con: Greece had all right to insist the change, since it was misrepresenting and insulting their history and culture.

1.1.3.1.1. Pro: International [media](http://www.pappaspost.com/nbc-commentators-rewrite-history-opening-ceremony-coverage-claiming-alexander-great-slavic-nation/) [routinely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jed03QfuN8) [confuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Iz4jNS4wC0) North Macedonia with Ancient Macedonia, a confusion that the country had [deliberately sought to encourage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquization).
1.1.3.1.2. Con: National Macedonians [consider themselves](https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/eu-envoy-apologises-for-calling-macedonians-slavs/) [descendants](https://www.ft.com/content/11034b1e-54ef-11dd-ae9c-000077b07658) of the ancient Macedonian civilisation.

1.4.1.1. Pro: The name is strongly associated with an [existing province of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(Greece\)). Using this term "Macedonia" as the country's name implies a territorial interest in annexing this region.

1.4.3. Pro: The region of Macedonia [spans six countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(region\)#Boundaries_and_definitions), and for any one country to claim this name for its own national identity is to culturally appropriate the heritage of an entire region.
1.4.3.1. Pro: North Macedonia comprises only around 38% of the land area and around [44% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_North_Macedonia) of the [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_\(region\)#Boundaries_and_definitions).
