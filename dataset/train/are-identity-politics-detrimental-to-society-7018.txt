Discussion Name: Are identity politics detrimental to society?

1. Identity politics are detrimental to society.
1.1. Pro: Identity politics harm political progress on a variety of other important issues.
1.1.1. Pro: Universal issues should be addressed before issues that only affect specific social groups, so as to help the most people possible and reduce overall suffering.
1.1.1.1. Con: As a universal approach to political issues is blind to deeply entrenched, historical, and systemic oppression, it only works in societies where people are already on an equal footing.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Had previous social movements followed the logic of prioritising universal issues, they would have had to arbitrarily sacrifice achievable goals and would have likely gained very little.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Prioritising issues that affect more people would imply that [American civil rights marchers](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/selma-montgomery-march) should have put off their fight for equality in order to focus on [Vietnam War protests](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/vietnam-war-protests).
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Universal changes tend to benefit marginalized groups more so than other groups.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: New public services tend to be [especially beneficial](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/04/transport-us-antiracism/)(Even when a Black and White household has similar levels of wealth, local studies conducted in cities such as Detroit suggest the Black household is still more likely to have to travel further to get food. In Los Angeles, White neighbourhoods have three times the number of grocery stores of Black neighbourhoods. The consequences include obesity and diet-related diseases with Black individuals being twice as likely as White individuals to have diabetes. All these issues are interconnected. Studies show that 24 jobs get created for every 10,000 square feet of retail grocery space while a large market, like a typical Whole Foods store with 25,000 to 50,000 square feet, can see up to 200 jobs created in the vicinity.) for the poorest and those furthest from economic centers. Given that marginalized people tend to be the poorest in society, they benefit the most.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: If societal improvements were universally applied, marginalised groups would likely benefit less than privileged groups due to [structural discrimination](http://www.cfor.info/structural-discrimination-and-structural-racism/)(Structural racism is not out there somewhere – in the ‘bad people’ or overtly racist individuals and organisations. It is not about individual acts of prejudice or racism. Rather, it is more subtle and pervasive, embedded in all of our interactions – These systemic dynamics recur at every level of interaction. You can find dynamics of white supremacy inside your own mind; or in relationship; in your organisation; in your neighbourhood or community; in your identity group, as well as embedded throughout the institutions of our broader society, such as the media, criminal justice system, educational systems, political systems and more.).
1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Accusations of structural discrimination are often exaggerated; for example, [Ibram X. Kendi's work](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/06/ibram-x-kendi-definition-of-antiracist#:~:text=Racism%20itself%20is%20institutional%2C%20structural%2C%20and%20systemic.) has demonstrated [confirmation bias](https://areomagazine.com/2020/06/16/three-common-fallacies-in-arguments-about-systemic-racism/#:~:text=Kendi%3A%20As%20an%20anti%2Dracist%2C%20when%20I%20see%20racial%20disparities%2C%20I%20see%20racism.%20But%20I%20know%20for%20many%20racist%20Americans%2C%20when%20they%20see%20racial%20disparities%20they%20see%20black%20inferiority.)(Kendi: As an anti-racist, when I see racial disparities, I see racism. But I know for many racist Americans, when they see racial disparities they see black inferiority.\nKendi relies on confirmation bias and will castigate anyone who proposes alternative explanations as a racist. The latter mindset has poisoned public discourse.) and [cherry picking](https://www.city-journal.org/how-to-be-an-antiracist#:~:text=Kendi%20also%20cherry,War%20on%20Racism.)(Kendi also cherry-picks his data when discussing race and health. He laments that blacks are more likely than whites to have Alzheimer’s disease, but neglects to mention that whites are more likely to die from it, according to the latest mortality data from the Center for Disease Control. In the same vein, he correctly notes that blacks are more likely than whites to die of prostate cancer and breast cancer, but does not include the fact that blacks are less likely than whites to die of esophageal cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and leukemia. Of course, it should not be a competition over which race is more likely to die of which disease––but that’s precisely my point. By selectively citing data that show blacks suffering more than whites, Kendi turns what should be a unifying, race-neutral battle ground––namely, humanity’s fight against deadly diseases––into another proxy battle in the War on Racism.).
1.1.1.2. Con: The policies that identity politics advocates support tend to benefit entire societies, even if they emphasize the importance of such policies for specific marginalized groups.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Identity politics have been used to [give excess privileges](https://theconversation.com/are-identity-politics-emancipatory-or-regressive-94434)(In this context, claims of indigeneity or autochthony are often used, not to challenge inherited forms of hierarchy and exclusion, but rather to consolidate them: to permanently relegate “outsiders” from other parts of the country to a second-class status, thereby perpetuating relations of enmity and exclusion, rather than building more inclusive relations of democratic citizenship.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, for example, Indonesian politicians have singled out Chinese as being “not indigenous” and therefore as not really to be trusted. The Myanmar military and many Buddhist figures have justified the oppression of Rohingyas on \(false\) grounds that they are foreigners who should to “return” to Bangladesh.) and status to non-marginalized groups throughout history.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: White supremacy has been increasingly [normalised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/the-white-flight-of-derek-black/2016/10/15/ed5f906a-8f3b-11e6-a6a3-d50061aa9fae_story.html)(Now Derek spoke in Memphis about the future of their ideology. “The Republican Party has to be either demolished or taken over,” he said. “I’m kind of banking on the Republicans staking their claim as the white party.”... “Years from now, we will look back on this,” he said. “The great intellectual move to save white people started today.”) in American politics due to right-wing identity politics.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Privileged groups seldom have to use identity politics as their existence is not [questioned and belittled](https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/brutally-honest-quotes-from-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/)(“If her functioning as a female is not enough to define woman, if we decline also to explain her through “the eternal feminine,” and if nevertheless, we admit, provisionally, that women do exist, then we must face the question: what is a woman? . . . The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say, ”I am a woman”; on this truth must be based all further discussion.”) as it is for the marginalised.
1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Though [racialisation](https://bostonreview.net/articles/minkah-makalani-cedric-robinson-and-origins-race/)(Capitalism and racism . . . did not break from the old order but rather evolved from it to produce a modern world system of ‘racial capitalism’ dependent on slavery, violence, imperialism, and genocide. Capitalism was ‘racial’ not because of some conspiracy to divide workers or justify slavery and dispossession, but because racialism had already permeated Western feudal society. The first European proletarians were racial subjects \(Irish, Jews, Roma or Gypsies, Slavs, etc.\) and they were victims of dispossession \(enclosure\), colonialism, and slavery within Europe. Indeed, Robinson suggested that racialization within Europe was very much a colonial process involving invasion, settlement, expropriation, and racial hierarchy.) and othering was recurrent in colonial expansion, this was not leveraged to gain rights for the majority, but rather justify exploitation and oppression.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Proposals to slash police funding and invest more heavily in communities would have significant benefits in [poorer, underfunded areas](https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/6-reasons-why-its-time-to-defund-police)(U.S. cities collectively spend $100 billion a year on policing, while needed investments in education, health care, housing, and other critical programs go unfulfilled, particularly in poor communities and communities of color. New York City, for instance, spends more on policing than it does on the Departments of Health, Homeless Services, Housing Preservation and Development, and Youth and Community Development combined.) inhabited by ethnic majorities as well.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Feminist policies, stemming from identity politics, can improve [public health](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2020/08/feminism-good-health/)(Across the world, countries headed by women and representing diverse cultures—from Germany, Norway, and Finland, to Taiwan, New Zealand, and Namibia—have managed the crisis more effectively, with fewer fatalities and less livelihood loss than others. But what distinguishes these health winners is not just the female shape of their leaders but the feminist shape of their societies. Even more gender-balanced societies headed by men—like Canada—do better in health crises than their less equitable peers like the United States. On the other hand, the most patriarchal countries headed by regressive strongmen do worse at every level of development. Today, we see this in Brazil, which until recently had managed health crises well under less masculinist leadership.) for all, even if feminists focus primarily on women.
1.1.1.2.4. Con: The quotas used in affirmative action artificially create diversity in favour of specific groups at the [expense](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11682950/fisher-supreme-court-white-women-affirmative-action)(But the battle to erase race from the application review process for admission comes with an interesting paradox: "The primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been Euro-American women," wrote Columbia University law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw for the University of Michigan Law Review in 2006.\n\nA 1995 report by the California Senate Government Organization Committee found that white women held a majority of managerial jobs \(57,250\) compared with African Americans \(10,500\), Latinos \(19,000\), and Asian Americans \(24,600\) after the first two decades of affirmative action in the private sector. In 2015, a disproportionate representation of white women business owners set off concerns that New York state would not be able to bridge a racial gap among public contractors.) of others.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Identity politics promote individualism by removing barriers to individual liberties. This does not benefit society, as major [structural changes are necessary](https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/structural-change-needed-community-development-1502488615.html)(It is very difficult to consider community as a homogeneous entity. Collective action of the people is an exception, not rule. Participation is not possible in an environment where resources are scarce and benefits limited. Under such circumstances the poor see themselves as competitors and instead of cooperation seek patronage.\n\nHere comes the role of politicians who work as patrons. Politicians seek clients among the poor to remain in power and instead of taking up the cause of the poor they only do some symbolic service. Thus despite all efforts of the last so many decades, the problem of poverty remains very serious. What is required to be done to tackle poverty is to bring structural change rather than symbolic services.) to improve the world and empower the oppressed.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: [Intersectionality](https://www.law.columbia.edu/news/archive/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality-more-two-decades-later)(Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here, and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.), a concept commonly used in identity politics, logically moves towards individualism, since there are an infinite number of groups that one can associate with.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Even among individuals of the same group identity combination, one can always find an additional group identity they do not share.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Intersectionality cannot promote individualism as it is a system level analytical tool that examines how different forms of oppression interact and manifest unique harms.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Feelings of oppression stemming from identity categories are subjective. Two Black lesbian truck drivers might have different experiences of what parts of their identity oppresses them and how.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Individualism is exacerbated by [neoliberal](https://www.sociologylens.net/topics/crime-and-deviance/neoliberalism-individualism-ego-violence/11193)(When it comes to individualization, this idea is one of the fundamental aspects of neoliberalism. In fact, Bauman \(2000:34\) argues that in neoliberal states “individualization is a fate, not a choice.” As Amable \(2011\) explains, neoliberals have realized that in order for their ideology to be successful, a state’s populace must internalize the belief that individuals are only to be rewarded based on their personal effort. With such an ego-driven focus, Scharff \(2011\) explains that the process of individualization engenders a climate where structural inequalities are converted into individual problems. That is, neoliberalism surmises that anyone can overcome obstacles if only they work hard enough. Similarly, Brown \(2003\) describes how neoliberal policies place a moral component on success. By insisting that only the immoral fail to achieve success, this concept permits and even encourages a society to blame the poor for their suffering.) politics that disregard the collective. As identity politics place emphasis on groups, they have less of this effect.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Advocates of identity politics often prioritize and celebrate the collective and emphasise the importance of cultural histories \([pp. 542-543](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.884.5159&rep=rep1&type=pdf)(The adoption of the kilt and the tartan as symbols of Scottish tradition depended on there being clothing similar to these in Scottish history; but also because Scottish home rule has been on the agenda for Scotland for some time beyond\nthe popularization of this tradition by British industrialists and military. The rediscovery of Masada as an important historical representation for Jews coincided with the creation\nof the state of Israel and its need for national symbols...\nWhile there is often substantial agreement on what constitutes the major events and figures of history, research has shown there is also substantial contestation over their meaning and relevance to current events. For example, disagreement over the meaning and constitution of history has been documented in New Zealand, where a previously colonized group \(Maori\) is engaged in a movement to generate a cultural renaissance and gain self-determination.)\). This produces community, not individualism.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: Individualism is the most sensible moral framework to operate under. Given this, identity politics advances society by encouraging its adoption.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: It may be correct to take a [solipsistic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-i-know-im-not-the-only-conscious-being-in-the-universe/)(The solipsism problem prevents us from verifying or falsifying these and other claims. I cannot be certain that you are conscious, let alone a jellyfish, bot or doorknob. As long as we lack what neuroscientist Christof Koch has called a consciousness meter—a device that can measure consciousness in the same way that a thermometer measures temperature—theories of consciousness will remain in the realm of pure speculation.) view of the world, as you are the only person that you can prove exists.
1.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Trusting others and prioritising group interests can easily lead to one being [exploited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free_rider_problem.asp). To reduce the likelihood of being taken advantage of, everyone should look after themselves.
1.1.1.3.3.3. Con: Individualism only works if everyone is and remains equal. As power is easily consolidated, people can quickly be exploited, creating a harm that cannot be ameliorated without group cohesion.
1.1.1.3.4. Pro: Even if an individual is perfectly free to choose what they like, they may be constrained by the norms of their society, pushing them towards supporting harmful actions and values.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Governments have limited resources, so policy-making [requires trade-offs](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2104360)(Meanwhile, local health care systems are increasingly intervening to influence social determinants of health, such as housing. The increasing centrality of health care systems in the provision of health care and social services may come with trade-offs. For example, whereas health care organizations have more financial resources than public health and social service agencies, they may be less effective or less efficient in addressing social determinants of health than those agencies, which may have more knowledge and practical expertise in upstream drivers of health. Understanding how these trade-offs inform optimal allocation of scarce societal resources will be critical to improving population health, particularly in marginalized populations. Discussions of trade-offs must recognize the fact that policymakers may assign widely varying weights to specific benefits and harms in their decision making \(e.g., ongoing debates over school closures during the pandemic\).) to be made. Dealing with a large array of different issues can reduce the capacity for effective change across the board.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Some groups are considered the default conception of humanity \([p. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/April-Bailey-2/publication/326451862_Is_Man_the_Measure_of_All_Things_A_Social_Cognitive_Account_of_Androcentrism/links/5ba50c2345851574f7dd0396/Is-Man-the-Measure-of-All-Things-A-Social-Cognitive-Account-of-Androcentrism.pdf)(Yet everyday experiences seem to be replete with men being taken as the common standard, or “the measure of all things.” The term androcentrism is used to describe this specific form of gender bias entailing the “privileging of male\nexperience and the ‘otherizing’ of female experience”. The present review focuses on the psychological\ncauses of androcentrism.)\). This is vital to push back against by discussing identity politics, making sure minorities are not consistently traded-off.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Since [doing nothing](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-politics-of-doing-nothing/)(A more recent line of exploration is the policy inaction or ‘the politics of doing nothing’ – an absence of action that can arise despite the availability of plausible interventions and often while a government is simultaneously claiming it is doing ‘everything it can’. The authors identify five types of policy inaction:\n\n Calculated: inaction that is deliberate, strategic and tactical such as awaiting the availability of critical evidence.\n Ideological: inaction arising from stances about the role of the state versus other mechanisms of public problem-solving.\n Imposed: inaction arising from a lack of power, such as inadequate political, financial or legal leverage.\n Reluctant: inaction rooted in the unavailability of resources, manpower or other inputs.\n Inadvertent: inaction arising from the failure of policy makers to comprehend the data and information available to them.) is often a viable strategy for governance, it is better that parties are encouraged to take on a small slate of issues. This makes accountability easier as scrutiny is applied to only a few areas.
1.1.2. Con: Universal issues, like climate change, and identity-based issues [can and should be tackled together](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-climate-feminism)(“The climate crisis is not gender neutral,” says Katharine K. Wilkinson, coeditor of the anthology All We Can Save: Truth, Courage, and Solutions for the Climate Crisis, a book of essays and poems written entirely by women contributors. “It grows out of a patriarchal system that is also entangled with racism and white supremacy and extractive capitalism. And the unequal impacts of climate change are making it harder to achieve a gender-equal world.”). Otherwise, neither set of concerns will be meaningfully improved.
1.1.2.1. Con: When majority groups think that issues are more likely to affect minorities than themselves, they may [disregard](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/study-covids-racial-disparities-made-white-people-less-vigilant-virus-rcna22613)(A new study from the school’s psychology department published in Social Science & Medicine, found that white people surveyed in the United States in fall 2020 cared less and were even more likely to shun pandemic safety precautions after learning about the disproportionate ways it impacts Black communities and other communities of color. \n\n“When white people in the U.S. were more aware of racial disparities in Covid-19, they were less fearful of Covid-19,” said Allison Skinner-Dorkenoo, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Georgia and co-author of the study. “We found evidence of less empathy for people who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and we also found evidence of reduced support for safety precautions to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”) key actions that reduce harm for everyone. This may make it harmful to intertwine universal and identity-based advocacy.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Accounting for marginalised groups within universal advocacy does not have to look like emphasising their vulnerability, but rather could be done by crafting race and gender aware policy.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: In the US, Black people were more likely to die due to COVID-19 when their area had a higher prevalence of racist attitudes \([p. 10](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242044&type=printable)(Put another way, a high percentage\nof Black residents is more likely to be associated with COVID-19 cases under some conditions \(i.e., high levels of explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes\) than others... it is possible that county-level racial attitudes are reflective of systemic forms of racism. From this perspective, racial attitudes captured at the aggregate level represent the bias of crowds and are emblematic of deeper biases that are embedded into systems within society. From this perspective, collective racial attitudes might give rise to racially\nbiased societal arrangements, including those in the area of religion, business, education, criminal justice, and of particular importance to this study, healthcare.)\), demonstrating the need to connect anti-racist action with public health campaigns.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Under some [utilitarian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/consequentialism_1.shtml)(Consequentialism is based on two principles:\n\n Whether an act is right or wrong depends only on the results of that act\n The more good consequences an act produces, the better or more right that act\n\nIt gives us this guidance when faced with a moral dilemma:\n\n A person should choose the action that maximises good consequences\n\nAnd it gives this general guidance on how to live:\n\n People should live so as to maximise good consequences) theories, if it benefits more people in the long-run to do so, this is the ethical position to take. Thus, it may be necessary to unlink universal issues from identity politics movements.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Many issues are deeply interlinked and contribute to one another, meaning that it is necessary to deal with them concurrently.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Class and race are [deeply](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/15/485835272/the-driving-life-and-death-of-philando-castile)("What Mr. Castile symbolizes for a lot of us working in public defense is that driving offenses are typically just crimes of poverty," says Erik Sandvick, a public defender in Ramsey County, which includes St. Paul and its suburbs...\n\n"It is in particular a way that people of color and the poor are victimized on a daily basis," Gonzalez Van Cleve said.\n\nMany times, both Gonzalez Van Cleve and Sandvick agree, the system leaves citizens with no good choices — having to pick, for instance, whether to pay a fine or pay for car insurance.) interlinked \([p. 35](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1382&context=asc_papers)(“Race is the modality in which class is lived” ~Hall et al., 1978, p. 394.\n\nThat’s how Stuart Hall evocatively put it, emphasizing the extent to which class relations can actually and substantively “function as race relations” for working class Black Brits \(and others\). He was arguing, amongst other things, against the neatly reified distinctions scholars traditionally policed between class-based analyses and racial ones. It is easy enough to proclaim that social identities are “articulated categories,” to repeat, ad nauseum, that they are all mutually constitutive and just about impossible to practically disentangle. However, it is quite another thing to construct a social\nscientific research project that aptly demonstrates the significance of such ineluctable imbrications.)\). Avoiding tackling the former in pursuit of the latter, therefore, allows harms to both to persist.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Climate change is also a [racial justice](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/why-is-climate-change-a-racial-justice-issue/)(Why Is Climate Change a Racial Justice Issue? 3 Things to Know\n\n Climate change interacts with and worsens existing inequalities in society that are often shaped by racism.\n Climate action requires an intersectional approach that takes into account the most impacted communities.\n Scientists, environmentalists, and racial justice advocates agree that the best way to overcome the climate crisis is by empowering and listening to Indigenous communities.) issue, as its impacts are especially severe for marginalized races and those with less global power.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: Motivating action on universal issues with explicit reference to marginalised groups may encourage the continued use of categories that identity politics seeks to abolish.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Identity politics are antithetical to abolishing oppressive categories as advocates rely on them to garner legitimacy and, thus, cannot present the world without them \([p. 1](https://www.unige.ch/etudes-genre/files/1114/0316/9732/coalition.pdf)(For this reason, her antifoundationalism appears as a critical practice that seeks not only to rethink the political – along with genders, bodies, subjects and agency – in terms of performativity rather than of representation, but also, and most importantly, to theorize alternatives to identity\npolitics in terms of coalition building.)\).
1.1.2.2.3.2. Con: People often [value](https://criticalmediaproject.org/why-identity-matters/)(Identity is a socially and historically constructed concept. We learn about our own identity and the identity of others through interactions with family, peers, organizations, institutions, media and other connections we make in our everyday life.\nKey facets of identity—like gender, social class, age, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, religion, age and disability—play significant roles in determining how we understand and experience the world, as well as shaping the types of opportunities and challenges we face.) categories that are used to distinguish them from others; erasing these could be harmful as people lose part of their identity.
1.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Feminists that support women-only spaces ultimately idealize and reinforce gender binaries that [harm](https://www.bustle.com/p/4-ways-women-only-spaces-can-be-anti-feminist-even-when-they-dont-mean-to-be-32798)(Spaces designated for women aren't inherently bad, but they do have a long history of being problematic. Take, for example, the controversy surrounding the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, which ran from 1976 through 2015: The festival faced accusations of being trans-exclusionary, in response to which founder and organizer Lisa Vogel wrote in an open letter in 2014. Although Vogel maintained in the letter that the festival's intention was "not a policy, or a ban on anyone" and stated that "trans womyn and transmen have always attended this gathering," she also wrote, "This space, for this week, is intended to be for womyn who were born female, raised as girls and who continue to identify as womyn."...\n\nIt's also worth noting in the discussion of women-only spaces that non-binary people — those who don't identify exclusively as men or women — are rarely mentioned.) the oppressed and contribute to sexist ideologies.
1.1.2.3. Pro: It is possible to address universal and social issues simultaneously; the advancement of women's education \([p. 3](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08b98e5274a31e0000c56/Aslam_etal_Girls_edu.pdf)(Overall female enrollment at the primary level in low-income countries has accordingly grown from 87 percent in 1990 to 94 percent in 2004, considerably shrinking the gender gap. This progress is the result of recognition of the centrality of girls’ education in development and the overall progress made under the Education for All \(EFA\) agenda. Making girls’ education a high priority and implementing a range of interventions - including scholarships, stipends, conditional cash transfers, female teacher recruitment, and gender-targeted provision of materials - have proved effective in increasing the enrollment of girls in school.)\) and global health demonstrates this \([p. 1](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/376/bmj-2021-068208.full.pdf)(Life expectancy at age 70 has continued to rise globally, mostly because of decreases in chronic\ndiseases. Adults aged ≥70 living in high income countries and regions with better healthcare access and quality were found to experience the highest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Disability\nburden, however, remained constant, suggesting the need to enhance public health and intervention programmes to improve wellbeing among older adults.)\).
1.1.2.3.1. Con: As feminist progress can be limited by [gender fatigue](https://odi.org/en/insights/gender-fatigue-what-can-we-do-to-overcome-it/)(There is a growing concern in academic and practitioner circles alike that 12 years after the lofty optimism of the 1995 UN Beijing Conference on Women we have reached a state of ‘gender fatigue’. The energy of global women’s movements appears to be waning; gender mainstreaming initiatives have not lived up to expectations; and donor and government funding for gender equality remains static or in some cases is even in decline, despite the fact that a significant number of countries are off-track in terms of meeting the Millennium Development Goal on gender empowerment.), entwining critical issues with identity politics could be detrimental to change.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Even if change is slower, ensuring that policies do not cause or compound sexism improves society, especially as bureaucratic norms can endure for long periods of time \([p. 60](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-anthro-101819-110147)(Advancing Weber’s observation that, once in place, bureaucracies will do everything to ensure their own reproduction, the late David Graeber \(2015\) further proposed that ours is the “age of ‘total bureaucratization’”, where infinite aspects of existence are policed through a melding of private- and public-sector rules that together form “the iron law of liberalism”. Bureaucracy is now such an all-encompassing cultural form, says Graeber, that it has stopped being critically analyzed: “It’s as if, as a planetary civilization, we have decided to clap our hands over our ears and start humming whenever the topic comes up”. While we were blanking, bureaucratic formations exploded.

1.1.3.

As the University of California, Berkeley, law professor and leading scholar on race Ian Haney-López observed as we discussed the motives behind this framing, mainstream Democrats, like Republicans, “are funded by large donors. Of course they’re concerned about the interests of the top 1 percent.” It’s almost as if the real agenda here isn’t ending racism, but deterring well-meaning liberals from policies that would upset the Democratic Party’s financial base. \n\nThe cruel irony is that, as much as it wouldn’t have ended racism, breaking up the banks and properly regulating them would have a positive effect on the economic, and consequently, the social status of black and Hispanic Americans.

Disproportionately. But this is also race and economics merged together on this issue,” Sanders says. “The reason people are in jail and they can’t afford their bail is because they are poor. So, yeah, you can argue this is a race issue. It disproportionately impacts minorities. That’s true. But it’s also an economic issue in a sense that if you are a poor, white person, you’re gonna be in the same position.”...\nSimply put: Racism is not a byproduct of being poor.

These policies lie inside the Overton Window. Other policy ideas exist, but politicians risk losing popular support if they champion these ideas. These policies lie outside the Overton Window.) and centre minorities in political debates.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: It is possible to [draw attention](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/02/how-can-democrats-connect-identity-politics-to-economics.html)(In the wake of the 2016 election, the Roosevelt Institute’s team wanted to return to the question of economic injustice, this time applying a racial \(and gendered\) lens to the questions of how American disparities have been built and why they thrive. The Hidden Rules of Race takes issue with universalist economic fixes alone as progressive panacea, instead examining the web of often invisible racialized and gendered obstacles to opportunity faced by millions of Americans, obstacles with roots as far back as Bacon’s Rebellion of 1676, which prompted the calcifying of the racial caste system of slavery, the institution on which the country’s economy, politics, and infrastructure were built.) to class issues using the lenses of gender and race.

1.1.3.1.2.

1.1.3.1.2.1.

1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Not all groups [experience inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/05/what-is-misogynoir)(The term was coined in 2010 by gay black feminist American academic Moya Bailey, who defined it “to describe the particular brand of hatred directed at black women in American visual and popular culture”.\n\nSince then black women – and some men – predominantly on social media, have taken ownership of the term, using it to describe prejudice experienced in a range of contexts.\n\n“Misogynoir provides a racialised nuance that mainstream feminism wasn’t catching,” says black feminist commentator, Feminista Jones. “We are talking about misogyny, yes, but there is a specific misogyny that is aimed at black women and is uniquely detrimental to black women.”) in the same way. In order to ensure equality for all, societies need to address those issues specifically.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Class-based discrimination is a core determinant of other forms of oppression yet is sidelined by identity politics advocates. Identity politics, therefore, force people's attention away from more effective advocacy.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: It is [unlikely](http://signsjournal.org/currents-identity-politics/walters/)(When we say “women’s rights are human rights,” we implode the assumption of an unmarked maleness that cannot be named. Further, today’s identity politics—drawing from the collective self-making of both civil rights organizing and feminist consciousness-raising—insists on its own definitions and mores. As distinct from interest groups as objects to be targeted, the social movements formed in and through identity politics do not signify a cordoned-off minority to be addressed. Rather, they assert a fundamental challenge to both white male hegemony and the relentless process of marking and unmarking that has allowed “identity” to be only located in those who have been actively denied citizenship and subjectivity. Contemporary identity politics—in its most robust manifestations—offers up a critique of what constitutes “mainstream,” what “issues” get attached to what bodies, and the hierarchies that result from that attachment.) that group-specific issues would be addressed by a class-based movement as the oppression those other groups face is often normalised.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Many contemporary racist tropes stem from colonialism, where great powers created and leveraged them to justify the [economic exploitation](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/08/european-racism-africa-slavery)(For much of the period from the 15th century till now, during which Europeans and Africans have been connected through trade, empire and migration, both forced and voluntary, Europe has viewed the people of Africa through the distorting veil of racism and racial theory. In the British case much of the jumble of stereotypes, pseudo-science and wild conjecture that coalesced to form racism arose from the political battles fought over the slave trade and slavery, during the last decades of the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th. The men who set out to defend slavery assembled a vast arsenal of new claims and old theories about black people, which they then codified, refined and disseminated through books, pamphlets, cartoons and speeches.) of other groups.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: Without considering elements like race or gender, movements that combat class-based discrimination can often remain [sexist](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/03/gmb-union-institutionally-sexist-inquiry-finds)(One of Britain’s biggest trade unions has been described as “institutionally sexist” in a highly critical independent report.\n\nThe GMB union, whose general secretary, Tim Roache, stood down this year following anonymous allegations of misconduct, needs “fundamental change”, the inquiry by the barrister Karon Monaghan QC concludes.\n\n“Bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment are endemic within the GMB,” the report says. “The culture in the GMB is one of heavy drinking and late-night socialising, salacious gossip and a lack of professionalism.”\n\nThe report covers the last decade, 2010 to 2020, and Monaghan interviewed three former general secretaries of the union, the third biggest in the UK with 620,000 members.\n\nMonaghan said women were “underrepresented throughout the GMB’s ranks”, with branches “often organised in a way that deters women members’ participation”.) and/or [racist](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1913/06/the-negro-and-the-labor-unions/529524/)(One does not have to go far to discover the reason for this. In several instances Negroes are expressly excluded from membership in the unions. In other cases individual Negroes have been refused admittance to unions where no such restrictions existed, and have been in consequence shut out from employment at their trades.\n\nFor this and other reasons, Negroes, who have been shut out, or believed they had been shut out, of employment by the unions, have been in the past very willing strike-breakers. It is another illustration of the way in which prejudice works, also, that the strikers seemed to consider it a much greater crime for a Negro, who had been denied an opportunity to work at his trade, to take the place of a striking employee than it was for a white man to do the same thing.).
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Racism and gender-based discrimination often [intersects](https://www.nlc.org/article/2020/09/03/a-beginners-guide-to-intersectionality/)(Racism benefits White people while harming Black, Indigenous and People of Color. Wealthy people benefit from classism while classism harms poor people. Cisgender men benefit from sexism and patriarchy while these systems harm women, femmes, trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people. Heteronormativity benefits straight people while harming Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Agender, Pansexual, Genderqueer, and Asexual \(LGBTQIA+\) people and communities. Non-disabled people benefit from ableism, which creates inequities for disabled people. \n\nThese systems of power and oppression do not operate independently and individually. People who experience harm based on their identity in one or more of these systems face increased oppression of each of these systems compounded together. Accounting for this compound oppression – at the intersection of race, class, gender, sexuality and ability – is called intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989.) with classism. Yet identity politics movements ignore this which can lead groups in similar class positions to be in conflict with one another.
1.1.3.3. Con: Making meaningful change often starts with small-scale action. Identity politics is useful, insofar as it encourages intersectional thinking that makes grassroots organising more egalitarian and effective \([p. 4](https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_C85BA77A1870.P001/REF.pdf)(As this worker suggests, the adoption of intersectionality also encourages officers in these organizations to acknowledge their privileged social position within the organization and in society at large. In this process, they have to relinquish their identity as experts\nin order to embrace more egalitarian relationships with the women they welcome.\nAdopting intersectionality as part of their toolkit has thus impacted some of their organizational practices, generating new ways of thinking and doing and integrating “topics like immigration and racism in every activity we do,” as an officer in a women’s centre stated\nduring her interview)\).
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Increasingly, Black women spearhead intersectional environmental movements to [give greater voices to](https://www.greenhouse.agency/blog/centering-and-celebrating-black-environmentalists-by-reclaiming-our-time/)(Reclaiming Our Time is a grassroots campaign rewriting the current narrative.

As Black Lives Matter \(BLM\) protests spread around the world in response to George Floyd’s murder, and as Edward Colston’s statue was toppled to highlight Britain’s lack of accountability towards its colonial past, the novelist’s choice to use her substantial platform to reignite the debate on trans rights appeared highly insensitive and a product of her current class and race privilege. Alyosxa Tudor asks “How bored and annoyed must JK Rowling be that she thinks the perfect moment in which she can reheat her \[…\] comments is the height of Black Lives Matter?” \(emphasis mine\).

Compared to their less self-aware peers, they could better detect negative emotions in the students who had just given a speech.\n\n“Emotional clarity and cognitive empathy may be associated because both constructs involve identifying and describing emotional experiences—of oneself for emotional clarity and of others for cognitive empathy,” write researcher Nathaniel Eckland and his colleagues.).
1.2.1.1. Pro: Those who reject identity politics often resort to the most punitive types of politics. This could be combatted by humanising policy-making through direct reference to the affected communities who would be helped if the policy was passed.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: For those opposing identity politics, [offensive comments](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/03/21/owning-the-libs-history-trump-politics-pop-culture-477203)(Rep.

1.2.1.1.3. Con: It is not apparent that identity politics result in increased empathy among groups, particularly since they focus on the [separation](https://iai.tv/articles/the-identity-politics-trap-auid-1807)(This is crucial to understanding how ‘identity’ functions in real social contexts. For there to be difference, things have to exclude other things, and in social contexts exclusion is liable to involve types of oppression. At the same time, however, assertion of a group identity can also be a form of resistance, of refusing to be swallowed by ideas which claim universality without actually providing it, such as ‘All lives matter’.) of identity categories rather than on building kinship.
1.2.1.2.

Empathy has certain design features that do make it positive in certain restricted circumstances. If you and I are the only people on earth and you’re in pain and I can help you and make your pain go away, and I feel empathy toward you and so I make your life better, empathy has done something good. But the real world is nowhere near as simple. Empathy’s design failings have to do with the fact that it acts like a spotlight. It zooms you in.

It entails, as Katie Krimer, a licensed clinical social worker describes it, “meta-cognition: the ability to think about thinking \[and\] implies the ability to recognize ourselves as we see ourselves, but also to understand how others may see us based on what we know about human behavior.”) by teaching them about the world and the challenges others face.

According to Singer’s results, among test subjects who underwent empathy training, “negative affect was increased in response to both people in distress and even to people in everyday life situations. . . . these findings underline the belief that engaging in empathic resonance is a highly aversive experience and, as such, can be a risk factor for burnout.”) they may burn out, meaning that they can only create short-term change.
1.2.1.2.3.

1.2.1.2.4. Con: The scope of someone's empathy is [reflective](https://theconversation.com/does-empathy-have-limits-72637)(There is evidence that we choose where to set the limits of empathy. For example, whereas people usually feel less empathy for multiple victims \(versus a single victim\), this tendency reverses when you convince people that empathy won’t require costly donations of money or time. Similarly, people show less empathy for mass suffering when they think their helping won’t make any difference or impact, but this pattern goes away when they think they can make a difference.\n\nThis tendency also varies depending on an individual’s moral beliefs. For instance, people who live in “collectivist cultures,” such as Bedouin individuals, do not feel less empathy for mass suffering. This is perhaps because people in such cultures value the suffering of the collective.) of their moral beliefs; if they are encouraged to take a collectivist view, as advocated by identity politics, they may empathise with more people.

1.2.2. Pro: Identity politics encourage political parties and social movements to take undemocratic actions.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Identity politics promote [votebanks](https://www.definitions.net/definition/votebank)(Votebank \(also spelled vote-bank or vote bank\), in the political discourse of India, is a term referring to a loyal bloc of voters from a single community, who consistently back a certain candidate or political formation in democratic elections. Such behavior is often the result of an expectation of benefits, whether real or imagined, from the political formations, often at the cost of other communities. Votebank politics is the practice of creating and maintaining votebanks through divisive policies. As it encourages voting on the basis of self-interest of certain groups, often against their better judgement, it is considered harmful to the principles of representative democracy.) and unwavering political support for parties, both of which undermine democracy.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Existing parties which do not prioritize identity politics, such as the [Labour Party and the Conservative Party](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/12/20/britains-election-and-the-deepening-generational-divide) in the UK, already have ardent and inflexible voters, implying that this problem is not specific to identity politics.

1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: As the US Republican Party claims to be explicitly [opposed](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/gop-mid-term-campaign-all-identity-politics/573991/)(Nevertheless, among those who claim to oppose identity politics, the term is applied exclusively to efforts by historically marginalized constituencies to claim rights others already possess.

It's extremely rare for politicians, even very pro-woman ones who work for feminist issues, to raise the "f" word, because the label is seen as divisive and dangerous. Popular conceptions of feminists as man-hating, bra-burning harpies have led to politicians striving to stay away from the word like the plague or a bad poll result; no matter how glam Taylor Swift or Beyonce make feminism look, it's still got an uneasy location on the political landscape. After all, we still live in a world where the leader of a legitimate political party in Poland can say that he doesn't believe women should have the right to vote, and where comedian Cecily Strong has to get journalists to raise their hands and swear that they won't comment on Hillary Clinton's appearance during her 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nLuckily, feminists around the world have taken matters into their own hands and formed their own political parties.), making it less likely that others will compete for their votes.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Progress requires political evolution from one generation to the next. The existence of votebanks contributes to stagnation of political evolution, worsening life for many.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Votebanks based on factors like caste or religion could stand in the way of [secularisation](https://www.pallikkutam.com/blog/vote-banks-and-future-of-secularism-in-india)(In short vote banks can be categorised broadly into 1\) religion or caste 2\) minority groups 3\) job or vocation related -farmers or planters \( more than 60% of population engaged in this \) 4\) business or trade groups.\n\nIt is not therefore surprising to find leadership of all major political parties or fronts meeting religious leaders when polls are announced. There are a plethora of interest groups and lobbyists in religion, trade, farming, plantations, Dalit communities that approach the government with their issues. And failure to address those issues can cause a swing in favour of the opposition front or group. Hence, the need to secure the vote banks at all times.), as they encourage voters to see such elements of their identity as key aspects of civic participation.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Identity-based campaigns encourage people to vote on the narrow perspective of their community against their better judgement. Often this voting preference comes at the cost of others.

1.2.2.3. Con: Identity politics aim to tackle the barriers that stop marginalised groups from representing themselves politically, ultimately creating better democratic representation for them.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Often, it is better to follow policy specialists when considering complex issues; identity politics harms political systems by encouraging an identity-based model of politics.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Elected representatives in democracies do not serve the same function as the representatives of identity groups. The former are elected because of their policies, while the latter are chosen based on their identity.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: Many political debates are not scientific or academic, but based on subjective value judgements. In such cases, specialists do not exist, or have limited intellectual authority. Therefore, it is better to follow those who are guided by their identity group and shared experiences.

This makes sense as given how right-wing or centrist voters are relatively allergic to transferring to those parties, they stood to gain the most from such a platform, but it was also picked up on by advocates for other left-wing parties, albeit to a lesser extent.)' slogan forwarded by voters in the 2020 Irish general election demonstrated the solidarity that can arise outside of identity politics.

Con: [Naftali Bennett](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56969598)(Mr Bennett was officially named the new prime minister on 13 June, prompting celebrations in Tel Aviv among some who sought to see Mr Netanyahu's ouster.\n\nHis government will be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel's 73-year history - made up of an unprecedented coalition of parties, it was approved with a razor-thin majority of 60-59.\n\nMr Bennett will be prime minister until September 2023 as part of a power-sharing deal with Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, who will then replace him.) was able to form a coalition government to oust Netanyahu from the Knesset in Israel as a broad array of political parties did not view his party's gain as their loss.
1.2.4.1.3.

1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Coalition-building can have disastrous effects on a party's polling. In the UK, the Liberal Democrats [struggled](https://novaramedia.com/2021/08/30/will-the-lib-dems-ever-escape-the-shadow-of-the-coalition/)(Before continuing, it’s worth outlining just how badly the Lib Dems performed in 2015.

1.2.4.2. Con: Identity politics raises the stakes of political factionalism by labelling those who disagree with identity politics as bigots, rather than political opponents.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Class-based politics similarly often labels those opposed to their movement as '[bourgeois](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/07/bourgeois-john-hayes)(Over the past few decades – perhaps as a result of the disingenuous insistence on the disappearance of distinct class identities and the whimsical suggestion that "we are all middle class now" – "bourgeois" has become less an objective economic identity and more a derogatory socio-cultural term, an accusation to be dodged and denied if one is not to be dismissed. To be "bourgeois" in a cultural rather than a class sense has become a term of insult from both left and right, its pejorative power generally centred around its connotations of prioritising middle-class abstract concerns over the concrete realpolitik of "keeping the lights on". As used by the left, "bourgeois" not only retains its connotations of traditional political enmity but also implies an airy, sheltered detachment from the material struggles of the proletariat. From the right, as Hayes's remark illustrates, it can be made synonymous with "liberal", "elitist", and perhaps the unspoken insinuation "Guardian-reading".)' or '[class traitors](https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/18133)(In 2017, I matriculated at Cambridge, a university marketed as a bastion of upwards social mobility.

This open offer took into consideration my low-income background, a progressive step for a University that prides itself on its traditional interview-based application system. I believe this was a preliminary move towards the new 100 conditional places offered to low-income students. But why am I the one to receive this treatment, and not those before me?...\n\nFrom the off-hand jokes from friends about me spending more time in expensive coffee shops than in libraries, to terms like ‘posh boy’ that have followed me all the way through high school, there is a view that my choice to attend Cambridge is an abandonment of my roots.)'. All types of factionalism leads to forms of name-calling.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Such rhetoric does more than just rally support against political opponents: it frames those opponents as immoral, vile people, making cooperation or empathy impossible.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Invoking terms like 'racist' or 'bigot' when describing someone aligns them with a [social taboo](https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/01/16/when-can-you-call-a-racist-person-racist/)(Monash University linguist Dr Howie Manns said that taboo words evolved over time, and were driven by socio-cultural changes. In the past, words associated with religion, and then words related to bodily parts and functions were considered most offensive. Now, words associated with people are touchiest.\n\n“Taboos and taboo language evolve in societies, and in contemporary English-speaking societies, words associated with people happen to be the taboo of the early 21st century,” he said.\n\nAnother issue at play, Manns said, is that words “invoke narratives”, so while someone’s actions and words might fit a description of “racist”, the people involved sometimes don’t think it describes them.). People often react poorly to this in order to defend their moral character.
1.2.4.2.4. Con: Identity politics advocates are right to be direct when identifying discriminatory attitudes in others. If they were to avoid accurately labelling people as bigots for fear of reprisal, [little would likely change](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/29/us/polite-racism/index.html)(The result is that many end up "talking in ridiculous circles" to avoid actually using the words "racist" or "racism."\n"You get this dynamic where nobody wants to come out and call it what it is," DiAngelo says. "White progressives are the worst. Our identity is very much rooted in being a nonracist. We really dance around it and avoid ever connecting ourselves to it."\nThe irony is that people who refuse to use plain language while calling out racism are inadvertently reinforcing it, DiAngelo says.\n"You actually end up protecting it when you don't name it," she says. "That's one of its means of operation -- to remain unnamed and unmarked.").
1.2.4.3. Pro: Other political movements have used factionalism to great effect in the past, yet rarely receive the same criticism that identity politics movements do.
1.2.4.3.1.

1.2.4.3.2. Con: Successful factional movements are often very inclusive, antagonising those in power without alienating their supporters. Identity-based movements struggle to achieve this balance.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: Civil rights campaigners, like Martin Luther King Jr., were often [highly critical of their allies](https://www.aaihs.org/martin-luther-king-jr-s-challenge-to-his-liberal-allies/)(“We do not need allies more devoted to order than to justice,” Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote in the spring of 1964, refusing calls from moderate Black and White leaders to condemn a planned highway “stall-in” to highlight systemic racism in New York City. “I hear a lot of talk these days about our direct action talk alienating former friends,” he added. “I would rather feel they are bringing to the surface latent prejudices that are already there. If our direct action programs alienate our friends … they never were really our friends.”) and even pointed out how they could frequently, inadvertently, be racist.

1.2.4.3.3. Pro: Politicians, like [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/froos1.asp)(Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.\n\nTrue they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money.

1.2.4.4. Con: Factionalism should exist only along ideological lines, as it sharpens the arguments of both sides and results in better policies that earn the support of the majority.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Ideological factionalism forces political opponents to [engage directly](https://www.youngfabians.org.uk/why_factions_are_good_actually)(No one is completely non-factional. We all have our biases and ideologies. What factions allow is for people to wear their beliefs on their sleeves.

Identity factionalism, by contrast, takes some claims to be already settled and not worth discussing.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Ideological factionalism forces political parties to consolidate the interests of both oppressed peoples and other voters, creating better policies. By contrast, identity politics requires only the [facade](https://culturico.com/2019/04/30/thoughts-on-cultural-representation-power-and-resistance/)(Representation can be regarded as characterising people in a highly reductive and de-contextualised manner – not, I suggest, simply to make sense of complex human relations, but to create political advantage.\n\nIt can be further argued that this political advantage is desired because of an instinct to ‘manipulate to dominate’ at the full expense of another entity – for economic gain. Some call this power play the ‘zero sum game’. The zero-sum player’s goal is to gain all benefit available and leave absolutely none to the perceived opponent; this strategy contrasts starkly with a ‘win-win’ mentality that drives players in the field to seek solutions where everyone involved achieves their desires in one form or another.) of representation.
1.2.4.4.3. Con: Identity politics often assumes certain ideological perspectives regarding how discrimination can effectively be changed. As such, identity-based political advocates can still clash with peers who have more traditional views.
1.2.4.4.3.1. Pro: For example, calls to 'defund the police' also involve beliefs about how best to prevent crime and about how to invest in local communities.
1.2.5. Pro: Identity-focused groups often do not accept opposing opinions, even within their coalitions, causing schisms and splits.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Identity politics encourage [groupthink](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-groupthink-2795213)(Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon in which people strive for consensus within a group. In many cases, people will set aside their own personal beliefs or adopt the opinion of the rest of the group. The term was first used in 1972 by social psychologist Irving L. Janis.\n\nPeople who are opposed to the decisions or overriding opinion of the group as a whole frequently remain quiet, preferring to keep the peace rather than disrupt the uniformity of the crowd. The phenomenon can be problematic, but even well-intentioned people are prone to making irrational decisions in the face of overwhelming pressure from the group.) which makes movements more insular.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: [Groupthink](https://www.simplypsychology.org/groupthink.html)(Groupthink refers to the tendency for certain types of groups to reach decisions that are extreme and which tend to be unwise or unrealistic\n\nGroupthink occurs when individuals in cohesive groups fail to consider alternative perspectives because they are motivated to reach a consensus which typically results in making less than desirable decisions.\n\nFor example, group members may ignore or discount information that is inconsistent with their chosen decision and express strong disapproval against any group member who might disagree.) encourages people to reject their personal opinions for those of the group. By contrast, identity politics organize people who already share opinions and experiences.

According to him, it stems from the idea that aspiration and success are seen as white attributes. “We might expect this from people who are racist, but anyone who thinks of themselves as anti-racist should not be using these slurs,” he says. \n\nThese terms are also frequently used towards people of colour by members of their own community. Here, the accusation might be that they’ve turned their back on their racial heritage and have “sold out” in order to get ahead, explains Dr Philip Seargeant, an applied linguistics lecturer at The Open University.) group members who question or undermine their narrative.
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: Marginalised identity groups are often prone to groupthink as members rally to protect their identity rather than exploring different ideas or solutions \([p. 12](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0032321720964667)(These findings show that whether and how strongly citizens engage in political motivated reasoning is dependent on the relevance of the specific topic to other parts of their identity.

In contrast, being in the relatively safe position of the dominant group, citizens have more freedom to argue in terms of the values of other, voluntary groups, like one’s ideological or partisan group.)\).

The main assumption that guides this theory is that people do not like to be wrong and often feel uncomfortable when their beliefs are challenged. Additionally, this theory focuses on the behavior to consequence connection within the ABC model. This theory, in management, can also be referred to as operant conditioning or the law of effect. Quite simply, this theory notes that a behavior will continue with a certain level of frequency based on pleasant or unpleasant results.). The pleasant experience of being within a group which affirms the individual's existing beliefs and attitudes would [condition](https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html)(According to this principle, behavior that is followed by pleasant consequences is likely to be repeated, and behavior followed by unpleasant consequences is less likely to be repeated.) them to continue immersing in the group's activities, beliefs, and attitudes. Inversely, they would be conditioned to avoid the discomfort of exploring challenging ideas.
1.2.5.1.4. Con: Most exclusive identity groups fail as they become too insular. Successful identity politics involves the creation of inclusive action, like protests, while offering [forums](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/reimagining-democracy-peoples-assemblies/)(Different standpoints, visions, the reformers and the revolutionaries will be there to develop a way forward.

Above all, this is an opportunity for ordinary people who are concerned about democracy to begin to shape the future they want in a participatory way.) for disagreements to take place in.
1.2.5.2. Con: Identity politics help build understanding between disparate groups, alleviating previous schisms that allowed oppression to thrive.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Despite their differences in proposals and methods, different identity groups have often worked together to achieve overarching political goals.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The [Combahee River Collective](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html)(We are a collective of Black feminists who have been meeting together since 1974...\n\nA Black feminist presence has evolved most obviously in connection with the second wave of the American women's movement beginning in the late 1960s. Black, other Third World, and working women have been involved in the feminist movement from its start, but both outside reactionary forces and racism and elitism within the movement itself have served to obscure our participation. In 1973, Black feminists, primarily located in New York, felt the necessity of forming a separate Black feminist group. This became the National Black Feminist Organization \(NBFO\).) split from the National Black Feminist Organization. This may have reduced the groups' effectiveness as a result, as resources could no longer be coordinated between them.

1.2.5.2.1.3. Con: White women were [more likely](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/09/white-women-vote-republican-why)(For the past two years, the American left has been haunted by a number: 53. It is the percentage of white women who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. In the sectors of the left where the figure and its implications have become a perennial theme, the number is treated both as disappointing and darkly unsurprising, a reflection of the conventional wisdom that white women would rather choose the racism espoused by the Republican party than join in the moral coalition represented by men of color and other women. On the left, this number can elicit exasperation, rage, and even suspicions about the moral legitimacy of the feminist project. It casts doubts on the political convictions of liberal white women, colors leftist perception of female-coded liberal political projects like the Women’s March, and has prompted long-overdue calls for increased political leadership by women of color.) than their Black peers to vote for Trump in 2016. This demonstrates the ways in which some groups are valued over others despite identity-based campaigning.

This coalition, led by [Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/31/pride-film-gay-activists-miners-strike-interview)(He went on to tell the story of miners in the Dulais valley in South Wales during the 1984-5 strike – the longest in British history – and a gay and lesbian group from London that donated more money \(£11,000 by December 1984\) to their cause than any other fundraiser in the UK, along with a minibus emblazoned with the logo LGSM: Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.\n\nIn a decade when a degree of homophobia was the norm, LGSM drove a couple of minibuses from Hackney Community Transport and a clapped-out VW camper van to a bleak mining town in South Wales to present their donations, uncertain what sort of welcome to expect.

1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Identity politics work to liberate everyone from systems of oppression. Consequently, they seek to build solidarity against oppressive systems, which encourages coalition-building \([p. 2](https://www.colorado.edu/odece/sites/default/files/attached-files/rba09-sb4converted_8.pdf)(Racism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to dominance.

For we have all been raised in a society where those distortions were endemic within our living. Too often, we pour the energy needed for recognizing and exploring difference into pretending those differences are insurmountable barriers, or that they do not exist at all.)\).
1.2.5.2.3. Con: Identity politics use a divide-and-conquer strategy that erodes shared identities like nationality and centralises power in the hands of a few group leaders engaging in [tribalism](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/the-threat-of-tribalism/568342/)(The causes of America’s resurgent tribalism are many. They include seismic demographic change, which has led to predictions that whites will lose their majority status within a few decades; declining social mobility and a growing class divide; and media that reward expressions of outrage. All of this has contributed to a climate in which every group in America—minorities and whites; conservatives and liberals; the working class and elites—feels under attack, pitted against the others not just for jobs and spoils, but for the right to define the nation’s identity. In these conditions, democracy devolves into a zero-sum competition, one in which parties succeed by stoking voters’ fears and appealing to their ugliest us-versus-them instincts.).
1.2.5.2.3.1. Pro: Foreign adversaries have used identity politics to distract and interfere with domestic politics and social harmony, as widespread perception of oppression allows adversarial propaganda to thrive.
1.2.5.2.3.1.1. Con: Foreign adversaries would not be able to promote destructive identity politics in other countries if genuine grievances did not exist.
1.2.5.2.3.1.2. Con: Foreign adversaries are likely to use any means necessary to distract from and interfere with progress, regardless of the existence of identity politics.
1.2.5.2.3.1.3. Pro: Russia targets African-Americans with messages designed to [perpetuate the narrative](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ira-target-black-americans/amp)(According to a new report commissioned for the Senate Intelligence Committee by cybersecurity firm New Knowledge, those accounts, along with dozens more, were part of an extensive and complex campaign to suppress the black American vote by the Russian firm Internet Research Agency.\n\nIn late 2017, it was first reported by CNN that the pro-Kremlin enterprise masterminded a plot to infiltrate online communities of the Black Lives Matter movement. But New Knowledge’s report, released Monday, shows a much more sustained and purposeful focus on black Americans—as the IRA went about instigating mistrust in law enforcement and political institutions, while cultivating seemingly authentic narratives of black pride.) that race relations are worse in America than they actually are.
1.2.5.2.3.2. Pro: Identity politics fracture groups that would otherwise be ideologically aligned, allowing more unified oppositions, even if they are a minority, to be politically dominant \([p. 5](https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08095656/CWCPReport_CommonsenseSolidarity.pdf)(Progressives do not need to surrender questions of social justice to win working-class voters, but “woke,” activist-inspired rhetoric is a liability.

But candidates who framed that opposition in highly specialized, identity-focused language fared significantly worse than candidates who embraced either populist or mainstream language.)\).
1.2.5.2.3.3. Con: While identity politics recognize different identity groups, there is no reason to assume that these groups are unable to work together.
1.2.5.2.3.4. Con: People in the UK say they have not heard of many identity politics terms, despite national tensions between groups \([pp. 5, 27](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/culture-wars-in-the-uk.pdf)(72% report they have either never heard of the term “microaggressions” or have heard of them but know very little, while\n61% say the same about both “cancel culture” and “identity politics”, and 54% are similarly unaware of “trigger warnings”...\n\nThree-quarters of the public \(74%\) say the UK feels divided to them these days, with more than one in four \(28%\) saying it feels very divided. By contrast, one in seven \(16%\) think the country is united, including just 1% who feel we’re very united as a nation. A survey from May 2020 which asked a similar question also found three-quarters of Britons thought the country was divided – down from 85% in 2018, according to an even earlier global study \(although the latter is less directly comparable due to differences in methodology\).)\). As such, the tensions may not be caused by identity politics.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Politics relies on understanding and reconciling competing views. If, as identity politics posit, it is impossible to understand the perspective of other groups, this process is futile and governance can only work through coercion.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: It is impossible for someone who can see to understand what it is like to be blind. However, trying to understand what it is like gives insights to the person who can see, making it easier to adapt their behaviors to help blind people. This is why society developed [audio descriptions](https://www.3playmedia.com/learn/popular-topics/audio-description/#:~:text=Audio%20description%20is%20an%20audio,blind%20and%20low%20vision%20viewers.)(There is an accessibility tool for the blind and low vision called audio description.

It is therefore inevitably messy, often slow, and nearly always cumbersome; but it is also a civilising and quite beautiful activity for the simple reason that it allows people to live together without resorting to violence.) argues, the main task of politics is to make collective decisions. This can only be done if all participants commit to sympathizing and compromising with others.

1.2.5.4.1. Pro: People [rely](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/05/alternative-facts)(In reality, we rely on a biased set of cognitive processes to arrive at a given conclusion or belief. This natural tendency to cherry pick and twist the facts to fit with our existing beliefs is known as motivated reasoning—and we all do it.\n\n"Motivated reasoning is a pervasive tendency of human cognition," says Peter Ditto, PhD, a social psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, who studies how motivation, emotion and intuition influence judgment.

People tend to seek consistency in their attitudes and perceptions, so this conflict causes feelings of unease or discomfort.\n\nThis inconsistency between what people believe and how they behave motivates people to engage in actions that will help minimize feelings of discomfort. People attempt to relieve this tension in different ways, such as by rejecting, explaining away, or avoiding new information.). This makes it hard to build a shared view of the world, as people do not agree on what is real.

For example, given how participants used Facebook and WhatsApp, they often relied on additional kinds of social cues \(e.g. number of likes or comments\) or labels, which in turn were absent when it came to Google, where the platform’s ranking of search results played a more significant orienting role. We also found that many said they depended on Google as a verification tool to validate or investigate information encountered on other platforms in cases when it was deemed interesting or important enough.

1.3.1. Pro: Marginalised identity groups know more about the issues that affect them than those in power do, yet they are seldom deemed credible.
1.3.1.1.

In short, they are wronged in their capacity as knowers, and especially so by what Fricker calls "tracker prejudices" which are systematic in their capacity to "track" a person of that social type or kind across an entire repertoire of activities, of which economic, educational, professional, sexual, legal, political, religious practices provide a representative sampling.\n\nIn chapter 2 the analysis expands to focus on stereotypes as themselves stereotypical vehicles of prejudice, in what Fricker calls "the credibility economy".), a system wherein the perceived trustworthiness of a person affords them more or less support from others.

Lugones claims that there was a distinctive and radical qualitative transformation in how these nations related to notions of gender. Lugones’ argument is motivated by feminist critiques of the constraining binary, cis-heterosexist gender system dominant in most contemporary societies.) of previously settled categories and phenomena.
1.3.1.2.1.

The science versus anti-science epithet-hurling really tracks differing interpretations of the facts of anatomical and physiological development. Rowling and Forstater argue that “sex is real”—“that there are only two sexes in humans.” In the Forstater ruling the judge cited my work to counter this viewpoint. He wrote that “morphology is not simply a question of what genes a person has, but also of which ones are being switched on, to what extent, in what combinations and how they interact.”); such actions thus inhibit progress by focussing less on policy and more on shared beliefs.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: [Identity politics](https://apnorc.org/projects/younger-generations-stand-out-on-identity-acceptance-and-progressive-policies/)(Race and ethnicity and gender are particularly salient. Overall, about 4 in 10 Gen Zers cite their race or ethnicity as important to their identity, and this is driven largely by people of color: 7 in 10 Black Gen Zers and half of Hispanic Gen Zers cite identity as important, compared to just a quarter of whites. Similarly, gender is more important to Gen Z women than men. More female Gen Zers also experience stress about their body image compared to male Gen Zers. Older Gen Zers ages 18-24 are also more likely than younger Gen Zers to cite body image as a major source of stress.\n\nSharp ideological divides emerge within Gen Z—just like older generations—with issues of race being a touch point.

The most recurrent argument, in the Nordic context, is that gender studies are preaching that everything connected to gender are social constructions... in the political discourse I have, however, rarely met any genuine intentions of actually trying to understand what kind of knowledge production gender studies stand for.\nThese misrepresentations are the norm. Typically, a straw man fallacy is when someone takes another person’s argument and distorts it in some kind of extreme way, and then\nattacks the extreme distortion, as if that is really the claim the person is making. This seems to happen to me and others that are discussing gender and gender studies in an\nopen public debate in different media outlets.)\), these movements can do little to help people that want to seem more credible.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The concept of the 'victim mentality' is associated with identity politics and is often used to [justify oppression](https://aninjusticemag.com/the-im-not-a-victim-mentality-1cc13883a28a)(Telling systemically-oppressed people that they have a “victim mentality” within the context of systemic oppression is not only factually incorrect, but it’s an incredibly insulting thing to say.\n\nThis especially applies to non-marginalized people telling marginalized people they’re “just acting like victims” when marginalized people address oppression. Don’t waltz into discussions about the legacy of U.S. slavery and claim Black people have a “victim mentality.”\n\nPersonally, I hate the term “victim mentality.” I usually hear it being used as a pejorative to shame and silence victims of systemic abuse. It’s also used to shame and silence victims of interpersonal abuse that is born from systemic abuse \(for example, husbands abusing their wives and how it’s a result of misogyny\).) by claiming people are responsible for their own oppression.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Reactionary backlash to identity politics has led to the use of terms like "[Karen](https://feministkilljoys.com/2022/06/08/the-complainer-as-carceral-feminist/)(I spoke informally to the students who were involved in the complaint process. I learned from them that complaints were made not by one student but by a group of students, including students of color, and related to Islamophobia and racial harassment as well as sexual harassment and bullying. This is how the use of the figure of the privileged white complainer, we could even call her Karen, can stop students of color from being heard; it can stop complaints about racial harassment from being heard.)" and "[snowflake](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/28/snowflake-insult-disdain-young-people)(The term has undergone a curious journey to become the most combustible insult of 2016.

You are the same organic and decaying matter as everyone else.”)" that mock people for what is perceived to be a 'victim mentality'.
1.3.1.3.2.

Such alienating language is [reductive](https://thoughtcatalog.com/chelsea-fagan/2013/02/white-girl-privilege-and-the-problem-with-blaming-all-men/)(But the idea of leveraging a universal hatred against men, or allowing ourselves to feel as though there is a clear divide in terms of gendered power, and that it falls distinctly on the men vs. women line, fuels a slippery slope of profound privilege denying. Because to pretend as though the 22-year-old white female blogger talking about her hatred of men from the comfort of her prepaid dorm at an Ivy League school does not hold many tangible privileges over, say, the undocumented male worker who is cleaning the bathroom stalls of her building at night, is ludicrous. There are countless privileges she has over him, and countless points of access she has in our society that he will never see.) and makes the movement easier for others to dismiss.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: Those seeking social change have frequently been [denigrated and mocked](https://sites.temple.edu/femalebody/final-project-blogs/lombardo-lombardo-blaze/)(In the early twentieth century, when the suffragette movement first began to kick off and dealt with an immediate wave of backlash, the predominately male comic artists who were in the anti-suffragette majority at the time, wanted to portray these women in a negative light, in order to devalue the suffragettes’ opinions and arguments. They would go about this by using silent visual cues to mock, belittle, and insult the women based off what was considered the most important thing about a woman at the time—her appearance. If they depicted the suffragettes in an ugly, unflattering manner, then people would value them less and brush off what they had to say. These visuals cues more often than not focused on the woman’s excessive weight, or extreme thinness, their unkept hair, being “too old”, and conventionally unattractive faces.); identity politics is not less effective for experiencing these attacks.
1.3.1.4. Con: Identity politics can promote a [victim mentality](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-rise-of-victimhood-culture/404794/)(Victimhood cultures emerge in settings, like today’s college campuses, “that increasingly lack the intimacy and cultural homogeneity that once characterized towns and suburbs, but in which organized authority and public opinion remain as powerful sanctions,” they argue. “Under such conditions complaint to third parties has supplanted both toleration and negotiation. People increasingly demand help from others, and advertise their oppression as evidence that they deserve respect and assistance. Thus we might call this moral culture a culture of victimhood ... the moral status of the victim, at its nadir in honor cultures, has risen to new heights.”) \([p. 23](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11109-020-09662-x.pdf)(We observe a similar pattern with the elite cueing treatment; both egocentric and systemic victimhood increase as a result of hearing Trump or Biden describe the average people’s inability to catch a break. As noted above, this type of rhetoric is commonplace in political messaging. Importantly, we control for factors that relate to actual political victimization - income,\neducation, race, and sex. As such, we can conclude that the treatment vignettes - and, presumably, real world elite rhetoric - can promote self-defined victimhood, without regard for sociopolitical or legal victim status. This is precisely what our theory purports: Political elites can rhetorically weaponize victimhood, and actually instill these feelings in individuals \(regardless of whether victim status is “earned” or “deserved”\).)\), encouraging [learned helplessness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-learned-helplessness-2795326)(Learned helplessness occurs when an animal is repeatedly subjected to an aversive stimulus that it cannot escape. Eventually, the animal will stop trying to avoid the stimulus and behave as if it is utterly helpless to change the situation. Even when opportunities to escape are presented, this learned helplessness will prevent any action.) by presenting the world through the binary of the oppressor and the oppressed. This oversimplified view of the world undermines the legitimacy and efficacy of identity-based advocacy.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: The fact that activists identify ways in which their groups have been harmed does not mean that everyone within that group sees themselves as 'victims' or are perceived as such.
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Emphasising victimhood may encourage people to harm other marginalised groups to maintain their credibility, as is the case with [trans-exclusionary cisgender queer men and women](https://www.gawker.com/culture/whats-up-with-gender-critical-gay-guys)("While I find the transphobic discourses promulgated by some cisgender women in the name of feminism very harmful, I do at least have some empathy or ability to understand how some women can have very real anxieties exploited by that movement,” says Shon Faye, author of The Transgender Issue: An Argument for Justice. She points to the decimation of women’s services in Britain after ten years of austerity, the fact there has been no reduction in the levels of male violence against women in their intimate lives, and the deprioritization of cisgender lesbians within the LGBT movement. “These are all real phenomena,” Shon says, “although I believe the anger is misdirected at trans people. However, in stark contrast, I find the transphobia of so-called ‘gender-critical gay men’ utterly self indulgent, considering that cisgender men tend to hold the most structural and interpersonal power within LGBTQ+ spaces.).
1.3.1.4.3. Pro: Some may use their marginalised status to [deflect blame](https://www.gawker.com/culture/identity-fraud)(Some might refer to this as pulling the race card or any other variation thereof. But such a term has become antiquated, co-opted and tainted by conservatives and those reacting negatively to what they see as excessive “wokeness” in contemporary discourse. My viewpoints do not align with theirs; rather, I would argue that it is to the detriment of left, progressive movements that a bad-faith weaponization of identity has saturated the fount of sociocultural dynamics. The danger of what I’m talking about lies not with the ideas behind brandishing identity — that it is meaningful, and that people of marginalized identities as a whole continue to suffer from inequities — so much as how inadequately this cynical rhetorical strategy addresses those fundamental problems in favor of shallow optics, cheap distractions, and personal gain.

Spaces are orientated\n‘around’ whiteness, insofar as whiteness is not seen. We do not face whiteness; it ‘trails behind’ bodies, as what is assumed to be given. The effect of this ‘around whiteness’ is the institutionalization of a certain ‘likeness’, which makes non-white bodies feel uncomfortable, exposed, visible, different, when they take up this space. The institutionalization of whiteness involves work: the institution comes to have a body as an effect of this work. It is important that we do not reify institutions, by presuming they are simply given and that they decide what we do.)\). Identity politics helps to call attention to this.
1.3.2.1. Pro: By questioning the benefits that accrue to people solely because of their race, gender, or sexuality, identity politics can encourage the criticism of systems otherwise presumed to be natural or acceptable \([p. 1](https://psychology.umbc.edu/files/2016/10/White-Privilege_McIntosh-1989.pdf)(My schooling gave me no training in\nseeing myself as an oppres sor, as an unfairly advantaged person, or as a participant in a damaged culture. I was taught to see myself as an individual whose moral state depended on her individual moral will. My schooling followed the pattern my colleague Elizabeth Minnich has pointed out: whites are taught to think of their lives as morally neutral, normative, and\naverage, and also ideal, so that when we work to benefit others, this is seen as work which will allow “them” to be more like “us.”)\).
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Many forms of oppression are often exhibited in [subtle or hidden ways](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8031073/what-are-microaggressions)(Microaggressions are more than just insults, insensitive comments, or generalized jerky behavior.\n\nThey're something very specific: the kinds of remarks, questions, or actions that are painful because they have to do with a person's membership in a group that's discriminated against or subject to stereotypes. And a key part of what makes them so disconcerting is that they happen casually, frequently, and often without any harm intended, in everyday life.), meaning that even those with good intentions can be oblivious to the harm they cause.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: The structural criticisms made by advocates of identity politics rarely necessitate or call for genuine structural change.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The demands of identity politics advocates, like quotas or increased job opportunities, often can be achieved [without removing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/06/racial-equality-working-class-americans-advocacy)(However, even affirmative action wasn’t brought about through the proliferation of White Fragility reading groups and self-contemplation about one’s own privilege. Rather, it was a demand that emerged from a labor-backed political coalition. As the scholar Touré F Reed reminds us, the phrase “affirmative action” first appeared in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 – the single-most important piece of labor legislation passed in the United States. The extension of affirmative action to issues of racial discrimination was initially part of a social democratic coalition that saw a government role in bringing about greater equality.\n\nThat’s a far cry from today’s emphasis on private sector activity not mandated by the state – through anti-racist trainings at workplaces and the like – to foster diversity and inclusion.) any underlying oppressive systems.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Con: There are many types of identity politics. While more 'liberal' varieties may have less transformative goals, more radical approaches do call for structural change.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Identity politics advocates, like feminists, often critique the [nuclear family](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdzwb/sophie-lewis-feminist-abolishing-the-family-full-surrogacy-now)(Even those of us who might call our family situations relatively “happy” should sign onto this project of demolishing their essential structure, Lewis says.

Maintaining the traditional family structure over time has also meant exploiting people of color and disowning queer children.), claiming it is exploitative and restrictive.
1.3.2.2. Con: Peace and cooperation between groups is best built slowly through [contact](https://www.apa.org/monitor/nov01/contact)(A longstanding line of research that aims to combat bias among conflicting groups springs from a theory called the "contact hypothesis." Developed in the 1950s by Gordon Allport, PhD, the theory holds that contact between two groups can promote tolerance and acceptance, but only under certain conditions, such as equal status among groups and common goals. Since the theory's inception, psychologists have added more and more criteria to what is required of groups in order for "contact" to work.\n\nRecently, however, University of California, Santa Cruz research psychologist Thomas Pettigrew, PhD, has turned this research finding on its head. In a new meta-analysis of 500 studies, he finds that all that's needed for greater understanding between groups is contact, period, in all but the most hostile and threatening conditions. There is, however, a larger positive effect if some of the extra conditions are met.) and continuous interaction. Identity politics are not necessary for this.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Identity politics is more likely to lead to [in-group contact](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/01/how-americas-identity-politics-went-from-inclusion-to-division)(As Vassar professor Hua Hsu put it in an Atlantic essay called “The End of White America?” the “result is a racial pride that dares not speak its name, and that defines itself through cultural cues instead.”\n\nIn combination with the profound demographic transformation now taking place in America, this suppressed urge on the part of many white Americans – to feel solidarity and pride in their group identity, as others are allowed to do – has created an especially fraught set of tribal dynamics in the United States today.) than out-group contact, because they claim that only members of one's in-group can understand them best.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: There is little evidence that increased contact between groups [consistently](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41290-017-0028-8)(We find that whereas interethnic friendships are indeed culturally driven, which confirms our cultural–sociological theory, contacts with neighbors and colleagues do indeed affect ethnic prejudice. They do so in a manner that is more complex and more culturally sensitive than contact theory suggests, however: while positive cultural stances vis-à-vis ethnic diversity lead interethnic contact to decrease ethnic prejudice, negative ones rather lead the former to increase the latter.) builds more understanding and cohesion.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: 'Contact theory' has been proven to improve cohesion in a [variety of different contexts](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.90.5.751)(This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice.).
1.3.2.2.3. Con: Improving understanding by increasing people's exposure to one another is an extremely slow policy that can be set back significantly by shocks or growing tensions [elsewhere in society](https://apnews.com/article/paris-france-emmanuel-macron-islam-europe-ea5e15bb651bbe443b27bc19948cae6b)(A spotlight of suspicion was trained on them again even before the latest acts of extremist violence, including two beheadings. President Emmanuel Macron has forged ahead with his effort to rid Islam in France of extremists, part of a project he labels “separatism,” a term that makes Muslims wince.\n\nAmid intensifying rhetoric and fresh attacks by outsiders, including the killings of three people Thursday at a Catholic church in Nice, Muslims in France have kept their heads down and chins up. But deep down, some are squirming, feeling they are being held responsible.\n\n“It’s worrisome for Muslims,” said Hicham Benaissa, a sociologist who specializes in Islam in the workplace. Within his network, he said, some “talk about leaving France. The situation is tense. There is fear.”).
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Controversial or reactionary political commentators often use [images of crimes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/how-a-teens-death-has-become-a-political-weapon)(Hundreds of people are murdered in Germany every year. But the troubling circumstances surrounding Der Fall Susanna, the case of Susanna, helped create a cause célèbre, generating intense media coverage—and activating the major fault lines now running through the country. Far-right parties hailed her as a martyr. Horst Seehofer, the country’s interior minister, who has repeatedly clashed with Angela Merkel over the government’s policy on immigrants and refugees, invoked the case when he threatened to resign last summer, sparking one of the most dramatic political crises in the country’s postwar history. And conditions were already fraught.) to reduce cohesion between groups living in close proximity.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Systemic political struggles are also often extremely slow in creating change, as they require long processes of convincing the public of a harm and working through political institutions to stop it.
1.3.2.3.

Students need to be exposed to the harrowing truths.) and literatures. This can help expand peoples' understanding of the world.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: In the US, conservatives have responded to what they see as 'identity politics' by trying to silence those who espouse them, going as far as to [ban popular books](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/book-bans-pen-america-school-districts)(More than 1,500 book bans have been instituted in US school districts in the last nine months, a study has found, part of a rightwing censorship effort described as “unparalleled in its intensity”.\n\nPEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression in the US, scrutinized efforts to ban certain books from school libraries for its “Banned in the USA” report.

King lamented the constricting conditions facing young Black Americans seeking higher education at the time.

1.3.2.4. Con: Identity politics is often individualised which makes broad structural change difficult to achieve.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Social identification alone cannot create change; people must believe others are in their group to create a shared identity \([p. 170](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1368430220936759)(On the one hand, the concept of shared social identity incorporates the notion of social identification but extends it: it is not just about\nmy perceptions of self \(I am a category member\) but also of others \(they are also category members\), and it is not just about my perceptions \(how I see category memberships\) but also about\nmy metaperceptions \(how I see others as seeing category memberships\). These extensions equally differentiate shared social identity from constructs such as entitativity. What is more, it is this multilevel sense of “we-ness” which leads people to support and have a\nsense of being supported by others, and therefore to act together as a group.)\).

Buoyed by his success, he networked within his company’s headquarters in search of someone who had dealt with a similar crisis. Eventually, he found two mentors.) to take effective action.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: People often learn about anti-racism or feminism through [books](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/jun/03/do-the-work-an-anti-racist-reading-list-layla-f-saad)(Many black people such as myself are wondering: what will happen when the news cycle is over, the social justice memes are no longer posted, and the declarations for inclusivity, diversity and “doing the work” have died down? What happens when white people, momentarily awoken from the comfortable slumber of white privilege by this moment of unignorable protest, go back to sleep? How do we actually create an anti-racist world and rid ourselves of this sickness and system of white supremacy, when the people who benefit from it are not showing up to do the work?). While they do benefit from a richer conceptual understanding of the world, what they learn may not be easily applied to the real world.

Even as a liberal who has attended abortion rights demonstrations and written about standing up to racism, I sometimes feel afraid to fully speak my mind.). This is a subtle process that may have long-term consequences for society.

Interestingly, expressing dissenting views to family, friends, or neighbors has a stronger effect as compared with strangers, politicians, or the media... The explanation for this novel finding can be found in the social accountability argument put forth by Mutz. The “need for social accountability creates anxiety because interpersonal disagreement threatens social relationships, and there is no way to please all members of one’s network and thus assure social\nharmony.” When voicing dissent to close others, social accountability is arguably higher compared with voicing disagreement to journalists, politicians, or strangers. Thus, citizens suppress their views to maintain social harmony. In terms\nof the spiral of silence, this means that disagreement with friends and family may lead to a higher state of fear of social isolation as compared with strangers.)\).

1.3.3.3.1.2. Con: People increasingly believe that men [should contribute to abortion activism](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/06/men-abortion-debate/591259/)(“I’ve seen all these signs that are like, you know, No uterus, no opinion,” she said. “I think that’s a reductive, gendered framing that makes it seem like we’re the only ones allowed to talk about it. I think that approach has spooked some men out of the conversation who we really need to be a part of it.” Every day on social media, she said, she sees progressive men in media and politics weigh in on “every progressive issue” except abortion, even though abortion is tied up in some of those issues, too. “Anyone who cares about economic justice, racial justice, human rights,” she said, “abortion access is your issue.”), though the perspectives of those who have abortions should be centered.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: If powerful groups are allowed to weigh in on issues that solely affect marginalised people, those people's voices may be [drowned out](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race)(“Not to mention that entering into conversation with defiant white people is a frankly dangerous task for me. As the hackles rise and the defiance grows, I have to tread incredibly carefully, because if I express frustration, anger or exasperation at their refusal to understand, they will tap into their presubscribed racist tropes about angry black people who are a threat to them and their safety. It’s very likely that they’ll then paint me as a bully or an abuser. It’s also likely that their white friends will rally round them, rewrite history and make lies the truth. Trying to engage with them and navigate their racism is not worth that.\n... It’s truly a lifetime of self-censorship that people of colour have to live. The options are: speak your truth and face the reprisals, or bite your tongue and get ahead in life.").
1.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: Oppressed people often lack money, social and political capital, and widespread respect; this makes it difficult to establish a political platform, allowing them to be easily ignored.
1.3.3.3.2.2. Con: Allowing many people to weigh in on an issue can allow it to be improved and consolidated through [consensus](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus)(Consensus enables a group to share power - everyone who is fundamentally affected by a decision can work together to find solutions that meet everyone's needs. It’s about working with each other rather than for or against each other.\n\nIt helps to build a stronger community. Consensus relies on us respecting other people's needs and opinions, and being open and honest about our own needs. This it turn leads to better relationships in a group.\n\nMaking better decisions: Consensus is looking for ‘win-win’ solutions that are acceptable to all. That doesn’t mean everyone has to completely agree on their favourite solution all the time – but nor should anyone have to compromise too much. The idea is to weave together all the best ideas and address all the key concerns to find something that works for everyone - a process that often results in surprising and creative solutions, inspiring both the individual and the group as whole.). This may create policy changes with more longevity.
1.3.3.3.2.3. Pro: Women are often listened to [less frequently](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/when-women-speak-do-people-listen)(The differences weren’t due to lack of effort. On average, the percentage of communicators who held training events was similar in male-communicator and female-communicator villages. But farmers in female-communicator villages were five percentage points less likely to attend those events. “Other people don’t show up as much,” Mobarak says. “They pay less attention, in spite of the fact that the objective indicators of performance in our data show that female communicators knew just as much, if not more.”\n\nIn general, people did interact with communicators in female-communicator villages. But they didn’t talk to them as much about agriculture, perhaps because they didn’t consider farming to be an important part of women’s identity. And they tended to think that communicators in female-communicator villages weren’t as skilled at farming as those in male-communicator villages.) than men, meaning that it is possible that male allies are able to talk more than their female feminist counterparts and advance their cause.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Despite what identity politics advocates espouse, one person does not need to have the exact same experience as another to be able to understand and discuss a topic.
1.3.3.3.3.1. Con: Oppression is often carried out through many [small interactions](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8031073/what-are-microaggressions)(Microaggressions are more than just insults, insensitive comments, or generalized jerky behavior.\n\nThey're something very specific: the kinds of remarks, questions, or actions that are painful because they have to do with a person's membership in a group that's discriminated against or subject to stereotypes. And a key part of what makes them so disconcerting is that they happen casually, frequently, and often without any harm intended, in everyday life.), alongside larger socio-economic barriers. Those not facing oppression will find it difficult to understand the cumulative experience of these incidents.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Pro: Those who do not face oppression can listen to and learn from those who are oppressed. This new-found understanding can then be used constructively by the privileged to discuss their place in the world and move to support change.
1.3.3.3.3.3. Con: Understanding a topic is not enough to motivate change; some critical race theorists believe that [interest divergence](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1023021)(Presently, we are witnessing the reverse of this process; a period of pronounced "interest-divergence," when White power-holders imagine that a direct advantage will accrue from the further exclusion and oppression of Black groups in society.) restricts how willing white people are to reduce anti-Black discrimination.
1.3.3.4. Pro: In order to gatekeep issues, identity politics advocates stereotype groups and create new forms of oppression. This limits people's understandings of themselves and society.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Liberal identity politics often stereotype white men as privileged oppressors [without accounting for](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/01/how-americas-identity-politics-went-from-inclusion-to-division)(One Trump voter claimed that “maybe I’m just so sick of being called a bigot that my anger at the authoritarian left has pushed me to support this seriously flawed man.” “The Democratic party,” said Bill Maher, “made the white working man feel like your problems aren’t real because you’re ‘mansplaining’ and check your privilege. You know, if your life sucks, your problems are real.” When blacks blame today’s whites for slavery or ask for reparations, many white Americans feel as though they are being attacked for the sins of other generations.) the individual circumstances of those in question.
1.3.3.4.1.1. Pro: [Poorer white students](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-57558746)(Committee chairman Robert Halfon said it was a "major social injustice" that so little had been done to address this gap in attainment - and accused the government of "muddled thinking" in suggesting it could be explained by poverty.\n\n"If you think it's about poverty, then it doesn't explain why most other ethnic groups do much better," he said.\n\nPoorer white pupils are falling behind "every step of the way", he warned, and with almost a million young people being affected, it could not be "swept under the carpet".\n\n At GCSE, in 2019, 18% of white British pupils on free meals achieved grade 5 in English and maths, compared with 23% for the average for pupils on free meals), for example, may be left without advocacy by those supporting identity politics. These people lack key social networks and have little wealth, yet still receive little attention \([p. 9](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/50672/1/Mowat_EERJ_2015_Towards_a_new_conceptualisation_of_marginalisation.pdf)(Social capital theory attests that people can be marginalised and disadvantaged through the lack of social networks \(and the trust and reciprocity associated with them\) which others can routinely call upon and the concept of cultural capital\n\(Bourdieu 1972\) perceives marginalisation through the lens of the status and power which people are able \(or not\) to exercise through their knowledge, skills and symbolic and material endowments \(Bourdieu, 1972; Brann-Barrett, 2011\) \(for example, qualifications which open the door to further opportunities\).)\).
1.3.3.4.1.2. Pro: The rhetoric used by advocates of identity politics is often [purposefully inflammatory](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/30/feminists-treat-men-badly-its-bad-for-feminism/)(Yet a lot of feminist rhetoric today does cross the line from attacks on sexism into attacks on men, with a strong focus on personal behavior: the way they talk, the way they approach relationships, even the way they sit on public transit. Male faults are stated as sweeping condemnations; objecting to such generalizations is taken as a sign of complicity. Meanwhile, similar indictments of women would be considered grossly misogynistic.) towards white men.
1.3.3.4.1.3. Con: Often it is white men who have [benefitted](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/politics/article/what-is-white-privilege)(The most important thing to understand about white privilege is that, if someone uses this term to describe a person’s circumstance, it is not an accusation of racism. It is merely an acknowledgement of the fact that their whiteness will work in their favour when navigating their way through Western society and culture. In the UK, there is still both a subconscious and conscious perception that to be white is to be “normal” and people of colour to be “other”. For instance, I am aware that the first thing most people will notice about me is that I’m mixed raced – it is also my key identifier for other people.) the most from Western imperialism. Thus, it is apt to critique the group, even if some outliers exist.
1.3.3.4.1.4. Con: Arguments about the privilege of white men do not aim to undermine the suffering that white communities can face. Instead, they talk of general trends that benefit white men, alongside other forms of suffering.
1.3.3.4.2. Con: Stereotypes will always exist, as they make the world easier to [understand](https://www.simplypsychology.org/katz-braly.html)(In social psychology, a stereotype is a fixed, over generalized belief about a particular group or class of people. By stereotyping we infer that a person has a whole range of characteristics and abilities that we assume all members of that group have. For example, a “hells angel” biker dresses in leather.\n\n One advantage of a stereotype is that it enables us to respond rapidly to situations because we may have had a similar experience before.\n\n One disadvantage is that it makes us ignore differences between individuals; therefore we think things about people that might not be true \(i.e. make generalizations\).). Identity politics often strives to decouple stereotypes from their oppressive or [colonial roots](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/abolition/black_imagery_gallery_04.shtml)(Colonial conquests were usually justified by portrayals of Africans as savage warriors, which circulated through drawings in illustrated magazines. Once colonies were established, these images of brutal warriors gradually made way for a new stereotype of impulsive, childlike Africans. Colonial paternalism required subjects that would fit the bill. Social theorist Roland Barthes remarked: 'the only really reassuring image of the Negro is that of the boy, of the savage turned servant.'\n\nAnother image introduced by colonialism was that of the 'lazy native'. This reflected the natives' lack of enthusiasm for exhausting themselves for the benefit of the colonisers, but most of all it demonstrated the colonists' illusion that their role was to instil industriousness. Again, we learn little about Africa from these depictions and much about the prevailing European attitudes of the time.) \([pp. 4404-4405](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1314788111)(Our results revealed a strong bias among subjects to hire male candidates for the arithmetic task. This bias was present among both male and female employers, related to their expectations of candidate performance by sex \(as suggested by IAT scores\), and remained undiminished by candidates’ self-reports of expected performance, largely because males tended to overestimate future performance. Objective information about past performance \(how subjects actually performed on the task\) attenuated sex-biased decision-making in this context but failed to eliminate it, especially in employers who showed a stronger implicit sex bias as revealed by the IAT.)\).
1.3.3.4.2.1. Pro: New stereotypes may co-exist with historic ones. This plurality could allow people to be understood in many ways, aligning with the stereotypes and discourses that best explain them.
1.3.3.4.3. Pro: Identity politics and the academic literature they are based on often assume that marginalised groups can find unity in a common experience of suffering \([p. 29](https://borderlandsnarratives.utep.edu/images/Readings/Moraga-CL-La-Guera-091979.pdf)(What I am saying is that the joys of looking like a white girl ain't so great since I realized I could be beaten on the street for being a dyke. If my sister's being beaten because she's Black, it's pretty much the same principle. We're both getting beaten any way you look at it. The connection is blatant; and in the case of my own family, the difference in the privileges attached to looking white instead of brown are merely a generation apart.)\). This overlooks the nuances of different forms of oppression.
1.3.3.4.3.1. Pro: Equating womanhood with progressive feminist ideals has led to [reductive](https://charlatan.ca/2017/02/03/letter-feminism-cannot-be-used-as-a-defensive-shield/)(Many seem to be shying away from the heart of the matter by focusing on people’s reactions to Kelly’s claim to feminism, rather than focusing on the claim itself. I urge people to reconsider and reevaluate their understandings of what they believe in, before allowing the name of valid movements such as feminism to be used as a deflective shield against valid criticism.\n\nIt is extremely important for everyone to pay attention. Kelly’s shaky claim to “feminism” was used as a way to avoid answering extremely valid questions from the public.\n\nFeminism is not a buzzword that can be used when one is out of options. It is a philosophy, a movement, an ideology that can be explained and defended when questioned. I do not feel that is the feminism Kelly claims to be part of, but then again, there is no way for me to know how she feels.) [generalisations](https://tsl.news/opinion-liberal-weaponization-feminism/)(Feminism is an ideology and theoretical framework to understand and encourage political and social action. However, feminism is also used to justify and shame women who did not enthusiastically support Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that Clinton is complicit in the military coup d’etat in Honduras and supported the homophobic Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nNo, it is not the responsibility of women to uphold blind loyalty to other women when they perpetuate classism, racism and other unjust structures. There cannot be sisterhood without crucial class and racial analysis, which recognizes the way in which women are complicit or even play an active role in subjugating other women. \n\nDiscussing feminism is becoming increasingly difficult as it becomes more mainstream and distorted, manipulated and rendered. Mainstream feminism maintains that it is men in positions of power that oppress women and this is true.) as to who is a legitimate social advocate. Such developments are easily weaponised to stymie change.
1.3.3.4.3.2. Pro: Identity politics often ignores the ways that marginalized groups [oppress or discriminate](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/19/opinion/non-black-minorities-are-complicit-black-oppression/)(At the same time, standing behind Black Lives Matter has been met with hesitation from many non-Black minorities. Terrence Johnson, associate professor at Georgetown University and author of “We Testify with Our Lives: Black Power and Ethical Turn in Politics” explains that “there’s a deep denial among some Asian-Americans, South Asian Americans, and Hispanics of their own complicity in reinforcing white supremacy. In far too many instances, they benefited from the political gains Blacks struggled to achieve in the late 1960s.” How could these minorities fight racism against Black communities when they have themselves failed to confront their anti-Blackness? Within safe spaces, derogatory racist remarks geared toward Black people are a toxic trope in the living rooms of many South Asian families in America and beyond.) against each other.
1.3.3.4.3.3. Con: Feminist identity politics can be nuanced; though the movement primarily works to abolish sexism, it still examines [racialised](https://www.blackburncenter.org/post/2020/02/12/what-is-misogynoir)(Knowing the definition is one thing — but how does misogynoir play out in real life? There are a number of ways that this happens. For example, Black girls are often viewed as older, more mature, and more sexually advanced than white girls — which causes many people to dismiss allegations involving the sexual abuse of Black girls and teens. Historically, Black women and girls have been overtly sexualized, leading to the modern-day stereotype of the hypersexual “jezebel.” This sexualization of Black women and girls is based in racism, starting with how European travelers to Africa described women there and continuing through slavery in the United States, where slave owners justified the rape of enslaved Black women by claiming that they had insatiable appetites for sex.) experiences of womanhood, and the ways in which white women can oppress their BIWOC counterparts \([p. 85](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1367549420985852)(This attempt to separate the personal and political is central to white women’s tears as a strategic device. We demand to be treated as ‘just a person’ who should be granted the benefit of the doubt, who exists outside racialised structures and power relations even as our actions perpetuate them. However, while privileged white feminists deny the relationship between the personal and the political in response to critique, in our own theory and politics this relationship \(and in particular, our own personal experience or that of women like us\) takes centre stage. This is more than just hypocrisy; it is white supremacy. Whether we deny or emphasise the relationship between the personal and political, white women’s tears enable us to centre ourselves and marginalise women of colour.)\).
1.4. Pro: Identity politics encourage and fuel [political correctness](https://hbr.org/2006/09/rethinking-political-correctness)(These types of events occur daily in politically correct \(PC\) cultures, where unspoken canons of propriety govern behavior in cross-cultural interactions—that is, interactions among people of different races, genders, religions, and other potentially charged social identity groups. We embrace the commitment to equity that underlies political correctness, and we applaud the shifts in norms wrought by that commitment. We are troubled, however, by the barriers that political correctness can pose to developing constructive, engaged relationships at work. In cultures regulated by political correctness, people feel judged and fear being blamed. They worry about how others view them as representatives of their social identity groups.) and [cancel culture](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/30/20879720/what-is-cancel-culture-explained-history-debate)(Within the turbulent past few years, the idea that a person can be “canceled” — in other words, culturally blocked from having a prominent public platform or career — has become a polarizing topic of debate. The rise of “cancel culture” and the idea of canceling someone coincides with a familiar pattern: A celebrity or other public figure does or says something offensive. A public backlash, often fueled by politically progressive social media, ensues.), both of which are harmful to societies.
1.4.1. Con: The harms of cancel culture are often [exaggerated](https://www.gawker.com/culture/the-pity-me-personal-essay)(One recent example is an Atlantic essay titled “The Things I’m Afraid to Write About” by Sarah Hepola. In this, Hepola describes her discomfort with voicing her opinion on topics, such as gender and politics, due to the threat of the “firing squads on Twitter” in the exaggerated fashion characteristic of this genre...These essays aren’t about traumatic experiences but in a culture “infatuated with victimhood,” as Seghal put it, we seem to have created a climate where even stories which aren’t particularly sad or serious are spun as if they are. The only stories worth telling are the serious and sad ones, this culture suggests, and so everyone is encouraged to tell their story in as serious and sad a way as possible. The infatuation with being put upon also has a way of neatly dividing the world up into victims and abusers. In such a world the appeal of self-identifying as a victim is obvious, but that’s not the world we live in: we all have far too much in common for that.) to solicit sympathy by creating a sense of victimhood for those who commit blunderous, offensive, or harmful acts.
1.4.1.1. Con: Call-outs can leave people socially isolated, due to [group shaming](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-mental-health-effects-of-cancel-culture-5119201)(One definition of cancel culture is "the popular practice of withdrawing support for...public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive." This canceling is often "performed on social media in the form of group shaming.”1\n\nIn short, to be canceled means that a person or group decides to stop supporting someone or something based on a transgression that is either actual or perceived.). Even if rare, this can have a chilling effect on speech, as people self-correct to avoid harm.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Cancel culture is seldom effective, typically only harming those who have committed [particularly egregious acts](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/21/entertainment/cancel-culture-explainer-trnd/index.html)(The truth is a bit more complicated. Some people certainly tried to cancel the rapper by swearing off his music and criticizing his viewpoints.\nBut let's be honest. Many other people still bump Ye's songs, and his recent Sunday Services have garnered huge crowds -- including actor Brad Pitt. Ultimately, Kanye proved just too big to cancel.).
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Those worried about experiencing large amounts of [online shaming](https://www.johnlocke.org/cancel-cultures-chilling-effect-on-free-speech-and-scientific-research/)(The societal backlash to the findings of the paper – not the methodology – led the authors to request it be retracted from the journal in which it was published.

Guze writes:\n\n \[T\]he bigger problem is that the mere possibility of cancelation is generally sufficient to ensure that most people, including most academics, don’t say anything that might conceivably trigger the cancellation mob. The resulting self-censorship stifles free and open debate to a dangerous degree.) are less likely to share potentially controversial opinions.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The phrase 'cancel culture' is often [weaponised](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-mind/202103/why-cancel-culture-anyone-is-harmful-and-wrong)(Cancel culture and calling-out have been used by all sides of the political and social spectrum. While it has been attributed to mostly the left-leaning, Donald Trump and others in the Republican orbit have done as much canceling, firing, threatening, and harassing. Criticism or defense of its use is not consistent but often depends on who or what beliefs are the subject of canceling attempts. Recently, political conservatives have used the term “cancel” as a weapon against anything they disagree with. The slogan of the recent CPAC convention was “UnCancel America.” Conservative politicians are consistently engaging in rhetoric claiming that attempts are being made to cancel out the American way of life.) by conservatives as a defense of traditions they feel are eroded. This misrepresents normal societal change as a form of attack.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Cancel culture often [punishes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54374824)(At the heart of many complaints about cancel culture is the idea that there are few ways to make amends once cancel culture says you have done something wrong.\n\nWhen an ordinary individual is the target those options for apologies or fixing an issue are even fewer. That can mean the financial consequences are more severe.\n\n"It's important to remember that someone is paying that price," says Alexis Odesser, an expert in crisis public relations at Bliss Integrated. She adds brands targeted by cancel culture can often find ways to move past an incident, while individuals can be left with very expensive consequences.) people for [minor mistakes](https://inews.co.uk/culture/radio/jon-ronson-twitter-things-fell-apart-radio-4-culture-wars-piers-morgan-1282604)(He feels that Twitter allows no space for complexity. Jokes are misconstrued; minor transgressions are lumped in with major ones. “I’ve had enough bad things happen in my own life to make me empathise with people who have flaws and to see humans as complex,” he says, “but Twitter has decided to do basically the opposite, to treat people as representatives of an ideology, whether they like it or not. It’s the idea that you can define someone based on some bad or ambiguous words they used in a tweet.”), meting out disproportionate punishments. This form of identity politics can have severe consequences.
1.4.1.2.2.

None saw it as embedded in social structures; they could not get beyond their righteous disdain for the latte sippers who have been imposing this new form of censorship.\n\nThere is a reason for their blindness. Conservatives concede that discrimination exists \(even if it is exaggerated\) but they see society as essentially good and not in need of structural change. So they do not accept that the injustices that animate activists reflect something rotten in society; instead they are merely the product of individuals behaving badly.).

At some point the institution is going to be compromised," he told an audience of about 500 people at an upscale hotel in Salt Lake City.\n\n"By doing this, you continue to chip away at the respect of the institutions that the next generation is going to need if they're going to have civil society," Thomas said.) claims that cancel culture erodes democratic norms and harms society, despite himself [undermining](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/28/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-affirmative-action-case-ginni-thomas)(The potential appearance of a conflict of interest over the Harvard case was noted in a recent investigation by the New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer that takes a deep dive into the overlapping interests of the couple.

1.4.1.2.4. Con: For many people, the language they use and the actions they take are core to their [identity](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/22/the-power-of-language-how-words-shape-people-culture/)(Speaking, writing and reading are integral to everyday life, where language is the primary tool for expression and communication. Studying how people use language – what words and phrases they unconsciously choose and combine – can help us better understand ourselves and why we behave the way we do.\n\nLinguistics scholars seek to determine what is unique and universal about the language we use, how it is acquired and the ways it changes over time. They consider language as a cultural, social and psychological phenomenon.\n\n“Understanding why and how languages differ tells about the range of what is human,” said Dan Jurafsky, the Jackson Eli Reynolds Professor in Humanities and chair of the Department of Linguistics in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford. “Discovering what’s universal about languages can help us understand the core of our humanity.”). Criticising these, thus, is an attack on their way of life.

Con: Exaggerated or otherwise, [harm](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/freedom-mind/202103/why-cancel-culture-anyone-is-harmful-and-wrong)(Cancel culture is undeniably toxic when it involves criminal threats, invasion of privacy \(doxing\), or driving a person to suicide. People might wish to believe it will effect positive social change. The nature of so many comments on social media seems to indicate otherwise.\n\nNastiness, Schadenfreude, and dismissive characterizations of opposing opinions substitute for dialogue. Internet platforms are structured to get a payout from high emotion and clickability. Canceling and calling-out posts fit perfectly into that paradigm. Commenting is instantly rewarding, and nasty and demeaning comments aimed at “trolls” or “deplorables” allow commenters to feel morally and intellectually superior. The act of canceling is “self-sealing,” as it protects the commenters from considering opposing opinions and critiquing their own position.) is caused by cancel culture and should not be minimised, especially as these harms violate good moral conduct in society.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: As people are [denied](https://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/article/cancel-culture-toxic-for-mental-health)(However, while calling out bad behaviour might be important, a culture that encourages people to be quick to cancel and reluctant to forgive is dangerous.

This is better as fewer people are harmed.
1.4.2. Pro: Identity politics, and the cancel culture it supports, erode traditional cultural values.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Some believe that identity politics and cancel culture [undermine](https://unherd.com/2022/05/why-cant-the-left-take-a-joke/)(But there is another loss here too, and it’s a loss to the political culture of the Left. For as the progressive wing has embraced the ever-evolving permutations of identity politics so enthusiastically, it has also — and probably non-coincidentally — made it impossible for anyone on its own side to laugh at these permutations, or at identity politics generally. In the reductive algebra of progressive offence-seekers, mocking identity politics is equated with mocking minorities. Of course, all politics is tribal, and no political party or movement, Right or Left, can easily tolerate mockery, especially from within its own ranks. But this is not just an understandable dislike of being laughed at by those on the same side as oneself. It is a positive taboo against it, with all the enforcing of speech codes, wilfully reductive misunderstandings, and attempted humiliation of miscreants that this implies.) comedy and make it harder for people to laugh at themselves and others.

Irrespective, she didn’t find Rock’s “joke” funny. Her immediate reaction to it was an eye-roll, which seemed to suggest a sort of exasperation at the brand of humor that seeks to make people laugh at the expense of another. People have been arguing against jokes that “punch down” for many years now. Indian comedians, too, had to reckon with the problematic content of their comedy routines in the first-half of 2021, with many of them being cancelled. Yet, comedians refuse to retire it.\n\nThe outrage against this form of humor isn’t merely a superficial endeavor to bring in a culture of “political correctness.” It goes deeper than that and causes actual harm to actual people. “\[A\]lthough jokes may not instantly change the world, they may affect people at an interpersonal level,” co-wrote Simon Weaver, a lecturer at the Brunel University London, and Karen Morgan, a research fellow at the University of Bristol.) on the already marginalised, causing [further harm](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/10/15/dave-chappelle-netflix-the-closer-set-dangerous-precedent/8450189002/)(And with anti-trans violence on the rise in the U.S., Chappelle's remarks struck a particularly nasty chord. \n\n"When it's a group that's already vulnerable because they're already discriminated against – maybe even by members of their own family, let alone others – those are the people who are going to be emotionally more harmed by it," Zuckerman says. "I know some people get very upset about political correctness – 'Can't we joke about anything anymore? People shouldn't be so sensitive' – but it's very different when you're a member of a discriminated group.").

Kelly urinating on an underage Black girl that first circulated in Black barbershops, over bootleg tables, and on porn sites in 2002. In a “video” for a song called “\(I Wanna\) Pee on You,” Chappelle instead casts adult women; instead of satirizing Kelly as an alleged predator—we already knew he’d married Aaliyah when she was 15—he’s merely mocked for an unhygienic kink...\nTo me, it seems that the bit and the positive reception to it spoke volumes about the inability of Chappelle, and most people, to have empathy for Black girls and women. We wouldn’t laugh—side by side with white folks—about any of the instances of Black men or boys being harmed by state violence. How could Black women be asked to laugh at rape jokes alongside, essentially, the same folks who’d be allowed to rape us with impunity?) conservative and harmful ideas.

Practically every writing generation has had its crew of young guys, from Amis and Ishiguro to Franzen and Foster Wallace.

Turner says the key isn’t with what we typically think of as intelligence, but rather with the emotions, which was accompanied by some important changes to our brain structure. Although the neocortex figures prominently in many theories of the evolution of religion, Turner says the more important alterations concerned the subcortical parts of the brain, which gave hominins the capacity to experience a broader range of emotions. These enhanced emotions promoted bonding, a crucial achievement for the development of religion.). Ideas are unlikely to last if they cannot be utilised positively.

The phrase has driven contentious debates in which free speech and free choice are pitted against civility and inclusion. But it hasn't just changed meaning, it has changed targets.

It can, but does not have to mean, an outright obstruction of human rights relating to speech. ‘Chilling’ does not necessarily mean to make ice cold; the metaphorical suggestion of temperature suggests a scale of deterrence from cool to freezing. The chilling effect is used to describe overt censorship such as a government banning publication of a book, as well as more subtle controls such as ambiguous legislation and high legal costs that provoke uncertainty and fear among writers and journalists.)\).
1.4.4.1. Pro: Limiting speech seldom liberates people. Rather, it normalises [censorship](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/how-respond-disinformation-while-protecting-free-speech)(A controversial law in Pakistan provides no definition of fake news and states that content should be labelled as false if the Pakistani regulatory authority says it is false. \n\nSimilarly, Vietnam’s Law on Cybersecurity has a broad prohibition on disinformation \(although it is only labelled as “conduct which is strictly prohibited”\) which includes “distorting history, denying revolutionary achievements, destroying the national solidarity block” and “providing false information, causing confusion amongst the citizens,” and “cheating or tricking, manipulating, training or drilling people to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.”), which is most likely to harm [marginalized](https://www.anewseducation.com/post/what-is-shadow-banning-on-instagram)(Often a post is reviewed due to other users reporting the image, which disproportionately impacts marginalised communities as they are more likely to have their post’s reported.

1.4.4.1.1. Con: Identity politics advocates are often specific in their calls for censorship. For example, they may support [penalties](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/02/criminalising-street-harassment-britain-france-catcalling-groping)(Of the 1,004 girls and young women aged between 14 and 21 they surveyed, 66% had experienced unwanted sexual attention, grabbing or groping, or indecent exposure. But 42% of them didn’t tell anyone. 33% said they were “too embarrassed” to open up, 28% didn’t think they’d be taken seriously, and 14% said they had kept quiet because they felt they were to blame.\n\nIt’s a stark contrast to news from France, where nearly 450 fines have been issued since new legislation came into effect in August last year. Sexist behaviour – which includes catcalling, unwanted sexual attention or degrading comments – can now result in an on-the-spot fine of up to €750.) for [catcalling](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/blog/voices/2018/04/11/catcalling-not-a-joke-not-a-compliment-its-harassment)(Street harassment is one of the most pervasive forms of violence against women and girls. It's a type of sexual harassment and includes catcalling, unwanted comments, gestures, honking and uninvited sexual advances from strangers in a public place. \n\nWhen women and girls face harassment as part of their daily lives, whether it's while going for a run or getting the bus to see friends, it holds them back. Many change their clothes, or routes to work, to try to avoid it. It can prevent them from working, from socialising, from learning, and from living with freedom and dignity. This is not acceptable. No woman or girl should feel afraid in the streets of her own city.) as it makes people feel unsafe.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: A penalty for actions deemed to be harassment and assault like catcalling is not an example of [censorship](https://www.britannica.com/topic/censorship)(censorship, the changing or the suppression or prohibition of speech or writing that is deemed subversive of the common good.).
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Not all identity politics advocates support restrictions on speech.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: The [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/free-speech-can-be-messy-we-need-it)(That’s why I’m a true believer in the First Amendment. I am an anti-authoritarian.

And because I want students everywhere to be able to take a knee without fear of government censorship, I know we have to cherish our robust First Amendment — even for speech that is hateful.) has long defended the First Amendment to the US Constitution, noting that it is vital to protect marginalised groups from state overreach.
1.4.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Abolitionist feminist groups](https://abolitionistfutures.com/latest-news/the-false-promise-of-hate-crime-laws)(For example, some of the groups advocating for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime have emphasised the problem of street harassment, cat calling and online trolling. These are pressing problems that need to be addressed, but it is unlikely that most of these behaviours will meet the threshold for prosecution as a hate crime.\n\nEven if such incidents did meet the hate crime threshold \(or new criminal laws were enacted to specifically target these behaviours\), it is unlikely that these laws would actually reduce such behaviour. This is because hate crime laws are an investment in punishment after a harm has occurred rather than a strategy to prevent harm in the first place. And punishment, particularly via imprisonment, is not actually an effective tactic for preventing or reducing harm.) decry the criminalisation of catcalling, noting that such prohibitions increase the number of people imprisoned [without actually changing society](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/anti-asian-hate-crimes-bill-abolition)(As radical American political activist Angela Davis has said, “Prisons do not disappear social problems, they disappear human beings.” And this only further destabilizes already disenfranchised communities.).
1.4.4.1.2.3. Con: Even if they do not support outright government censorship, many identity politics supporters advocate for forms of informal censorship, like [Twitter mobs](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/10/new-puritans-mob-justice-canceled/619818/)(The censoriousness, the shunning, the ritualized apologies, the public sacrifices—these are rather typical behaviors in illiberal societies with rigid cultural codes, enforced by heavy peer pressure. This is a story of moral panic, of cultural institutions policing or purifying themselves in the face of disapproving crowds. The crowds are no longer literal, as they once were in Salem, but rather online mobs, organized via Twitter, Facebook, or sometimes internal company Slack channels. After Alexi McCammond was named editor in chief of Teen Vogue, people discovered and recirculated on Instagram old anti-Asian and homophobic tweets she had written a decade earlier, while still a teenager. McCammond apologized, of course, but that wasn’t enough, and she was compelled to quit the job before starting.), that deter opponents from expressing their opinions.
1.4.4.1.2.4. Con: Identity politics are more likely to encourage [restrictions](https://www.frieze.com/article/corrosiveness-identity-politics-art)(Identity – once the object of political and social debates in terms of difference, hybridity and the demand for mutual respect – has become static. Diversity takes the place of difference. Identity becomes a property to be defended, legitimizing its owners to strike and to silence trespassers. Affect in this setting becomes the watchdog – not only sounding the alarm but attacking everyone who allegedly climbs over the fence of these sacred grounds of identity.\n\nIdentity politics as a strategy for emancipation and self-empowerment was flawed from the beginning because identity is an exclusionary concept... But today, identity politics and the tactics of outrage have been successfully usurped by, among others, white nationalist and far-right, so-called identitarian, movements in Europe and the US, which exploit identity’s basically exclusionary structure.) on speech than other forms of political campaigning, as identity is necessarily exclusionary and requires strict boundaries to maintain.
1.4.4.1.2.4.1.

It rid itself of many QAnon groups and far-right militias. But it is also struck at leftwing organizations, seeming to accept Trump’s post-Charlottesville “both sides” moral equivalency with little thought. Facebook removed It’s Going Down, a platform that has long provided on-the-ground analysis of mass protests. It also removed CrimethInc, an anarchist publication that provided a teenage me with a new lens in which to view formative events like the invasion of Iraq and the 2008 economic crisis. While both these sites are keystones of the left, they were quickly disappeared from Facebook with little public attention or reaction.) of prominent voices on both extremes of the political spectrum.
1.4.4.1.2.4.2. Pro: Identity politics advocates often problematize [common words and concepts](https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/western-philosophy-as-white-supremacism/)(Kant famously argues that rational creatures must be treated as ends and not merely as means. He calls that “dignity” and holds it to be a \(or the\) most basic moral principle that persons with such dignity must be treated with “respect.” The complement of this doctrine is that irrational creatures can legitimately be treated as mere means, and with disrespect. To claim of some person or some culture that it is irrational and hence animalistic, opens them to the use of creatures who regard themselves as rational, such as Kant’s European readership.\n\nIn the first European defense of the African slave trade \(1444\), a Portuguese courtier \(Gomes Eanes de Zurara\) argued that Africans were better off in slavery, and claimed that in Africa “They lived like beasts, without any custom of civilized beings. . . They were without covering of clothes, or the lodgement of houses; and worst of all, they had no understanding of good, but only knew how to live in bestial sloth.”), emphasizing their supposedly oppressive nature. Those who benignly continue to use them face harmful backlash.
1.4.4.1.2.4.3. Con: Censorship is common in [hierarchical systems](https://hbr.org/2007/05/why-employees-are-afraid-to-speak)(What would you think if you overheard an employee confiding in another, “If I tell the director…what customers are saying, my career will be shot”? We actually heard this, verbatim, in the course of our research on communication in a leading high-technology corporation. Our study suggests that this type of self-censorship is common, from the rank and file right up through senior management... half the employee respondents in a recent culture survey had revealed that they felt it was not “safe to speak up” or challenge traditional ways of doing things. What they were most reticent to talk about were not problems but rather creative ideas for improving products, processes, or performance.\n\nWhy? In a phrase, self-preservation. While it’s obvious why employees fear bringing up certain issues, such as whistle-blowing, we found the innate protective instinct so powerful that it also inhibited speech that clearly would have been intended to help the organization.), as people are dependent on one another for success.
1.4.4.1.2.4.4. Con: Interpersonal conflict, like cancelling or online criticism, is not equivalent to punitive treatment from the state.
1.4.4.1.2.4.4.1. Con: It is reductive to assume that just because something is not prohibited by the state then it is not harmful, as many [dangerous acts](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/dec/30/is-skiing-the-worlds-most-dangerous-sport)(Their results show the importance of experience; 49% of injured snowboarders were beginners compared to 18% of skiers. Wrist and ankle injuries are far more likely among snowboarders while skiers are more likely to damage their knees during a fall. \n\nOverall though, snowboarding carries a higher risk of injury and, according to Professor Michael Henrie at the University of Utah, has become more dangerous - Henrie found that there were 6.97 snowboarding injuries per 1,000 visits in 2001, compared to 3.37 per 1,000 ten years earlier.\n0.9 per 1,000\n\nIn a separate study of skiers in Norway, a medical officer documented 883 injuries over 980,000 days - amounting to an injury rate of around 0.9 per 1,000 days.

For example, CSOs in Bhutan are said to be reluctant to raise issues around women’s rights that are considered by the government to be sensitive \(US Department of State, 2017\). The rationale behind such a balancing act is to advance specific causes where CSOs see a potential for improving the existing situations, rather than working on issues where progress is not considered possible at the present time and which may jeopardise working relationships with local authorities.)\), identity politics fuels censorship that should be combatted.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Limiting free speech may quell [the evolution of ideas](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/arguments-limiting-speech/601066/)(Liberal free-speech regimes are better than any alternative ever tried at subjecting all ideas to scrutiny, and at preventing powerful actors from quashing truth seekers. “As we check and criticize and find common ground, as we propose ideas and they fall apart and we try again, our knowledge advances,” Rauch writes.) by treating some topics as taboo, instead of rigorously unpacking and rebutting them.
1.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Speech is not good in and of itself; it is a speech act's instrumental value that makes it worthy of protection. Thus, identity politics advocates are right to restrict harmful speech.
1.4.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Identity politics ensure that new ideas adhere to basic moral rules, namely respect for different experiences within the citizenry, and an [opposition to oppression](https://www.philosophytalk.org/blog/identity-politics)(Identity politics is when people of a particular race, ethnicity, gender, or religion form alliances and organize politically to defend their group’s interests. The feminist movement, the civil rights movement, and the gay liberation movement are all examples of this kind of political organizing.).
1.4.4.1.3.2. Con: Accepting all forms of speech could ultimately lead to the [degradation](https://www.openculture.com/2019/03/does-democracy-demand-the-tolerance-of-the-intolerant-karl-poppers-paradox.html)(Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. - In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.) of society and politics; as such, tolerance is not an objective virtue.
1.4.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: [Far-right political parties](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/countering-radical-right/how-far-right-took-over-mainstream/)(In her recent landmark book, “Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism”, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Anne Appelbaum has harrowingly outlined the ‘rise’ of authoritarianism in Poland, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the United States, amongst other countries. Applebaum presciently points to how her former allies and even friends on the centre right have now become “sycophants to authoritarians” and have hollowed out or largely rejected key liberal democratic values.\n\nLike Applebaum I argue that we should be deeply worried about \(a\) what scholars such as Cas Mudde term, both the ‘mainstreaming’ and \(b\) ‘normalisation’ of radical right discourse in global politics, particularly by ‘mainstream’ parties. This is a worrying trend that arguably serves to legitimise populist radical right parties by bringing their discourse into the mainstream and therefore making it publicly acceptable amongst voters.) prosper in democracies that do not filter out exclusionary parties. Advocates of identity politics argue that we ought not tolerate parties who wish harm upon others.
1.4.4.1.3.3. Pro: In a true [marketplace of ideas](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/999/marketplace-of-ideas)(This concept draws on an analogy to the economic marketplace, where, it is claimed, through economic competition superior products sell better than others. Thus, the economic marketplace uses competition to determine winners and losers, whereas the marketplace of ideas uses competition to judge truth and acceptability. This theory of speech therefore condemns censorship and encourages the free flow of ideas as a way of viewing the First Amendment.), the ideas that would degrade society and inhibit the speech of others would be challenged and thrown away, making them less powerful.
1.4.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.4.4.1.5. Pro: Those with power can successfully [appeal or usurp](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/07/us/cancel-culture-accountability-reality-trnd/index.html)(Bestselling country artist Morgan Wallen faced criticism after he was caught saying a racial slur on camera. Some radio stations decided to stop playing his songs, but they climbed up the Spotify charts nonetheless, and his album sales and social media followers skyrocketed. So far, his career has certainly not be canceled.\nNeither were the careers of Lana Del Ray, Doja Cat, Camila Cabello, Justin Bieber or other singers accused of racist speech. \n\nGina Carano, who played a supporting role on Disney's "The Mandalorian," was fired after comparing the treatment of conservatives to the Holocaust.\nShe's not banned from getting work, and in fact has already landed herself another gig -- funded by conservative pundit Ben Shapiro.) instances of censorship against them. The marginalised rarely can, making their censorship more permanent.
1.4.4.1.6. Con: Critics of identity politics often [conflate](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/05/19/americans-and-cancel-culture-where-some-see-calls-for-accountability-others-see-censorship-punishment/)(Given that cancel culture can mean different things to different people, the survey also asked about the more general act of calling out others on social media for posting content that might be considered offensive – and whether this kind of behavior is more likely to hold people accountable or punish those who don’t deserve it.\n\nOverall, 58% of U.S. adults say in general, calling out others on social media is more likely to hold people accountable, while 38% say it is more likely to punish people who don’t deserve it. But views differ sharply by party. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that, in general, calling people out on social media for posting offensive content holds them accountable \(75% vs. 39%\). Conversely, 56% of Republicans – but just 22% of Democrats – believe this type of action generally punishes people who don’t deserve it.) lively criticism with censorship. This is an illegitimate way of stifling discourse as it discredits arguments without engaging with them.
1.4.4.2. Con: Cancel culture typically only affects those with power. Given that power, their 'cancellation' rarely impedes their speech.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Those who claim they have been cancelled are typically wealthy and able to [weather](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a33296561/cancel-culture-a-force-for-good-or-a-threat-to-free-speech/)(The journalist and author Owen Jones argued on Twitter that “All too often, ‘cancel culture’ becomes a means for very rich and very powerful people to pretend they are victims when people respond to very controversial things they have used their huge public platform to say”. The situation has become heated indeed.) the criticism they receive because of their financial and social power.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: A variety of prominent writers and academics signed an [open letter](https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/)(Powerful protests for racial and social justice are leading to overdue demands for police reform, along with wider calls for greater equality and inclusion across our society, not least in higher education, journalism, philanthropy, and the arts. But this needed reckoning has also intensified a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity. As we applaud the first development, we also raise our voices against the second. The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat to democracy. But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion—which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting.

Pro: Despite being cancelled, [Dave Chappelle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-17/dave-chappelle-s-special-cost-more-than-squid-game)(While reporting on the growing unrest at Netflix over Dave Chappelle’s new special “The Closer,” we obtained internal Netflix data that offered the clearest picture yet of how the service measures the success of its projects. \n\nNetflix makes this information available to hundreds of its employees, some of whom feel the company should reconsider working with Chappelle – not just because they consider him transphobic, but because it is a poor use of Netflix’s money.\n\nChappelle’s specials are the most-watched on the service, but they are also the most expensive. About 24 million people watched a previous special, “Sticks & Stones,” which cost the service $23.6 million, according to the documents. \(“The Closer” cost $24.1 million.\)), [Louis C.K.](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a39635251/louis-ck-grammy-fickle-cancel-culture-will-smith-oscars/)(Louis C.K. is one of the last people you’d have expected to win a Grammy award on Sunday night.

1.4.4.2.2. Con: Cancel culture often targets those [without power](https://www.vox.com/22384308/cancel-culture-free-speech-accountability-debate)(People who call for accountability on social media seem to slide quickly into wanting to administer punishment instead. In some cases, this process really does play out with a mob mentality, one that seems bent on inflicting pain and hurt while allowing no room for growth and change, showing no mercy, and offering no real forgiveness — let alone allowing for the possibility that the mob itself might be entirely unjustified.\n\nSee, for example, trans writer Isabel Fall, who wrote a short story in 2020 that angered many readers with its depiction of gender dysphoria through the lens of militaristic warfare. \(The story has since become a finalist for a Hugo Award.\) Because Fall published under a pseudonym, people who disliked the story assumed she must be transphobic rather than a trans woman wrestling with her own dysphoria. Fall was harassed, doxed, forcibly outed, and driven offline.). In these cases, it can be especially harmful.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Pro: Call-outs are often poorly targeted, harming those who minorly [misstepped](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/style/loretta-ross-smith-college-cancel-culture.html)(She doesn’t believe people should be publicly shamed for accidentally misgendering a classmate, which she once did, leading to a Title IX complaint that was later dismissed; for sending a stupid tweet they now regret; or for, say, admitting they once liked a piece of pop culture now viewed in a different light, such as “The Cosby Show.”\n\n“If it were on TV right now, I’d watch the reruns,” she said.\n\n“What I’m really impatient with is calling people out for something they said when they were a teenager when they’re now 55. I mean, we all at some point did some unbelievably stupid stuff as teenagers, right?”\n\nProfessor Ross thinks call-out culture has taken conversations that could have once been learning opportunities and turned them into mud wrestling on message boards, YouTube comments, Twitter and at colleges like Smith, where proving one’s commitment to social justice has become something of a varsity sport.) long ago, and are often used as a means to prove one's legitimacy as an identity politics advocate.
1.4.4.2.3. Pro: It is those with power and a large audience that can most frequently be condemned. For those without that platform, there is often not enough interest or people willing to cancel them.
1.4.4.2.4. Con: '[Doxxing](https://theweek.com/twitter/1012735/conservatives-complain-of-doxxing-after-expose-reveals-woman-behind-libs-of-tiktok)(Conservatives accused journalist Taylor Lorenz of "harassment" and "doxxing" — revealing someone's identity online with malicious intent — after her article revealing the identity of the woman behind the popular "Libs of TikTok" social media account was published in The Washington Post on Tuesday.)', where the personal details and address of people are leaked online, has become a regular part of cancel culture. This is dangerous regardless of one's social power.
1.4.4.2.5. Con: The belief that cancel culture only affects the powerful may be an example of [survivorship bias](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200827-how-survivorship-bias-can-cause-you-to-make-mistakes)(In simple terms, this comes about when we select only the ‘survivors’ – those that outperformed the rest, whether people, machines or companies – and come to conclusions based on their attributes, without looking more broadly at the whole dataset, including those with similar characteristics that failed to perform as well. \n\nThe most famous example of survivorship bias dates back to World War Two. At the time, the American military asked mathematician Abraham Wald to study how best to protect airplanes from being shot down. The military knew armour would help, but couldn’t protect the whole plane or would be too heavy to fly well. Initially, their plan had been to examine the planes returning from combat, see where they were hit the worst – the wings, around the tail gunner and down the centre of the body – and then reinforce those areas.); it only appears as though the threat of cancel culture only impacts people in power because only they can withstand it and remain visible.
1.4.4.2.5.1. Pro: [Many young adults remain silent](https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/mental-health/cancel-culture-psychology/)(Americans do not speak freely in everyday situations. And 61 percent of young adults said that they hadn’t spoken up on at least one occasion over the past year because they were afraid of being cancelled or experiencing another form of retaliation.) out of fear of cancel culture. This illustrates that the impact of cancel culture is not 'typically' limited to the highly visible and powerful examples.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Identity politics fuels cancel culture, by making it easier to accuse people of discriminatory behavior, even if such accusations are based on [tangential or flimsy evidence](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/former-youtuber-lindsay-ellis-says-s-learning-live-trauma-canceled-rcna35389)(“I can see where if you squint, I was implying all Asian-inspired properties are the same, especially if you were already privy to those conversations where I had not seen them. But the basic framework of TLA is becoming popular in fantasy fiction outside of Asian inspired stuff,” Ellis wrote.\n\nThe use of the word “squint,” which has historically been used as a pejorative directed at Asian people, resulted in Ellis’ name trending on Twitter, with thousands admonishing her. \n\nOne month after the tweets, Ellis published a video entitled “Mask Off” to her 1.2 million YouTube subscribers. In the nearly two-hour video, Ellis explained, contextualized, and apologized for nearly every perceived infraction she had committed during the decade she had spent as a public figure online. In the video, she also shared her experience with sexual assault.).
1.4.4.3.1. Con: People have always been "cancelled" in one form or another \([p. 89](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2057047320961562)(“Cancel culture” is situated within the Habermasean concept of the public sphere which assumes public discourse is the realm of the elites. Earlier examples of discursive accountability practices, including reading, dragging, calling out, in and even canceling, are the creations of Black counterpublics that are conspicuously absent from the American public imaginary, which holds a lofty vision of newspaper op-ed pages, radio shows, town-hall meetings, and the like as forums of debate where a multiplicity of discursive publics are equally empowered to engage in debate and the free expression of ideas. This simply isn’t so.\n\nFor instance, canceling’s analog antecedents - blacklisting and boycotting - are also mediated processes, though limited both in scope and effectiveness by factors of structural power, time, and access to resources. Producers and casting directors, for example, have the ability to categorically deny employment in the entertainment industry.)\). Identity politics is not unique in supporting this trend; it merely seeks to democratise it.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: Sometimes, people are legitimately accused of discriminatory behavior. Cancel culture makes it easier to [remove](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/06/callout-culture-black-lives-matter-adidas-bon-appetit-lea-michele/613054/)(Vulture’s Dee Lockett suggests that the online reckonings of late would be best described as demonstrating not “cancel culture” but “accountability culture.” That’s a good suggestion - in part because the notion of “accountability” might help this culture police itself against excess and drift. At BuzzFeed, Tomi Obaro has persuasively written about the potential pitfalls ahead. ... She also points out that “we have been here before,” with past moments of anti-racist reckoning leading only to small, mostly fleeting change for institutions. It’s hard to argue with that concern. On-the-ground mass protests also have a cyclical, two-steps-forward-one-step-back record on enacting progress. But if the powerful figures now vowing to do better after being put on blast both online and in the streets are to be held to their word, it’ll require another round of callouts.) these people as people without power are able to share their disdain and gain support.
1.4.4.3.3. Con: False or exaggerated accusations of discriminatory behaviour are more often the result of social media — which encourages anonymous, unaccountable, and [inflammatory interactions](http://www.campustimes.org/2022/01/30/this-is-what-cancel-culture-taken-too-far-actually-looks-like/)(The Twitter crowd accused Ellis of racism for comparing two properties heavily inspired by Asian cultures, even going so far as to imply that comments like Ellis’s were a contributing factor to anti-Asian hate crimes. This innocuous Tweet triggered a campaign of harassment so severe that Ellis recently announced that she’s effectively quitting the Internet...\nThe second lesson is that the specific breed of cancel culture that made Ellis, in her own words, “\[shit\] blood for weeks on end” from sheer stress, is the result and tacit acceptance of online political spaces as social cliques instead of actual political movements with real world consequences. This is a way for people to collect brownie points and look like good little activists for joining in on a dogpile that serves as a low-effort, emotionally-gratifying substitute for actual political activism.) — than of identity politics movements.
1.4.4.3.4. Pro: The [vocabulary](https://www.insider.com/cancel-culture-meaning-history-origin-phrase-used-negatively-2020-7)(On one end of the spectrum are people like Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and R. Kelly who were canceled by the public before their sex-crimes trials. On the other end are everyday people like David Shor, who faced criticism on Twitter after he tweeted a study from an academic journal questioning the political consequences of violent and peaceful protests. Shor, who tweeted the link during the George Floyd protests, was fired, though the company has said it wasn't over the tweet.\n\nDespite the seemingly positive intentions of many cancellations — to "demand greater accountability from public figures," as Merriam-Webster's evaluation of the phrase notes — people tend to call out cancel culture itself as a negative movement, suggesting that the consequences of cancellation are too harsh in minor instances or represent rushed judgment in complicated situations.) of those who engage in 'cancelling' often comes from identity politics movements.
1.4.4.3.5. Pro: Pages like '[Your Fave Is Problematic](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/your-fave-is-problematic-tumblr.html)(If you were on Tumblr in the early 2010s, you may remember a blog called Your Fave Is Problematic. If not, its content should still sound familiar to you. The posts contained long lists of celebrities’ regrettable \(racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ethnophobic, ableist and so on\) statements and actions — the stuff that gets people canceled these days.\n\nThat blog was my blog. I spent hours researching each post; as you can probably imagine, my search history was pretty ugly.\n\nYour Fave Is Problematic had around 50,000 followers at its peak, in 2014, when I was a high school senior, but its influence was outsized. I got in a feud with a prominent young adult fiction author over his inclusion.

The page was operated by six moderators, some as young as 17, and created something of a benchmark in modern language and behavioural politics as we see it now. Before I came across this website, the concepts of cultural appropriation, microaggressions, fat shaming as a body politic and not just an insult, transmisogyny, the word cis and a slew of others were essentially new to me, and, I imagine, to a lot of other people. These terms were presented via the criticism of celebrities, something we all, consciously or not, partake in regularly. But instead of criticising their weight or relationships or haircut or what have you, they criticised their politics, their attitudes, their lack of awareness on cultural issues.) for celebrities, using little evidence. Many of the posts rely heavily on the concepts of identity politics.
1.5. Con: Identity politics are one of the most effective ways to combat oppression on a sociopolitical level.
1.5.1. Con: Identity politics are unpopular and unlikely to gain significant political support.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Given that identity politics are unpopular, they often inadvertently give more support to those who want to discriminate against others.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: When mainstream parties rhetorically emphasize identity politics, voters that feel left out by this rhetoric will move to opposing parties thereby weakening movements for social change.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: If one party explicitly [positions itself](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/first-mover-advantage/)(The first-mover advantage refers to an advantage gained by a company that first introduces a product or service to the market. The first-mover advantage enables a company to establish strong brand recognition and product/service loyalty before other entrants to the market.) in favour of identity politics, their opposition may find it more electorally advantageous to oppose identity politics, thus furthering discrimination.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: Backlashes to identity politics movements are often short-term, as the social changes they make are normalized and accepted.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: The adoption of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 was [controversial at the time](https://law.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2016/09/12MissReportAug1964.pdf)(An example of this backlash and defection is shown in the poll reported by the New York Times, when in Chicago neighborhoods composed mostly of people of Polish Catholic backgrounds there was expressed hostility to President Johnson and friendliness to Senator Goldwater because of their respective stands on civil rights. The poll sample comprised people who usually vote Democratic. Other examples of this kind of “white backlash” are cited in the large percentages of the total vote gained by Alabama governor George Wallace in the several states in which he entered the primaries, and in the feared wholesale defection from the Democratic party by normally Democratic voters in Southern states.), but was quickly accepted in the US.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Con: The current opposition to identity politics in [the US](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11317202)(Demographically, several polls show that the Tea Party is overwhelmingly white and older than 45, and more likely to be male.\n\nThe group has been accused of racism and xenophobia, allegations most members vehemently deny.\n\nStill, many do not believe President Obama is an American, and Tea Party protesters were accused of hurling ugly epithets at black and gay members of Congress before last year's vote on healthcare reform.\n\nOne group erected a billboard in Iowa comparing Mr Obama to Hitler and Stalin.) and much of Europe has been ongoing for over a decade, representing an enduring harm that could harm minority groups.
1.5.1.1.4. Con: Identity politics advocates inform those who oppose their methods and persuade them of their value. Though a slow process, this may reduce discrimination in the long run.
1.5.1.1.5. Con: The policy recommendations of those who oppose identity politics are often far less popular than those made by identity politics advocates.
1.5.1.1.5.1. Con: Identity politics can diminish turnout among minorities, as they lose trust in politics if they hear issues important to their identity being cynically used by politicians they do not trust.
1.5.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Hillary Clinton's appeal to African-Americans in 2016 received a [mixed response](https://www.salon.com/2016/02/19/hillary_clintons_cynical_race_appeals_the_revenge_of_neoliberal_identity_politics/)(“It's possible that what Clinton's doing is trying to capture the segment of the black vote most likely to support ‘race man/woman policy’,” he emails. “Black moderate voters, black middle-to-upper income voters \(the ones who benefitted most from her husband's presidency\), with Sanders going after the segment of the black vote most likely to support standard ‘left policy’...black radical voters, black working class voters, youth \(the ones perhaps least likely to remember the Clinton presidency with fondness\)."), with some believing she was likely to merely pay [lip service](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hillary-clinton-does-not-deserve-black-peoples-votes/)(But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you’ll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie’s rhetoric because we must be “pragmatic,” “face political realities,” and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is “unrealistic” to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it’s probably best to leave the room.) to issues of racial injustice.
1.5.1.1.5.2. Pro: For example, the campaign to make abortion illegal in the US faces opposition from [most of the country](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/27/1107733632/poll-majorities-oppose-supreme-courts-abortion-ruling-and-worry-about-other-righ)(By a 56%-to-40% margin, respondents oppose the court's decision, including 45% who strongly oppose it.\n\nAlmost 9-in-10 Democrats and a slim majority of independents \(53%\) are against the decision. Three-quarters of Republicans, on the other hand, support it.).
1.5.1.1.6. Pro: As one identity group gains power in politics, a significant reactionary [backlash](https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/news-blogs/what-is-the-manosphere-and-why-is-it-a-concern/)(The report found that 50% of young men aged 16-24 believe feminism makes it more difficult for men to succeed.) usually emerges, ultimately harming the overall goal of the oppressed group.
1.5.1.1.6.1. Pro: The rise of the [Black Lives Matter](https://www.landmarkschool.org/our-school/landmark-360-blog/?id=253178/black-lives-matter-and-blue-lives-matter-explained)(Similar to All Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter is often used in contrast or as an argument to Black Lives Matter. The Black Lives Matter movement is not saying that the lives of police officers \(or firefighters\) are not as important as Black citizens. The goal is equality. Police officer’s lives matter and Black lives matter. Police departments provide valuable and often dangerous services to our communities and in our country. Black Lives Matter is not anti-police, but police reform is a significant element in the movement, including discussion on how police departments are funded and how we spend money on policing and community support. There is an understandable level of tension between Black Lives Matter protesters and Blue Lives Matter/Back the Blue supporters as many of the protests were sparked by the death or injury of a Black person in a police-involved shooting.) movement has also led to the rise of the [Blue Lives Matter](https://theweek.com/articles/960175/what-blue-lives-matter-always-about)(Now, it's been obvious from the start that Blue Lives Matter originated as a troll. It's a reference to the leftist slogan Black Lives Matter \(BLM\), of course, intended to both deflect attention from the ongoing plague of police brutality and to suggest that the left doesn't care about police lives. It's a typically dishonest piece of propaganda from a political movement that has an entirely instrumental relationship to facts — thus the maudlin carnival of fake grief whenever a police officer is killed in a way politically convenient to the far right \(or when the police kill a middle-class white person, something the far right would have ignored or celebrated prior to BLM\).) movement in opposition.
1.5.1.1.6.2. Pro: Some theorise that the [alt-right](https://stingingfly.org/review/kill-all-normies/)(Nagle stresses that the savagery of the backlash by the alt-right subcultures – including those radiating from the nihilistic sewer-site 4chan – was reflexive to the toxic absurdities of Web-fermented, US campus-nurtured identity politics. The alt-right were not the only ones exasperated by the sanctimony, puritanism, public shaming of dissenters, and open hostility towards straight white males that became normalised in recent years. All out war might not have erupted if social constructionist, identity political radicalism – and its attendant doctrinaire moralising – had remained within the Internet subcultures and campuses where it was spawned: the problem arose when it gained serious traction in mainstream life.) arose from the online left's attachment to identity politics, enabling a destructive [backlash](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-on-the-new-white-supremacy)(Another segment of the alt right refers to themselves as neo-reactionaries \(those who reject liberal democracy and ideas associated with the Enlightenment. Some neo-reactionaries refer to their theories as the “Dark Enlightenment.”\) Others call themselves “race realists” or alternately “HBD” advocates, a reference to human biodiversity \(a belief that one’s race governs traits such as behavior and intelligence—with non-whites being inferior to whites\). However they define themselves, alt righters reject egalitarianism, democracy, universalism and multiculturalism.).
1.5.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Far-right leaders like Steve Bannon have [publicly said](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/12/2/13718770/identity-politics)(Steve Bannon thinks identity politics are great for President Donald Trump.\n\nThat’s what the president’s adviser told Robert Kuttner over at the American Prospect. “The Democrats,” he said, “the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”\n\nThe argument invokes a question that picked up steam after the 2016 election: Either Trump’s election was a rejection of identity politics or his election was a validation of the prominence of identity politics in the US.) that prominent forms of liberal identity politics help their movement.
1.5.1.1.6.3. Con: No meaningful social change has happened without opposition. Avoiding advocacy out of fear of opposition guarantees that the status quo remains, regardless of the need to improve society.
1.5.1.1.6.3.1. Con: While opposition may always arise in some form, identity politics inspire a high level of vitriol and resentment from majority groups by violating [social norms](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/projects/impoliteness/definitions.htm)(The lowest common denominator \[underlying definitions of impoliteness in Bousfield and Locher 2008\] can be summarized like this: Impoliteness is behaviour that is face-aggravating in a particular context. \(Locher and Bousfield 2008: 3\)\n\n\[rude behaviour\] does not utilise politeness strategies where they would be expected, in such a way that the utterance can only almost plausibly be interpreted as intentionally and negatively confrontational. \(Lakoff 1989: 103\)\n\n\[...\] rudeness is defined as a face threatening act \(FTA -- or feature of an FTA such as intonation -- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction of the social context in which it occurs. \(Beebe 1995:159\)\n\n\[...\] impoliteness, communicative strategies designed to attack face, and thereby cause social conflict and disharmony \[...\] \(Culpeper et al. 2003: 1546\)).
1.5.1.2. Con: Many radical ideas are [initially unpopular](https://crestresearch.ac.uk/comment/reverse-waves-how-radical-ideas-spread-and-take-hold/)(Do ‘waves’ and ‘reverse waves’ unfold in similar ways? Generally, any idea that challenges convention or undermines social consensus teases the boundary of what is considered as acceptable. This is as true of ideas involving emancipatory, inclusive change as of ideas calculated to divide, exclude, and persecute. The mechanisms for diffusion are essentially the same: breaking a previous taboo; gaining traction by receiving new adherents and mobilising human resources; and, finally, if successful, spreading further through multiple channels of interaction, getting translated in the process to respond to the requirements of different contexts.) but gain political traction over time. Therefore, even if a cause starts out with little enthusiasm, it can still make great changes.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Martin Luther King Jr. was [greatly disliked](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-martin-luther-king-had-75-percent-disapproval-rating-year-he-died-180968664/)(According to an early 1968 Harris Poll, the man whose half-century of martyrdom we celebrate this week died with a public disapproval rating of nearly 75 percent, a figure shocking in its own day and still striking even in today’s highly polarized political climate.\n\nWhite racial resentment was still a critical factor at that point. But Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s unfavorable numbers were at least 25 points higher in 1968 than in 1963, and his faltering appeal over the final years of his life was also a consequence of appearing to fall behind his times in some respects even as he was leaping well ahead of them in others.) during his initial campaigning. However, he became an American icon as the changes he fought for were normalized.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: Proposals to '[defund the police](https://www.police1.com/health-wellness/articles/support-for-defund-the-police-has-dropped-nationwide-poll-finds-RvHkZ7nWw8X7WotJ/)(The poll of 1,000 people nationwide found that “defund the police” policies remain highly unpopular, even more so than in a UMass poll from April of 2021.\n\nSupport for transferring funding from state and local police departments to social services dropped from 38% to 31%. But while opposition remained relatively stable at about 45%, UMass’ poll found the number of people with no opinion on the topic jumped from 17% to 23%.)' have received little mainstream support despite their recurrence in identity politics advocacy.
1.5.1.3. Con: Many policies are not [wedge issues](https://www.theatlantic.com/membership/archive/2017/12/the-irresistible-effectiveness-of-wedge-politics/547946/)(Wedge politics involves treating Aristotle’s “Law of the Excluded Middle” as universal. If one side of an issue is right, then the other must be wrong—there is no in-between. Controversial topics like abortion, gun control, or confederate statues are polarizing, forcing people to choose a side, for or against. Voters may feel debates about wedge issues leave no room for nuance. But wedge issues, despite sometimes annoying the electorate, have proven to effectively galvanize support in a two party system.\n\nThey may degrade the quality of public discourse, but a skillful use of wedge issues can also help make change in areas that otherwise seem intractable, political scientists told me. By turning an otherwise dormant issue into a vitally important dividing line, wedge politics force the nation to have a debate, and politicians to make clear where they stand.), meaning that they do not divide people into oppositional political groups. Through identity politics, more issues are brought to the fore and become important.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Formulating uncontentious policies with an awareness of gender inequality can drastically improve their [outcomes](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/28/invisible-women-by-caroline-criado-perez-review)(Even snow-ploughing, it turns out, is a feminist issue: in Sweden, roads were once cleared before pavements, a policy derived from data that prioritised commuters in cars over pedestrians ferrying children or doing the shopping. But then officials realised that it’s easier to drive through three inches of snow than push a buggy through it. Clearing pavements first also saved the state money: a study in one Swedish town found that pedestrians were three times more likely to be injured in icy conditions than car drivers; and 70% of those injured were women.).
1.5.1.3.2. Con: Drawing attention to issues can cause them to become politically polarised, making it harder to expand legislation with new research, as people are often [intolerant](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2022/01/26/reducing-extreme-polarization-is-key-to-stabilizing-democracy/)(The ARM has two rules of opinion change. The first rule states that agents are more likely to interact with other agents that have similar opinions; social scientists call this well-established phenomenon “homophily.” The second rule states that when agents with similar opinions interact, their opinions move closer together \(i.e., they attract, as in the Axelrod culture model\). Conversely, when dissimilar agents interact, their opinions move further apart \(i.e., they repulse\). Tolerance is the degree of similarity between opinions that interacting agents find attractive, and beyond which they find repulsive.).
1.5.1.4. Pro: Many large-scale policy ideas supported by identity politics advocates are unpopular because they are deemed harmful and unjust.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Identity politics advocates often support quotas for minorities in parliaments and businesses that undermine the principles of meritocracy while rallying little support in either domain \([p. 4](https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_1614C667B2FC.P001/REF.pdf)(Second, the quota was perceived as contradicting the principle of \(formal\) equality that applies to candidates for elections. When the debate resurfaced in the beginning\nof the 1990s, in part, thanks to a European network of experts on gender balance in decision-making and the influence of international norms following the Beijing conference, French parity activists faced tremendous opposition.)\).
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: Adopting quotas, regardless of political support, can greatly improve gender equality. Identity politics advocates thus support just policies that, if implemented, would be highly beneficial \([p. 11](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/9120/WDR2012-0008.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)(Improves substantive representation: A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that men and women differ in policy preferences. For instance, Miller shows that an increase in female suffrage in the U.S. led directly to an increase in healthcare spending. Besley and Coate uses a theoretical model to demonstrate how implemented policies often reflect policy-maker preferences, while Pande presents causal evidence of mandated political representation of various caste groups resulting in increased transfers to those groups in India. Along these lines, a lack of female leadership translates directly into an underrepresentation of women’s interests in policy decisions. Increasing the proportion of female leaders through quotas\ncan improve representation of women’s policy interests.)\).
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: Many identity politics supporters advocate for the paying of [reparations](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherstwcvb-poll-finds-nearly-half)(Nearly two-thirds of Americans and 90% of Republicans oppose the idea of providing reparations to the descendants of slaves, according to the results of a nationwide University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB poll released today.) from groups in power to those who faced oppression. To many, this is an unfavorable proposal.
1.5.1.4.2.1. Con: Without reparations, many oppressed groups will [continue](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/)(Perhaps no statistic better illustrates the enduring legacy of our country’s shameful history of treating black people as sub-citizens, sub-Americans, and sub-humans than the wealth gap. Reparations would seek to close this chasm. But as surely as the creation of the wealth gap required the cooperation of every aspect of the society, bridging it will require the same... \nWon’t reparations divide us? Not any more than we are already divided. The wealth gap merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say—that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution. What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.) to suffer from economic inequality to the benefit of their oppressors. Thus, even if unpopular, they are a just policy.
1.5.1.4.2.1.1. Con: [Individualised requests](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/12/protests-some-white-people-gift-cash-black-comrades-but-why/5335452002/)("We're not going to Venmo ourselves out of this crisis because the crisis needs a structural solution," said Raúl Pérez, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of La Verne in California. "It shouldn't just be these micro reparations. What about the macro reparations?") for funds from identity politics advocates often undermine radical efforts for reparations by trivialising racial and/or gendered injustices.
1.5.1.4.2.2. Pro: Many people do [not feel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47643630)(Bayard Rustin, who organised the March on Washington and was a friend of Martin Luther King Jr, called it a "ridiculous idea".\n\n"If my great-grandfather picked cotton for 50 years, then he may deserve some money, but he's dead and gone and nobody owes me anything," Mr Rustin told the New York Times in 1969.\n\nHe later expanded on the views, writing that a payout would demean "the integrity of blacks" and exploit white guilt.\n\n"It is insulting to Negroes to offer them reparations for past generations for suffering, as if the balance of an irreparable past could be set straight with a handout.") as if they directly suffered from the oppression of others. When identity politics advocates imply that they did, they may feel unjustly maligned.
1.5.1.4.2.3. Pro: Many white people, especially those who are themselves poor, oppose reparations as they feel they would incur large economic costs to finance the policy \([p. 278](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s12552-021-09348-x?sharing_token=8qJSFFC20uzPIWYOUJly4Pe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6Rhn_L0VKIC4eN5gN9wrVXWZxWyV24W3gDTs9nA0z7wKiuguh9Miz8hygR3SvzLaSGfkKwFEFDdN77yAPYHNhaeyr1UbFZRBMUUM-leQiXxLJEL12fIDM3TaUpIh81YrY=)(The observed effects of age and political ideology are consistent with past research: older and more conservative Americans tend to take positions on racial policy that reinforce the existing social structure. The broader set of significant predictors for the financial payments outcome suggests a more complex underlying story involving possible intersections of group threat/ competition, social identity, and relative deprivation. Specifically, certain Americans may be more likely than others to fear a loss of group-based status if whites are directly implicated in \(and held to account for\) the systematic oppression of black Americans.)\).
1.5.1.4.3. Con: As identity-based movements aim to tackle systemic harm, the injustice people see advocates to cause is actually the world being made fairer.
1.5.1.5. Pro: Some advocates of identity politics prioritize personal experiences over factual evidence \([p. 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17405904.2022.2061544)(SLU can be seen, on the one hand, as an example of how social media can play an important role in raising the profile of social justice movements, becoming, an outlet for formerly silenced voices, for example, in relation to issues of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. The personal stories of the kind shared by SLU can provide one way to allow people to ‘recognize that their experiences of oppression or discrimination are not isolated’. It can offer a sense of empowerment through openly speaking out about personal stories of ‘trauma, injustice or violence’ instead of being silenced – what has been called a ‘politics of visibility’. And, importantly, such stories have the potential of doing the political work of consciousness-raising, drawing out ‘both internal and external forms of oppression’.)\). This can be unconvincing to others.
1.5.1.5.1. Pro: As facts are objective and unchanging, unlike personal experience, people often find them more persuasive when considering policies that could have a great impact on them.
1.5.1.5.2. Con: Emphasizing personal experiences through [storytelling](https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/connecting-neuroscience-storytelling-psychology-can-create-measurable-impact-refugee-youth/)(According to neurobiologist Paul Zak, stories actually influence brain chemistry. In various studies, Dr. Zak’s research has shown that stories of a particular structure can trigger the release of the hormone ‘oxytocin’, which is associated with connectedness, and by some empathy. Certain narratives also were found to be linked to the release of the stress hormone, ‘cortisol’, in listeners.) can be more persuasive than focusing on complex or difficult data.
1.5.1.5.3. Con: Personal experiences can be used as factual evidence, for example [in courts of law](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25639645)(One requirement unique to Scots Law is the need for corroboration of the essential facts in the case against the accused.\n\nIn other words that there must be two separate sources of evidence before a case can proceed to trial.\n\nIt means that the accused cannot be convicted on the word of one person alone with no supporting evidence.\n\nCorroborated evidence does not have to come from forensic science or witness testimony: it can be circumstantial or in certain cases can relate to the previous convictions of the accused.\n\nFor prosecutors, corroboration is a particular problem in rape cases, especially where the accused claims that sexual activity was consensual.), particularly when aggregated, as they are often vetted and affirmed by others.
1.5.1.5.3.1. Con: Judicial proceedings do not accept evidence as fact only because corroborating evidence exists. Such proceedings are critical of all evidence and test its veracity. Personal experiences, as used in identity politics, are not so thoroughly and critically examined.
1.5.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: If aggregated personal experiences are not critically examined for consistency, veracity, relevance, credibility, exaggeration, and bias/conflict of interest then they cannot be verified factual evidence. They are simply a collection of narratives sympathetic to a particular agenda/issue.
1.5.2. Con: Advocates of identity politics often merely pay [lip service](https://believermag.com/aside-affects-lauren-michele-jackson/)(What’s more, it aligned with boilerplate wisdom on the plights of “women” and “women of color,” respectively—imagined as orders of magnitude. Whatever can be said happens to “women” happens “especially,” “particularly,” “most,” and “worst” when color—“of color”—shows up. When the media documents non-white women this way, does it make them a part of the whole? Or apart from it? The “women” who lost jobs were not white, but the “women” imagined by the headlines must be; if women of color were the story, there would be no need for such asides. Women of color are women, but if that were true, one would expect we needn’t be reminded of it with such frequency. Gender was not meant for all.\n\nHere we see a version of a familiar technique: A detail professing inclusiveness is squirreled away as secondary information. An article takes note of the less fortunate, allows a brief pause for the further disadvantaged, and moves on with its premise, undeterred by this dispensable material.) to people's struggles instead of making them a priority in the goals of their activism; this [virtue signalling](https://theconversation.com/virtue-signalling-a-slur-meant-to-imply-moral-grandstanding-that-might-not-be-all-bad-145546)(Virtue signalling is an expression used to call out an individual, company, or organisation - suggesting they are only backing an idea to look good in the eyes of others.

1.5.2.1. Pro: Politicians can cynically use the rhetoric and imagery of identity politics to gain trust among voters, while more effectively pushing through harmful policies than other forms of political rhetoric.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Identity politics leaders often cultivate more trust in their supporters, making them less likely to face internal dissent and criticism when they put forward poor policy proposals.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Supporters often feel a close bond with leaders of identity politics movements \([p. 9](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/5/e054980.full.pdf)(As people tend to turn to such alternative explanations when they feel threatened or alienated, we\nanticipate that \(identity\) leaders can reduce the spread of such theories by ensuring that people feel safely embedded within a national community \(so that they feel a sense of ‘we’-ness\) and perceive their government as\nemblematic of this.)\); leaders are believed to share their followers' experiences and offer a sense of safety.
1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Social movements emphasising identity-based issues are often very willing to criticise their leaders, as evidenced by the recent [Black Lives Matter](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democratic-leaders-clash-black-lives-matter-activists-over-defund-police-n1227671)(Painted in bright yellow letters outside the White House are the words "DEFUND THE POLICE": a rallying cry for a movement to combat police brutality and racism that has exploded across the nation — and caused nervousness among Democrats.\n\nProtesters around the country demanding justice for George Floyd's death waved "Defund the Police!" signs at rallies in major cities on a weekend when Joe Biden officially became the presumptive Democratic nominee to face President Donald Trump in the fall.) protests.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Populist demagogues often achieve similar levels of trust by invoking the imagery of '[the people](https://demos-h2020.eu/en/populist-rhetoric)(Populist rhetoric It is a special type of political talk that divides the population into two categories: pure, moral, and victimized people and a corrupt, malfunctioning elite.

1.5.2.1.3. Con: Politicians often use their [personalities](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/inverted-beer-test/604282/)(This way of analyzing candidates and their supposed likability is now routine. But what if the old beer line gets the truth exactly backwards?\n\nMaybe it’s not that voters prefer the candidate they would rather have a beer with; maybe they prefer the candidate who would rather have a beer with them...\n\nA candidate’s attitudes toward “people like me” thus become a powerful heuristic. If a candidate generally likes people like me, then it seems plausible that he will look out for my interests in a wide range of scenarios. If he dislikes people like me—if he would hate sharing a beer with me, and secretly thinks I’m trash—then he is far more likely to sell me out.) to build rapport with voters, independent of their policy proposals and political skills.
1.5.2.1.4. Pro: The language of identity politics can be co-opted by other movements in pursuit of malignant aims \([pp. 243-244](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14742837.2021.1928484)(With their dubious or opaque funding sources, the latter sites might be considered ‘Astroturf’, or fake grassroots organisations, that have wealthy funders and mimic journalistic or grassroots output. Pro-Leave Facebook pages may also be investigated as ‘Astroturf’ organisations, for example, Get Britain Out – one of the most active pro-Brexit pages we identified – is run by bookseller Julian Blackwell, who, according to a Channel 4 News report, gave UKIP its second largest individual donation since 2001, and Jayne Adye, who writes\nfor Breitbart and the Daily Express. Such campaigns therefore lack authenticity through masquerading as bottom-up movements and hiding their elite support.)\). Thus, progressive campaigns should jettison identity politics if they wish to make progress.
1.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: Many have criticized the American Democratic Party for co-opting the language of identity politics while nonetheless pursuing policies that [harm](https://www.salon.com/2016/02/19/hillary_clintons_cynical_race_appeals_the_revenge_of_neoliberal_identity_politics/)(“I think it’s very cynical,” says Rutgers historian Donna Murch, the author of a recent New Republic article titled “The Clintons’ War on Drugs: When Black Lives Didn’t Matter.” “Saying that political economy doesn’t matter to black people, I think that that is terrible.

1.5.2.2. Con: Virtue signalling can be an important means for [flagging support](https://aeon.co/essays/why-virtue-signalling-is-not-just-a-vice-but-an-evolved-tool)(In defence of virtue signallers, research on signalling theory shows that even cheap talk can be useful.\n\nLife is rife with coordination problems... Coordination is crucial in the moral domain too... The paradox is that, even if many people are in this situation – everyone is concerned but convinced that no one else is – they might fail to act, despite having the majority opinion. But speaking up can start a chain reaction. The more individuals raise their voice to denounce what they see as a moral problem, the more the initially silent people realise they are not alone and speak up in turn.\n\nLoud and public signals are especially effective as establishing common knowledge of a moral norm ­making sure that everyone knows about the moral norm, that everyone else knows that everyone knows about the moral norm, that everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows \(and so on\).) for an issue, making it easier for people to coordinate activism.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Virtue signalling can be tiring for minorities who view it as a form of [white knighting](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/white-knight)("White Knight" \(also known as “Internet White Knight”\) is a pejorative term used to describe men who defend women on the Internet with the assumption that they are looking for a romantic reward in return.) that overshadows their more nuanced opinions on identity politics.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Just giving lip service to an issue can make voters perceive it as more important, making them more likely to discuss and vote to improve the highlighted issue.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: When majority groups believe that minorities benefit more from a policy, they are less likely to support it, even if they also benefit \([p. 962](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11109-022-09774-6.pdf)(The Great Society introduced new federal policies such as income support for the poor, housing subsidies, and affirmative action, promising to address inequality.\nHowever, these interventions allocated costs and benefits differentially across whites and minority groups—or were perceived to do so. As a result, many white Americans of the era believed that these new programs unfairly benefited African–Americans. Scholars argued that these negative policy perceptions contributed to the decline in public trust among whites in the 1970s and 1980s, with significant consequences for the federal government’s ability to address economic inequality.)\). Thus, virtue signalling could harm policy-making in the long-term.
1.5.2.3. Pro: People [dislike](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/living-finesse/202009/staying-authentic-when-those-around-you-are-not)(It can be challenging to hold onto your authenticity when you are around people who seem fake. Whether it is in a work setting, community interactions, or any other social encounter, it can be awkward to know how to respond without compromising your own internal guide. A fake laugh, unreasonably bubbly personality, or tone of voice that is incongruous with what is going on can be more than just off-putting; it can influence interactions and really throw us off at times...\n\nWe are less likely to feel safe enough to be vulnerable with people who are inauthentic, and when we perceive someone isn’t being real with us, we naturally feel guarded around them. All of this is exhausting and far too much work, which is why it is a good idea to have some general guidelines when engaging with someone who seems to be inauthentic.) disingenuous or inauthentic behaviour. Virtue signalling may, therefore, be off-putting, as identity politics advocates' words do not align with their behaviour.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Obama's pivot from [weaponising identity politics](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-goldberg-obama-mandela-hypocrisy-identity-politics-0723-20180720-story.html)(As president, and on his path to the presidency, Obama often exploited identity politics for partisan advantage. He called on Hispanic voters to “punish our enemies.” He appointed to the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor, who famously suggested that a “wise Latina” on the bench would come to better conclusions than a white male would.\n\nObama also had an annoying tendency to ascribe bad faith to anyone who didn't share his opinions or conclusions...\n\nI understand why some conservatives want to dismiss Obama’s statements. They only see the hypocrisy. But there's a reason we say hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue. Hypocrisy is a good gauge of a person’s sincerity in defense of an ideal.

Would it be better if he’d lived up to and defended these ideals better when he was president? Yes.) to attacking it was criticised as an act of hypocrisy that, for some, undermined his legitimacy.

They might be based on how we were brought up, on religious or spiritual tradition, on a particular sense of ethics, or an approach to life that we have adopted along the way.\n\nThere are no right or wrong values, and they are different for everyone. One person might most value being genuine in relationships, honesty, and having a good work ethic, while another’s values could consist of ‘giving people a fair go,’ being creative, and ‘always doing my best.’\n\nWhatever the history of our values, they are essentially our sense of the \(subjective\) right way for us to live.

A common debate between "personal" and "political" questioned whether women's consciousness-raising groups were a useful part of the political women's movement. According to Hanisch, calling the groups "therapy" was a misnomer, as the groups were not intended to solve any women's personal problems. Instead, consciousness-raising was a form of political action to elicit discussion about such topics as women's relationships, their roles in marriage, and their feelings about childbearing.) on the world. These changes can be flagged when virtue signalling, demonstrating to others that one has a new view of the world.
1.5.3. Pro: Advocates of identity politics have proposed clear paths for political change and improvements for those they represent.
1.5.3.1. Pro: By emphasising the importance of group cohesion and cooperation, identity politics make it easier for members of marginalized groups to form critical masses that create electoral change.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: In the United States, the [New Deal Coalition](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-ushistory/chapter/conclusion-the-legacy-of-the-new-deal/)(New Deal relief programs are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending the nation's economic problems on a macroeconomic level. Although fundamental economic indicators may have remained depressed, the programs were very popular among ordinary Americans. They improved the life of many citizens through providing jobs for the unemployed, legal protection for labor unions and some non-unionized industrial workers, modern utilities for rural America \(e.g., electricity\), living wages for the working poor, and price stability for farmers...\n\nDespite's Roosevelt's questionable record in respect to African Americans, even black voters, who until 1936 loyally supported Lincoln's Party, turned to the Democrats. What was known as the New Deal Coalition, turned the Democratic Party into a majority party, and shaped American politics until the 1960s, with some remnants of it existing into the 1980s.) created a broad alliance by uniting African Americans, immigrants, Irish Americans, and labor unions without giving primacy to any single identity. It was able to win major policy victories from the [1930s to 1960s](https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/the-american-franchise)(With FDR at its head, the Democratic Party put together a formidable coalition whose main components were lower-income groups in the great cities—African Americans, union members, and ethnic and religious minorities, many from recent immigrant groups—and the traditional source of Democratic strength, "the Solid South." Roosevelt carried every former Confederate state all four times he ran, but no Democrat has done so since 1944, FDR's final race. This "New Deal coalition," as it came to be known, powered the Democratic Party for the next thirty years. Its strong hold on these voters was due largely to the social, political, economic, and cultural changes wrought by the Depression, the New Deal, and World War II.).
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: In practice, the New Deal Coalition [failed](https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/)(The realignment of black voters from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party that began in the late 1920s proliferated during this era. This process involved a “push and pull”: the refusal by Republicans to pursue civil rights alienated many black voters, while efforts—shallow though they were—by northern Democrats to open opportunities for African Americans gave black voters reasons to switch parties.26\n\nThe 1932 presidential contest between incumbent Republican President Herbert Hoover and Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt was something of a turning point. During his first term, Hoover had tried to ingratiate himself with southern segregationists, and his administration had failed to implement economic policies to help African Americans laid low by the Great Depression.) to address many significant forms of structural discrimination, like [anti-lynching laws](https://www.history.com/news/fdr-eleanor-roosevelt-anti-lynching-bill)(“Somebody’s been priming you.

1.5.3.1.2. Pro: The inclusion of identity politics in social and political discussions makes it easier for disadvantaged groups to know who supports them and treats their issues as important.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: People can support disadvantaged groups without engaging in identity politics. The world is [improving](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190111-seven-reasons-why-the-world-is-improving)(Who wants to hear about the fact that every day some 200,000 people around the world are lifted above the $2-a-day poverty line? Or that more than 300,000 people a day get access to electricity and clean water for the first time every day? These stories of people in low-income countries simply doesn’t make for exciting news coverage. But, as Rosling pointed out in his book Factfulness, it’s important to put all the bad news in perspective.\n\nWhile it is true that globalisation has put some downward pressure on middle-class wages in advanced economies in recent decades, it has also helped lift hundreds of millions of people above the global poverty line – a development that has mostly occurred in South-East Asia.) rapidly, independent of identity-based causes.
1.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: This makes it easier for marginalized people to become electoral constituencies, making it more attractive for parties to pursue their votes en masse, by proposing beneficial policies.
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Identity politics often increases the confidence of individuals in marginalized groups, who feel more willing to engage in political action as they have both power and safety in numbers.
1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: People are [more likely to join protests](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/how-effective-are-protests/) when they feel they are members of a group that is deprived and when they feel the protests may be successful or highly visible. Identity politics often create both perceptions.
1.5.3.1.3.2. Pro: Identity politics movements create new leaders and prominent voices within marginalized groups, who can act as [role models](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3312617) for future advocates.
1.5.3.1.3.3. Con: Any social movement can mobilize people, including regressive ones. The act of political mobilisation is not a good in and of itself, it is the change that it engenders that is valuable.

1.5.3.1.3.3.2. Con: By giving power to previously marginalized identity and reifying the history of these groups, identity politics gives this confidence to groups who have been historically deprived of it.
1.5.3.1.4. Con: Democracy presumes that people can reason together to arrive at a shared vision of justice. Identity politics undermine this by claiming that it is impossible for some groups to understand the plight of others.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Progressive identity politics groups around the world have proposed and normalized a large number of important new policies.
1.5.3.2.1.

Memes featuring Irish singer Daniel O’Donnell and former Irish president Mary McAleese were among the best-performing content during the campaign.) that changed minds and made society more equal.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: Identity politics advocates often object to entire strategies of policy-making, labelling them as discriminatory towards small numbers of people, ultimately hampering broader politics.
1.5.3.2.2.1.

So far, the spike has continued into 2021: Murders are up nearly 15 percent so far this year compared to the same period last year, based on data from US cities collected by crime analyst Jeff Asher.), and so may lead to identity-based advocacy being disregarded in conversations around crime and justice.
1.5.3.2.2.2. Con: Often, identity politics groups label policies unworthy of implementing because they would cause severe harms for their members.
1.5.3.2.2.3. Pro: Few policies benefit everyone. Through their opposition, identity politics advocates may create political gridlock, as other groups are inspired to resist actions that could benefit society to their detriment.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: Feminist protests in Ireland helped change the discussion surrounding abortion, leading to its ultimate [legalisation in 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/ireland-votes-by-landslide-to-legalise-abortion)(Forty years ago Irish women could not even buy a condom legally, divorce was banned and abortion almost unmentionable in public.

McMullan, like many other women and men, chose to start the day at a mural of Savita Halappanavar, a 31- year-old dentist who died after she was refused an abortion in 2012. Her death spurred the campaign for change. “I came down especially to pay tribute,” McMullan said. “It’s brilliant that this has happened, but we can’t forget the people who died because of our laws.”).

Under the terms of this notion, there cannot be identity without land. In places like New South Walses \(NSW\), Australia, where indigenous people have been very largely dispossessed of land, this mindset has forced them to emphasize the physical traces of their former tenures as landholders - to emphasize, in our terms, the archaeological evidence of their former prescence. This may account for the way indigenous peoples regard collections, which to us represent convergences, as dispersals. From their point of view, the act of collection evaporates the evidence of their entitlement to land, since this evidence loses efficacy the minute it ceases to be in situ. In appropriating the discourse of heritages, Aborigines in places like NSW have reworked it into a discourse of land.)\), allowing them to begin reclaim their past traditions as well as the rights stripped from them.
1.5.3.2.5. Con: Progressive identity politics often create rushed and unsophisticated demands that can further harm the groups they seek to protect.
1.5.3.2.5.1. Pro: Many US universities stopped using the SAT admissions exams due to accusations that it disadvantaged minority and low-income students. However, it has been found that scrapping the test is [even worse](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/how-the-pandemic-remade-the-sat)(A 2015 report published in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science noted that, since the seventies, participation in school clubs and sports teams has risen among upper-middle-class students and declined among their working-class peers. New research from a team at Stanford suggests that students’ personal essays are more predictive of family income than their SAT scores are. When I asked Coleman about the Varsity Blues college-admissions scandal, in which wealthy parents paid to have their children’s test scores doctored, he said, “Add up all the cheating scandals any way you want—they don’t compare to the number of students who get substantial help on their essays.”) for these groups.
1.5.3.2.5.2. Con: This is often the result of decision-making bodies responding to pressure from from advocates on the basis of identity, instead of holistically consulting members of all relevant communities when implementing their policies \([p. 4](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4gq0b5s7/qt4gq0b5s7.pdf)(Over the last three decades, an impressive body of evidence has demonstrated that politicians provide greater substantive political representation to those who share their personal characteristics, including their gender, race, profession, class, and sexual orientation. Much of this literature has shown that legislators are more responsive in their roll call voting to the interests and preferences of those who share their personal characteristics. Other work\nshows that this pattern also holds for committee behavior and\nthe provision of constituency service. And crucially, still further research demonstrates that these differences in policymaking behavior also have real effects on substantive outcomes for members of these groups. Though differences between black and non-black politicians are the most studied, much work has shown that this link holds for other groups as well.)\).

And finally, he needs to move forward with criminal justice reform legislation that ensures police are held accountable.\n\nPresidents can’t do everything without congressional and electoral support, but they can do a great deal to move out into the forefront of these battles. The time to do so is now.) that identity politics groups find in their causes, they are often keen to tear down the existing forms of power without considering what will come after they do so.
1.5.3.3. Con: Advocates of identity politics often oversimplify complex issues to garner political support, which reduces their effectiveness.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: Identity politics uses [statistics](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/surprising-stats-about-gender-inequality/)(As the following statistics show, there are huge differences in the types of inequality faced by women in different parts of the world - from cultural representation, to domestic burdens and child marriage. But through collective action and shared ownership, change is possible.\n\n1. Women are 47% more likely to suffer severe injuries in car crashes because safety features are designed for men\n\nIn their 2011 study of more than 45,000 crash victims over 11 years, researchers from the University of Virginia found women drivers were much more likely to be injured in a crash than men.) to infer large scale phenomena which inform policy-making. This is not oversimplification, but rather a method for making nuanced assessments of society.
1.5.3.3.2. Pro: As identity politics movements often simplify discussions, they may encourage short-sighted and risky decision making with little additional information provided to dissuade decision-makers.
1.5.3.3.2.1. Con: Peer pressure within a group, exerted by identity politics, may encourage people to hide aspects of their personalities in order to fit in, like adopting more centrist political positions \([p. 981](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-pdf/69/4/963/20501494/gpw065.pdf)(Third, we find a robust peer effect across the specifications for the peer engagement variable on individual political identification. Students with more engaged classmates tend to move to the Centre of the political spectrum and become less likely to invalidate their votes. The result is particularly interesting because it goes against the suggestion that these types of peer effects tend to reinforce initial beliefs and preferences.)\).

For half the students, the face was described as belonging to a white man, and for the other half, it was described as belonging to a black man.\n\nIn one task, the experimenter asked the students to spend four minutes drawing the face as it sat on the screen in front of them. Although all the students were looking at the same face, those who tended to believe that race is an entrenched human characteristic drew faces that matched the stereotype associated with the label \(see a sample below\).

Our tendency to distinguish between in-group and out-group members has moral implications.\n\nPeople may harm those whom they perceive to be in an out-group in ways that they would not harm in-group members. For example, one study showed that when soccer fans viewed fans of their own team being harmed, they felt empathy. But when they viewed fans of a rival team being similarly harmed, they felt pleasure.\n\nLikewise, people tend to make different moral judgments based on in-group and out-group distinctions. When someone in our in-group misbehaves, the natural reaction is often to dismiss the behavior as no big deal. But when someone in our out-group does the same thing, we will tend to judge the behavior much more harshly.). This makes it easier to exclude people and, thus, see their win as your loss.

The term “patriotism” might not even be used. Everything is down to interpretation, the weight put on a description. An alternative is to see it as a form of localism.\n\nNobody wants to see their culture ignored, insulted and dismissed. Perhaps patriotism is stronger among the mass population, where culture lives and breathes, and exists in the everyday rather than an art gallery. Here, the education is broader and more immediate, freed from the narrow limitations of the university lecture theatre. Britain is a special place. Why shouldn’t we say so and have pride in ourselves?) by claiming that people are excluded from ideas such as founding myths.

A May 2011 paper in Perspectives on Psychological Science surveyed a nationally representative sample of 417 Americans, roughly equal numbers white and black, and found:\n\n“White respondents were more likely to see decreases in bias against Blacks as related to increases in bias against Whites — consistent with a zero-sum view of racism among Whites — whereas Blacks were less likely to see the two as linked.”) are [zero-sum](https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-zero-sum-game)(Zero-sum games were first used in economic theory and modelling though there are now many real-world applications and examples of zero-sum games. Usually, the zero-sum game theory presumes that all of the players in a zero-sum game are rational and have all the information that's available about the game. You can also call this perfect information. But there are also examples of zero-sum games in which the players do not have perfect or complete, information.) as resources are often [limited](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/07/24/the-melian-dialogue-in-contemporary-international-politics/)(Leading from these points, the realist argument confers that even though we are in a period where weaker states seek to cozy up to the dominant state, there will always be a battle between the “haves” and “have nots.” Let us acknowledge that security, in theory, is a positive sum value and can be shared without diminishing its enjoyment for the individual actor. However, given the scarcity of resources, the same cannot be said of glory, status, political influence, leadership, and leverage and market shares. Taking this one step further, scarce natural resources such as water, oil and minerals will invoke further conflicts in the future as supplies dwindle and sharing becomes less likely. The protection and access to vital resources have profoundly influenced American military policy since the 1800’s and have taken a renewed precedence with the end of the Cold War.) and must be distributed. Marginalised groups suffer from not explicitly acknowledging this fact and campaigning accordingly.
