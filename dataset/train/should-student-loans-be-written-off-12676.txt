Discussion Name: Should Student Loans be Written Off?

1. Student Loans Should Be Written Off.
1.1. Con: It would be a more effective solution to the problems that student loans and debt cause to simply make all higher education cheaper or free.
1.1.1. Con: This would encourage more people to take an academic degree, and complete it while being financially supported, rather than learn other skilled-labour trades that would support society more.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In countries, such as Ireland, with [very cheap education](https://spunout.ie/education/finance/financial-supports-college), and significant grants and government subsidies, levels of tradespeople are [decreasing](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/harris-says-there-is-significant-shortage-of-skilled-tradespeople-1.4664485).
1.1.1.2. Pro: College is great, but there is nothing wrong with being a plumber making $2,000 a week.
1.1.2. Con: Unless this were coupled with harder curriculums, it would trigger an influx of college graduates, meaning bachelors degrees would decrease in value and graduates would be forced to earn Masters degrees in order to stay competitive in the work force.
1.1.2.1. Con: Having a better educated society should be the aim of countries everywhere. Regarding it as anything but reflects a failure on part of the government to provide jobs.
1.1.2.2. Con: There is currently [a lack of skilled labour](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahchamberlain/2019/08/21/addressing-the-skilled-labor-shortage-in-america/#4ac61067181d) in the US. An influx in college graduates will solve this problem before a devaluation of degrees can occur.
1.1.3. Pro: The [increased commodification](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/it-s-time-to-stop-the-commercialisation-of-our-universities-1.4156729) of education at third level compromises the quality and availability of education.
1.1.4. Pro: This change would not affect the already existing debt of those who got student loans before higher education was made cheaper or free.
1.2. Con: Writing student loans off would be unfeasible.
1.2.1. Pro: Student loans amount to [$1.5 trillion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2019/06/06/most-total-student-loan-forgiveness-plans-are-a-bad-idea/#611cf5107c66) in the US. It would be unfeasible to forgo such a significant amount of money.
1.2.2. Pro: The outstanding fee debt of graduates who entered university after 2012 stands at [£34 billion](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9738) in the UK.
1.2.3. Con: Writing student loans off would be good for the economy.
1.2.3.1. Pro: A working paper found that when 10,000 borrowers had their private student loans canceled, their income increased on average by [$4,000](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wiping-out-the-nations-student-loan-debt-could-have-unintended-financial-consequences-for-borrowers-2020-02-12) over three years.
1.2.3.2. Pro: It is estimated that debt cancellation would inject [$86-108 billion](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_2_6.pdf) into the economy every year for 10 years \(p. 6\).
1.2.3.3. Pro: If student debt was to be eliminated, the average unemployment rate would increase by [0.22 to 0.36 percentage points](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_2_6.pdf) over the 10-years following it \(p. 6\).
1.2.3.4. Pro: Without the stress of recurring payments from debt, it is likely that former students would be more productive toward the economy.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: [Research](https://hbrascend.org/topics/are-you-too-stressed-to-be-productive-or-not-stressed-enough/) suggests that some stress can increase productivity levels.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: The same study suggests that too much stress can [result in impaired performance](https://hbrascend.org/topics/are-you-too-stressed-to-be-productive-or-not-stressed-enough/). The stress felt from debt is likely to fall into this threshold.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Debt stress can lead to [mental health issues](https://www.stepchange.org/debtstress.aspx). Someone without mental health issues is [likely to perform better](https://www.passporthealthusa.com/employer-solutions/blog/2018-12-how-does-mental-health-affect-work-performance/) than if they had mental health issues.
1.2.3.5. Con: The government would have to pay off these loans, likely via the [taxpayer](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/28/7billion-bill-astaxpayer-picksup-tab-halfof-student-loans/).
1.2.3.6. Con: Public spending that goes toward writing off student loans is likely to come at the expense of public spending in other industries.
1.2.3.7. Con: The prospect of further financial difficulty is a strong incentive to increase economic productivity and pay off debt.
1.2.3.8. Con: Debt can lead to an individual taking on [more work than they can handle](https://www.creditfix.co.uk/blog/debt-impacts-performance-workforce/), thus reducing performance and net productivity.
1.2.4. Pro: Nobody would be able to absorb the debt the student accumulated while in school.
1.3. Pro: Other governing bodies like banks have gotten "[bailouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailout.asp)" as they are a fundamental element of driving the economy; students should have their loans written off on the same basis.
1.3.1. Pro: Higher education [spurs innovation in our economy](https://izajoels.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-9012-2-24). New economic markets are linked to geographic areas with highly educated people. This connects the need for higher education - to the quality of life for citizens - as such a measured loan forgiveness program would make sense.
1.3.2. Con: Bank "bailouts" are immoral so the fact they have occurred should not be used as justification for student loan forgiveness.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Bank bailouts [have been and continue to be opposed](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2016/12/14/bank-bailouts-still-unpopular-auto-bailouts-less-s) by Americans.
1.3.2.2. Pro: From a utilitarian perspective, bank bailouts can be [costly, ineffectual, and cause additional problems such as moral hazard.](https://covid-19.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/vf54oo8p/release/1)
1.3.2.3. Con: It is unfair for the government to give support to one group when they need it, and not also give support to others when needed, regardless of the morality of the first handout.
1.3.3. Con: Banks are there to manage the entire society, while students make up a comparably small percentage.
1.3.3.1. Con: Students will be running the country \(along with the banks\) in the future. It is important to equip them to do so.
1.4. Con: Loan write-offs are unfair to students who have paid back what was owed.
1.4.1. Pro: A Student Loan Hero survey of more than a thousand Americans found that [every other person](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/mass-student-loan-forgiveness-unfair-survey/) regarded blanket loan write-offs as unfair to former cohorts who have paid their dues.
1.4.2. Con: Perceptions of fairness [vary by generation](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/mass-student-loan-forgiveness-unfair-survey/)(Millennials want student loan forgiveness more than other generations: 50.5% of them think everyone’s loans should be forgiven, compared to 44.1% of Gen Xers and 31.4% of baby boomers. Baby boomers are more than three times as likely than millennials to say that no one’s loans should be forgiven.). Baby boomers who strongly oppose blanket cancellation of loans fail to understand the financial crises faced perpetually by younger generations, particularly [millennials](https://www.europeanceo.com/finance/millennials-have-been-hit-by-successive-economic-crises-as-they-entered-the-workforce/)(The media has a tendency to characterise the Millennial generation as materialistic, narcissistic, mollycoddled snowflakes. This cohort of individuals has probably received more flak than any that came before it, but perhaps this criticism isn’t fair. If Millennials are always whining, maybe it’s because they have more to whine about than most.\n\nIn relatively quick succession, at a time when their economic and social foundations were unlikely to have been particularly solid, Millennials have had to cope with two cataclysmic events. First, there was the global financial crisis in 2008. Then, just when many will have felt relatively secure after years of austerity and hard work, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived and turned everything on its head once more. Dealing with one huge economic crisis is bad luck, but two is enough to make anyone feel a little sorry for themselves.).
1.4.3. Pro: Loan write-offs are unfair to students who have made [significant sacrifices](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/11/17/you-paid-student-loans-but-didnt-get-any-student-loan-forgiveness/?sh=29bf3e63159a)(Many student loan borrowers who borrowed money for college or graduate school would tell you they successfully paid off student loans through multiple sacrifices. Like their modern counterparts, they too delayed getting married, starting a family, building a business, or saving for retirement. In some cases, they paid off student loans working two or three jobs, delayed buying a home, or even took an extra mortgage to get out of student loan debt. They paid off their student loans to honor their financial agreement, even if it meant personal sacrifice.), such as delaying marriage or parenthood, or worked several jobs, to pay off their debt.
1.4.4. Con: Students who have recently paid back their loans could be [compensated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/11/17/you-paid-student-loans-but-didnt-get-any-student-loan-forgiveness/?sh=28a48c5c159a)(Student loan forgiveness, like most laws, isn’t retroactive. A student loan borrower who paid off student loans in 1988 may not get compensation, even if they paid off student loans responsibly. However, perhaps a student loan borrower who paid off student loans more recently should be considered for “student loan forgiveness.”) by the government.
1.5. Con: Writing off student loans creates a moral hazard where students take out larger loans than they normally would anticipating loan forgiveness.
1.6. Pro: Loans have negative impacts on the lives of students.
1.6.1. Pro: Many students have to work while they're studying as part of their loan package, which [reduces their chances](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-all-public-higher-edu_b_1099437) of successfully graduating.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Only [30%](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-all-public-higher-edu_b_1099437) of Americans who enroll in university successfully graduate.
1.6.2. Pro: Cancelling loans will [increase taxes](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wiping-out-the-nations-student-loan-debt-could-have-unintended-financial-consequences-for-borrowers-2020-02-12) that students are likely to pay.
1.6.3. Pro: Cancelling student loans will cause the credit score of borrowers to [drop](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wiping-out-the-nations-student-loan-debt-could-have-unintended-financial-consequences-for-borrowers-2020-02-12), which will negatively affect their ability to take out loans and credit cards in the future.
1.6.4. Con: Loans teach students to manage their money effectively.
1.6.4.1. Pro: If students are loaned a sum of money and are then unable to stick to a budget, the prospect of paying interest encourages financial responsibility in the future.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Loans provide the impetus to organize and manage one's finances.
1.6.5. Pro: Debt exacerbates mental health conditions of people.
1.6.5.1. Pro: New research, led by the University of Southampton, has shown that people in debt are [three times](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2013/09/26-debt-linked-to-mental-health-problems.page) more likely to have a mental health problem than those not in debt.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Debts are likely to lead to [problems](https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/debt-stress-and-mental-health.aspx) such as stress, depression and anxiety.
1.7. Con: Students have consented to take this debt.
1.7.1. Con: Students only consent to take on debt due to a lack of viable alternatives. This does not constitute a free and fair choice.
1.7.2. Con: Many students who take on this debt are [17 year olds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States). As minors, they should be allowed to [void](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/can-a-minor-enter-into-a-contract-34024) this contract.
1.7.2.1. Con: Contracts entered into by minors for [necessities such as education](https://lawshelf.com/coursewarecontentview/contracts-of-minors/) cannot be voided. The ability to void these contracts would harm the opposing party who has made provisions to fulfill their part of the contract for the benefit of the minor.
1.7.3. Con: Be that as it may, this debt can still be waived to positively impact the future of students.
1.7.4. Con: Banks consent to provide student loans. By providing loans, banks open themselves up to the possibility that the amount lent may never be recovered.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Banks are required to undertake [due diligence](https://pecunica.com/knowledge-point/what-is-due-diligence-in-loan-syndication/) prior to loan syndication. Bad loans are, therefore, an indictment of the quality of their evaluation of the trustworthiness of potential borrowers.
1.7.4.2. Con: Bank consent to provide student loans could be contingent on terms and conditions. In extreme cases, non-repayment can lead to [lawsuits and even arrests](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/can-you-be-arrested-for-not-repaying-your-student-loans)(When someone defaults on their student loan, the lender will often turn to debt collectors. Filing a lawsuit against the borrower is one tactic collection agencies use to recoup the debt, according to an American Civil Liberties Union \(ACLU\) report on the criminalization of private debt. Both private student loan lenders and the federal government can sue for failure to pay student loan debt.\n\nIf the borrower is sued and fails to appear in court, the debt collection agency can ask the judge to issue an arrest warrant.).
1.7.4.3. Con: Banks do not likely factor wholesale government write-offs into their actuarial calculations. Defaulting on debt is usually caused by personal factors, not government decisions.
1.7.5. Pro: Students make an informed choice when taking loans.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Students are aware of the terms and conditions of the agreement.
1.7.5.2. Con: Students are unable to predict their financial position and salaries after graduation in the future. Therefore, it becomes an uninformed choice.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Most students also have access to [alumni employment statistics](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/jul/15/employment-statistics-university-graduates), meaning that the choice is well informed in terms of future employment and repayment prospects.
1.7.5.2.2. Pro: Since the future [economic conditions](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/the-future-is-uncertain-and-its-holding-back-economic-growth-heres-what-needs-to-change/) of most countries are unpredictable, the informed choice is unlikely to be based on future prospects.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Pro: [Political instability](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/can-political-stability-hurt-economic-growth) directly affects the level of investments in an economy. Low investment means that less jobs are available for students who graduate in the future.
1.7.5.2.2.2. Pro: Students who have [variable interest rates](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/student-loans/how-fed-rate-cut-impacts-student-loans/) against their loans might be forced to pay higher interest rates in the future.
1.7.5.2.2.2.1. Con: Those who have variable interest rates on their loans can look into [refinancing options](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/student-loans/how-fed-rate-cut-impacts-student-loans/) if their interest rates rise in future.
1.7.5.3. Pro: Students have access to data of previous student loan recipients and how [difficult](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/13/twenty-two-percent-of-student-loan-borrowers-fall-into-default.html) it is for them to repay their loans.
1.8. Con: Writing off student loans could disincetivize the provision of such loans, which are uniquely structured to be more beneficial than regular loans.
1.8.1. Con: Predatory financial institutions can engage in [aggressive marketing strategies](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2007-08-26-ike26-story.html)(The Federal Trade Commission reports that it has received almost 600 complaints about deceptive direct-to-consumer marketing practices by student lenders since 2000.\n\nStudent lending is not the only industry dealing with this issue. Aggressive marketing and its effect on consumers have been much discussed in the pharmaceutical and mortgage industries. Such marketing tactics have resulted in measurable harm to consumers.\n\nIn the mortgage industry, state attorneys general and federal officials are investigating predatory-lending tactics such as offering subprime loans to borrowers who cannot afford them.) to lead students to believe that their loan plans are more beneficial and affordable than they really are.
1.8.2. Con: In the case of federal student loans, debt forgiveness is unlikely to have any effect on future lending behaviors, as the decision to write off student loans as well as to sanction loans is made by the same institution: [the government](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/federal-vs-private)(Federal student loans and federal parent loans: These loans are funded by the federal government.).
1.8.3. Pro: Student loans have lower costs associated with them.
1.8.3.1. Con: The concessions and benefits afforded to students through such unique loans are adequate financial assistance; it would not be fair to write off their debt entirely.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Interest rates are often [fixed](https://www.thebalance.com/fixed-rate-loans-315603), so students don’t have to worry about severe changes in their interest cost.
1.8.3.3. Pro: At times, the interest might even be [subsidized](https://www.thebalance.com/how-subsidized-loans-work-315581) or paid by the government.
1.8.4. Pro: Student loans are easier to get approvals for.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Most students do not have high paying jobs or high [credit scores](https://www.thebalance.com/how-credit-scores-work-315541). Therefore, in the absence of a student loan, it become very difficult for them to borrow.
1.8.5. Pro: Student loans provide benefits at payback time.
1.8.5.1. Pro: With some loans, students don’t have to start making payments until they are [out](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand) of school.
1.8.5.2. Pro: If students experience a stretch of unemployment, they might be able to stop making payments until they find a job, known as an [unemployment deferment](https://www.thebalance.com/unemployment-deferment-315583).
1.9. Pro: Education and access to resources is a human right, and so students should not be penalised.
1.9.1. Pro: Students who incur debts in their undergraduate degree often are [unable to attend](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/student-loans/pay-off-student-loans-before-grad-school-278497) graduate school because they need to repay their debts. Student debt should not be a barrier to exercising the human right to education.
1.9.2. Pro: Student loans are a significant contributing factor to the education inequalities that still exist in society today.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Prospective students from poorer backgrounds may decide that taking out a large student loan is too great a financial risk. They may therefore decide against higher education or decide to attend a cheaper institution that may not provide good quality education, both of which could lead to unfulfilled educational potential and correspondingly poorer future outcomes.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Black students [rely more heavily](https://tcf.org/content/report/bridging-progressive-policy-debates-student-debt-racial-wealth-gap-reinforce/?agreed=1) on loans \(and tend to take on riskier loans\) than other demographics because of generational wealth disparities. Negative experiences in the job market make it much more difficult for them to be hired and to repay their loans.
1.9.2.3. Con: Writing off student loans is not the most effective and sustainable way to address education inequalities.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Writing off all current and past student loans would amount to a windfall for those generations only, changing nothing for future students.
1.9.3. Con: If a student does well enough in high school and on standardized tests, scholarships and other programs can cover a significant portion of tuition and books. If you can't make the grades to get scholarships, you probably won't make the grades to compete against the people that did. In this case, you would already be starting out your career at a disadvantage and would be better off learning a trade. College is not the answer for everyone.
1.9.3.1. Con: In many cases, scholarship places are highly coveted and competitive. There are many students with [exemplary grades who do not receive scholarships](https://www.diycollegerankings.com/3-reasons-why-your-your-kids-good-grades-wont-pay-college/20249/), purely due to scarcity.
1.9.3.2. Con: As many scholarships are merit based, rather than need based, they exacerbate existing inequalities among students, such as favouring students who have completed [unpaid internships](https://edtrust.org/the-equity-line/the-problem-with-merit-aid/).
1.9.4. Pro: Many international conventions recognize education as a human right.
1.9.4.1. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [recognizes](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx) education as a fundamental human right.
1.9.4.2. Pro: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights [recognizes](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Education/Training/Compilation/Pages/UnitedNationsDeclarationonHumanRightsEducationandTraining\(2011\).aspx) the right to education as a human right.
1.9.4.3. Pro: UNESCO's Convention against Discrimination in Education [asserts](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=12949&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html) that education at all stages is a fundamental right.
1.9.5. Pro: In the current age we live in, where advanced qualifications are all but compulsory for any high-end job, it is vital that students are permitted the opportunity to access equally high-end education.
1.9.6. Con: Receiving a higher level education is not a universal fundamental human right.
1.9.6.1. Con: With the [inflation of education](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210126-degree-inflation-how-the-four-year-degree-became-required)(“I have been told multiple times that I have a great resumé, and lots of experience, but no degree… so no potential for upward movement,” says Cornett, 33. At the last company she worked for, she applied for open managerial positions constantly over five years, “only to not get them because someone with less experience, but who had a degree, did”.) seen in recent years, a bachelor's degree is required, at minimum, to secure a range of jobs. As such, the basic education provided at second level is no longer sufficient to meet individual needs.
1.9.6.2. Pro: [Article 26](https://www.humanrights.com/course/lesson/articles-26-30/read-article-26.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "...higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit." The right guarantees that higher education be accessible, but not generally available. \([Beiter ,p.97](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276473106_The_Implementation_of_the_Right_to_Education_in_Indonesia)\)
1.9.6.3. Con: Just because it is not a fundamental human right does not mean that it should not be.
1.9.6.3.1. Pro: Higher education provides [unparalleled access](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13636820000200142) to the best paid and most rewarding forms of employment. Exclusion from these opportunities is unjust.
1.9.6.3.2. Pro: People should have a right to the experience of learning, and the individual and collective process of intellectual development.
1.10. Pro: Students can start off in the workforce without issues of overwhelming debt.
1.10.1. Pro: Many students are [unable to begin work](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/heres-how-student-debt-can-hurt-your-career.html) in the career that they have studied for and are passionate about due to the pressing need to make their monthly payments.
1.10.2. Con: Students should look at the job security, as well as the payout, of jobs in the field they are studying before taking on debt to learn about the subject. It is an irresponsible person that takes on debt to chase after a foolish venture.
1.10.3. Pro: This [worked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition_fees_in_the_United_Kingdom) in previous years in the UK, when students did not have to pay fees. It is completely possible and massively beneficial to students.
1.10.4. Pro: It is already challenging for young adults to get on the property ladder, et cetera; existing debt is an unfair burden to add.
1.10.5. Pro: Student with massive student loan debts might struggle to be independent adults.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Failing to make monthly payments can result in late fees, which further exacerbates the problem.
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: Not making payments on time in the University of Minnesota incurs a [late fee.](https://onestop.umn.edu/finances/consequences-non-payment)
1.10.5.2. Pro: Students already have limited budgets as they don't have a steady income in the form of a job. This makes it harder for them to ensure that they have housing, food, clothing, and other essentials, leading them to become more reliant on their parents and the system.
1.10.6. Pro: Poor mental health as a result of debt affects people's [performance](https://cpr.bu.edu/resources/reasonable-accommodations/jobschool/how-does-mental-illness-affect-my-work-performance/) at work.
