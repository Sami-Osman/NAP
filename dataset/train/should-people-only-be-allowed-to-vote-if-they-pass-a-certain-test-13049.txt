Discussion Name: Should People Only be Allowed to Vote if they Pass a Certain Test?

1. People should only be allowed to vote if they pass a test.
1.1. Pro: This would ensure that the best possible leaders are elected.
1.1.1. Pro: Intelligent and effective leaders can more effectively improve the country and the lives of their people.
1.1.2. Con: This policy is vulnerable to corruption. It may be misused so that the most powerful leader gets elected instead of the best possible leader.
1.1.2.1. Con: All political systems are vulnerable to corruption.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The ability to vote in a democratic society \(which is being threatened in this model\) is the most effective way to remove a corrupt government.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The most influential party \(which is usually the incumbent party\) can ensure that only voters who agree with them are selected.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Politicians can use certain test questions to eliminate their opponents.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The ability to determine the contents of the test under the guise of establishing a test that is "unbiased" can easily be abused by governments to subjugate the people.
1.1.2.4. Con: Measures can be enforced to protect the testing process, similar to how there are measures in place to protect the voting process.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: Measures that would need to be passed by politicians are not a good way to prevent the corrupt practices of politicians.
1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: A purely separate body does not exist. Even the powers of the executive, legislature, and judiciary [overlap](http://www.dailynews.lk/2018/12/07/features/170580/balancing-overlapping-powers-executive-legislature-and-judiciary). It is unfair to set absolute neutrality as a requirement for the body implementing this test.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Politicians [tend](https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/opinion/politicians-driven-by-self-interest-not-public-service-1587790) to put personal interests before service, making corruption extremely likely in this model.
1.1.3. Con: A leader that the people choose of their own volition is the best possible leader.
1.1.4. Pro: Politicians who make false promises are less likely to be elected if this policy is implemented.
1.1.4.1. Con: Testing the voting population will not change the politicians running for office.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: While true, this policy would determine which politicians are ultimately elected.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Politicians who fail to keep their promises will not be able to make excuses for their actions because the voters are more likely to be critical and assess their claims.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: If politicians choose to lie, no amount of assessment can definitively prove it.
1.1.5. Pro: An unbiased test regarding basic knowledge about the political system \(and possibly history\) would counter the [recent wave](https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-populism/) of [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism).
1.1.5.1. Pro: Popular decisions are not always the best decisions.
1.1.6. Pro: Politicians who have concrete ideas and execute their policy goals are more likely to be elected when, by virtue of the test, people are paying attention to their actions and policies.
1.1.7. Pro: People who don't have the basic knowledge of the government have no right to vote as some of them would guess. This could make some of the presidents win with luck which is unfair for the other. Voters should pass a test to show that they qualify to vote as the right to vote.
1.2. Con: This policy will disenfranchise voters.
1.2.1. Pro: Another barrier to voter registration will likely drive down voter turnout.
1.2.1.1. Con: Those intent on voting will overcome this barrier.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: It is likely that those who choose to not overcome this barrier care less about voting. It can be assumed that such individuals cast irresponsible votes.
1.2.1.2. Con: There is no inherent value to increased voter turnout. In comparison, a more educated voting group comes with [greater benefits](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jlhochschild/publications/if-democracies-need-informed-voters-how-can-they-thrive-while-expanding-en).
1.2.1.3. Pro: Minor inconveniences such as small increases in the distance from the polls to the voters' homes can have a [significant](https://psmag.com/news/how-polling-places-can-affect-your-vote-20318) negative impact on voter turnout. This policy is likely to cause a much greater disruption in voter turnout.
1.2.2. Pro: Voters will feel that this is a hypocritical standard and may choose to not partake in voting. If legislators do not need to pass a test to establish that they are proficient in the subject of the policies they work on \(such as climate change\), it is unfair for ordinary people to need to prove themselves.
1.2.3. Con: Non-voter concerns could still be collected and aggregated by voters who could factor them into who or what they would vote for.
1.2.4. Pro: This policy is inherently discriminatory, especially against minorities.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Wealthier people tend to have better access to education and are therefore more likely to pass the test.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: There is a significant degree of [education inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_inequality). If education is important to a person's ability to pass the test, a large percentage of people will be unable to vote.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Political power is the best way for disaffected groups to advance policies to improve their conditions.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: The voting class can create policies that benefit the non voting class.
1.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: The working class would be robbed of their only real tool for societal change.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: As the [internet becomes a basic right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access), any person, regardless of class, should have the ability to do well on such a test.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Voting tests, such as literacy tests, have [historically](http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/literacy-test-louisiana-used-to-suppress-the-black-vote.html) been used to deny specific groups of people the right to vote.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: When this policy was instituted in the 1960s in the US, its only purpose was to [exclude](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/06/28/voting_rights_and_the_supreme_court_the_impossible_literacy_test_louisiana.html) Black Americans from being able to vote.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: This happened almost 60 years ago. Such blatant discrimination is [less common](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/09/01/racist-behaviour-is-declining-in-america) now.
1.2.4.3. Pro: A test may exclude people who are otherwise capable on the basis of a disability or a lack of fluency in English.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: This can be easily combated by making the tests more accommodating.
1.2.4.4. Con: Throughout history, governments have had many different checks on unfettered democracy - age, legality, ownership of land, sex, race, etc. This would simply be a different check on the process.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Voting is a privilege, not a right.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: The difference between children and adults is logical and universally accepted. Such a distinction is not true in this case.
1.3. Con: This policy threatens the principles and ideals enshrined in democracy.
1.3.1. Pro: The goal of democracy is not to make "correct" decisions but to maintain governments that most accurately represent the desires of the people, even if that is not pragmatically ideal.
1.3.1.1. Pro: In a democracy, every citizen has the [right to vote](https://www.theusconstitution.org/issues/voting-rights-democracy/).
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Democracy [requires](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13523270410001687082) that interested people actively engage in the democratic process by carefully choosing their leader. This test will ensure the leader a voter does choose has been carefully considered.
1.3.1.2. Pro: This policy will prevent a significant number of people from being able to vote.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: If the test is too simple, it will fail to act as an effective filter. If it is too difficult, it will filter out too many people.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.
1.3.1.3. Pro: In a democracy, every person is [equal](http://www.civiced.org/pdfs/books/ElementsOfDemocracy/Elements_Subsection6.pdf) \(p. 18\). Rejecting someone's worldview because they are uninformed about certain policies or procedures is antithetical to democracy.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: In a representative democracy, individuals who have specialized knowledge about politics and policies are elected to make decisions on the people's behalf. This means that the people do not need to be particularly well versed in political, social, or economic affairs.
1.3.2. Con: If we want to maintain a tenet of democracy that 'everybody must have a say' then rather than the test possibly disenfranchising people by their not accepting their vote, we could apply weightings dependant on test scores but still give everybody a vote .
1.3.2.1. Pro: Everybody gets 1 vote and the best get 2 but others a fraction in between dependant on their test score. This is one suggestion, others exist, but the point is not to disenfranchise enybody.
1.3.3. Con: The belief that democracy should be protected unconditionally indicates some form of [cognitive bias](https://www.yourbias.is/).
1.3.3.1. Pro: Establishing a democracy is not the goal. The goal is to create a society in which citizens are guaranteed rights, liberties, and privileges even if this comes at the cost of some citizens' right to vote.
1.3.3.2. Pro: A cognitive bias demonstrates why an age limit alone does not mean a person can be entrusted with such critical political influence: Age does not make a person immune to indoctrination and brainwashing from, say, campaigning by political parties.
1.3.4. Con: A democracy, even in its truest form, is not necessarily better than other types of government.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Certain problems are better tackled through non-democratic methods. For example, problems such as inflation and climate change are best tackled by experts when they do not need to worry about appeasing the people.
1.4. Con: The implementation of a neutral test would be logistically difficult.
1.4.1. Pro: The test questions would be subject to perpetual debate, making it impossible to reach a consensus regarding the content of the test.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Politicians or political parties that are disadvantaged by certain questions will probably refuse to compromise on their position.
1.4.1.2. Pro: It's very likely these different political parties would disagree with each other on such reviews. The opinions of political parties diverge on most important social and economic issues.
1.4.2. Pro: It is likely that the content of the test will be biased.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Questions are likely to prioritize certain policies over others, which will introduce bias by influencing which policies citizens are paying most attention to.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: They is not necessarily true. Different political parties could be assigned a portion of questions that they can then write.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Questions on a poll test take on greater importance than questions that are not included. Designating information for a test indicates that that knowledge is somehow special and that the people must learn it.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Test questions may contain leading phrases that prevent people holding opposing views from being able to accurately express themselves.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Tests may make assumptions that the test taker does not agree with \(for example, regarding the cause for inflation\).
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Bias could be minimized by keeping the test fact-based.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The test can contain straightforward questions pertaining to the role of the president, the basic functioning of the government and its bodies, the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens etc.
1.4.2.3. Con: The media can [help](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/media/how-do-media-affect-government-transparency-and-accountability-media-essay.php) ensure that the questions on the test are not biased by holding the test takers accountable for any biased or substandard questions that may be included on the test.
1.4.2.4. Con: There are a number of measures that can be taken to minimize bias within the test.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: The contents of the test could undergo screening \(similar to the way peer reviews work\) by various people from all ends of the political spectrum.
1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.
1.4.2.4.3. Pro: Bias could be minimized by structuring the questions in the test so that they only test one's reasoning ability.
1.4.2.5. Pro: Correct test answers may be biased towards a more liberal/conservative point of view.
1.4.2.5.1. Con: A different branch of government or a non government entity can be placed in charge of the testing process to reduce bias.
1.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: The people involved in the creation of the test could be chosen from all the political colors.
1.4.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Electing politicians from existing parties to create the test will ensure that existing parties become powerful enough to prevent any new political 'color' from arising. This will create an oligarchy of rulers with unchecked power.
1.4.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The test is a tool to help determine an understanding of government and an individual's ability to reason. It is unlikely that politicians will be able to use it to produce such extreme outcomes.
1.4.2.5.1.2. Pro: The test can be administered by a neutral third-party. For example, the [US Election Assistance Commission](http://charged with developing guidance to meet HAVA requirements) is an independent, bipartisan commission that is responsible for developing guidance to meet Help America Vote Act's \([HAVA](https://www.eac.gov/about/help-america-vote-act/)\) requirements.
1.4.2.5.2. Con: There is no reason why correct test answers need to be biased towards something. The answers on math tests are not biased towards any particular political ideology.
1.4.2.5.2.1. Con: Tests pertaining to politics are likely to have political questions, which are more open ended. Bias is thus still a major concern.
1.4.3. Con: It would be easy to place the test questions on the ballot paper.
1.4.4. Pro: Testing would cost time and money.
1.4.4.1. Con: The test can be embedded in the registering process. Separate resources would not need to be delegated to its implementation.
1.4.4.2. Con: Time and money are a small price to pay.
1.4.5. Con: 'Difficult does not take away the possibility of a neutral test, and therefore it can still be implemented.
1.4.6. Con: You could have the test requirements be decided upon by public supermajority vote, which in turn would make it the will of the people.
1.5. Pro: This would create a more engaged, politically aware, and cohesive society.
1.5.1. Con: When only a specific group holds political power, it is possible for [authoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism) to override democracy in a country.
1.5.2. Pro: Such a test will improve one's understanding of the democratic process and the responsibilities of various actors within it. This will improve the ability of voters to [meaningfully engage](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/the-future-of-democracy-needs-a-new-kind-of-leader/) with the political process.
1.5.3. Pro: This system would discourage media outlets from distributing 'fake news', as they might be reducing the voting power of their demographic if a related question appears on the test. This will automatically increase the standard of information available to the public.
1.5.4. Pro: [Active citizenship](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/active-citizenship-can-change-your-country-better), which is the process of citizens becoming more involved in their community, has been linked with the cultivation of healthy societies. It is particularly important in new democracies.
1.5.5. Con: This would lead to a divide in society between the voters and the people who failed the test.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Once a society begins excluding people from fundamental rights such as voting, it is difficult to draw the line. Such discrimination could easily be extended to other policies.
1.5.5.2. Con: This divide is not permanent. It can easily be overcome by the acquisition of the skills or knowledge being tested.
1.5.5.3. Pro: The people that fail the test could resort to violent protests.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: People who are less educated or intelligent [tend](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3820075) to resort to violence instead of civil debate.
1.5.5.3.1.1. Con: The actions of a few uneducated or violent people should not inform the decisions of the government.
1.5.5.3.1.2. Pro: Intelligence and crime are [inversely correlated.](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1365/Intelligence-Crime-Explaining-IQ-crime-correlation.html)
1.5.5.3.1.2.1. Con: A political test does not measure one's IQ. People with high IQs may also fail the test.
1.5.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: The average IQ score for [delinquents and criminals](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1363/Intelligence-Crime-Measuring-size-IQ-crime-correlation.html) is 8 to 10 points lower than noncriminals.
1.5.5.3.1.2.3. Pro: Individuals with lower IQs will commit [more violent crimes](http://criminal-justice.iresearchnet.com/crime/education-and-crime/4/) than individuals with higher IQs.
1.5.5.3.2. Con: Even currently, people resort to violent protests over a variety of issues. Such an outcome is not unique to the test.
1.5.5.4. Con: Setting such a standard is necessary, regardless of the cost. It is analogous to disallowing an unqualified individual from conducting surgery.
1.6. Pro: If a test were implemented, any minimum age could be eliminated.
1.7. Pro: Enforcing a test to determine who can vote will ensure that the people allowed to vote can be trusted to make informed decisions.
1.7.1. Pro: Such a policy would mean that more intelligent people have a greater voice. Intelligent people are [more likely](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/highly-intelligent-people-avoid-making-bad-decisions-by-doing-6-things-according-to-psychology.html) to make smart decisions.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Critical thinking, which is integral to decision making, is [better mastered](https://thinkeracademy.com/critical-thinking-in-decision-making/) by intelligent people.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Studies have found that there is [no link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0c70/b2649bf6b5c3491fa9705ade530fcdfc6145.pdf) between critical thinking and intelligence \(p. 8\).
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Stanovich/publication/232472337_The_domain_specificity_and_generality_of_belief_bias_Searching_for_a_generalizable_critical_thinking_skill/links/0deec5268138dde610000000.pdf) found that people with greater cognitive ability had better critical thinking skills.
1.7.1.2. Con: It is the job of the government and the citizens to work together to nurture \(by education, for example\) critical/intelligent civilians who are capable of choosing who should lead them, instead of artificially selecting people who already meet this criteria.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: If the test is detailed, less informed individuals may be incentivised to learn more about elections and electorate law.
1.7.1.3. Con: Intelligence does not necessitate sound political choices; it is subject to personal preferences - including popularity - which no amount of testing can guard against.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: More intelligent people are not immune to propaganda, bias, and voting against their interests.
1.7.1.4. Con: This fundamentally claims that intelligent people should have more rights that less intelligent people, which is a deplorable way to view humanity.
1.7.1.4.1. Con: Public facilities and privileges are often privy to barriers. For example, a person only has the right to go to a state college if they score high enough on their SATs.
1.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.1.
1.7.1.4.1.2. Con: This is a false equivalence. College is a higher education institution. Intelligence is required to utilize what colleges offer. The democratic process is a person's input on who should lead the nation, for which only an opinion is required.
1.7.1.5. Con: Intelligence is subjective; being able to memorise political policies does not necessarily mean a person can make better voting decisions.
1.7.1.5.1. Con: The test can assess a variety of abilities and values. Policy knowledge is likely to be one of the many parts of the test.
1.7.1.5.1.1. Pro: An eventual "civics test" can include questions that range from empathy, right or wrong, laws, et cetera.
1.7.1.6. Pro: This policy will ensure that the people voting have a basic understanding of how civics work and a basic level of intelligence. Democracy requires an educated electorate.
1.7.2. Pro: A test which has questions about the political structure and representatives' duties would filter out people who do not understand the rudimentary elements of the political process.
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: Questions about economics are more central to informed decision-making than political questions.
1.7.2.3. Con: Everyone that [registers to vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration) should be allowed to vote, as in the current model. Registration is "neutral" and provides evidence that an individual possesses basic knowledge about how the government works.
1.7.3. Con: Demagogues and corrupt political candidates can misinform intelligent voters.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Donald Trump, the current president of the US, made [492](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims/?utm_term=.236d4f494952) false or misleading claims in the first 100 days of his presidency.
1.7.3.2. Con: It would be reasonable to assume that intelligent voters are less likely to fall for demagogues and corrupt politics than less intelligent voters.
1.7.4. Con: There are other ways to ensure that the voting citizens of a country are well informed.
1.7.4.1. Pro: [Information material](https://sswm.info/taxonomy/term/2654/creating-information-material-%28ws%29) such as pamphlets and leaflets could be offered at voting booths or sent to voters via post.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Voters could be sent links offering basic information via email.
1.7.4.3. Pro: [Mandatory education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education) can be used to ensure that the voting population is educated enough to make an informed decision.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: Mandatory education alone cannot determine that a person is capable of placing an educated vote. An exam \(similar to those in schools\) is the most effective way to ensure that a person understands and can make use of what they have learnt.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: Adding mandatory classes to secondary schools to educate students in the rudiments of democratic institutions would ensure a well informed citizenry.
1.7.5. Con: General intelligence, or mere knowledge of civics, is not an indicator of other values such as empathy or morality that one might consider essential for a voter to have in a civic society.
1.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.5.1.
1.7.5.2. Con: Assuming that other values such as empathy or morality can not be covered sufficiently in the test, separating voters possessing general intelligence/ knowledge from those who do not, will already improve the level of rationality in the voting process.
