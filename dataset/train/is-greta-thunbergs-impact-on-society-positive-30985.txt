Discussion Name: Is Greta Thunberg's Impact on Society Positive?

1. Greta Thunberg's impact on society is positive.
1.1. Pro: Greta Thunberg has triggered a serious global discussion on climate change.
1.1.1. Pro: Climate change must be discussed and addressed on a global scale. The efforts of individual nations could be futile.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Individual nations may not be able to curtail the activity of large global companies, [20 of whom are responsible for 33% of the world's emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions)(The Guardian today reveals the 20 fossil fuel companies whose relentless exploitation of the world’s oil, gas and coal reserves can be directly linked to more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era.\n\nNew data from world-renowned researchers reveals how this cohort of state-owned and multinational firms are driving the climate emergency that threatens the future of humanity, and details how they have continued to expand their operations despite being aware of the industry’s devastating impact on the planet.).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many of these companies span across multiple jurisdictions, and have the ability to take advantage of weaker environmental laws in developing countries.
1.1.1.2. Con: Taking unilateral action can be difficult without data or examples, which can only be created if one nation takes the initiative and enacts environmental changes.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Scientists can and have used [models](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19244/w19244.pdf)(In other words, might we obtain better estimates of the SCC\nby building and simulating integrated assessment models \(IAMs\), i.e., models that “inte-\ngrate” a description of GHG emissions and their impact on temperature \(a climate science\nmodel\) with projections of abatement costs and a description of how changes in climate\naffect output, consumption, and other economic variables \(an economic model\).) in order to predict climate change and the effects of climate change policy. \(p.1\)
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Models do [not predict the future](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-scientific-models/)(Models do not always predict the future. This does not make them unscientific, but it makes them a target for science skeptics. I cannot even blame the skeptics, because scientists frequently praise correct predictions to prove a model’s worth. It isn’t originally their idea. Many eminent philosophers of science, including Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos, opined that correct predictions are a way of telling science from pseudoscience.), and can often be inaccurate or misleading.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Climate models](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2018/05/18/climate-models-accuracy/)(Because weather takes place hour by hour, forecast models use current atmospheric and oceanic conditions to predict future weather. The forecast takes into account humidity, temperature, air pressure, wind speed and direction, as well as cloud cover. Geographic location, proximity to water, urban structures, latitude and elevation can also influence the weather you experience.\n\nWeather models work at resolutions high enough to generate different predictions for neighboring towns, in some cases, but only over short timescales of about two weeks maximum.) can predict [how average conditions will change](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/08/26/a-beginners-guide-to-climate-models/) in a region over the coming decades.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Taking unilateral action won't change the fact that some countries would still [be polluting and aggravating the climate crisis](https://www.activesustainability.com/environment/top-5-most-polluting-countries/).
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Unless efforts of individual nations to fight the climate crisis can be matched, it would be impossible to hope for a change on a global scale.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: In 2020, [two-thirds of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/) thought that their Government should be doing more to fight the climate crisis.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: Addressing changes on a [global scale](https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/sc14445.doc.htm)(Climate change is a “crisis multiplier” that has profound implications for international peace and stability, Secretary-General António Guterres told the Security Council today, amid calls for deep partnerships within and beyond the United Nations system to blunt its acute effects on food security, natural resources and migration patterns fuelling tensions across countries and regions.) can put more pressure on individual nations to enact those changes.
1.1.1.3. Con: Thunberg has [urged individuals to take action on climate change](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2019/11/19/greta-is-right-study-shows-individual-climate-action-boosts-systemic-change/?sh=79fab79a4a54). It makes sense that such a sentiment could be scaled up to appreciate individual nation's efforts in the crisis.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Nations [encounter different obstacles to enacting environmental change](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201949493)(There is no short answer to these questions, but ultimately it boils down to the intrinsic value we place on the environment and the complexities of our economic, political and social systems. Time and again, we encounter obstacles to enacting environmental change, often because industry places a higher value on short-term profits than on long-term sustainability, or owing to a lack of regulation by governments, or resistance by consumers to adopt a new product.) such as a lack of regulation by governments, or the value that industry places on short-term profits rather than on long-term sustainability.
1.1.1.4. Pro: In 2020, Thunberg asked for tougher actions at [the World Economic Forum in Davos](https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020) by stating that the world has just [eight years left](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/01/21/thunberg-says-eight-years-left-avert-1-5c-warming/) to avert severe warming.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Thunberg stated that [global events are a great opportunity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/12/27/greta-thunberg-state-climate-movement-roots-her-power-an-activist/) to mobilize people and to highlight the fact that nowhere near enough is being done about climate change.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Thunberg has alleged that these same global meetings are simply "[PR event\(s\)", and referred to them as failures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/12/27/greta-thunberg-state-climate-movement-roots-her-power-an-activist/)(You called COP26 a “failure” and a “PR event.”\n\nWell, in the final document, they succeeded in even watering down the blah, blah, blah. Which is very much an achievement, if you see it that way. Of course it’s a step forward that, instead of coming back every five years, they’re doing it every year now. But still, that doesn’t mean anything unless that actually leads to increased ambition and if they actually fulfill those ambitions.). This seemingly represents a contradiction in her beliefs and messaging.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: The fact that these events are failures is the reason why people can be mobilized by witnessing their futility. If world leaders consistently attend climate events, but fail to take action, then the public can be mobilized and engaged by recognizing these events as PR stunts.
1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Thunberg stated that [no change could come from global events such as the COP](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/greta-thunberg-says-cop26-climate-summit-is-a-failure-and-a-pr-event.html)(“Inside COP, there are just politicians and people in power pretending to take our future seriously,” she said. “Change is not going to come from inside there, that is not leadership. This is leadership, this is what leadership looks like.”), however she has also previously insisted that politicians and people in power should start taking actions.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: [Global events are a great opportunity to raise awareness about climate change](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/Climate-change/activities/raising-awareness-on-climate-change-and-health) in order to facilitate behavioral change and societal support.
1.1.2. Pro: [Greta Thunberg gave a speech at the United Nations to politicians from around the world.](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit) This highlights how widespread her influence is throughout the world.
1.1.2.1. Con: Having a platform is not necessarily the same as having influence. Due to Greta Thunberg's young age, she may not be respected and listened to by those in government, who notoriously ignore experts on climate change.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Young environmental activists have faced [increasing criticism](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-49291464) from people of influence.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The ways in which people in power respond to a young girl speaking the truth about the environment reflects poorly on such individuals, which may encourage greater discernment about who we select as leaders.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Greta Thunberg has shown [greater leadership skills](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/25/greta-thunberg-showed-the-world-what-it-means-to-lead) than many of those in government and in doing so has garnered significant public support. This has placed significant pressure on global leaders to respond positively to her.
1.1.2.2. Con: The United Nations has often been derided as being an [ineffective talking shop](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266400604_The_UNGA-a_talking_shop_Exploring_rationales_for_the_repetition_of_resolutions_in_subsequent_negotiations)(The United Nations General Assembly \(UNGA\) is frequently criticized as being an inefficient talking shop. Such criticism is partially due to the fact that UNGA resolutions are not legally binding, and partially due to the considerable share of resolutions that are debated repeatedly in multiple UNGA sessions.). If Thunberg wanted to avoid endless debate and incite action, then she should focus her activism elsewhere.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Whilst ineffective in some areas, the UN has been successful in consistently gathering representatives of many global powers under one organisation. This is a valuable asset that Thunberg was able to take advantage of.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Having the ability to speak to representatives of many global powers at once presents the issue of climate change as a global issue, not just one that is relevant to a handful of nations.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Speaking to representatives of many global powers at once is more efficient than traveling to many individual nations in order to address their governments.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The UN has failed to tackle the climate crisis [for the last 30 years](https://theconversation.com/dont-bet-on-the-un-to-fix-climate-change-its-failed-for-30-years-123308)(Some would argue that trying to get 197 countries to agree on anything is a fool’s errand. For 20 years, critics such as the international relations expert David Victor have questioned whether the UN is the appropriate venue for climate negotiations. Victor argues that such a forum is inevitably going to lead to gridlock. He’s not alone in this – as early as 1983 some policy analysts in the US were saying that such a global problem could not be solved because of the complexity of its politics.).
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The UN kick-started the global discussion on climate change by tabling the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change) in 1992.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)\) published in a 2022 report "[a damning indictment of failed global leadership on climate](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112852)."
1.1.2.3. Pro: There are [193 member states of the United Nations](https://www.worldometers.info/united-nations/). Addressing the UN may be the only opportunity for an activist to speak to representatives of most nations on Earth at once.
1.1.3. Con: The media and the internet greatly exaggerate the role that Greta Thunberg has played in launching a global discussion on climate change.
1.1.3.1. Con: Even if Thunberg's role was greatly exaggerated, the fact that it has caught media attention still plays an important part in launching a global discussion on climate change.
1.1.3.2. Pro: There are numerous youth activists preceding Thunberg who are not credited as heavily despite doing work comparable to that done by Thunberg.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Indigenous or Black youth activists are [often erased, or their work obscured](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/10/11/20904791/young-climate-activists-of-color), when mentioning leaders in the fight against climate change.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Thunberg has attempted to [redirect attention](https://apnews.com/baa29614a79cbcd2edb83b9e3f7de90f) to activists representing underprivileged communities and countries.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if Thunberg has tried to redirect attention, Indigenous environmental activism is shown as [an echo of Thunberg’s voice](https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/11-10-2019/its-not-just-greta-the-nobel-peace-prize-belongs-to-indigenous-climate-activists)(This narrative that activists like those above exist only to echo Thunberg’s call invalidates the impact of indigenous peoples who have fought for climate justice for years, and further perpetuates the colonial ‘white saviour’ stereotype. It is insulting to present members of the communities most threatened by climate change as passive onlookers who are only now being spurred into action by the ‘Thunberg effect’.), which invalidates the impact of indigenous peoples who have fought for climate justice for years.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: An indigenous student activist, Tokata Iron Eyes, invited [Thunberg to her school where they spoke about the proposed Keystone XL pipeline](https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4710375-Who-is-Tokata-Iron-Eyes-and-why-did-Greta-Thunberg-come-to-the-Dakotas-to-see-her) and marched together in a [climate rally in Rapid City, South Dakota](https://ndncollective.org/thunberg-and-takota-iron-eyes-join-forces-and-elevate-climate-justice-conversation/).
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Diverse voices have highlighted the importance of raising the existing critical issues of representation and inclusion in the global climate movement.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Xiye Bastida](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/xiye-bastida-climate-activism_n_5d8a7ec9e4b0c6d0cef3023e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9pZGVudGl0aWVzLzIwMTkvMTAvMTEvMjA5MDQ3OTEveW91bmctY2xpbWF0ZS1hY3RpdmlzdHMtb2YtY29sb3I&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAZV4y1lLloQq-xDMOys8peZ0wFuWk_A0iv5rblf0w4mM4zz-kBSSpoUIGyhiKnPbeciDO4gewDQG9ZTpY03SPCKUbsL405pVscJO0my5uWcBrtpMjR39sghoynMIG91vPae0oiE9_S91PSvq0-UR0xnkt7Q7lszHAqqt32xH8Ag) is not as widely represented in the media despite working with several climate-focused groups, lobbying lawmakers in New York, having spoken at several UN events, and having often lead climate-change protests.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Climate activists have criticized that environmental activism can be seen as a '[white privilege](https://aninjusticemag.com/environmental-activism-as-white-privilege-1a607a0e6f7)'.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Thunberg has never experienced [the negative effects of climate change](https://theowp.org/is-greta-thunberg-too-privileged-to-lead-the-charge-for-climate-activism/)(As Greta toured through Canada and the U.S., meeting various important politicians, representatives, and people directly affected by climate change, she became the subject of much discussion both online and in university and high school settings. The discussions also generate a debate on whether a young, privileged, white Swedish girl should have the authority to represent a movement that may affect her far less than large numbers of young indigenous climate activists who are not heard. Is this simply another reflection of how the world has selective ears for the privileged? She has never had to suffer through water contamination and its associated diseases, she has never had to evacuate her home to escape severe, destructive weather conditions. Ought we, as young people, accept her leadership, or use the momentum she has created to bring others, with real experiences around the matter, into the spotlight?), such as water contamination and its associated diseases or even displacement due to destructive weather conditions.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Activists do not need to experience issues in order to raise awareness of them. Thunberg is campaigning so that herself and others do not have to experience these hardships in the future.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Because Thunberg has never experienced these negative effects, her activism could fall under the "white savior" complex because it inspires a climate movement with millions of supporters [who are a long way from the real lives of people fighting to stay alive](https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/09/29/views-from-the-global-south-how-to-decolonise-the-climate-crisis)(The Global South has urgent problems which push climate goals into the background, says Kaveh Madani, an environmental scientist at Yale and Imperial College London.\n\n\[...\]\n\nWhen it comes to addressing climate change, countries in the Global North and South face different realities.\n\n\[...\]\n\nMadani reflects that figures like Greta Thunberg, whose activism inspires a climate movement with millions of supporters, are a long way from the real lives of Yemeni, Palestinian, or Afghan girls who simply want to stay alive or go to school).
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Thunberg is not purporting herself to be the "white savior", but rather is engaging in activism on behalf of those who do not have the privilege or resources to make a significant change.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: [Climate change mostly affects people in the global south](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/09/we-need-to-be-heard-the-bame-climate-activists-who-wont-be-ignored)(Why have BAME activists so often been ignored? “Historically, the environmental movement comes from a white, privileged background,” says Suzanne Dhaliwal, 37, who is researching BAME representation in the climate justice movement at the University of Brighton. “But climate change mostly affects people in the global south, so it’s fair to elevate those voices.”). However historically, the environmental movement comes from a white, privileged background. That is why there are some movements to [reframe climate activism](https://climatereframe.co.uk/) in order to elevate the voices of the ones that do directly suffer climate change.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: A New Zealand climate group linked to Thunberg called 'School Strike 4 Climate Auckland' was criticized and ended up being disbanded for being a [‘racist white-dominated space](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/greta-thunberg-new-zealand-school-strike-b1866457.html)(“We are not holding any more climate strikes in the Auckland region. Our members have also separated from the national SS4C team. Going forward, we will only be using our social media to uplift BIPOC-led climate justice spaces in Auckland.”\n\nIt added that SS4C AKL “has been a racist, white-dominated space” and “tokenised” BIPOC voices such as “those of Pasifika and Māori individuals in the climate activism space”.\n\nThe statement also apologised “for the hurt, burnout, and trauma caused to many BIPOC individuals” and said the disbanding of the chapter was “well overdue”.)’.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.3. Con: Thunberg has demonstrated that her voice can [amplify other voices all around the world](https://news.globallandscapesforum.org/46649/why-the-fight-for-climate-justice-is-a-fight-for-justice-itself/)("Our allies in the Global North increasingly have a role to play in amplifying our voices,” Tomlinson continues. “They can utilize these platforms to highlight our plight in the Global South and to share some of the challenges we face.”) to highlight some of the climate-related challenges that different parts of the world are facing.
1.1.3.2.1.2.3. Con: [Thunberg has empowered the voice of all climate activists](https://www.volunteerfdip.org/greta-thunberg-inspiration-to-climate-change-activists-and-conservation-volunteers) and has created a global platform to discuss the existing critical issues in the global climate movement.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4. Con: Thunberg has been described as a "[a messenger for a growing movement](https://www.vox.com/2019/9/19/20873043/greta-thunberg-climate-activism-washington-sunrise)(As she tours Washington, Thunberg proves she isn’t a lone voice but a messenger for a growing movement.)."
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: An Ugandan climate activist, [Vanessa Nakate](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/whites-only-photo-uganda-climate-activist-vanessa-nakate), called out racism in media after she was cropped out of a "whites-only image" featuring prominent climate activists including Thunberg.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The fact that Vanessa Nakate was cropped out of the picture has nothing to do with Thunberg's positive influence on society, instead it is probably the result of the [bias of Western media](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01292980009364781).
1.1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: This incident highlighted the ongoing [erasure of global South voices in climate debates](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58808509).
1.1.3.2.1.3.3. Pro: [Western media tend to portray 'white saviour' solutions to climate change](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2021/11/12/erasure-of-vanessa-nakate-crop-why-africa-needs-voice-in-climate-debates-cop26/)(The erasure of Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate at the COP26 UN climate summit is another example of how western media portrays ‘white saviour’ solutions to the problem, reinforcing the need for real global South involvement.), which can explain why Thunberg has had more media representation.
1.1.3.2.1.4. Con: [Thunberg](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Thunberg-Indigenous-Peoples-Lead-the-Fight-Against-Crisis-20200207-0001.html) praised the role of Indigenous people in the fight against global climate change during a demonstration in Jokkmokk, Sweden.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Numerous [youth activists](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/04/greta-thunberg-wasnt-the-first-to-demand-climate-action-meet-more-young-activists-feature/) preceding Thunberg have now gained more visibility thanks to the awareness on climate change activism brought by Thunberg.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: Media attention is a valid result when it comes to raising environmental awareness.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: There are many young activists whose fight for indigenous environmental rights are not represented in the media as much as Thunbergs' climate fight.
1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: The [Standing Rock movement](https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/27023/the-youth-of-standing-rock)(Numbering just over 8,000, the Standing Rock Sioux live on a stretch of plains that reaches across state lines from North to South Dakota. The reservation was once part of a far more vast expanse of land controlled by a confederation of Sioux tribes, including the Lakota and Dakota. That territory was dramatically whittled down in 1868 to an area of roughly 25 million acres, encompassing most of modern western South Dakota, when the federal government via treaty consolidated the tribes into the Great Sioux Reservation.) was initiated by a youth group comprising of Indigenous activists.
1.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Jamie Margolin is a first-generation daughter of a Colombian immigrant and the co-founder of the climate action organization [Zero Hour](http://thisiszerohour.org/who-we-are/), a group that fights for environmental Indigenous rights.
1.1.3.2.4.3. Con: Thunberg has lent her voice and support to [indigenous youth groups demanding climate justice.](https://peoplesclimatecase.caneurope.org/2020/02/greta-thunberg-joins-the-indigenous-saami-youth-to-demand-climate-justice-2/)(Greta Thunberg joined the climate strike organised by the Sáminuorra on 07 February 2020. The climate strike which was an occasion to underline the importance of indigenous knowledge and culture to tackle the climate crisis, marked the 102nd anniversary of the first Saami congress, representing the indigenous people of northern Europe.) Thunberg cannot be blamed for the failure of the media to represent indigenous peoples.
1.1.3.2.5. Con: The actions and success of Thunberg with the media has nothing to do with the failure of other activists to gain media attention.
1.1.3.3. Con: The fact that Thunberg is a prominent and often-mentioned figure in the media is proof of her significance to the global discussion.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Thunberg's activism aims to highlight and promote discussion on climate change. Thunberg has become a personification of the climate change discussion, and her prominence contributes to the aims of her activism.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: The prominence of Thunberg as a figure for the climate change discussion draws focus away from the actual issue at hand: climate change and its consequences.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Discourse surrounding Thunberg often devolves into [harassment and bullying](https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2020/02/19/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-faces-systemic-hatred-bullying-and-harassment/)(Ever since her passionate speech at the UN Climate Summit in New York, Greta Thunberg has been facing increased harassment and threats.), which distracts people from the discussion of climate change.
1.1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Much of the criticism leveled against Thunberg has been spearheaded by older age-sets, particularly [middle-aged men.](https://qz.com/1719873/greta-thunberg-comes-under-attack-from-misogynistic-men/) These are often personal attacks that have little to do with her climate change efforts.
1.1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Andrew Bolt, a 60-year old Australian journalist, [called](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/the-disturbing-secret-to-the-cult-of-greta-thunberg/news-story/55822063e3589e02707fbb5a9a75d4cc) Thunberg "freakishly influential" and "the deeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement."
1.1.3.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Chris Kenny, a 57-year old commentator, described Thunberg as a “[hysterical teenager](https://consortiumnews.com/2019/11/07/misogyny-male-rage-the-words-men-use-to-describe-greta-thunberg/)(Sky News commentator Chris Kenny described her as a “hysterical teenager” who needs to be cared for.)” who needs to be cared for.
1.1.3.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Brendan O'Neill, a British columnist, [called](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/04/22/the-cult-of-greta-thunberg/) Thunberg a "millenarian weirdo".
1.1.3.3.2.1.1.4. Con: Some have claimed that the ['deification' of Greta Thunberg](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/greta-thunberg-attackers-climate-crisis-activist)(Thunberg is a particularly tempting target. Bolt made much of the fact that she is “someone with disorders which intensify fears”. This is deeply reassuring for people who think anyone who is afraid for the future of the planet is overreacting. “Eco-anxiety” can be dismissed as a pathology rather than as a rational response to a growing emergency.\n\nThunberg has become exhibit A for those like O’Neill who want to rebrand the environmental cause as “climate-change alarmism”. They see in Thunberg someone who makes this dismissive charge seem plausible. Why try to criticise thousands of sober, grownup scientists when you can have a go at a pig-tailed Young Turk instead?.) can have a negative effect on the so-called “eco-anxiety”, because it can be dismissed as a pathology instead of a rational response to a growing emergency.
1.1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Thunberg was mocked by the Chinese State media when they '[fat shamed](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/greta-thunberg-china-fat-shaming-b1851860.html)' her and called her an 'environmental princess'.
1.1.3.3.2.2. Con: Thunberg has set the focus [on what it means to lead a cause](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/25/greta-thunberg-showed-the-world-what-it-means-to-lead). By doing so, she has set an example of how climate change actions should be led.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Thunberg wasn't the first [young activist to demand climate action](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/greta-thunberg-wasnt-the-first-to-demand-climate-action-meet-more-young-activists-feature), others had also influenced the youth before.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: [Severn Suzuki](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/before-greta-there-was-severn-the-b-c-girl-who-silenced-the-world) was 12 years old when she gave a speech to the 1992 UN climate conference in Rio, alongside three other young activists.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: 27 years before Thunberg started her school strikes, Suzuki became known as the "[girl who silenced the world](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/before-greta-there-was-severn-the-b-c-girl-who-silenced-the-world)".
1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: The fact that even [30 years after her speech](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/environmental-crises-pose-biggest-threats-to-global-population-over-next-decade-wef-global-risks-report-2022-81109) climate change is still a threat shows how difficult it is to have a positive impact on society as an activist.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: Even if Thunberg wasn't the first young activist to demand climate action, [she has become the most influential voice](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2019/12/12/why-greta-thunberg-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-powerful-women/).
1.1.4. Con: Greta Thunberg's approach to activism is too emotional to create meaningful discussion or effective change.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Political decisions, such as those relating to climate change, should be based on rational argument and reason, not on emotion.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Political decisions regarding climate change should be based on [rational arguments based on scientific evidence](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg62618/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg62618.pdf)(Scientific research plays a role in guiding the nation’s response to climate change\nby:\n• projecting the beneficial and adverse effects of climate changes;\n• identifying and evaluating the likely or possible consequences, including unin-\ntended consequences, of different policy options to address climate change;\n• improving the effectiveness of existing options and expanding the portfolio of\noptions available for responding to climate change; and\n• developing improved decision-making processes.). \(p.7\)
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Climate change has become a political problem more than a scientific one](https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/opinion/climate-change-is-a-problem-of-politics-not-science/), therefore political solutions should be mainly guided by science.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Despite indisputable climate data and appeals based on rationality and reason, politicians still display [climate apathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332219302714)(The non-result of the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference \(COP25\) confirmed that consensual political will for implementing the Paris Agreement is still lacking despite strident protests by civil society actors, such as #FridaysForFuture. Breaking this deadlock requires not only reconsidering global climate-governance architectures but also a more pronounced stance of researchers at the science-policy-society interface.).
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: [A study found](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160315182709.htm) that anxiety negatively affects decision-making. In particular, more mistakes are made when the correct choice involves ignoring distracting information. This is analogous to political decision-makers working in the current environment of climate anxiety.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: [Anxiety](https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/03/02/anxious-people-decisions/) may be linked to difficulty in using information about whether the situations we face daily are stable or not, and deciding how to react.
1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: The study also showed that while there are more bad decisions made to complete a task, the set tasks were completed nevertheless.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: Research shows that anxious individuals prefer [low-risk/low-reward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions_in_decision-making#Positive_and_negative_emotions) options. Politically, this is a sensible approach.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Climate change does not provide humanity with the possibility of a low-risk/low-reward option. Thunberg has attempted to [highlight this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/12/27/greta-thunberg-state-climate-movement-roots-her-power-an-activist/)(Well, there are many different numbers that include many different things. But it’s just the principle that we need to understand: that we have a very limited time, that we are using up the carbon dioxide budget right now — no matter which carbon dioxide budget you go for — and that cannot be undone in the future.) to the public and world leaders.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Drastic action is likely to be necessary; the disastrous effects of climate change can already be seen in the [rising sea-level and increased number of extreme weather events](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/state-of-climate-2021-extreme-events-and-major-impacts).
1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: If climate change risks causing [increased drought, hunger and flooding](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/effects-of-climate-change)(Humans and wild animals face new challenges for survival because of climate change. More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people’s livelihoods and communities.), then the stakes are already too high to make a low-risk/low-reward option feasible.
1.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: A risk averse philosophy in politics can lead to greater stability within society. This stability allows for non-political actors like activists and NGOs to work in a more effective manner.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: Arguably, many political decisions are based on [emotions](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-dont-confuse-me-with-the-facts-1.5381255).
1.1.4.1.4.1. Con: This is not evidence that those decision have been thoughtful, effective or beneficial.
1.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's PM, has stated that her decision-making process is often based on information and [instinct](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/07/instinct-v-advice-pm-jacinda-ardern-reveals-decision-making-process.html).
1.1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: Instinct can lead to [errors in public decision making](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/vbook.htm).
1.1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: She has been lauded for her [empathetic](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/australia/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-leader.html) leadership style, especially after a mass shooting in a New Zealand mosque, where she visibly grieved with victims' families.
1.1.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: [According to a study,](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.749715/full#h7)(Ardern’s relatively wide window not only directly shaped her own effective decision-making, but also indirectly affected New Zealand’s successful collective response. In contrast, Trump’s relatively narrow window allowed stress arousal and emotions to drive much of his decision-making, while also indirectly undermining the United States’ collective response.) Jacinda Ardern’s emotions and "wide window" of tolerance directly shaped her effective decision-making, and indirectly affected New Zealand’s "successful collective response".
1.1.4.1.4.2.4. Con: If Jacinda Ardern has based her decision-making process on instinct it could explain why her pandemic strategic shift caused anger and [confusion on COVID strategy](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/453182/the-week-in-politics-transition-confusion-and-auckland-s-road-to-nowhere).
1.1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Emotions represent a [rhetorical tool in political discourses than can enhance its efficiency](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281108732_Emotions_as_a_rhetorical_tool_in_political_discourse)(The analysis of \nemotionally charged linguistic units and of their potential/real discursive \neffects through some concrete cases not only helps to understand the way \npolitical rhetoric functions but also questions the relationship between \npolitics, power, media and lay public.). \(p.1\)
1.1.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: Emotions will always play a role in decisions being made, given that the effect is often [subconscious.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intense-emotions-and-strong-feelings/201012/it-or-not-emotions-will-drive-the-decisions-you) It's unrealistic to demand that politicians give up on emotions and to make purely rational decisions.
1.1.4.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: For example, a decision that will give an advantage to a particular position might be fuelled by a fear of insignificance or a \(perceived\) threat of poverty.
1.1.4.1.4.3.1.2. Con: Even if politicians may have subconscious emotions, their professional role is typically supported by a team of experts that recommend [rational decisions](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MD-02-2019-0261/full/html).
1.1.4.1.4.3.2. Con: Emotions as a rhetorical tool in political discourses can also engage in [dangerous discourses of fear of the 'Other'](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/humaff-2016-0020/html?lang=en).
1.1.4.1.5. Con: Politicians often encounter situations that confound the rational approach to decision making.
1.1.4.1.5.1. Con: Politician's decisions need to be based on rational decision making because their [ability to act is limited by political procedures of democracy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2514848619887464)(First, politicians’ ability to act – their agency – is limited by the practicalities and procedures of everyday politics, and by the norms and cultures of their working life. Second, UK politicians feel little pressure from their electors to act on climate change, and have to work to justify why action on climate change carries democratic legitimacy.) and by the norms of their working life.
1.1.4.1.5.2. Con: The fact that politicians might find situations that confound the rational approach to decision making is a prime example of [political barriers to the fight against climate change](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/political-barriers-to-climate-change-adaptation)(The views on adaptation varied largely between left-wing and right-wing parties. The latter tended to consider adaptation as a trivial dimension of climate policy, compared to the most important theme of mitigation and its relationship to energy supply and economic growth.), which can differ between left-wing and right-wind parties.
1.1.4.1.5.3. Pro: According to the theory of "[mood maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions_in_decision-making#Positive_and_negative_emotions)" happy decision-makers are reluctant to gamble \(risky behavior\); happy people decide against gambling, since they would not want to undermine the happy feeling.
1.1.4.1.5.4. Pro: Politicians are often faced with [transformative experiences](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/rational-decision-making-in-politics/), the outcome of which cannot rationally be determined without implementing the change.
1.1.4.1.5.5. Pro: Arguably, decisions relating to the climate are often exactly the type of situation/decision that confounds rational approaches to decision making, given they require us to try predict future outcomes, and how to mitigate future harms, while minimising damage to current populations.
1.1.4.2. Con: Emotions can positively impact our willingness to engage in [collective action.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action)
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Research](https://sciencenordic.com/denmark-emotions-politics/emotions-in-politics-make-us-rational/1463019) has shown that emotions can make citizens more likely to seek out information and better inform themselves.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: An issue becoming common knowledge is the first step in [identifying collective action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action)(In Bratman \(1993\) Bratman proposed that, roughly, two people "share an intention" to paint a house together when each intends that the house is painted by virtue of the activity of each, and also intends that it is so painted by virtue of the intention of each that it is so painted. That these conditions obtain must also be "common knowledge" between the participants.).
1.1.4.2.1.2. Con: Emotions have also been [identified as the fuel for fake news](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2021.1990610)(Emotional reactivity of participants was associated with response behavior intentions such that participants who reported high levels of emotions were more likely to take actions that would spread or suppress the fake news, participants who reported low levels of emotions were more likely to ignore or disengage from the spread of false news, and participants who reported high levels of negative emotions and low levels of positive emotions were more likely to suppress the spread of fake news and less likely to contribute to the spread of fake news.).
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/168723506/spc3.12031.pdf)(In this article, I take\nstock and look ahead by briefly reviewing four core social-psychological motivations for undertaking\ncollective action \(based on identity, morality, emotion, and efficacy\).) has found that emotion is one of the four core motivations when undertaking collective action. \(p.2\)
1.1.4.2.3. Con: While [anger has often been linked to collective action](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/168723506/spc3.12031.pdf)(A broad range of work suggests that anger is the most relevant emotion with respect to\ncollective action because it is an approach emotion.) being taken, [fear](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-10643-003)(The results further indicate that fear, in addition to affecting the impact of known causes of collective action \(anger and group efficacy\), is a powerful inhibitor of collective action. The implications for current theoretical models of collective action instigators are discussed.) has been shown to inhibit collective action. \(p.381\)
1.1.4.3. Con: Thunberg's emotionality is preferable to climate change [apathy from world leaders](https://www.theweek.co.uk/103444/greta-thunberg-accuses-world-leaders-of-betraying-young-people)(Greta Thunberg has attacked world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through their apathy over the climate crisis.) - which is what angers her.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Although lacking the emotionality displayed by Thunberg, world leaders have not been apathetic towards climate change and have taken steps to combat it.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Many world leaders have signed the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), which is a legally binding, international climate change agreement.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Ex-Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, has a long history of environmental advocacy, and took many actions to combat climate change while in power.
1.1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: Merkel presided over the first ever [UN Climate Conference in 1995](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/making-climate-chancellor-angela-merkel)(Merkel is made Federal Environment Minister. In 1995, she presides over the first UN Climate Conference in Berlin, which puts Germany at the forefront of the global movement to cut CO2 emissions.).
1.1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Merkel introduced a policy aimed at [transitioning Germany into using renewable energy](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/three-top-world-leaders-fighting-climate-change)(Only a few years later, in 2011, the center-right politician announced a sweeping new energy policy – called the German energiewende \(energy transition\) – that sought to transform the nation from one powered by nuclear and fossil fuel energy to one receiving almost all of its energy from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. And she intended for it all to happen within just a few decades.) in 2011.
1.1.4.3.1.2.3. Con: Merkel has been criticized for setting lofty climate goals, but not taking the drastic actions required to fulfill them. This is a condemnation that Thunberg has [leveled](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/28/world/greta-thunberg-climate-intl/index.html)(Swedish activist Greta Thunberg mocked world leaders -- including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson -- at a youth climate summit in Milan on Tuesday, saying the last 30 years of climate action had amounted to "blah, blah, blah.") at world leaders previously.
1.1.4.3.1.3. Con: World leaders have shown their apathy by not taking drastic enough steps to stop global warming. Even optimistic models predict a rise of [1° Celsius](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/predictions-future-global-climate)(Climate models predict that Earth's global average temperature will rise and additional 4° C \(7.2° F\) during the 21st Century if greenhouse gas levels continue to rise. But with swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, models project that global average temperature will only rise an additional 1° Celsius \(1.8° F\).) in the next century, which may have [wide-reaching effects](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/predictions-future-global-climate)(Warmer temperatures will cause \(and are causing\) changes to other aspects of climate - such as rain, snow, and clouds. They are also causing changes to the ocean, life, ice, and all other parts of the Earth system.).
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Thunberg's communication strategy has framed climate change as a moral and ethical issue by using [an emotional appeal of hope](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19401612211055691)(This study elucidates her communication strategy by applying the concept of framing to unpack how she frames climate change as a moral and ethical issue, uses an emotional appeal of hope, and visually frames motivational collective action to mobilize her audience.) to mobilize collective action.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Thunberg approaches climate change with [fear and emotional manipulation](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/read-greta-thunberg-s-full-speech-united-nations-climate-action-n1057861), instead of actually providing solutions. This can be seen in her speech at the UN Climate Action Summit.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Thunberg is not the only young environmental activist that has publicly claimed [to live in constant fear and climate anxiety](https://apnews.com/article/climate-united-nations-health-us-news-climate-change-2d7ccb5d1b3242b9923deb2ca197a56b)(“Young people from different parts of the world are living in constant fear and climate anxiety, fearing their future,” Komal Kumar, a youth climate activist from Fiji, told United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at Saturday’s youth climate summit.).
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: [Thunberg](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/greta-thunbergs-despair-is-entirely-warranted/598492/)'s campaign is designed to instill fear. As she herself has said: "\(...\) I want you to panic, I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.”
1.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Thunberg’s headline “I want you to panic” has also become a [communication strategy for brands](https://thefifthestate.com.au/columns/spinifex/brands-too-should-want-you-to-panic-how-fear-in-advertising-can-work-to-energise-action-on-the-climate-emergency/) because [negative emotions such as fear can quickly lead to viral messages](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332848620_Viruses_Going_Viral_Impact_of_Fear-Arousing_Sensationalist_Social_Media_Messages_on_User_Engagement).
1.1.4.4.2.2. Con: A reasonable amount of fear might push people to make the right decisions to help stop climate change, which might otherwise threaten their existence.
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: Raising fears and anxieties about climate change may lead to negative consequences.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: A fairly recent psychological disorder '[eco-anxiety](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b2e7ee32-ad28-4ec4-89aa-a8b8c98f95a5)' afflicts an increasing number of individuals who worry about climate change.
1.1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Thunberg cannot be held responsible for how listeners react to her speeches. Those who react with worry and fear and make hasty decisions are entirely responsible for their own emotional reactions and decisions.
1.1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: If the eco-anxiety caused by Thunberg's rhetoric causes real action to be taken to combat climate change, then her impact on society is positive.
1.1.4.4.3.1.3. Pro: Climate activists and scientists have reported having [severe anxiety](https://eos.org/features/the-emotional-toll-of-climate-change-on-science-professionals)(There are also significant emotional strains on those who communicate climate science, including anxiety about constantly delivering bad news or about communicating to those who distrust or reject mainstream climate science. Because climate change and its impacts \(e.g., exacerbated flooding\) are pressing problems that pose increasing risks for humans, climate communicators—whether scientists, emergency managers, or others—often face high-intensity, high-volume workloads and long hours.) from reporting on issues surrounding climate change.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.1.4.4.3.3. Con: Climate change itself might lead to [worse consequences](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/effects-of-climate-change) than anxiety.
1.1.4.4.3.4. Con: Fear and anxiety about climate change is mostly experienced because [negative environmental effects](https://theconversation.com/climate-anxiety-is-real-why-talking-about-it-matters-172813) are now [being felt](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-has-already-hit-southern-africa-heres-how-we-know-169062) and [seen](https://www.wwfca.org/en/our_work/climate_change_and_energy/climate_change_impacts_la/) around the world.
1.1.4.4.4. Con: Thunberg's UN Climate Action Summit speech didn't use manipulation or fear, it was a [powerful emotional speech](https://www.climateaction.org/news/you-have-stolen-my-education-greta-thunbergs-powerful-speech-at-the-un-clim) which aimed to wake leaders up.
1.1.4.5. Con: Dismissing Thunberg's message due to her expressiveness and emotion is ableist and misogynistic.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: [Thunberg's message is more often dismissed as emotional due to her age](https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2019/09/27/dont-dismiss-young-voices-heres-why/), independently of her sex or her condition.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: Calling Thungerg's approach "[emotional](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/3817)(The inability to properly control\nemotions, which is believed to invalidate a claim, is one of the most salient stereotypes of\nwomen in the West, and thus calling a woman emotional will be more believable than calling a\nman emotional.)" is symptomatic of a general tendency to undermine what women, particularly young women, have to say about problems they identify. \(p.3\)
1.1.4.5.3. Pro: Thunberg's tendency to appear direct and emotional may be [a symptom of her Asperger's syndrome](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/02/greta-thunberg-responds-to-aspergers-critics-its-a-superpower)(Tony Attwood, a world authority on Asperger’s, has said people diagnosed are “usually renowned for being direct, speaking their mind and being honest and determined and having a strong sense of social justice”.). Simply dismissing it as being too emotional is ableist.
1.1.4.5.4. Con: It would be ableist and misogynistic to not hold her to the same standards as everyone else.
1.1.4.6. Pro: Thunberg's panic and emotion perpetuate the [exaggeration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/09/18/immediacy-threat-climate-change-exaggerated-faulty-models/)(Climate change poses less of an immediate threat to the planet than previously thought because scientists got their modelling wrong, a new study has found. New research by British scientists reveals the world is being polluted and warming up less quickly than 10-year-old forecasts predicted, giving countries more time to get a grip on their carbon output.) of the effects of climate change.
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: Thunberg's activism has been described as "[climate change alarmism](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/anti-greta-teen-activist-cpac-conference-climate-sceptic)(Naomi Seibt, 19, who styles herself as a “climate sceptic” or “climate realist”, will this week address the Conservative Political Action Conference \(CPAC\) near Washington, joining speakers including Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence.\n\n\[...\]\n\n“Climate change alarmism at its very core is a despicably anti-human ideology,” she has said.)."
1.1.4.6.2. Con: Even if the threat is exaggerated, this does not mean that action shouldn't be taken to tackle the climate collapse.
1.1.4.6.2.1. Pro: If exaggeration leads to climate action, then only positive results can occur. Better climate consciousness would result in cleaner air and water, as well as more [stable weather patterns](https://racetozero.unfccc.int/climate-repair-three-things-we-must-do-now-to-stabilise-the-planet/).
1.1.4.6.2.2. Con: The exaggeration of threats could disrupt the prioritization of issues facing world leaders, and cause them to make incorrect decisions.
1.1.4.6.2.2.1. Pro: Enforcing the belief that climate change may cause [resource shortages soon](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/megatrends/climate-change-and-resource-scarcity.html) may lead to preemptive conflicts over limited resources.
1.1.4.6.2.2.2. Pro: If world leaders are distracted with handling climate change prematurely, they may neglect other existential crises, such as a [new pandemic or social inequality](https://theconversation.com/earths-existential-threats-inequality-pandemics-and-climate-change-demand-global-leadership-154325).
1.1.4.6.2.2.3. Con: Thunberg has often [criticized leaders for having failed at enacting any change to avoid climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-49795270), therefore it could be said that world leaders have already made incorrect decisions.
1.1.4.6.2.2.3.1. Pro: Refusal to act on an issue as pressing as climate change, in the face of [undeniable evidence](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/)(It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.), is a conscious and incorrect decision.
1.1.4.6.2.2.3.2. Con: The focus should be put on the present actions that world leaders should take in order to avoid the worsening of the climate crisis.
1.1.4.6.3. Con: [Evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-should-we-talk-about-whats-happening-to-our-planet/2019/08/26/d28c4bcc-b213-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html) suggests the threats of climate change are [accurate](https://www.sciencealert.com/is-it-time-to-call-it-a-climate-crisis). In light of this, many media [sources](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/blog/climate-change-or-climate-crisis-whats-right-lingo) made a conscious [decision](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/guardian-language-changes-climate-environment) to change their [language](https://theconversation.com/language-matters-when-the-earth-is-in-the-midst-of-a-climate-crisis-117796), using climate crisis, or emergency.
1.1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Experts have explained [numerous flaws](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-scientists-hit-back-at-claims-global-warming-projections-are-greatly-exaggerated) with the research that claims to prove the threat is exaggerated.
1.1.4.6.4. Pro: Thunberg has been accused of performing "[emotional blackmail](https://theprint.in/talk-point/greta-thunberg-on-climate-change-is-a-teens-plea-more-moving-or-emotional-blackmail/298508/)(Greta Thunberg’s activism is more of an emotional blackmail. There are several Gretas around the world, including in India, who are doing their bit without hogging the limelight or giving “icy cold looks” to world leaders.)".
1.1.4.7. Con: Climate change and its consequences are inherently emotional, and Thunberg accurately reflects this in her approach to activism.
1.1.4.7.1. Con: It could be argued that any environmental or social issue that affects human beings is emotional. However, emotions that feed anxiety [can lead to burnout rather than action](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/constant-anxiety-wont-save-the-world/537132/).
1.1.4.7.2. Con: Whilst climate change is inherently emotional, an overemphasis on emotion is [climate hysteria](https://www.dailynews.com/2019/09/25/climate-hysteria-drives-the-extinction-of-common-sense/)(Thunberg is the Swedish teenager who helped to kick off climate week at the U.N. with a scorching speech to world leaders. “How dare you,” she seethed, accusing the government officials of stealing her dreams and ignoring “the beginning of a mass extinction.”\n\nThere has been a mass extinction of common sense.\n\nThe young activist told the world body that “the popular idea of cutting emissions by 50 percent” is utterly inadequate to head off “irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.”), which is not a wise way to approach activism.
1.1.4.7.3. Pro: Climate change has been shown to elicit feelings of [guilt, anger and powerlessness](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644240/full)(The results indicate that two of the five participants’ most selected emotions are shared with other nations \(‘concern,’ ‘guilt’\), while the other three have been less reported and studied in the climate change field \(‘powerlessness,’ ‘anger,’ and ‘confusion’\).).
1.1.4.7.4. Pro: By acknowledging the emotional impact of environmental change alongside embracing modern science, Thunberg's style of activism sidesteps the [technocratic frameworks that have dominated](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/the-new-climate-change-activism-is-emotional-and-its-a-good-thing/)(On the other hand, activists are asking everyone to be emotional about it, and this is a good thing. As my recent article in PRX journal discusses, they are showing a way out of the technocratic frame which has dominated climate change politics, and is preventing us from ‘solving’ the climate crisis.) climate discussions in the past.
1.1.5. Pro: Greta Thunberg has forced global leaders and activists to move past platitudes and take climate change more seriously.
1.1.5.1. Con: Thunberg critized global climate conferences for being ["empty talks" and "never-ending discussions"](https://www.undispatch.com/the-greta-thunberg-interview/) that aren’t leading to action, which shows that global leaders haven't moved past platitudes yet.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Global geopolitics is incredibly complex, and changes often. It is improper and immoral for Thunberg to criticise global leaders for discussing climate discussions without herself proposing solid and realistic solutions.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Even if she has acknowledged that compromises must be reached, she has still criticized world leaders for engaging in "[three decades of bla bla bla.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/greta-thunberg-message-to-the-davos-agenda/)(We understand that the world is very complex and that change doesn’t happen overnight. But you’ve now had more than three decades of bla bla bla. How many more do you need? Because when it comes to facing the climate and ecological emergency, the world is still in a state of complete denial. The justice for the most affected people in the most affected areas is being systematically denied.)"
1.1.5.2. Pro: Italian climate minister Roberto Cingolani accepted criticism from Thunberg, admitting that politicians "[were not credible in the past](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58743515)(Italy's climate minister says he accepts the criticism of Greta Thunberg who this week accused politicians of "30 years of blah, blah, blah".\n\nRoberto Cingolani told the BBC Ms Thunberg raised "a serious problem, we were not credible in the past".)".
1.1.5.3. Pro: Thunberg's influence has directly caused politicians to take action on climate change.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Thunberg has [criticized politicians for not trying "hard enough"](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49738225) to take effective actions on climate change.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: Thunberg has accused the current generation of politicians of "[giving up without even trying](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210422-greta-thunberg-blasts-politicians-for-ignoring-climate-crisis)(She also directly accused the current generation of politicians of "giving up without even trying. Well I'm here to tell you that unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight."\n\nThunberg in particular criticized the continued use of fossil fuel subsidies, which in the United States have been on the books for over 100 years, even though Washington committed in 2009 to bringing them to an end.)", which shows that she hasn't had such a positive influence on politicians.
1.1.5.3.3. Pro: During Thunberg's meeting with the leaders of the Green Party, [participants agreed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg) to start regular cross-party meetings on climate policy, to open consultations with youth climate activists and to have an independent body assess whether party manifestos were in line with the Paris agreement.
1.1.5.3.4. Pro: Thunberg's speech and presence at the main debating chamber of the House of Commons [caused Miliband](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg) to ask the government to declare a national climate emergency.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Thunberg [turned down](https://time.com/5713794/greta-thunberg-turns-down-environment-prize/) an environmental award because she believes it is time for the climate movement to move beyond such tokens.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Thunberg turned down an environmental award because she believes that the climate movement needs [people in power to start to “listen” to “science” and not awards](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/greta-thunberg-declines-award-climate-crisis).
1.1.5.4.2. Con: The rejection of the award can be perceived by people as arrogant.
1.1.5.4.2.1. Con: Thunberg hasn't ever put in effort to make herself more palatable, choosing to focus instead on her message. This isn't likely to hurt her standing among the people who are rallying behind her.
1.1.5.4.2.2. Pro: When Bob Dylan was thought to have disrespected the award by refusing to travel and accept his Nobel Prize, it was considered "[impolite and arrogant](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37740379)".
1.1.6. Con: Discussions about climate change were ongoing even without Greta Thunberg.
1.1.6.1. Con: Thunberg has received [lots of recognition](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/49405357) for her influence on the discussion around the climate crisis. While she is not the only voice, hers has been particularly effective.
1.1.6.2. Pro: There are plenty of [NGOs](https://medium.com/\@thalesetd/organizations-fighting-climate-change-a-quick-guide-2e700d96dc52) predating Thunberg, that specialize in climate change and awareness raising.
1.1.6.3. Con: Discussions about climate change before Thunberg media's presence were limited to politicians and experts. Thunberg managed to get [young citizens involved in the discussion](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760538254/greta-thunberg-to-u-s-you-have-a-moral-responsibility-on-climate-change).
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Thunberg is responsible for the creation of "[generation Greta](https://apnews.com/article/0070e5b1f63742b7a68cd7038fbde4fc)". This is a generation of youth activists who are actively involved in climate change talks.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: Young, uninformed citizens do not have the expertise to provide valuable insight into climate-based decision making. Getting them involved is populism, not activism.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: Young people will inherit the Earth after older generations die off. The emergence of "[generation Greta](https://en.unesco.org/courier/2021-2/generation-greta)" is positive for society, as it ensures that current decision-makers protect the environment that they will leave to younger generations.
1.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: The narratives of Thunberg and Donald Trump have been compared as they both act as '[populist truth-tellers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2021.1996818)(Populism is a storytelling performance that involves a charismatic ‘truth-teller’ and a populist narrative frame.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe aim of this article is one of theory generating, using the cases of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg to illustrate the idea of populism as storytelling. While their climate change stories are very different, both share an approach that relies on the ‘truth-telling’ character of their hero, applying the same populist narrative frame.)'.
1.1.6.3.2.2.1. Con: Such a comparison is inaccurate. Donald Trump purports to be a "truth-teller" and is often [anti-science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02800-9)(The US president’s actions have exacerbated the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people in the United States, rolled back environmental and public-health regulations and undermined science and scientific institutions.), whereas Thunberg urges world leaders to simply "[listen to the scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/18/greta-thunberg-testimony-congress-climate-change-action)(The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has bluntly told members of Congress to heed scientists’ warnings over global heating on a day when the existential anguish of young activists was given a voice at the heart of Washington DC power.)" and accept the truth of the climate crisis.
1.1.6.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump has consistently [ignored climate science and denied the existence of man-made climate change](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/us-elections-2020-a-history-of-trump-s-climate-change-denial-74075)(From the very beginning, the Trump administration took all the steps that it could to derail climate science and outreach. One of the first of these was a gag order on scientists and other employees of the Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\), which prevented them from indulging in any public communications.\n\nSince then, many scientists have complained of being sidelined and even demoted for speaking up. Subsequently, the administration removed the words climate change from many government scientific and policy reports.).
1.1.6.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Even if their agendas are different, they [both share storytelling skills.](https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2021/trump-and-thunberg-s-share-storytelling-skills)(The views of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg may differ on climate change but their speeches on the issue have more in common than people might think, a study suggests.)
1.1.6.3.2.2.2. Con: While both individuals have similar narrative frames, this does not mean that both individuals and agendas have similar merit.
1.1.6.3.2.2.3. Pro: Both Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg use a narrative of "the people" being pitted against "the elite", and use such a frame to [explain issues like climate change and the global response to it](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2021.1996818)(Populist ‘truth-tellers’ apply a particular narrative frame that pits ‘people’ against the ‘elite’ when interpreting complex problems such as climate change. The aim of this article is one of theory generating, using the cases of Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg to illustrate the idea of populism as storytelling.).
1.1.6.4. Pro: The [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was signed before Thunberg rose to fame.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: Thunberg has noted the ineffectiveness of the Paris Agreement, stating that the world is [still in denial over the actions needed to combat climate change](https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-greta-idUSKBN28L1L2)(Five years on from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world remains in denial over the actions needed to prevent catastrophic warming, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said on Friday.). This suggests that pre-Thunberg agreements were not radical enough to cause lasting change.
1.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: The five years after the Paris Agreement was signed were the [five hottest years on record](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/10/greta-thunberg-we-are-speeding-in-the-wrong-direction-on-climate-crisis).
1.1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: The Paris Agreement could not immediately lower temperatures, but rather it sets out a long-term structure for governments to [limit global warming in the future](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)(Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.\n\nTo achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century.).
1.1.6.4.1.2. Con: There are [no radical agreements to fight climate change](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-greta-idUSKCN24H1KQ) 'after Thunberg' either.
1.1.6.4.1.2.1. Con: We are not in an 'after Thunberg' period, as she has acknowledged that her fight is [far from over](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/greta-thunberg-college)(That said, it appears that Thunberg has yet to openly address the topic of college. Based on an interview in People, it appears as though Thunberg’s fight for the climate is far from over. She believes that the time to act is now, and that given the timeframe, everything else will have to wait until the crisis has passed.).
1.1.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: [According to a World Economic Forum 2022 report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-risks-report-2022/in-full/chapter-2-degrees-of-disorderly-climate-transition), we are in the phase of "climate \(in-\)action" and at risk of starting a "disorderly transition" to greener economies.
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: [The Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol)(In short, the Kyoto Protocol operationalizes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases \(GHG\) emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets. The Convention itself only asks those countries to adopt policies and measures on mitigation and to report periodically.) was adopted in 1997, before Thunberg was born.
1.2. Pro: Greta Thunberg has had positive influence on the youth of today.
1.2.1. Pro: Greta Thunberg has positively influenced today's youth into being more environmentally conscious.
1.2.1.1. Con: Youths were previously [environmentally conscious](https://theconversation.com/greta-thunberg-emerged-from-five-decades-of-environmental-youth-activism-in-sweden-171043)(With the emergence of modern environmentalism and the “ecological turn” around 1970, when knowledge of a global environmental crisis became more widespread, children and young people were mobilised to take action.\n\nOne of the first major Swedish initiatives was the campaign “Front against environmental degradation”, launched by insurance company Folksam in 1968. The corporation had strong ties to the social democratic government and launched a national competition where young people were given the task of documenting environmental problems in their local communities. These inventories formed the basis for a series of public hearings in 1969, where young people put an older generation of politicians, public officials and industry leaders against the wall. With an average attendance of 500 people, these hearings were considered a public success.).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: This does not negate Thunberg's positive influence on the youth in being even more environmentally conscious.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Thunberg's Fridays demonstrations echo the actions of young people who in [the late 1980s and early 1990s took up the cause of conservation](https://time.com/5549331/youth-climate-strike-ecokids/)(In 1990, TIME dubbed this group the ecokids: “a new generation of conservation-conscious, environmentally active schoolchildren” who “may be the best hope for the cause of preservation.”\n\nAs a feature that December noted, they were a group of children who had been getting the message about saving the planet for their whole lives, not just from school but also from TV shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers. Awareness of climate change was growing, and they were frightened by what they’d heard about holes in the ozone layer, oil spills and the extinction of animal species. \n\nThey were also the offspring of parents who grew up during the era of ’60s activism, and had inherited some of that tradition, starting early by forming clubs, circulating petitions and writing to Congress. \n\nThe “youngsters have become convinced that they were put on the planet for the express purpose of saving it,” the writer Philip Elmer-DeWitt observed.).
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that young people already took action against climate change in the late 80s and early 90s shows how environmental activism might not have enough impact on society.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The fact that climate change is still a pressing issue also shows that political apathy is not new, and that activism does not affect it.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Young people in the late 80s and early 90s didn't have the global exposure that is currently available to young activists thanks to the Internet and social media.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: The fact that Thunberg has continued the activism of past generations still constitutes a positive impact on society.
1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: If Thunberg had not continued the spirit of protest and activism of the past, then it is possible that it would have died out.
1.2.1.2. Con: Thunberg's '[Fridays For Future](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/why-millions-of-kids-around-the-world-are-skipping-school-today/fridays-for-future/slideshow/71214607.cms)' has lead to a considerable number of students bunking off lessons and school.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Young people are those with the most at stake in discussions around the climate crisis as those who will be alive for the brunt of its impacts. Thunberg has helped many young people decide to prioritise this crucial issue for their futures.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The de-prioritization of their education puts even more at stake on an individual level.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Although education is important for young people, having a planet to live on is the most important issue at stake. The climate crisis may threaten the survival of these students.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: According to a [2021 UNICEF report](https://www.unicef.org/media/105376/file/UNICEF-climate-crisis-child-rights-crisis.pdf)(Climate change is the greatest threat facing the world’s children and young people. We have known this for some time – based on what science told us, what the stories we heard from around the world have illustrated, and what we have witnessed with our own eyes – but today, we have the first analysis of climate risk from the most important perspective on this crisis – ours.), climate change is the greatest threat facing the world’s children and young people. \(p.4\)
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Over one-third of children globally are currently highly exposed to water scarcity and [almost 90% of children globally are exposed to air pollution](https://www.unicef.org/media/105376/file/UNICEF-climate-crisis-child-rights-crisis.pdf). \(p.10\)
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: [Education](https://www.iberdrola.com/social-commitment/climate-change-education)(Education, especially when focused on children and young people, is a key factor in helping to curb climate change.) should be the number one priority for children and young people so they can become the leaders of change that's needed to revert the climate crisis.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The de-prioritization of children's education could [increase inequalities](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-ed-opportunity/) in university admissions and future job opportunities.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Predictions suggest that young people will imminently face the [effects](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report) of the climate crisis: droughts, food shortages, flooding and extreme heat.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: This is alongside the effects that are harder to predict such as insect and animal species becoming [extinct from climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report) and our uncertainty about the numerous ways this could have ripple effects for the global eco-system.
1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Research has also suggested that these effects will be felt [across the globe](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report), with some experts predicting the effect on [US cities](https://qz.com/1727717/what-climate-change-will-do-to-three-major-american-cities-by-2100/).
1.2.1.2.1.2.3. Con: While young people will directly face the effects of the climate crisis, the older generation is currently leading the world, therefore the focus on 'environmental consciousness' should be put on them.
1.2.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: [Older and more experienced adult activists](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2021.641154/full) have knowledge that young activists lack, and they could also offer support on legal issues or liaising with the police.
1.2.1.2.1.2.3.2. Con: Older generations will likely be dead by the time the more damaging effects of climate change become reality. Therefore it is important that younger generations apply pressure on them to make decisions that account for future climate consequences.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: 'Fridays For Future' could have scheduled the demonstration on weekends, so as not to jeopardize the education of the youth and not to serve as an excuse to bunk off.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The effect would have been different in this way: on weekends it would not have been a "strike".
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: People are forced to pay attention to the protests of young people in a much more significant way when they are actively refusing to engage with their education and 'normal lives' due to their concerns about climate inaction by adults and governments.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: While [skipping school](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/skipping-class-big-societal-impact-experts-say/) can be an anecdotal experience for some students, it can also negatively impact more disadvantaged students.
1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Children from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to perform well in school](https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/migrated/files/2123), therefore if they skip school, their chances of successful education might suffer even more. \(p.1\)
1.2.1.2.2.2.2. Con: According to [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/eap/press-releases/one-billion-children-extremely-high-risk-impacts-climate-crisis-unicef), one billion children are at 'extremely high risk' of the impacts of the climate crisis, which shows that the impact of climate change is more negative when compared to the impact of missing school to strike.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Youths are more likely to be affected by the actions, rhetoric and concern of someone their own age.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Thunberg has acted as a [voice for an entire generation](https://en.unesco.org/courier/2021-2/generation-greta)(For the new generation, changing the world means saving the planet, above all. They are proclaiming this loud and clear – on social networks, in the streets or through civic disobedience movements, such as school strikes. The scale of the worldwide mobilization of under-25s is commensurate with the urgency of the environmental challenges we face.) of young people who will inherit a world damaged by climate change.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Young people are more likely to support public protests in order to raise awareness of important issues, independently of the age of the lead activist.
1.2.1.4. Pro: [According to a survey](https://theconversation.com/greta-thunberg-effect-people-familiar-with-young-climate-activist-may-be-more-likely-to-act-154146), people that have become more familiar with Thunberg have also felt more confident about mitigating climate change as part of a collective effort.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: It makes sense that people who have knowledge of environmental activists also care about the environment. This study does not prove that Thunberg has caused this concern.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: People who were familiar with Thunberg's [personal story](https://theconversation.com/greta-thunberg-effect-people-familiar-with-young-climate-activist-may-be-more-likely-to-act-154146)(Our model seemed to show this might be the case because people who knew Thunberg’s story – how her lonely stand inspired millions around the world to join her – were more likely to recognise the potential for ordinary people to make a difference.) were more likely to believe that their own individual actions could make a difference.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Thunberg has also shown an ability to transcend political and age-based barriers, having the [same positive effects across the age and political spectra](https://theconversation.com/greta-thunberg-effect-people-familiar-with-young-climate-activist-may-be-more-likely-to-act-154146)(Surprisingly, the Greta Thunberg effect seems to be similar across age groups and the political spectrum for US adults, though it was stronger among liberals than conservatives. We didn’t survey children and teenagers, but we expect them to be most strongly influenced by Thunberg’s school strikes.).
1.2.1.5. Pro: In 2019, her influence resulted in the largest coordinated climate strike in over [150](https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future) countries.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: [On the 20th of September 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/21/across-the-globe-millions-join-biggest-climate-protest-ever), students and millions of people around the world staged the largest climate change protest in history, uniting across time zones.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: The school strikes that helped Greta Thunberg rise to fame have been ineffective, and she stated that [school strikes for the climate achieved nothing](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/06/greta-thunberg-says-school-strikes-have-achieved-nothing)(Extinction Rebellion, an international movement that began last year with a Declaration of Rebellion in London, advocates civil disobedience.\n\nExtinction Rebellion calls for activists to block roads and shut down transport systems in major cities around the world, not just for one day, but for long enough to impose real economic costs on governments and business elites, all the while maintaining strictly nonviolent discipline even in the face of government repression.).
1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Student climate strikes have achieved nothing because students [don't have any leverage to disrupt the actors that need to change their climate policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2019/09/14/climate-strikes-what-they-accomplish-and-how-they-could-have-more-impact/?sh=4910a4275eed) such as governments and fossil fuel firms.
1.2.1.5.2.2. Con: Student climate strikes made a powerful impression worldwide because they [put the climate issue on the public agenda](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47242477)(In Europe the school strikers are also making a powerful impression.\n\n"They have put the climate issue on the public agenda," said Conner Rousseau, a spokesperson for the Flemish Socialist party in Belgium.\n\n"They've forced all of the Belgian political parties to take a stand on the climate issue. We have elections in May, it will be one of the main themes."\n\nObservers believe the same thing can happen in the UK.\n\n"If the government is serious about winning over the next generation of voters, then they need to heed their most pressing concerns," said Richard Baker, from Christian Aid.).
1.2.1.5.2.3. Con: The fact that the strikes allowed for Thunberg to become an influential international figure means that they did not achieve nothing.
1.2.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Global climate school strikes also showed that active [citizenship can build and sustain large-scale public engagement](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/what-ingos-can-learn-greta-thunberg-and-global-climate-strikes/).
1.2.1.5.2.3.2. Con: Becoming an influential international figure doesn't have a direct positive impact on society.
1.2.2. Pro: Greta Thunberg has received multiple awards and honors in recognition of the positive work she has been doing which has inspired others to follow her example.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Thunberg is the youngest [TIME](https://time.com/5746458/youngest-time-person-of-the-year/) Person of the Year ever.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Thunberg [was awarded](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/greta-thunberg-wins-international-childrens-peace-prize-1574652866-1) the International Children's Peace Prize in 2019.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Thunberg was awarded the [Rachel Carson Prize](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/3/22/1844267/-Greta-to-receive-Rachel-Carson-prize), which is an international environmental award awarded to women who have distinguished themselves by doing outstanding work for the environment.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Thunberg was awarded the [Ambassador of Conscience Award](https://www.vhlf.org/news/greta-thunberg-receives-top-human-rights-honour-amnesty-internationals-ambassador-of-conscience-award/), which is the the most prestigious human rights award.
1.2.2.5. Con: Thunberg has received awards as a result of the media attention she has been receiving and not the result of her work in particular.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Thunberg won the i[naugural Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53477604) for being "one of the most remarkable figures of our days." She also donated the one-million-euro humanitarian prize to climate groups.
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: Many other [young environmental activists have also done great work](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/17/gen-z-on-how-to-save-the-world-young-climate-activists-speak-out), but they haven't received the same prestigious awards.
1.2.2.6. Con: Awards don't have a direct impact on society, and Thunberg herself stated that "[the climate movement does not need any more awards.](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/30/774693218/start-listening-greta-thunberg-rejects-major-environmental-award)(Teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg has turned down a major environmental prize.\n\n"It is a huge honor," Thunberg said of the Nordic Council Environment Prize. "But the climate movement does not need any more awards."\n\n"What we need is for our politicians and the people in power to start listening to the current, best available science," she added.)"
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: Awarding activists with accolades and praise, while ignoring their messages gives people the illusion of acting upon the problem without fixing it.
1.2.2.6.1.1. Con: It is important that activists receive rewards for their work as an incentive for others in the field.
1.2.2.6.1.2. Con: Awards and accolades give credibility to activists, and the ensuing media coverage could help to secure further funding to fight climate change.
1.2.2.6.1.3. Pro: Thunberg has rejected awards in the past, stating that instead of awards, what climate change activists need is is ["for our politicians and the people in power to start listening to the current, best available science"](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/30/774693218/start-listening-greta-thunberg-rejects-major-environmental-award).
1.2.2.6.2. Con: Thunberg has used the money awarded to her in order to better society.
1.2.2.6.2.1. Con: If leaders would be truly engaged in the fight against climate change, they would directly fund [climate change projects](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02712-3) instead of offering awards.
1.2.2.6.2.2. Con: [From January 2020 to March 2021](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094762), globally, more money was spent on fossil fuels than on renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure. Money from awards won't change that trend.
1.2.2.6.2.3. Pro: Thunberg used [1 million Swedish Krona in award money to set up the Greta Thunberg Foundation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/greta-thunberg-sets-up-non-profit-with-alternative-nobel-prize-money.html)(Climate activist Greta Thunberg has used the 1 million Swedish Krona \($102,062\) prize money she won in a recent award to launch a non-profit foundation.\n\nThunberg received the Right Livelihood Award, also known as the “alternative Nobel prize,” in December and the organization behind the prize announced Thursday that she used her winnings to establish The Greta Thunberg Foundation.\n\nThe young activist will focus her non-profit on promoting ecological and social sustainability, as well as mental health issues.), which promotes sustainability.
1.2.2.6.2.4. Pro: Thunberg [donated a 1 million euro award entirely](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/greta-thunberg-donates-gulbenkian-prize)(The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation has just awarded Greta Thunberg its Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity, which comes with an award of 1 million euros \(about $1.15 million USD\).

1.2.3. Pro: Greta Thunberg has inspired neurodivergent youth by [speaking openly](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/02/greta-thunberg-responds-to-aspergers-critics-its-a-superpower) about her Asperger's syndrome.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Thunberg described her Asperger's as being a "[superpower](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/02/greta-thunberg-responds-to-aspergers-critics-its-a-superpower)(Greta Thunberg has spoken about her Asperger’s syndrome diagnosis after she was criticised over the condition, saying it makes her a “different”, but that she considers it a “superpower”.)", and expressed pride about being different.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: While bringing awareness about Asperger's syndrome is beneficial to society, Thunberg might be reinforcing the idea that all neurodivergent people are [savants](https://www.ssmhealth.com/treffert-center/conditions-treatments/savant-syndrome).
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Changing the narrative on Asperger's, and portraying it as a potentially good thing, might help and encourage other young people who have the syndrome.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Asperger's is still considered a [disability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drnancydoyle/2019/11/10/is-greta-thunberg-disabled-or-a-superhero-two-sides-to-neurodiversity/?sh=6510196523bf) in many places, which can lead to [social stigmatization](https://www.bond.org.uk/sites/default/files/resource-documents/stigma_disability_and_development.pdf). Thunberg's openness about having Asperger's may change the perception of the syndrome.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Thunberg expressing pride in her differences will encourage other people to do the same, thus helping many neurodivergent people to embrace their identities.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Thunberg's success could lead to a [greater acceptance of and appreciation for](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/468091-opinion-activist-greta-thunbergs-autism-doesnt-hold-her-back)(Greta’s successes, when considered within the context of her Asperger’s profile, shed light on the importance of accepting neurodiversity as a significant and meaningful aspect of our social fabric. We acknowledge diversity with respect to race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, skin color and political affiliation, among others.) neurodivergent individuals in society.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Thunberg's prominence has also led to her being [attacked](https://www.institutelm.com/resourceLibrary/could-a-greta-thunberg-effect-boost-neurodiversity.html)(Exploring a storm of controversy that erupted around negative Fox News coverage of Thunberg’s UN appearance – wherein a guest on the channel described the activist as a “mentally ill, Swedish child”) for her neurodivergence. This may cause neurodivergent individuals to fear similar attacks, and embolden their attackers.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Thunberg's transparency about her Asperger's diagnosis and achievements helps promote [understanding and acceptance of those on the Autism spectrum](https://www.institutelm.com/resourceLibrary/could-a-greta-thunberg-effect-boost-neurodiversity.html)(Autism is not an illness and, in fact, we consider neurodiversity to be something worth celebrating. At AANE, we know that individuals on the autism spectrum can use their strengths to make outstanding contributions to society because we see it every day with our community members. There are many people like Greta in our world, and we hope that her transparency about her Asperger diagnosis will help promote understanding and acceptance of individuals on the autism spectrum.).
1.2.3.3. Con: It has been claimed that by portraying that autism is not a disorder, it can be potentially damaging to those whose "[needs for support go beyond the removal of discrimination](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bioe.12780)(The claim that autism is not a disorder is based on the proposition that autistic traits are not harmful to those that have them except insofar as they are subject to discriminatory treatment \(for example in the form of discriminatory attitudes or material conditions that unjustly favour the neurotypical majority\). \n\nHowever, it is increasingly recognized in the scientific literature and reflected in current diagnostic criteria that autism comprises a complex array of traits that can manifest in very different ways. \n\nSome ways of being autistic are benign \(or would be in a society that was more accommodating of neurological difference\) but others are disadvantageous to those that have them in ways that are not only a matter of discrimination or injustice.\n\nThis makes the unrestricted claim that autism is not a disorder both theoretically unwarranted and potentially damaging to those whose needs for support go beyond the removal of discrimination.)."
1.2.3.3.1. Con: The removal of discrimination will not stop those with severe autism from getting the support that they require, and will benefit everyone with autism.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Some people with autism are [nonverbal, or require long-term care](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-severe-autism-260044)(People with severe autism are most likely to be non-verbal—entirely unable to use spoken language. They may also appear not to notice the people around them. \n\n...\n\nIn many cases, it's not safe for family members to live with a severely autistic teen or adult.). By portraying autism as not being a disorder, Thunberg is alienating those with severe autism and their families.
1.2.4. Con: Greta Thunberg has demoralized young people.
1.2.4.1. Con: Thunberg has empowered young people by showing that they can criticize those in power and be heard.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Thunberg performs '[rhetorical disruption](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354495047_Greta_Thunberg%27s_Disruptions_How_Rhetoric_Breaks_Trained_Incapacities_to_Climate_Change)' targeted towards world leaders, which can convince them of the importance of fighting for a sustainable environmental future.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Thunberg has [identified wealth](https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4494&context=etd)(By identifying wealth as the source for their lack of perception of and apathy toward the\nseverity of climate change, Thunberg’s rhetoric is attempting to open world leaders’ eyes to the\nmaterial reality they are unable or choose not to see.) as the source for the world leaders' lack of perception and apathy toward the severity of climate change. \(p.59\)
1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Thunberg's rhetorical disruption successfully breaks world leaders’ "[trained incapacities to neoliberalism](https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/3400/)(Her rhetorical disruption matters because it breaks world leaders’ trained incapacities to neoliberalism and thus persuades, through wonder and imagination, the importance of a sustainable environmental future.)" and persuades of the importance of a sustainable environmental future.
1.2.4.1.1.3. Con: Thunberg's rhetorical disruption has gone too far sometimes, such as when she said that [world leaders "should be put against the wall" in a speech.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50799233)
1.2.4.1.1.4. Con: Thunberg frequently relies on [populist rhetoric](https://www.europenowjournal.org/2020/11/09/post-political-populism-as-the-elephant-in-the-room-a-critical-discourse-analysis-of-greta-thunbergs-public-speeches-on-climate-change/), which can [jeopardize democracy.](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/03/11/populism-jeopardizes-democracies-around-world/)
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Thunberg [scolded leaders](https://time.com/5684216/greta-thunberg-un-climate-action-summit-climate-speech/) at a UN climate conference for their lack of action.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: By complaining about the actions of world leaders without suggesting viable alternatives, Thunberg has only empowered those who wish to complain about an issue and not those who wish to seek solutions.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Thunberg has demoralized young people by undermining world leaders.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Thunberg [encouraged division and disregarded global efforts](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/uk-news/greta-thunberg-slammed-over-her-cop26-criticism-politicians-affirm-progress-being-made.html)(“She risks leading them into something authoritarian, anti-democratic and outright dangerous. Her rhetoric is just a single step short of demanding anything beyond civil disobedience. And what she says is not true. Progress is being made, even if it may not be enough.”) by dismissing COP26, calling it a ["Global North greenwashing festival"](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/uk-news/greta-thunberg-slammed-over-her-cop26-criticism-politicians-affirm-progress-being-made.html)(His remarks came after the teen climate activist said that COP26 is “no longer a climate conference” and called it “a Global North greenwash festival.” Additionally, in her speech that came just before the climate conference kickstarted in Scotland, she used the soundbites from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s addresses such as “expensive bunny hugging” and “green economy” to highlight what she termed as “empty words and promises” of politicians across the world.).
1.2.4.2.2. Con: World leaders have so far failed to [honor the climate change pledge](https://www.dw.com/en/cop26-world-leaders-fail-to-honor-climate-pledge/a-59812348).
1.2.4.3. Pro: Thunberg has demoralized young people by being too pessimistic.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Young people are, in the 21st century, [more depressed than before](https://discoverymood.com/blog/todays-teens-depressed-ever/), which shows that Thunberg is not responsible for the demoralization of young people.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Young people are genuinely [concerned and depressed regarding the state of the climate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/climate-depression-youth-crisis-world-leaders)(We are in a growing epidemic of serious climate depression among young people. This is a crisis that cannot be solved by “positive messaging” any more than climate breakdown itself. Ultimately, the only thing that will help the mental and physical safety of every age group, including the young, is meaningful action from world leaders.). This is not due to activism or messaging, but the [lack of action from world leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/climate-depression-youth-crisis-world-leaders)(This is a crisis that cannot be solved by ‘positive messaging’. The only thing that will help is action from world leaders).
1.2.4.3.1.2. Con: Even if young people are more depressed nowadays, [pessimism will only worsen their condition](https://www.impossiblepsychservices.com.sg/our-resources/articles/2020/08/12/the-relationship-between-pessimism-and-depression).
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, billionaire [Bernard Arnault](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2019/09/26/billionaire-lvmh-chief-bernard-arnault-slams-greta-thunberg-for-demoralizing-young-people/)(Arnault, whose giant group LVMH boasts Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy amongst its luxury brands, said of the teenage campaigner in comments reported by AFP, “I find that her views are demoralizing for young people. ... She’s a dynamic young girl, but she’s surrendering completely to catastrophism.”\n\nChampioning his own “green” goals Arnault said, “We believe that environmental performance is a source of innovation, creativity, excellence and must be considered in all design and manufacture activities. We are committed to accelerating our work in that field and going even further.”), criticized Thunberg for demoralizing young people and "surrendering to catastrophism.”
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: Bernard Arnault is not qualified to comment on the environment or on the feelings of young people.
1.2.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Bernard Arnault has a net worth of [$172 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/bernard-arnault/), owns a [333 foot yacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_\(yacht\)) and a [private jet](https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/symphony/owner/). It is likely that he has a massive personal carbon footprint.
1.2.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: Bernard Arnault's company, LVMH, has a [poor record of increasing emissions](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1125494/co2-emissions-lvmh-by-sector/)(Between 2016 and 2020, CO2 emissions of the fashion and leather goods branch of LVMH went from 143,336 to 146,180 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.).
1.2.4.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Bernard Arnault has stated LVMH's [commitment to responsible growth](https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/news/lvmh-releases-first-comprehensive-social-and-environmental-reporting-spotlighting-initiatives-to-support-sustainable-growth/)(Opening with an editorial by Bernard Arnault, the report details the many initiatives that embody LVMH’s strong commitment to responsible growth...), and the company has stated that "[Relations between humans and non-humans must radically change.](https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/news/lvmh-releases-first-comprehensive-social-and-environmental-reporting-spotlighting-initiatives-to-support-sustainable-growth/)"
1.2.4.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Fashion is considered to be [second most polluting industry](https://ecocult.com/now-know-fashion-5th-polluting-industry-equal-livestock/) after oil.
1.2.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: Bernard Arnault is [72 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Arnault). It is unlikely that he is in touch with the sentiment of the global youth.
1.2.4.3.2.1.4. Con: Who Bernard Arnault is does not affect how correct or incorrect his opinions are.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Pro: Bernard Arnault backed [the efforts of the fashion industry towards a more sustainable future](https://www.euronews.com/green/2019/09/26/lvmh-billionaire-dismisses-greta-thunberg-s-pessimism-as-demoralising), while he described Thunberg's lack of optimism on climate issues as demoralizing.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Thunberg, unlike many politicians, has been pragmatic and realistic about the climate crisis. The fact that this [is seen as pessimistic](https://www.ft.com/content/6ee4bb03-3039-446a-997f-91a7aef5f137)(But the pandemic does contain a lesson, she says: “It proves that the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis. It just puts it in a different light.”) is proof of how dire the situation is.
1.2.4.3.4. Pro: [A survey of 10,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02582-8) youth underscores the demoralization: 68% feel sad or afraid, 63% anxious, 57% feel powerless and 53% even feel guilty about climate change.
1.2.4.4. Con: Thunberg's discourse uses ['parrhesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrhesia)(Michel Foucault developed the concept of parrhesia as a mode of discourse in which one speaks openly and truthfully about one's opinions and ideas without the use of rhetoric, manipulation, or generalization.)', and 'rhetorical citizenship' which has an empowering effect on young people because it encourages "[those hindered from speaking \[to\] boldly speak](https://www.presenttensejournal.org/volume-9/how-dare-you-greta-thunberg-parrhesia-and-rhetorical-citizenship/)(Her demand for rhetorical citizenship and forthright call to action are explained via the framework of rhetorical parrhesia, which situates her delivery and the global response to it as part of a long-standing democratic tradition where those hindered from speaking overcome constraints to boldly speak.)."
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: One of the definitions of parrhesia is to only say what needs to be said “because it is necessary.” Thunberg herself described the same in an interview to the New York Times: [“I only say what’s necessary.](https://ethique-des-affaires.essca.fr/en/in-what-way-does-greta-thunberg-speak-truth-to-power-2)”
1.2.4.4.2. Con: [The idea of using 'parrhesia' or 'speaking truth to power'](http://The ancient Greeks had a word for this: parrhesiastes. It means a person who speaks truth to power:)(The ancient Greeks had a word for this: parrhesiastes. It means a person who speaks truth to power: you should not be behaving in this way. Don’t. More specifically it suggests someone in whom directness of expression and access to truth coincide; and it means someone of very little power who’s risking everything – because they can’t not, there’s no option – to speak ethical truth to powers so entrenched that they’re close to tyrannical, because telling this truth is about moral law.) has a very dangerous element to it, because it can increase the arrogance of the youth as they might [believe they hold the truth](https://medium.com/\@kirktaylor87/the-arrogance-of-truth-186eb51d8eb6).
1.2.5. Con: Other young activists believe that [diverse voices matter and should also influence the climate movement](https://theelders.org/news/my-name-not-greta-thunberg-why-diverse-voices-matter-climate-movement), not just Greta Thunberg's.
1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.5.2. Con: Diverse voices, such as [Xiye Bastida](https://www.ted.com/speakers/xiye_bastida), have also participated in 'Fridays For Future movement', which was first started by Thunberg.
1.2.6. Pro: Greta Thunberg has supported many non-climate causes, many of which have profound effects on youth globally.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Thunberg worked with a Danish NGO to [support children's rights](https://www.unicef.org/vietnam/press-releases/greta-thunberg-and-ngo-human-act-launch-child-rights-driven-coronavirus-campaign)(Climate activist Greta Thunberg today launched a child rights driven campaign with Danish NGO Human Act to support UNICEF’s efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and protect children from its direct and knock-on consequences. These include food shortages, strained healthcare systems, violence and lost education.).
1.2.6.2. Pro: Thunberg has expressed her support for the LGBT community by [attending pride events](https://twitter.com/gretathunberg/status/1157669667923812354?lang=en)(Supporting #StockholmPride from Copenhagen! #loveislove #pride).
1.2.6.3. Con: Thunberg's support of other causes dilutes her work on climate change, and could potentially hinder it.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Thunberg's support of LGBT causes might make it difficult for her to work with the [69 states worldwide that still criminalize homosexuality](https://ilga.org/ilga-world-releases-state-sponsored-homophobia-December-2020-update)(As of December 2020, 69 States continue to criminalise same-sex consensual activity,” noted Lucas Ramón Mendos, Research Coordinator at ILGA World and lead author of the report.).
1.2.6.3.2. Con: Climate change is an existential and universal issue. Thunberg's support of other causes does not alter the importance of halting climate change and its effects.
1.2.7. Con: Greta Thunberg has negatively impacted society by normalising children growing up too quickly and becoming concerned with adult problems.
1.2.7.1. Con: Thunberg has normalized children being [environmentally concerned](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/greta-thunberg-generation-children-pushing-parents-go-greener/) which is important because [climate change puts children at risk](https://www.unicef.org/stories/impacts-climate-change-put-almost-every-child-risk).
1.2.7.2. Pro: Thunberg herself noted the irregularity of her position in her speech to the UN, [stating](https://www.gq.com/story/greta-thunberg-un-how-dare-you) "This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean."
1.2.7.3. Con: The fact that children feel the need to fight for their future is not a condemnation of Thunberg, but rather the current political leadership of the world.
1.2.7.4. Pro: Child activists can miss out on schooling or basic childhood experiences if they are too focused on their activism.
1.3. Con: Greta Thunberg's choices and actions might be harming the fight against climate change.
1.3.1. Pro: Greta Thunberg has been criticized for being "[an indoctrinated child coerced by adults](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/24/how-greta-thunbergs-rise-could-backfire-on-environmentalists.html)(There are also lots of observers expressing general alarm at what they see as an indoctrinated child being coerced by adults to make their political arguments with her youth as a shield from any criticism.)" to support political arguments that are likely to make the environmental cause more divisive and ineffective.
1.3.1.1. Con: [It is not the first time in history](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/greta-thunberg-indoctrinating-children-fox-news-michael-knowles-donald-trump-889557/)(In many ways, this argument was an expertly crafted hybrid two of the most common strains of right-wing thought: the paranoia-fueled idea that positive media coverage in any form, particularly of a prominent young woman, is the result of a vast left-wing conspiracy; as well as the cynical belief that anyone who appears to exhibit anything other than Ayn Randian self-interest must be either a propaganda tool, or motivated by less than altruistic principles. But it also happens to be wrong, for reasons that go far beyond Thunberg. There is a long, long history of children in activism, with many risking their own welfare to put themselves on the front lines for their beliefs.) that the right-wing has accused young activists of being indoctrinated to support a specific left-wing agenda.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: The attacks on young activists have [nothing to do with the political divide](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/greta-thunberg-child-activism-climate-change-autism-greenwashing-a9176106.html)(The polarisation is not down so much to political divide. Rather, the split in opinion is due to our deep-seated belief that childhood is an age of innocence and being dependent on adults, a time that aligns with the private, not the public and political sphere.) but rather with the idea that childhood is an age of innocence and being dependent on adults.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Far-right agitators](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/young-female-climate-activists-face-hateful-abuse-online-how-they-n1079376) have a history of attacking young female activists.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: [Public discourses on youth activism](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350904976_Is_It_Okay_to_Critique_Youth_Activists_Notes_on_the_Power_and_Danger_of_Complexity) tend to dismiss youth as either pawns of adults or naïve idealists.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: When young people participated a civil rights protest against segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963 they were [described as "puppets.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/weve-had-the-same-debate-over-teen-activism-since-the-civil-rights-era.html)(The images of children being blasted by fire hoses and menaced by police dogs shocked the nation and helped King negotiate for the removal of the city’s racist commissioner of public safety, Bull Connor. Yet the students didn’t get much credit at the time, and in fact, their involvement offered ammunition to opponents of King. Theoharis writes of the reaction: “The students whose actions gained that attention are not taken seriously as actors, but are often assumed to have been puppets of King.” Other young people in the movement faced similar accusations; as historian Kevin Kruse noted on Twitter recently, segregationists also insisted that the teenagers who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, were paid protesters imported from the North.)"
1.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Public discourses on youth activism tend to depoliticize the youth which can portray [young people as agents of social change](http://cosmos.sns.it/all-events/public-discourses-about-youth-and-their-impact-marco-giugni-university-of-geneva/)(It presents the results of two separate but related analyses. The first examines the impact of public discourses, looking at the ways in which collective actors frame youth in the public domain and how this may provide discursive opportunities understood in terms of the extent to which public discourse portrays young people as agents of social change. It shows that young people are depoliticized in the public domain. This process of depoliticization of youth in the public domain, in turn, has important implications on their potential for acting as political agents and for their political activism.).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Thunberg has been accused of being indoctrinated into sharing an [anti-capitalist agenda](https://www.faithandfreedom.com/the-shameless-exploitation-of-greta-thunberg/)(Some people – some companies and some decision-makers in particular – have known exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. I want to challenge them into real and bold climate action, to set their economic goals aside and to safeguard the future living conditions for humankind. I ask you to stand on the right side of history.\n\nClearly, there’s little original thought here. This sounds like a robotic recitation of typical anti-capitalist boilerplate.).
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Thunberg has said that we need to [change our political and economic systems](https://theconversation.com/climate-strikes-greta-thunberg-calls-for-system-change-not-climate-change-heres-what-that-could-look-like-112891) in order to fight climate change.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: There has been a lot of [anti-Greta propaganda to dismiss her](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/greta-thunberg-propaganda-fact-check), with claims that have been proven to be false.
1.3.2. Pro: Greta Thunberg has met with leaders who continue to harm the environment or exacerbate climate change.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Thunberg met with Justin Trudeau whose policies have harmed the environment.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The construction of Trudeau's oil pipeline has forced people of [native tribes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/11/canada-pipeline-indigenous-trudeau-treaty)(But the dramatic scenes highlighted a broader issue for Canada in 2019: swaths of territory – never signed away by treaty or seized in war – still belong to indigenous nations who are fighting back against resource projects they say they never consented to.\n\nUnlike the rest of the country – where relationships between indigenous groups and the state are governed by treaties – few indigenous nations in British Columbia ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands, said Gordon Christie, a scholar of indigenous law at the University of British Columbia.) off the land.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Forced relocation of Native Americans makes them [more vulnerable to climate change](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/11/11/indigenous-relocation-environment)(A study published in the journal Science last month shows how forced relocation of Native Americans in the U.S. has moved them to lands more susceptible to climate change.).
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: The release of products carried through pipelines can [negatively impact the environment](https://www.watershedcouncil.org/pipeline-risks.html).
1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: While forcing native tribes off their land is morally reprehensible, it does not directly harm the environment.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [announced in November 2021](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/11/01/prime-minister-trudeau-announces-enhanced-and-ambitious-climate) that Canada would be working toward ending exports of thermal coal by no later than 2030.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: Canada, under Trudeau, has promised to cap Canadian oil and gas emissions, reducing them by [40 to 45%](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/pm-trudeau-s-pledges-at-cop26-and-how-they-might-affect-canadians-1.5649657)(Trudeau promised on Monday a cap on Canadian oil and gas emissions, an item on the Liberal Party platform during the election campaign. He pledged to reduce emissions by 40 to 45 per cent, compared to 2005 levels, by 2030.).
1.3.2.2. Pro: Thunberg intended to meet Theresa May, who has [supported fracking](https://news.sky.com/story/could-fracking-cause-fractures-in-theresa-mays-government-10606868)(While the Conservatives have declared themselves "all out" for the controversial method of freeing the gas using a high pressure cocktail of water and chemicals, the Labour leadership is diametrically opposed.), however the Prime Minister [did not attend](https://theecologist.org/2019/apr/23/may-snubs-greta)(Before her speech, Miss Thunberg had held a roundtable with party leaders, where prime minister Theresa May was empty-chaired after she declined to attend.).
1.3.2.3. Pro: Meeting people, especially people in positions of power who have an interest in maintaining the status quo, will not cause immediate changes to ideology or behaviour.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: Thunberg has not only met with these leaders, but [actively criticized and challenged them](https://www.un.org/en/desa/greta-thunberg-tells-world-leaders-%E2%80%98you-are-failing-us%E2%80%99-nations-announce-fresh)(Speaking at the beginning of the UN’s Climate Action Summit on Monday, the 16-year-old acclaimed climate activist Greta Thunberg, was unsparing in her criticism of world leaders, telling them that they are still “not mature enough to tell it like it is”.). Even if this does not change the leader's mind, it is a strong symbol of resistance and change.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Meeting with such leaders undermines the revolutionary and counter-cultural elements of the climate movement, and makes rapid change more difficult.
1.3.2.4. Con: Ignoring leaders with different views will not help tackle climate change.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Meeting leaders who have failed to tackle climate change gives them a platform and legitimizes their actions.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: World leaders who meet with Thunberg gain [media attention and the appearance of being concerned about the environment](https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2021-10-01/Greta-Thunberg-meets-Italian-PM-as-activists-clash-with-police-13YYOn8KVUs/index.html)(Video footage released by the Italian Prime Minister's office showed Draghi talking to Thunberg and two other young activists. An environmentally friendly refillable water bottle was perched on the coffee table in front of Thunberg.).
1.3.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Simply meeting with Thunberg is an effective PR alternative to making decisive climate change decisions.
1.3.2.4.1.2. Con: Giving them a platform also means that these politicians can present their arguments and problems, which can lead to better understanding.
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Thunberg acknowledges that [compromises must be reached](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/12/27/greta-thunberg-state-climate-movement-roots-her-power-an-activist/)(Of course we need compromises. But we have to also understand that we cannot compromise with the laws of physics.). This would not be possible without meeting people with opposing viewpoints.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: If Thunberg is seen to be negotiating with those who are actively harming the environment, it may hurt the climate change movement.
1.3.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Thunberg has gained much of her renown and admiration for [standing up to people in power](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/thunberg-on-cop26-we-will-hear-many-pledges-that-are-more-or-less-meaningless-1.4705802)(Greta Thunberg has become a global figure, giving voice to her generation’s fury at the world’s failure to tackle climate change.). Negotiation may be considered a step back from holding leaders accountable.
1.3.2.4.2.1.2. Con: Thunberg has agreed that compromise with leaders and other people is needed, but has firmly stated [the laws of physics cannot be compromised with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/12/27/greta-thunberg-state-climate-movement-roots-her-power-an-activist/)(Of course we need compromises. But we have to also understand that we cannot compromise with the laws of physics. If we are here \[gestures\], and we need to be there \[gestures again\] to have, say, safe living conditions, and they are talking about moving \[just a tiny bit\], then I would rather say no. Yes, it’s better than nothing, but we have to zoom out and understand that we’re not going to get there if we pretend that this is enough.).
1.3.2.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Thunberg's awareness of the scientific reality of climate change ensures that she does not compromise to a degree that would harm the environment.
1.3.2.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Thunberg has also confessed that [global leaders are still in denial over the climate crisis](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/activist-thunberg-says-global-leaders-still-denial-over-climate-2021-05-04/), therefore, compromise with leaders can hurt the climate change movement.
1.3.2.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Thunberg has [met with Nicola Sturgeon](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-meets-greta-thunberg-25346745), who has a poor record with combating climate change.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: Sturgeon has failed to deliver on a number of climate targets, rendering them '[meaningless](https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/19697478.nicola-sturgeon-admits-undelivered-climate-change-targets-meaningless/)(Nicola Sturgeon has admitted some of her own government’s targets on tackling climate change are “meaningless” as they haven’t been met.)'.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Scotland's air pollution only came within legal limits [for the first time](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55661358) in 2021.
1.3.2.5.3. Con: Nicola Sturgeon has committed to fighting combat change in the future, promising young people that she would take action on climate change, ["no matter how difficult](https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/19696812.nicola-sturgeon-promises-young-people-action-climate-change-no-matter-difficult/)."
1.3.2.5.3.1. Con: A consistent theme of Thunberg's rhetoric is the [meaninglessness of promises](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions)(Greta Thunberg has excoriated global leaders over their promises to address the climate emergency, dismissing them as “blah, blah, blah”.) and the value of action. Despite making promises, Scotland has [failed to meet its climate targets](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-59206425)(The snag is the Scottish government has missed the annual targets it needs to hit to achieve the 2030 outcome in each of the last three years.\n\nScotland's emissions were down by 51.5% by 2019 - short of the 55% target for that year. A catch up plan has been put in place.).
1.3.2.5.3.2. Pro: Nicola Sturgeon directly addressing and promising young people this shows that she acknowledges the issues and how they will affect younger generations disproportionately.
1.3.2.5.4. Con: Nicola Sturgeon participated in a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/nicola_sturgeon_how_small_countries_can_make_a_big_impact_on_climate_change?language=en) about how small countries can make a big impact on climate change.
1.3.2.5.5. Con: Scotland, under Sturgeon, was one of the first international actors to allocate funds to [help developing countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-59206425)(The Scottish government has won international recognition for its contribution to tackling global warming from, among others, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres.\n\nIn a BBC interview, he expressed appreciation for the Holyrood administration being among the first "international actors" to allocate funds to developing countries for loss and damage caused by the effects of climate change.) affected by climate change.
1.3.3. Con: Greta Thunberg has been particularly effective in targeting both individual behavior and that of larger organizations in her climate activism.
1.3.3.1. Pro: We must change both large scale inaction \(or worsening of the crisis\) and individual behaviour to have a realistic chance of limiting \(or reversing\) the damage humans have caused to the planet.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Thunberg holds governments, companies and other organizations to high standards, refusing to tolerate their inaction and encouraging others to hold them to the same standards.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: This is a very helpful alternative to politicians who are much more likely to waver around what is 'economically feasible' or politically viable. Thunberg demands what is needed to fix the crisis, not merely what is most realistic.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Thunberg doesn't have any effective tools to actually hold governments, companies and other organizations to high standards.
1.3.3.3. Con: Thunberg was criticized for being a '[double-standard environmentalist](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1222988.shtml)' when she targeted China on annual emissions.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: [The Global Times is not a reliable source](https://qz.com/745577/inside-the-global-times-chinas-hawkish-belligerent-state-tabloid/) since it does not offer objective reporting.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Thunberg was mocked for being a '[puppet of Western politicians](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1222988.shtml)' because she pointed fingers at China's role in climate change but made no comment on [Japan's decision to dump nuclear-contaminated water](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/13/fukushima-japan-to-start-dumping-contaminated-water-pacific-ocean)(Japan has announced it will release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea, a decision that has angered neighbouring countries, including China, and local fishers.).
1.3.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.2.1.2.
1.3.4. Con: Given that the past generation has made no meaningful effort to combat climate change, it is hypocritical of them to pass judgement on Greta Thunberg's efforts.
1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The harms of climate change were affirmed over [30 years](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/07/embark-essay-climate-change-pollution-revkin/) ago.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Nearly everything we understand about global warming today was [already understood](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374191337/losingearth) in 1979.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: In 1994, 165 nations signed an international treaty, [the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change)(This was remarkable for its time. Remember, in 1994, when the UNFCCC took effect, there was less scientific evidence than there is now. The UNFCCC borrowed a very important line from one of the most successful multilateral environmental treaties in history \(the Montreal Protocol, in 1987\): it bound member states to act in the interests of human safety even in the face of scientific uncertainty.), as a commitment to reduce carbon emissions.
1.3.4.3. Con: Past generations have made meaningful efforts to combat climate change by imposing carbon taxes or limiting the output of other greenhouse gases.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: If the efforts made by previous generations were meaningful, then the situation would likely not be as dire as it is now.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Important accords including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement resulted from [negotiations to combat climate change that started in the early 1990s](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/paris-global-climate-change-agreements).
1.3.4.4. Con: According to research, the portrayed [generational conflict over the climate crisis is a myth](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/15/generational-conflict-over-climate-crisis-is-a-myth-uk-study-finds)(A fake generational war over the climate crisis has distorted public thinking and political strategy, when in fact older generations are just as worried about the issue as younger people, according to new research.\n\nThe idea that young people are ecowarriors, battling against selfish older generations is a common trope in representations of the environment movement. It has been stoked by instances including Time magazine naming Greta Thunberg their person of the year in 2019, for being a “standard bearer in a generational battle”.\n\n\[...\] But a new UK study, Who Cares About Climate Change: Attitudes Across The Generations, has found that the generational divide over climate action is a myth, with almost no difference in views between generations on the importance of climate action, and all saying they are willing to make big sacrifices to achieve this.), because older generations are as worried as younger people.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Although many older people will not live to see the more severe effects of climate change, their children and grandchildren will.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: While both generations may be equally as worried, the older generation holds [more wealth and power](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charting-the-growing-generational-wealth-gap/) than younger generations. Therefore they have a duty to act against climate change.
1.3.4.4.2.1. Pro: Most world leaders are in their [50s or 60s](http://chartsbin.com/view/38561).
1.3.4.4.2.2. Con: The older generation won't see the future impact of climate change, [therefore they might not feel that duty to act](https://theoutline.com/post/6384/boomers-shut-up-climate-change).
1.3.5. Pro: Greta Thunberg has [heavily criticised](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/eu-in-row-over-inclusion-of-gas-and-nuclear-in-sustainability-guidance)(The European Commission is facing a backlash from Greta Thunberg and fellow climate activists over plans to include gas and nuclear energy in a “green” investment guidebook.\n\nBoth energy sources are expected to feature in the next part of the EU’s “taxonomy for sustainable activities”, which is expected at the end of the year, following a period of intense political bargaining between the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; and Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz.) the EU commission's inclusion of nuclear energy in a green investment handbook, despite also advocating for [divestment from fossil fuels](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/22/greta-thunberg-house-committee-testimony-fossil-fuel-subsidies)(“The uncomfortable fact is if we are to live up to our Paris agreement promises we have to end fossil fuel subsidies, end new exploration, completely divest from fossil fuels and keep the carbon in the ground,” said Thunberg.).
1.3.5.1. Con: Thunberg hasn't been the only one to criticize this decision, a European [Commission’s group](https://www.wwf.eu/?5796416/EU-Taxonomy-Commissions-expert-group-says-no-to-EUs-greenwashing-of-fossil-gas-and-nuclear-energy) of green finance experts opposed the decision because it would greenwash the [EU taxonomy](https://www.unpri.org/policy/eu-policy/eu-sustainable-finance-taxonomy)(The EU Taxonomy is a tool to help investors understand whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable, and to navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Setting a common language between investors, issuers, project promoters and policy makers, it helps investors to assess whether investments are meeting robust environmental standards and are consistent with high-level policy commitments such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.).
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Being one of many people to criticize a decision does not diminish the significance or validity of Thunberg's criticism.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: The European sustainable taxonomy has been greenwashed as a direct result of [lobbying supported by a pro-gas and nuclear alliance of countries](https://reclaimfinance.org/site/en/2022/02/02/the-eu-taxonomy-becomes-the-new-standard-for-greenwashing/)(As a result of effective industry lobbying supported by a pro-gas and nuclear alliance of countries, the European Commission has included fossil gas and nuclear power in the European sustainable taxonomy. The EU’s sustainable finance flagship thus becomes the new standard for greenwashing. In reaction, Reclaim Finance calls on French and European financial actors to adopt their own gas and nuclear exclusions.).
1.3.5.2. Con: Thunberg, together with other climate activists, [criticised the rebrand of fossil gas and nuclear power as falsely “sustainable”](https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/opinion/code-red-for-humanity-or-green-light-for-more-climate-destruction/).
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: [Germany's Vice-Chancellor, Robert Habeck](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-proposes-labeling-gas-and-nuclear-energy-as-climate-friendly/a-60308833), also accused the EU of "greenwashing" over their new energy proposal.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: [Spain](https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2022-01-03/spain-rejects-brussels-plan-to-classify-nuclear-power-and-natural-gas-as-green-energy.html) also publicly rejected the EU comission's plan to classify nuclear power and natural gas as green energy.
1.3.5.2.3. Con: Nuclear energy is considered one of the largest [sources of zero-emissions energy in developed nations](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable)(Nuclear is often left out of the “clean energy” conversation despite it being the second largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world behind hydropower.).
1.3.5.2.4. Con: OECD's experts claim that nuclear energy has an important role in the [transition to net-zero emissions by 2050](https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/the-role-of-nuclear-energy-in-mitigating-climate-change).
1.3.5.3. Pro: The inclusion of nuclear energy in a green investment book would not only help to transition to cleaner power, but it would also have to follow [strict standards to be considered green](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59850093).
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: The EU comission's proposal would only consider green nuclear energy [with strict waste disposal plans](https://cfissbd.com/News/Details/276), and gas plants would have a limit on how much carbon dioxide is released.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: Even if nuclear energy would meet the highest standards, it still causes [thermal pollution](https://www.citizen.org/article/nuclear-power-is-not-clean-or-green/) which adversely affects marine ecosystems.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Thunberg has stated that the details of solving climate change are "[nothing to do with me](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719)(... Thunberg has avoided getting into the detail of what action should be taken, saying "it is nothing to do with me".)", yet has opposed nuclear energy solutions without a scientific education or backing.
1.3.6. Con: Greta Thunberg leads by example and has sacrificed for her convictions.
1.3.6.1. Con: Thunberg's examples are hard to replicate by ordinary citizens with limited resources.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: It is very unlikely that the [average person](https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-has-greta-thunberg-gone-overboard/a-50028269) could \(or will\) spend 15 days crossing the Atlantic in a boat with no toilet.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Thunberg's trip across the Atlantic was [facilitated](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/greta-thunberg-s-voyage-is-admirable-but-not-practical-1.3992104) by a Monacan prince, and is a highly specialised vessel to be carbon-neutral. This is not replicable for ordinary citizens generally, and is beyond the price range of most people.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Con: The difficulty that Thunberg had in arranging carbon-neutral travel highlights the [lack of availability of sustainable methods of travel](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50659318)("But this is a more symbolic trip. Greta wanted to sail because it's a good way to send a message to the world that there is no real sustainable option to travel.\n\n"She's not telling anyone how to travel, she's not telling anyone how to live their life.").
1.3.6.1.2.2. Pro: Thunberg also sailed the Atlantic across a [48ft Outremer performance cruising catamaran called "La Vagabonde"](https://www.yachtingworld.com/sailing-across-atlantic/greta-thunberg-atlantic-crossing-la-vagabonde-125068), a yacht owned by the creators of a YouTube channel. Such an experience is not replicable for ordinary citizens either.
1.3.6.1.2.3. Con: Thunberg [openly admitted](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/greta-thunberg-s-voyage-is-admirable-but-not-practical-1.3992104) that her journey across the Atlantic was [symbolic](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50659318)(She was criticised for that decision as the whole mission was supposed to be carbon-neutral.\n\n"In an ideal world, yes, I would have sailed there and sailed back," she says. But this is a more symbolic trip. Greta wanted to sail because it's a good way to send a message to the world that there is no real sustainable option to travel.), and it was not one that others would be able to replicate. She did not take this trip in a misguided hope of inspiring others to do the same. She had vowed that she would not travel unless she could do so without creating a carbon footprint.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: Her examples have increased awareness over the environmental cost of transport methods and have increased demand and interest in more [sustainable travel](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/travel-sustainably-like-greta-thunberg) choices.
1.3.6.2. Con: Thunberg's sacrifices can't be considered as an example to follow, as she comes from a privileged background that makes her "[one of the lucky one](https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2019/12/11/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-becomes-youngest-ever-time-person-of-the-year/)s", as she has stated herself.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The sacrifices made by Thunberg pale in comparison to the benefits that she has enjoyed from her climate activism.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: By the age of 18, Thunberg had accrued a net worth of an [estimated $1 million](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2021/11/03/greta-thunberg-net-worth/)(Greta Thunberg’s net worth is unconfirmed but is estimated to be around $1 million.\n\nUnlike Hollywood actors whose regular work in blockbuster movies allows for accurate estimates into their net worth, the 18-year-old poses a different story.).
1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Many of these estimations include the $1 million prize money that she was awarded, but which [she subsequently donated through her foundation](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2021/11/03/greta-thunberg-net-worth/)(After being awarded €1 million for her humanitarian work by winning the inaugural Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity in July 2020, she said:\n\n“We’re in a climate emergency, and my foundation will as quickly as possible donate all the prize money of one million euros to support organisations and projects that are fighting for a sustainable world.).
1.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: Due to her fame, Thunberg [was featured on the cover](https://www.luxurydaily.com/vogue-scandinavia-spotlights-greta-thunberg/) of the first edition of Vogue Scandinavia.
1.3.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Thunberg used this opportunity to [condemn fashion brands](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58145465)(Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has condemned the fashion industry over its "huge" contribution to climate change, in a magazine interview.) for their climate actions.
1.3.6.2.1.2.2. Pro: Being on the cover of Vogue is prestigious, and in featuring on the cover, Thunberg joined a list that includes [countless big-name celebrities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Vogue_\(US\)_cover_models).
1.3.6.2.1.3. Con: Thunberg has claimed to have lost her [childhood and personal dreams](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2217418-greta-thunberg-you-have-stolen-my-childhood-with-your-empty-words/)(In a passionate and often angry address to the UN climate action summit in New York, the 16-year old said: “This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”), which is a sacrifice greater than any benefits which she may have gained.
1.3.6.2.1.4. Pro: Thunberg got the opportunity to sail across the Atlantic in order to attend a climate change summit. This is an experience that people spend [thousands of dollars](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/how-to-sail-across-the-atlantic-and-back-76276)(Michael Wood, general manager of Peters & May, quotes typical prices of US$10,200 for a 32-footer and US$21,600 for a 41-footer.) to get.
1.3.6.2.1.5. Con: [Thunberg sacrified her education](https://dailyfreepress.com/2021/09/20/welcome-to-the-greenhouse-greta-thunberg-and-the-ethics-of-sacrifice-in-activism/)(The key to Thunberg’s climate change activism is not that she sacrificed her education to send a message, but rather that she felt like she had no other choice, and she was incredibly angry about it. In her 2019 address to the United Nations, she accused the audience:\n\n“How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”) to send a message about the need to unite in the fight against climate change.
1.3.6.2.1.5.1. Con: The international renown and celebrity that Thunberg has gained from her activism makes it likely that a college would offer her a scholarship or position.
1.3.6.2.1.5.2. Pro: Thunberg herself has been [missing school](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/49405357) to protest the climate crisis.
1.3.6.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Thunberg was behind her peers in school, being in her junior year of high school when [she should have been in her senior year](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/greta-thunberg-college)(The climate activist has openly stated much she loves school, and she even tweeted that it felt "so great to finally be back in school again!" when she returned in August 2020, following her sabbatical. That month, she would have began her senior year, but due to her gap year, she is presumably currently in her junior year of high school.).
1.3.6.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: Before she became a public figure, this was a big sacrifice to her future \(education, career etc.\) given how many people have [warned](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/19/teachers-warned-not-let-children-walk-climate-strike/) students [against](https://nypost.com/2019/09/17/the-climate-strike-is-a-crock-that-exploits-kids/) striking from their education.
1.3.6.2.1.5.2.3. Con: Much of this time has been spent travelling and experiencing things the average person would not have the opportunity to do, such as [sailing the Atlantic](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50659318) or [addressing the U.N](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit?t=1641829567774).
1.3.6.2.2. Con: The fact that Thunberg has acknowledged her privilege, and uses it to advocate for a good cause, is admirable in itself.
1.3.6.2.3. Pro: Thunberg has enjoyed fame and worldwide renown due to her sacrifices. This would not be possible for others who follow her example.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Thunberg has become a target for [abuse and vilification](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/08/greta-thunberg-far-right-climate/619748/)(“The stuff on the internet about her—the violence and vilification, the pure hatred—is really quite scary,” Catherine Fieschi, a political analyst who tracks dissent against climate policy in Europe, told me. Her latest study reproduced some of most popular memes, including one portraying Thunberg as akin to a member of the Hitler Youth.) from climate change deniers due to her beliefs.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Thunberg does not [enjoy campaigning](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-53255535)(That is what Greta Thunberg has spent last year doing, but the teenage climate campaigner doesn't seem to have enjoyed it much.\n\nI don't think she is being a brat. I believe Greta knows how unique and special her life has been and how privileged she is.\n\nThe world's most famous climate campaigner just doesn't actually like campaigning very much.\n\n"I am in this because I want to be," she tells me. "And that's not because I think it's fun. That's not because I enjoy the attention. It's because I want to make a difference."), however she does it because she wants to make a difference.
1.3.6.5. Pro: Thunberg has taken as many measures as she can on an individual level to do as she preaches.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: Thunberg has defined her own image from a [branding perspective as a "knowledgeable prophet" who dedicates her life to the cause](https://www.17goalsmagazin.de/en/from-climate-change-to-covid-19-and-forward-how-pictures-influence-how-we-react-to-global-crises/), this doesn't mean she has individually sacrificed for her convictions, instead she has created a [successful personal brand](https://www.workingvoices.com/insights/projecting-your-personal-brand-learning-from-greta-thunberg/).
1.3.6.5.2. Con: Even if she has done as much as she can as an individual, [individual actions won't solve the climate crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/10/individuals-climate-crisis-government-planet-priority).
1.3.6.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.5.2.
1.3.6.5.4. Con: Thunberg's general narrative [seeks to shift](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/24/how-greta-thunbergs-rise-could-backfire-on-environmentalists.html) almost all the focus from personal responsibility to governments and big corporations to enact environmental reform. This is a dangerous road to go down.
1.3.6.5.4.1. Pro: The shift might discourage individuals from being environmentally conscious.
1.3.6.5.4.1.1. Pro: If public sentiment regarding the environment does not change alongside government and big corporations, then it is unlikely the public will make sacrifices in order to combat climate change.
1.3.6.5.4.1.2. Con: Unless governments and corporations enable platforms and resources for individuals to be environmentally conscious, the [global fight against climate change](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200618-climate-change-who-is-to-blame-and-why-does-it-matter) won't happen.
1.3.6.5.4.2. Con: Focusing on personal responsibility instead of [governments and big corporations' responsibilities is convenient for corporations](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-focusing-on-how-individuals-can-help-is-very-convenient-for-corporations-108546), because they are not pressured to take actions.
1.3.6.5.4.2.1. Pro: [According to a 2017 study](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change), 100 corporations account for 71% of global industrial emissions since 1988.
1.3.6.5.4.2.2. Con: If individual responsibility causes consumer demand to change, then corporations will be forced to adopt more eco-friendly practices.
1.3.6.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: If consumers are more likely to buy eco-friendly, ethical products due to their own personal sense of consumer responsibility, then businesses will change to accommodate this.
1.3.6.5.4.2.2.2. Con: Many consumers will also continue to buy what is cheapest, either out of convenience or necessity. These products are often not environmentally friendly.
1.3.6.5.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: It is the role of the government to incentivize the creation of eco-friendly products and penalize those who continue to use non Eco-friendly practices and materials. Enforcing individual responsibility disrupts this.
1.3.6.5.4.2.2.2.2. Con: [Consumer behavior is changing](https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/shifting-sands-sustainable-consumer.html)(Consumer trends in 2020 suggest that concerned consumers are adopting a raft of different measures to shop and live more sustainably.), and according to an international study, [one in three people choose to buy from brands they believe are doing environmental good](https://theconversation.com/climate-explained-are-consumers-willing-to-pay-more-for-climate-friendly-products-146757).
1.3.6.5.5. Pro: Thunberg arrived in New York City via [sailing](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/28/754818342/teen-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-arrives-in-new-york-after-sailing-the-atlan) instead of flying to call attention to the need for quick action to save the planet.
1.3.6.5.5.1. Con: It is worth noting that [the captains of the ship needed flights](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/dec/1/greta-thunberg-carbon-reduced-plan-blown-flight-ca/)(Unfortunately for Ms. Thunberg’s carbon footprint though, the boat’s captain had to fly to the U.S. to reach the boat.\n\nNikki Henderson, the 26-year-old yacht captain of the 48-foot catamaran La Vagabonde, flew to the U.S. from Britain to sail Ms. Thunberg’s ship 3,500 miles from the U.S. to Portugal.\n\nAs a result, multiple British news outlets noted Sunday, the 16-year-old girl’s trip back to Europe — for a Madrid climate summit, no less — had about the same carbon emissions as it would have had if she had just flown herself.) to go back and forth anyways so while it's a nice idea, it didn't actually help anybody.
1.3.6.5.5.1.1. Pro: The unreasonableness of the Thunberg sailing trip has led to [criticism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/15/swedish-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-is-sailing-america-amid-storm-criticism/).
1.3.6.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: In order to facilitate Thunberg's zero-carbon travel, the sail crew took additional flights. The net effect of this created [more emissions](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/08/18/doh-climate-messiah-greta-thunbergs-plastic-boat-trip-will-result-in-two-airline-flights/) than Thunberg's individual flying would have.
1.3.6.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The company Thunberg sailed with operate [very sustainably](https://news.sky.com/story/greta-thunberg-is-her-transatlantic-trip-really-that-green-11784480) and offset the [carbon emissions](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9739595/greta-thunbergs-carbon-free-yacht-trip-flights/) of their flights.
1.3.6.5.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: If Thunberg had taken a flight across the Atlantic, it would have [generated less CO2 than her sailing journey](https://www.aviation24.be/miscellaneous/environment/atlantic-flights-for-greta-would-have-generated-less-co2-than-her-sailing/).
1.3.6.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: The use of the sailing yacht could save no CO2, since the the flight took place regardless of whether Thunberg was one of the passengers onboard.
1.3.6.5.5.1.1.3. Con: Thunberg's sailing trip was a way of raising awareness about the already existing ["zero-carbon option" for traveling](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-plymouth-climate-us-trump) in opposition to the environmental costs of planes.
1.3.6.5.5.1.2. Con: Thunberg's travel arrangements have drawn attention to CO2-neutral travel options.
1.3.6.5.5.1.2.1. Pro: For example, her train trip from Spain to Sweden has received a lot of media [attention](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/15/greta-thunberg-in-twitter-spat-with-german-rail-firm).
1.3.6.5.5.2. Pro: Thunberg traveled aboard "the Malizia II", which had its own [solar panels and hydro-generators](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20837520/greta-thunberg-boat-new-york-city-climate-change) to power the yacht.
1.3.6.5.6. Pro: Thunberg refused the [Children's Climate Prize](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greta-thunberg-nordic-prize-1.5340672) to avoid needing to fly to Stockholm for the ceremony.
1.3.6.5.7. Pro: Owing to animal cruelty and the contribution of the meat industry to the climate crisis, Thunberg is [vegan](https://www.plantbasednews.org/news/greta-thunberg-says-go-vegan).
1.3.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.4. Con: Greta Thunberg has proposed ineffective solutions to climate change.
1.4.1. Con: Greta Thunberg has proposed specific individual actions that could be effective solutions to climate change.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Thunberg has suggested to fly less because [air travel is one of the biggest contributors to climate change](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/25/8881364/greta-thunberg-climate-change-flying-airline).
1.4.1.2. Pro: Thunberg has encouraged people to follow a [plant-based diet to reduce climate change](https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/news/greta-thunberg-warns-we-must-switch-to-vegan-diet/)(The 18-year-old is predicting a grim future for humanity if we don’t change our relationship with nature and our diets. According to Thunberg, “we are f***ed” if we continue to farm animals intensively for food.\n\nIn the inspiring film, Thunberg highlights how the global health crisis, ecological crisis, and climate crisis were all connected thanks to the industrialisation of animal agriculture for human consumption.).
1.4.1.3. Con: Climate change is a [systemic issue](https://theecologist.org/2020/jun/02/climate-change-requires-system-change) that requires global change. Thunberg has failed to propose such changes.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Thunberg has proposed adopting a [science-based stance on climate policy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/18/greta-thunberg-testimony-congress-climate-change-action)(The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has bluntly told members of Congress to heed scientists’ warnings over global heating on a day when the existential anguish of young activists was given a voice at the heart of Washington DC power.\n\nThunberg, the Swedish teenager who has ignited a global youth climate movement, said at a congressional hearing that she had no prepared remarks other than to submit the landmark IPCC report, published last year, that warned of the rapidly approaching catastrophe of global heating.\n\n“I don’t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists,” Thunberg told the US lawmakers. “I want you to unite behind the science and I want you to take real action.”), which would help to prioritize the climate crisis.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Stating that leaders should take a "science-based" approach without specifying solutions to issues is ultimately meaningless.
1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: [Scientists have praised Thunberg](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/climate-scientists-say-greta-thunberg-s-efforts-are-building-real-ncna1059321)(Climate scientists say Greta Thunberg's efforts are building real momentum.\n"She is getting people to listen, which we have failed to do," one climatologist said.) for spreading their message.
1.4.2. Pro: Greta Thunberg has supported Extinction Rebellion, which [promotes civil disobedience](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/views/analysis/gretathunbergs-moment-why-we-need-to-follow-swedish-teens-example-956321.html)(Extinction Rebellion, an international movement that began last year with a Declaration of Rebellion in London, advocates civil disobedience.\n\nExtinction Rebellion calls for activists to block roads and shut down transport systems in major cities around the world, not just for one day, but for long enough to impose real economic costs on governments and business elites, all the while maintaining strictly nonviolent discipline even in the face of government repression.) as a method of tackling the [climate](https://theconversation.com/language-matters-when-the-earth-is-in-the-midst-of-a-climate-crisis-117796) [crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-should-we-talk-about-whats-happening-to-our-planet/2019/08/26/d28c4bcc-b213-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html).
1.4.2.1. Con: Civil disobedience has been an effective way to create change in the past.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The civil rights movement in the USA used [civil disobedience](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/views/analysis/gretathunbergs-moment-why-we-need-to-follow-swedish-teens-example-956321.html)(Civil disobedience was first used as part of a mass movement by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa and subsequently in India. In the United States, its most famous proponent was Martin Luther King, Jr., in the struggle against racial segregation. Civil disobedience played a role, along with other forms of protest, in ending the Vietnam War.) to highlight and change treatment of people of colour.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: There have been many examples of civil disobedience in the past that were effective, such as the [fight for Women's Suffrage](https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/03/civil-disobedience-examples/).
1.4.2.1.3. Con: Civil disobedience can become a threat to our [society under law](https://fee.org/articles/civil-disobedience-a-threat-to-our-society-under-law/)(Parenthetically, I would suggest that you experts in criminal law consider whether there can be “civil” disobedience where there is a specific intent to disobey the law) because it promotes disrespect and general disobedience.
1.4.2.1.4. Con: Civil disobedience was ineffective in South Africa when [Nelson Mandela](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/english-literature/ineffective-civil-disobedience.php)(Nelson Mandela was forced to abandon nonviolence in his fight against a republic in South Africa. The concept of civil disobedience that Thoreau outlined in “In Resistance to Civil Government” may not be a plausible strategy in a non-democratic government.) had to abandon nonviolence in his fight against a republic in South Africa.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The acts of civil disobedience \(such as the school strikes\) done in the name of climate protection have caused more [coverage](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/19/teachers-warned-not-let-children-walk-climate-strike/) on whether children should be in [school](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/dublin-school-warns-pupils-off-infuriating-climate-strikes-1.4022682) than coverage on what is needed to save the climate. This is ineffective.
1.4.2.3. Con: While in itself civil disobedience does not serve as a method of tackling the climate crisis, it could serve as a potenial [means to an end](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+means+to+an+end) - indirectly progressing the cause.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Extinction Rebellion has been accused of [being non-inclusive and elitist with its civil disobedience tactics](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/04/extinction-rebellion-race-climate-crisis-inequality)(“It was feeding into a racist narrative,” says Guppi Bola, an activist with the Wretched of the Earth, an environmental group that focuses on black, brown and indigenous voices. “When those kinds of things come up, then of course you are not going to feel welcome.”), it is therefore ineffective because it generates widespread media coverage, but [hinders working-class climate protests that go unnoticed](https://aninjusticemag.com/extinction-rebellion-has-a-class-problem-which-no-one-is-talking-about-4d365289a831).
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Extinction Rebellion aims to depoliticize climate change by framing the question as a [moral one which affects us all equally](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/new-climate-politics-of-extinction-rebellion/)(While XR’s talk of extinction and annihilation is arresting, it is also depoliticising: it frames the question as a moral one which affects us all equally, passing over the questions of who is most vulnerable to climate change, over the power structure of climate politics, and over questions of history and justice, debt and inequality.).
1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: Climate change does not affect us equally however, and will [effect the developing world to a much greater degree](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/11/1054809644/climate-change-cop26-loss-and-damage), which makes it inherently political.
1.4.2.4.1.2. Pro: [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.global/why-rebel/) has described climate change as a crisis that "knows no borders, race or ethnicity, and while wealth may offer some protection, it is all but temporary. The clock is ticking, and if we don’t succeed in uniting to protect our planet, everyone will be impacted."
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: The middle-upper class elitist criticisms echo those of Thunberg herself, whose family is wealthy. [Her mother is an opera singer, and her father is an actor](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10059484/greta-thunberg-parents-malena-ernman-svante/).
1.4.3. Con: It is unreasonable to expect Greta Thunberg to propose a solution to climate change when no one else has been able to.
1.4.3.1. Con: Many [different solutions](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/climate-change/solutions-climate-change/)(Climate change is already an urgent threat to millions of lives – but there are solutions. From changing how we get our energy to limiting deforestation, here are some of the key solutions to climate change.) have already been proposed to fight climate change.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Thunberg was only born in 2003, and is not a scientist or political leader. It is unlikely that she could devise a new and revolutionary method to fight climate change.
1.4.3.3. Con: Because her voice is powerful, [she could spread awareness of the solutions that scientists are proposing.](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/climate-change-global-warming-history-b1830739.html)
1.4.3.3.1. Con: It is more beneficial to the climate cause for Thunberg to raise awareness on the issue, not theoretical solutions. If Thunberg endorsed a method that was later found to be a hoax or ineffective, then it could damage her reputation.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: Thunberg has raised concerns over [scientists being ignored](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/29/we-cannot-make-it-without-science-greta-thunberg-says-climate-experts-are-being-ignored)('We cannot make it without science': Greta Thunberg says climate experts are being ignored.).
1.4.3.4. Pro: Thunberg has stated that the detail of what climate actions should be taken has ["nothing to do with me"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719)(She has also criticised goals for cutting emissions which cause global warming, saying: "We don't just need goals for just 2030 or 2050. We, above all, need them for 2020 and every following month and year to come."\n\nHowever, Thunberg has avoided getting into the detail of what action should be taken, saying "it is nothing to do with me".).
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Simply criticizing those who are trying to find workable solutions to climate change, while refusing to make suggestions is irresponsible and unhelpful.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: If political and economic leaders are expecting a schoolchild to produce viable answers to climate change, then they should not be world leaders.
1.4.4. Con: [Greta Thunberg is an activist](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719), not an expert. Her role is to raise awareness about climate change not to find solutions.
1.4.4.1. Con: Thunberg has stated that "[activism isn't enough](https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/11/greta-thunberg-s-climate-activism-isn-t-enough-we-need-to-put-words-into-action-view)(Furthermore, and most importantly, the authors of the letter explicitly identify those who they deem responsible to take action now: national leaders, the European Commission and the European Parliament.)" and that [certain actions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/greta-thunberg-we-are-ignoring-natural-climate-solutions)(“Right now, we are ignoring natural climate solutions,” said Thunberg. “We spend 1,000 times more on global fossil fuel subsidies than on nature-based solutions. This is your money, it is your taxes, and your savings.”\n\n...\n\n“It’s simple,” she says. “We need to protect, restore, and fund.” That means protecting tropical forests that are being cut down at the rate of 30 football pitches a minute, she said, restoring the large areas of the planet that have been damaged and stopping the funding of things that destroy nature and instead paying for activities that help it.) are needed in order to have a positive impact on climate change.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Thunberg does not have the authority to make many of the decisions that can effect climate change at a national or global level. Therefore all she can do is engage in [environmental activism](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/importance-types-examples-environmental-activism.php)(Environmental activism refers to the coming together of various groups of individuals and organizations that work in collaboration in social, scientific, political, and conservational fields with the main purpose of addressing environmental concerns. These people and organizations are collectively part of the green movement, green living, or environmental sustainability and do have a common agenda on protecting and preserving the environment.).
1.4.4.3. Pro: Thunberg has personally led protests and demonstrations.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Protests don't tend to [achieve any change](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/why-street-protests-dont-work/360264/).
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: In 2019, Thunberg led [500,000](https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-leads-500000-people-at-montreal-climate-rally/a-50617527) people at the climate rally in Montreal.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: In 2019, Thunberg led the climate strike in [New York](https://actionnetwork.org/events/new-york-city-climate-strike-with-greta-thunberg).
1.4.4.4. Con: As an environmental activist with a strong public voice, [Thunberg should follow 'solution driven activism'](https://richmondvale.org/en/blog/what-is-an-environmental-activist)(Solution driven activism: Encompasses finding a solution to a specific problem and demanding steps be taken in order to implement said solution.) in order to be able to demand specific steps to be taken.
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.
1.4.6. Pro: Applying heavy carbon [taxes](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/4/20896541/greta-thunberg-panic-carbon-tax-price), as Greta Thunberg has suggested, will not have much of an effect on the fossil fuel industry.
1.4.6.1. Pro: [Corporations](https://anewspost.com/anonymous-message-greta-thunberg/) have teams of lawyers on standby for any accusations that are brought against them, and they have money budgeted specifically for dealing with all of the fines that they intend to violate.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Corporations [pass the cost of taxes onto consumers](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CorporateTaxation.html) in the form of higher prices. Economically consumers are hit the hardest by price hikes.
1.4.6.3. Con: [The International Monetary Fund \(IMF\)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/carbon-tax-most-powerful-way-to-combat-climate-change-imf.html) has stated that raising the cost of burning fossil fuels is the best way to mitigate climate change.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Making fossil fuels financially untenable incentivizes the usage and [development of renewable power sources](https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/renewables-increasingly-curbing-reliance-on) and technologies.
1.4.6.3.2. Con: Thunberg claimed that [fossil fuels need to be eliminated to stop global warming](https://nypost.com/2021/04/22/greta-thunberg-us-must-cut-fossil-fuels-before-poorer-countries/)(Teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday scolded Congress on policy changes she said are needed to eliminate fossil fuels and stop global warming — saying the US must take into account the “global aspect of equity” and be held to a higher standard than poorer countries like India.), and that the US should be held to a higher standard and be the the first one to do so.
1.4.6.4. Con: [By applying carbon taxes](https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-tax-basics/), corporations would have to either pay emissions taxes, based on the quantity an entity produces; or a tax on goods or services that produce greenhouse emissions, which would have a direct impact of the fossil fuel industry.
