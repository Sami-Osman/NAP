Discussion Name: Should Teachers Be Allowed To Wear Religious Symbols At School?

1. Teachers should not be allowed to wear religious symbols at school.
1.1. Pro: Children need to have a neutral safe space to learn without the religious symbols worn by their teacher influencing their impressionable minds.
1.1.1. Con: Preventing the innocent and unobtrusive expression of faith by an individual is itself an act disfavoring one set of beliefs and privileging the lack of belief.
1.1.1.1. Con: Creating neutral ground does not favor those who are already neutral, rather it sets a standard which is acceptable for everyone.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Rejection of a position is not neutrality; it is a counter to the position. A neutral party would either desire to include both positions or would not care one way or the other.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The suppression of religious beliefs could cause atheism to become the prevailing attitude among children who aren't exposed to any other religious objects.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Children are already easily exposed to religious symbols in public.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Logic dictates that if we were to ban teachers' wearing of religious symbols for fear of influence, we should also institute a similar ban in public, which could lead to excessive and burdensome bans.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Exposure to religious symbols in public is brief and fleeting.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Parents are more aptly prepared to steer their children away from given religious symbols in public.
1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Exposure to religious symbols in the classroom is more significant and takes place over longer periods of time.
1.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: In many heavily religious countries, exposure to religious symbols in public is not likely to be brief.
1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Conversely, in secular nations, the presence of religious symbols in public is likely to be greatly reduced.
1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Children can be exposed to religious objects at home or in churches, synagogues, or mosques.
1.1.2. Pro: Children need to be protected from the negative aspects of religion.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Religion keeps people [away from scientific knowledge](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20927986-300-religion-no-excuse-for-promoting-scientific-ignorance/).
1.1.2.2. Con: Children need to be protected from the negative aspects of society in general, not explicitly the religious ones.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Children need to be protected from the negative aspects of religion as well; more than 1,700 clergy members [credibly accused of sex abuse](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/religion/nearly-1-700-priests-clergy-accused-sex-abuse-are-unsupervised-n1062396) are still working with children in the US.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Some forms of censorship around children are necessary, especially to protect them against pornographic or extremely violent images or themes.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Religious symbols are not pornographic or violent.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: If any symbol is considered pornographic or violent, it can be banned for those reasons, rather than because it is a religious symbol.
1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The Kama Sutra is a [Hindu text about erotic love](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kama-and-kama-sutra) and pleasure and is filled with pornographic images.
1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The Kama Sutra is unlikely to be a religious symbol that is worn or carried around by a teacher.
1.1.2.2.2.1.3. Con: The [crucifix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix), the core symbol of Christianity, depicts Jesus' violent and painful death.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Pornographic images are [harmful](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/child_law/resources/child_law_practiceonline/child_law_practice/vol-33/may-2014/how-pornography-harms-children--the-advocate-s-role/) to children and can damage their health and well-being.
1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: The [scientific evidence](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2021/03/teaching-porn-literacy) regarding the effect pornography exposure has on adolescents is mixed.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Religion promotes [violence](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/how-should-faith-communities-halt-the-rise-in-religious-violence/).
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Most [religious texts promote peace](https://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol1_1/smoker.html)(This paper is about different spiritual and religious traditions in the world and how they have or could in the future contribute to the creation of a global culture of peace. As the above quotations indicate, almost all of the world's religions, in their own sacred writings and scriptures, say that they support "peace". Yet it is a known fact that war and violence have often been undertaken historically, as well as at present, in the name of religion \(as is discussed further below\). Yet religions profess to want peace. So what is 'peace'? And how have religions historically helped to promote peace, and how might they help create a more peaceful world in the 21st century?), the followers interpret those scriptures in [distorted ways](https://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library/why-religions-facilitate-war-and-how-religions-facilitate-peace)(While Muhammad had cautioned against war over minor differences within Islam, even during the reign of the first four good or paradigmatic caliphs, reformers appeared who attempted by armed revolution or assassination to purify the realm of allegedly corrupt rulers. As will become apparent shortly, the teachings of Muhammad were interpreted to create a kind of holy war as well as justice in the conduct of war similar to medieval Christian just war theory.), causing violence.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: [Jihad is a religious war](https://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library/why-religions-facilitate-war-and-how-religions-facilitate-peace)(The only legitimate jihad war is a religious war to expand the rule of God. Only the caliph can declare an offensive jihad after an invitation to submit to the opponent has been issued and should be fought only by Muslims free of debt. A defensive jihad is when Islam is under attack and is a duty incumbent on all Muslims.) to expand the word of God.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: [The Crusades](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1249/the-crusades-causes--goals/) were a series of invasions and battles to defend Christianity and retake Jerusalem and other sacred sites from Muslim occupiers.
1.1.2.3.4. Con: Much of the violence in the modern world is perpetrated by [secular nations](https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/root-evil)(Westerners are fascinated by the nexus of “religion and violence.” War on behalf of nationalism and freedom and oil and other such mundane secular matters hardly counts as violence at all. At the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Qatar in 2007, nearly four years into the U.S. occupation of Iraq, David Satterfield, senior adviser and coordinator for Iraq in the office of the U.S. Secretary of State, gave a speech condemning those in Iraq “who try to achieve their goals through the use of violence.” As the journalist Rami Khouri sardonically commented, “As if the U.S. had not used weapons when invading Iraq!”) in the name of freedom or human rights.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Religion promotes [intolerance](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/opinion/how-religion-can-lead-to-violence.html) and creates divisions.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Religion promotes [sexism](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/07061.pdf)(One strength of \(religious\) fundamentalisms was seen to be their ability to make religion/nation/ethnicity the most important consideration, compared with which all others are of minor importance. Thus, for example, women’s rights become for the followers of such a fundamentalist movement a secondary issue. The fight for them is postponed to a later time, a later time which probably will never come. Similarly, women’s movements tend to take their collective identity as the master category, which is considered more important than all others. This makes it difficult for religious women to join these movements.).
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Religion promotes racism.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: [Racism is less associated with religion](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/religion-does-not-cause-racism-deprivation-and-insecurity-do/)(My research on religion and racism in Europe highlights three key findings: firstly, racist attitudes are to a large extent explained by low education, socio-economic deprivation, older age and insecurity, but not religion. Once these variables are taken into account, religious identities and devoutness matter only little. If anything, belief in God, no matter whether it is a personal God or a Spirit/Life Force is significantly negatively correlated with racism. The findings are based on the European Values Survey 2008 and are robust across 47 countries.) and more related to low education, socio-economic deprivation, older age, and insecurity.
1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: White Christians have been found to be [far more racist](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/racism-among-white-christians-higher-among-nonreligious-s-no-coincidence-ncna1235045) than nonreligious people.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: There are many peaceful multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities around the world.
1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: In [Kazan, Russia](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0822/In-Russia-how-one-mainly-Muslim-region-beat-back-radicalism), a city comprised of Muslims and Christians, both sides live peacefully together in an interfaith community.
1.1.2.4.3.2. Pro: From a domestic perspective, predominantly-Muslim Lebanon has [existed in relative peace](https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/middle-east/lebanon/history-language-culture/) despite there being significant numbers of religious minorities.
1.1.2.4.3.3. Con: Equally, there have been many violent and divided multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities around the world.
1.1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: India was ultimately forced into a violent [partition in 1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India) because of the incompatibilities between its Muslim and Hindu citizens.
1.1.2.4.3.3.2. Pro: [East Jerusalem](https://theconversation.com/israel-palestinian-violence-why-east-jerusalem-has-become-a-flashpoint-in-a-decades-old-conflict-160697), one such community divided by religion, is particularly violent.
1.1.2.4.3.3.3. Con: Violent and divided communities aptly demonstrate the need for more inclusive, educated, and open communities around the world.
1.1.2.5. Con: It is naïve to believe that simply removing religious symbols from classrooms will protect children from the negative aspects of religion.
1.1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.3. Con: The potential impact of a teacher's religious bias is low for most subjects.
1.1.3.1. Pro: With a math, foreign language, or music teacher, their personal beliefs in creationism are irrelevant to their scope of work.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Personal beliefs and biases are omnipresent and influence a number of aspects of our lives, even if the scope of work doesn't seem directly related.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Music teachers could choose to avoid certain religious songs, math teachers could downplay the historical importance of religion on discovering or proving certain mathematical concepts, and foreign language educators could teach students biased information about the cultures and countries that speak the foreign languages.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: A belief in creationism would not affect the ability of a teacher to teach algebra, for instance.
1.1.3.2. Con: Science classes in particular could be negatively impacted by a teacher unwilling to teach evolution.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: If a teacher disagrees with the scientifically proven facts of evolution, then it is up to that individual to decline a job as a science teacher, or teach the facts that run contradictory to their personal beliefs.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: However, if they do not decline this job, it is ultimately harmful for the children.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Plenty of people display or are [influenced by bias](https://www.easyllama.com/blog/unconscious-bias-in-the-workplace) at work; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to decline jobs that run contradictory to their personal beliefs.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Many people take [jobs that they don't enjoy](https://www.staffsquared.com/blog/why-85-of-people-hate-their-jobs/) in order to survive.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Part of being a teacher is setting a [responsible example](https://teach.com/what/teachers-are-role-models/) for children and doing what is right.
1.1.3.3. Pro: All teachers hold certain view points or biases that could influence the perceptions of their students; it would be impossible to find someone qualified to teach philosophy, history, or literature otherwise.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: If anything, this would help to indicate where any biases might lie on the part of the teacher.
1.1.4. Con: Children need to be educated to think openly and critically, to question the world around them, and make informed choices; the onus falls on society \(parents and teachers\) to teach these values.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Arguably, focusing on these values would provide an even firmer foundation for education than simply memorizing facts to pass examinations without highlighting critical analysis.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Memorization in the classroom [doesn't actually help students learn](http://elearnhero.com/memorization/).
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Actually, [memorization](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/) is the basis for all other areas of thought.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Having enough information stored in your memory is actually what [allows people to think critically](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliewexler/2019/04/29/why-memorizing-stuff-can-be-good-for-you/).
1.1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa that used a memorization platform [scored sixteen points higher on critical thinking questions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliewexler/2019/04/29/why-memorizing-stuff-can-be-good-for-you/)(At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, a study of 98 students taking an economics course showed that those who used Cerego diligently had scores on multiple-choice questions that were ten percentage points higher than those who used it less. But here’s what may surprise those who dismiss memorization: those students also had higher scores on questions calling for analysis. In fact, their advantage on those questions was even higher than on the factual recall ones: sixteen points.) than their peers who didn't use the software.
1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: The memorized facts at the bottom [must be reinforced or they'll be forgotten](https://teachlikeachampion.com/blog/blooms-taxonomy-pyramid-problem/) and keep students from being able to think critically about a given subject.
1.1.4.2. Con: The fact that a teacher is wearing religious or secular symbols does not detract from teaching critical or religious thinking.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: There seems to be a slight contradiction between critical thinking and religious belief; the display of a religious symbol may demonstrate that the teacher is unprepared for true critical thinking.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: The contradiction exists assuming that religious people are incapable of critical thinking, which is contrary to what [experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology) has shown.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Throughout history there have been many influential scientists, such as [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre), who have belonged to a variety of religions; religion certainly does not make people incapable of critical thinking.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Religious belief requires some degree of dogmatic and unjustifiable faith - this is anathema to critical thinking.
1.1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Critical thinking relies on assessing available data and drawing reasonable conclusions. Faith is premised on choosing to believe something despite the lack of evidence or reason.
1.1.4.2.1.3. Con: To say that religious symbols indicate a lack of the ability to think critically is like saying that Allan Rex Sandage, who discovered the quasar, is unable to be a great thinker because he said, "[if there is no God, nothing makes sense.](http://www.leaderu.com/truth/1truth15.html)"
1.1.4.2.1.4. Con: Many people come to believe in a given religion through deep and thorough critical thinking.
1.1.5. Pro: Teachers have the ability to influence children both directly and indirectly. By wearing religious symbols, teachers can lead students to believe that they \(as an agent of the state\) endorse a particular religion.
1.1.5.1. Pro: In most cases, the US Supreme Court has ruled that displaying religious symbols [does not pass](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/are-religious-displays-on-public-property-such-as-ten-commandments-in-historical-documents-exhibits-legal/) the [Lemon Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman), a test that details legislation concerning religion in the US.
1.1.6. Pro: Children have a right to learn in a religiously neutral setting.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Religious symbols would distract children from learning.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Children are unlikely to be overly interested in — or [pay much attention](https://www.brainbalancecenters.com/blog/normal-attention-span-expectations-by-age) to — random symbols to be severely distracted from learning.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Students are actually quite curious and have been found to be interested in learning about the [meaning behind certain religious symbols](https://www.weareteachers.com/teacher-headscarf/).
1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Most religious symbols are [unobtrusive](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20210104114137/https://archive.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4953) and do not interfere with staff dress codes.
1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Wearing a [cross symbol](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20210104114137/https://archive.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4953) attached to a chain or bracelet to denote Christianity is subtle and fits well with dress codes.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: Learning extends beyond the curriculum - religious symbols can prompt children to engage with other forms of knowledge.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: This would come at the cost of children learning what their curriculum is designed to teach them.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Schools should be a place where logic, reason, facts, data, and science prevail. Many religions often [contradict](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible), and are at odds with the lessons and subjects taught by teachers, sending mixed messages to the students.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: [Pragmatism](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/education/pragmatism-in-education-study-notes/69152), and not religious beliefs, should be the aim of an educational setting.
1.1.6.1.3.2. Con: Exposing children to differing ideas and viewpoints is not a bad thing. There is no single authority on what exactly should be considered a contradiction or mixed message; that is a slippery slope.
1.1.6.1.3.3. Con: Schools should certainly teach these things, but they should also be institutions that pass on a collective human experience.
1.1.6.1.3.3.1. Pro: We do a disservice to future generations if we do not teach them about the cultures and faith traditions that, in addition to science and logic, [contributed to the world](https://www.e-ir.info/2017/01/08/religion-and-culture/) in which they will live.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: Religion has, throughout the ages, been [divisive](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/religion-is-divisive-and-_b_1211924). Children should be free from divisions caused by religions so that they can concentrate on learning.
1.1.6.1.4.1. Con: Prohibiting religious symbols at school could be equally divisive as it could create distrust of unfamiliar religions and subsequently fuel fear of religious minorities.
1.1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Teachers wearing symbols of their religious adherence, where it is the majority religion \(and held by most students\), would be uncomfortable for students who identify with minority religions or no religion.
1.1.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: If the other children are already making the minority religion/atheist children feel alienated, it would be hurtful to see the teacher as a fellow of those students.
1.1.6.2. Con: Classrooms are inherently religious.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Historically, many [religious or religiously-affiliated institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science) were leaders or funders of [major learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science) centers and [scientific breakthroughs](https://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/an-overview-of-religion-and-science-in-the-united-states/), and were de facto responsible for recording historical events and factual information.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: European classrooms during the Middle Ages [focused on religion](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/history-of-education-quarterly/article/marking-time-making-community-in-medieval-schools/2232C1A9675A07C5E7E37E7A5CD16F15)(For the most part, the focus here is on Western Europe from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries and on societies that were Latin Christian in adherence. Though striking variations exist even within this region, the significant cultural similarities justify studying them together. Where possible, evidence from other religious traditions \(such as Judaism and Islam\) will be discussed, but the meagerness of these references here should not be taken to suggest that these societies did not possess equally complex and conscious socio-pedagogical strategies.) and teaching scripture.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: The fact that historical classrooms were largely religious does not mean that modern classrooms have to be religious as well.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: The purpose of a classroom is for students to gain knowledge, regardless of whether religious symbols are present.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: [Theology](https://trainingleadersinternational.org/jgc/41/the-history-of-theological-education) should also be taught in schools.
1.1.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: Theology is historically relevant in many countries, such as the United States.
1.1.6.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are several mentions of "God" and the "Creator" in the American [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript).
1.1.6.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The historical relevance of theology does not mean that it continues to be relevant into the modern day.
1.1.6.2.2.1.1.3. Con: Religion itself is steadily declining in the US; the number of [religiously unaffiliated](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/) Americans now total more than one quarter of the population.
1.1.6.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: Even "[The Father of the American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine)(Paine has a claim to the title The Father of the American Revolution, which rests on his pamphlets, especially Common Sense, which crystallized sentiment for independence in 1776.)," Thomas Paine [declared](https://www.bartleby.com/400/prose/456.html), "It has been the error of the schools to teach astronomy, and other sciences and subjects of natural philosophy, as accomplishments only; they should be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them: for all the principles of science are of Divine origin and cannot make, or invent, or contrive principles.”
1.1.6.2.2.1.2. Con: There are only so many things that a student can be expected to learn - theology is not important enough to be one of them, so it should be an elective at best.
1.1.6.2.2.1.3. Pro: Religious education is a [compulsory part](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects) of the national curriculum in the UK.
1.1.6.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Schools are required to teach religious education but parents are able to [withdraw their children from the lessons](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects).
1.1.6.2.2.2. Con: The purpose of a classroom is to teach students the ability to think for themselves and learn facts, not be exposed to unobjective religious propaganda.
1.1.6.2.2.3. Pro: Prohibiting teachers from wearing religious symbols and the indoctrination of a religion have the same effect; the elimination of the option to gain knowledge, which is counterproductive to the purpose of a classroom.
1.1.6.2.2.3.1. Pro: U.S. courts, especially the Supreme Court, often side with promoting more dialogue and expression over censorship. The same was [upheld in various cases](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases) including Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District and Evans v. Selma Union High School District of Fresno County.
1.1.6.2.2.4. Con: Classrooms actually have multiple purposes: for example, another purpose is to help children learn how to interact with each other and with adults. Children are taught [social skills](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/robsonsoced/chapter/__unknown__-6/) in addition to traditional fact-based knowledge.
1.1.6.2.2.4.1. Pro: Social skills are also an essential part of learning and foundation building for the future.
1.1.6.2.2.5. Pro: Children should learn that beliefs are not limited to religion. It's not specific beliefs that create a stifling environment, but rather the way beliefs are held and applied.
1.1.6.2.2.5.1. Pro: A stifling way to adhere to science is called [scientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism). This term refers to the cosmetic application of science in unwarranted situations not amenable to application of the scientific method or scientific standards.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: In the United States, former President Trump [moved to protect students who desired to pray in the classroom](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/01/16/trump-administration-moves-protect-prayer-public-schools-federal-funds-religious-organizations/) and give student-led religious groups access to public funds.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Con: There is little evidence that anyone was being [prevented from praying at school](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/01/16/trump-administration-moves-protect-prayer-public-schools-federal-funds-religious-organizations/)(Some experts criticized the administration for distorting reality, saying there is scant evidence that students who want to pray are being prevented from doing so.\n\nCharles C. Haynes, a senior fellow at the Freedom Forum who has advised hundreds of school districts on matters related to religion, said the guidance fed a false narrative that prayer in public schools is under attack. He said the vast majority of schools respect a student’s right to prayer.) in the first place.
1.1.6.2.4. Con: While there might be religion in classrooms, this does not mean that they should be religious.
1.1.6.2.4.1. Pro: In the US, [separation of church and state](https://time.com/5103677/church-state-separation-religious-freedom/) within public schools is broken first thing every morning during the [Pledge of Allegiance](https://www.legion.org/flag/pledge), which contains the assertion "under God."
1.1.6.2.4.1.1. Pro: Students are encouraged and sometimes forced to say the Pledge, while being taught to [memorize](https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2014/10/16/pledge-of-allegiance-immigrants-america-dena-vardaxis) the words before they truly understand their significance. Therefore, it is hypocritical to prevent a teacher from wearing a religious symbol.
1.1.6.2.4.1.2. Con: Forcing someone to recite the Pledge is illegal, per a [US Supreme Court ruling in the 1940s](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/624/)(Students may not be required to salute the American flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance at public schools if it is contrary to their religious beliefs.) that has withstood the test of time.
1.1.6.2.5. Con: Teachers wearing religious symbols on their person does not make their classroom setting religious.
1.1.6.2.5.1. Pro: Some individuals wear religious symbols for aesthetic purposes.
1.1.6.2.5.1.1. Pro: Many symbols, especially [crosses](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/wearing-cross-jewelry-appreciation-appropriation-190000816.html), are worn for decorative, sentimental, or traditional reasons, and not explicitly for religious purposes; the wearer is not always actively practicing or following a religion.
1.1.6.2.6. Pro: There is no such thing as a religiously neutral setting.
1.1.6.2.6.1. Con: Instituting a uniform policy could turn a classroom into a religiously neutral setting; teachers would be unable to wear their religious beliefs in the form of clothing or symbols.
1.1.6.2.6.1.1. Pro: Teachers could be required to wear jeans and a plain t-shirt without any printed designs in order to maintain the neutrality of a classroom.
1.1.6.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Logos on uniforms also advertise a brand, some of which may be closely tied to social identity. Teachers should wear whatever they want as long as it adheres to their employer's dress code.
1.1.6.2.6.1.2. Con: While it might make the classroom appear neutral, a uniform policy would ultimately not be able to affect religious discussion and belief in the classroom.
1.1.6.2.6.2. Con: The fact that there isn't currently a religiously neutral setting doesn't mean that it is not a desirable goal.
1.1.6.2.6.2.1. Pro: This is similar to saying that there is no justice - but that does not mean that we should not try to achieve it.
1.1.6.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Justice is an [absolute good](https://www.iep.utm.edu/justwest/), recognizable as good by everybody. Neutrality is of debatable merit.
1.1.6.2.6.3. Pro: Teachers should not \(and indeed realistically, cannot\) be expected to be neutral. However, the expectation should be to foster a climate of neutrality in their classrooms; this begins with acknowledging and accepting that no one is fully neutral.
1.1.6.2.6.4. Pro: Even people who follow non-religious, atheist, or agnostic belief systems frequently have strongly-held religious ideas regarding morality, ethics, and/or truth. As such, there is no default religious neutral setting.
1.1.6.2.6.5. Con: School settings should be neutral with regard to which moral authority to follow \(or not\), while justifying and discussing values with valid arguments.
1.1.6.3. Pro: A religiously neutral setting would allow children to have the opportunity to learn about all of the religions of the world.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Schools should be inclusive of all religions; a non-neutral setting impairs the ability to present and learn about all religions without bias.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Some religions teach concepts that are diametrically opposed to the ideas of secular learning. Allowing schools to be inclusive of such ideas undermines secular education itself.
1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Religion and public education are [becoming more intertwined](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2019/03/20/why-the-spread-of-public-education-is-unlikely-to-yield-a-secular-world/)(More and more societies are blending secular features with religious ones; a purely secular society is not emerging, and mostly religious societies are being secularized. Education and religion are meeting more in the middle than expected.), with each one influencing the other.
1.1.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism) is an aspect of religious faith that is diametrically opposed to the scientific evidence explaining the origin of the known universe.
1.1.6.3.1.1.3. Con: It is possible to include people of all religions while teaching strictly the approved secular curricula; being inclusive does not equal an endorsement.
1.1.6.3.1.1.3.1. Con: There is no guarantee that an approved secular curricula would treat all religions equally.
1.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: A neutral setting will allow students to learn about all religions and create an interfaith community, open to and accepting of everyone.
1.1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Being part of an interfaith community teaches diversity, demonstrating that everyone is part of the community regardless of their religion.
1.1.6.3.1.2.2. Con: Even by law you cannot force everyone to accept everyone else. The maximum amount of cover the law can provide is to prohibit discrimination.
1.1.6.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.3.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: Children can still learn about all religions even when teachers elect to wear their own religious symbols.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Many educational jurisdictions around the world offer classes that are [inclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_education_in_primary_and_secondary_education) of the bulk of faith traditions. Permitting a teacher to demonstrate their adherence to a religion does not have to necessarily limit students' access to information about other faith traditions or belief systems.
1.1.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: The [mix of public education with religion](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2019/03/20/why-the-spread-of-public-education-is-unlikely-to-yield-a-secular-world/)(More and more societies are blending secular features with religious ones; a purely secular society is not emerging, and mostly religious societies are being secularized. Education and religion are meeting more in the middle than expected.) is making secular societies more religiously tolerant, and religious societies more secular.
1.1.6.3.3. Pro: Students interacting with people and ideas from religions differing from their own is an overall net positive.
1.1.6.3.3.1. Pro: These interactions between different people [build tolerance and acceptance](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1468796817723682)(Over the past two decades there has been a marked shift in attitudes towards many social groups that have historically been marginalised and/or vilified in British society. People have become more accepting of homosexuality and interracial marriage, for instance. These changes have coincided with globalisation and open-borders policies that have made West European societies more diverse, ethnically and religiously.) among diverse groups of individuals.
1.1.6.4. Con: There is no basis to say that children have the right to learn in a neutral setting.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: Children are generally impressionable and likely to believe what they are told; an educational setting which is not religiously neutral violates their right to freedom of religion.
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: Even if one were to concede that teachers wearing religious symbols is an infringement of a student's right to learn in a neutral environment, it is an even bigger infringement of the teacher's right to practice their religion.
1.1.6.4.2.1. Con: Practicing a religion has very little to do with wearing any given religious symbol; it has more to do with following the guidelines established by their religion.
1.1.6.4.3. Con: In many countries, it is a priority for the government or public services to maintain a neutral environment.
1.1.6.4.3.1. Pro: [Hong Kong](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201908/03/P2019080300860.htm), [the United States](https://www.jstor.org/stable/972951)(p. 317), and [New Zealand](https://www.publicservice.govt.nz/spirit-of-service/new-zealanders-can-be-proud-of-their-public-service/) are a few examples of places where neutrality as a civil servant is required.
1.1.6.4.4. Pro: Traditionally, children have little to no choice of their religion.
1.1.6.4.4.1. Pro: A child's parent should ultimately decide their religion; there should not be any religious indoctrination that goes against what the parents have decided is best for their child.
1.1.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: The simple display of a teacher's religious beliefs could be attractive to children, who might begin to show interest in those symbols, creating an internal conflict with the religion that they were born into.
1.1.6.4.4.1.2. Con: There is no reason why parents should have the sole capacity to decide what is best for their child from a religious point of view.
1.1.6.4.4.1.3. Pro: Religious indoctrination against the parents' will is harmful to students.
1.1.6.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Wearing a religious symbol is not synonymous with religious indoctrination.
1.1.6.4.4.1.3.2. Pro: Parents have a right to prevent the miseducation of their children.
1.1.6.4.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: Before public schools existed, children were educated at home; they were taught the values and ideals the parents instilled in them \([p.2](https://www.historyisfun.org/pdf/colonial-life/What_was_the_role_of_children_on_a_%20farm.pdf)\).
1.1.6.4.4.1.4. Pro: Teachers displaying symbols of religions \(or belief systems\) which are at odds with their students \(and their family members\) could create clashes with the parents of those children.
1.1.6.4.4.1.5. Con: It is unreasonable to keep a teacher from displaying even a passive symbol of support for anything that a parent disagrees with, especially given large and diverse classrooms.
1.1.6.4.4.1.6. Con: Children should be able to choose their faith freely.
1.1.6.4.4.1.6.1. Pro: In Canada and a number of other countries, [the freedom of religion applies to children](https://www.educationjuridique.ca/site/assets/files/14694/trousse_cde_religioneng.pdf)(the law also says that children can choose their own religious beliefs and practices, or refuse to participate in the religion of their parents when they are mature enough to do so.), not only adults.
1.1.6.4.4.1.6.2. Con: Children are very likely to maintain the same faith as their parents. [Seven out of every ten](https://www.pewforum.org/2016/10/26/links-between-childhood-religious-upbringing-and-current-religious-identity/) people raised by Christians keep their faith in adulthood.
1.1.6.4.4.2. Con: Children lack the ability to make their own choices, including their religion, until they can learn to reason for themselves.
1.1.6.4.4.2.1. Con: Children begin to use reason [at a young age](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/brain-waves/201708/how-children-s-brains-learn-reason), allowing them to grasp more complex topics.
1.1.6.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Children might certainly be able to make choices, but not necessarily the best ones given their limited knowledge. Parents should continue to make important decisions \(regarding their health, education, etc.\) on their behalf until they can make them on their own.
1.1.6.4.4.2.2. Pro: Most children [younger than eight](https://www.scholastic.com/parents/family-life/social-emotional-learning/development-milestones/age-reason.html) still learn primarily through mimicking and role models.
1.1.6.4.4.3. Con: Children are actually quite likely to rebel against their parents when [raised to have strong beliefs](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/parents-political-beliefs/361462/).
1.1.6.4.4.4. Pro: The pressure from home to conform to a certain faith might be doubled down on by a teacher who belongs to the same faith.
1.1.6.4.4.4.1. Pro: Children already have very little say in choosing their religion, this added pressure could potentially cause significant stress and discomfort.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2. Con: Teachers wearing religious symbols would not negatively impact the freedom of choice of their students. In fact, their freedom of religious choice could even be enhanced through awareness of community members who follow faiths differing from that of their parents.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that a child would deliberately seek out more information about a religion after seeing a symbol on their teacher.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2. Pro: In school systems where students are exposed to a number of different teachers that represent and show off diverse beliefs, it might be acceptable to allow religious symbols at school.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.1. Pro: If the teachers all hail from diverse backgrounds and religions, the impression of the school would be more aligned with tolerance and open-mindedness.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.1.1. Con: It is likely that in many communities a strong majority of the teachers belong to the same faith.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Communities that adhere to the same religion are [strengthened through their shared faith](https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2010/10/19/how-religion-strengthens-community/ideas/up-for-discussion/) and belonging.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.2. Pro: The more diverse religions a child is exposed to, the more tolerant and open-minded they are likely to become.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.3.1.
1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.1.1.
1.1.6.4.4.4.3. Con: The religious symbols worn by teachers should not be restricted based on whether their symbol supports or opposes the child's home belief system.
1.2. Con: Banning religious symbols in the classroom discriminates against religions whose symbols are not simply adornments but constitute religious practice.
1.2.1. Pro: Some religious symbols cannot be removed.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Some traditional headgear and clothing styles are not merely symbols, nor a public display of one's affiliations. Instead, they uphold the person's traditional lifestyle.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Sikhs have their [turbans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turban) \(and some adherents don't cut their hair\) and Orthodox Jews wear [specific types of clothing](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/orthodox-jewish-dress-codes/index.html) as part of their religious practise. They wear these items as a form of religious observance and not as symbolism of their belief.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many Muslim women [choose to wear a hijab](https://theconversation.com/why-do-muslim-women-wear-a-hijab-109717) in public.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Many Muslim women [do not wear a hijab](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/02/02/465180930/american-muslim-women-explain-why-they-do-or-dont-cover) at all, implying that it is not mandatory.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Upholding a traditional lifestyle is not a good enough reason to allow for religion to enter public schools.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Certain cultures and traditions may have [beliefs that are discriminatory](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/religion.html) towards certain groups - they would obviously not be allowed in a school. Therefore, it is legitimate to exclude culture from schools where it may be harmful.
1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Anti-Semitic attitudes can have [detrimental effects](https://www.dw.com/en/anti-semitic-bullying-forces-jewish-teen-from-berlin-high-school/a-38256364) on student welfare.
1.2.1.2. Con: Most symbols can be removed, and the fact that some cannot should not be used to distract from this.
1.2.2. Pro: Some religious groups for whom religious symbols are very important may feel that they have to make a choice between the teaching profession and their religion.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The biggest disadvantage could be minority religion teachers eschewing teaching at a given school due to restrictions. Students of these religions could feel like they do not fit in if there are no teachers representing their group.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: When the vast majority at a given school practices a certain religion, students in religious-minority groups could feel more welcomed and have people with whom they share something in common if they see that there are other people in religious-minority groups in their school as well.
1.2.2.2. Con: Wearing a religious symbol could demonstrate a preference to teach according to religion and not science because many religions restrict knowledge considered incompatible with religious books, despite having been proven by science.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: This incompatibility is demonstrated by [Turkish schools](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/turkish-schools-to-stop-teaching-evolution-official-says), the [Creation Museum](http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=17309), and [teachers not teaching evolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/science/08creationism.html).
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: What a religion teaches and what an individual practices can be different; to wholesale ban all religious expression in schools due to a single minority religion that opposes science is needlessly punitive.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Teachers who are predisposed towards teaching against science will do so whether or not they are allowed to wear their religious symbols.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: The standard of teaching is [defined by the government](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs95/95780.pdf)(p. 2) or school administrators. Teachers will already be aware of and have to adhere to this standard; they’ll teach by those rules or face being fired.
1.2.2.3. Pro: If these policies were to cause a significant decrease in religiously devout teachers, the ban of religious symbols could be viewed as government hostility toward religious beliefs.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: This hostility was demonstrated in the [US Supreme Court case of the baker](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/05/617029562/colorado-bakers-supreme-court-win-revives-religious-freedom-debate) who cited his religious opposition to same sex marriage and refused to bake a cake for a same sex couple.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: The [government crackdown](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/paul-wilson/2012/12/11/special-report-taking-christ-out-christmas) on religious symbols has been accused of having taken "Christ out of Christmas."
1.2.2.3.2.1. Con: This not a new government crackdown, [secular Christmas celebrations are deeply rooted](https://source.wustl.edu/2012/12/taking-christ-out-of-christmas-is-nothing-new-historian-says/) in American history.
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Without government hostilities and attacks on religious beliefs, there would be no need for religious freedom protection [insurance policies](https://www.brotherhoodmutual.com/resources/religious-freedom/religious-freedom-protection-shepherding-ministries-in-a-time-of-change/)(p. 15).
1.2.2.3.4. Con: It is not a bad thing for a government to have a reputation for challenging the influence of religion in public spaces.
1.2.2.3.5. Con: A government not doing anything about the wearing of religious symbols in schools could be seen as pandering to religion.
1.2.2.3.6. Pro: In Turkey, women were [prohibited from wearing headscarves and hijabs](https://www.pri.org/stories/2010-10-15/turkey-schools-flout-hijab-ban) in the classroom; this government hostility caused women to wear hats and wigs instead.
1.2.2.3.6.1. Con: At the end of 2010, the [head coverings ban was lifted](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11880622) and women were allowed to wear headscarves and hijabs in the classrooms again.
1.2.3. Con: The definition of "religious symbol" is too vague; it is impossible to tell whether certain adornments or pieces of jewelery are religious.
1.2.3.1. Pro: For example, [one's hair length](https://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/2011/11/theology_of_hair_how_many_worl.html) could be a symbol of their faith; a [beaded necklace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_beads) or simple [thread of white cloth](https://religion.wikia.org/wiki/White_clothing_\(religious\)) could also be considered religiously significant symbols.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: A beard can be a [religious symbol](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/10/many-religions-require-their-men-to-grow-beards-why-does-god-like-hairy-chins.html) for Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others. It is impossible to decide if wearing a beard is religious in principle.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: For example, many Christians wear a beard but not for religious reasons.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.5.1.1.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: While there may be some cases where it is ambiguous whether or not a symbol is religious, in many cases it would be obvious that a cross or turban, for example, are worn for religious reasons.
1.2.3.2. Pro: The arbitrary restrictions placed on the public display of everything holding a spiritual and/or religious meaning to a given individual are far too intrusive and ultimately unenforceable.
1.2.3.3. Con: If teachers were to be truly banned from wearing religious symbols, an exhaustive list of such symbols could be procured or created, regardless of the amount of time or effort involved.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Schools are able to [effectively enforce](https://www.today.com/parents/school-board-chairman-blames-parents-dress-code-policy-t225729) dress codes, religious symbols could just be added as a new section.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.6.1.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: As fashion trends change, what constitutes a religious symbol would likely also change, complicating the ability to create and maintain a truly exhaustive list.
1.2.3.4. Con: Some countries have been able to accurately define religious symbols; they have been banned from [schools in France](https://www.france24.com/en/20191030-french-move-to-extend-ban-on-wearing-religious-symbols-sparks-fears-of-radical-secularism) since 2004.
1.3. Con: Teachers wearing religious symbols in the classroom is protected under freedom of expression.
1.3.1. Pro: Public signaling of a person's religion by wearing religious symbols is protected under the [right of self expression](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/y-ddeddf-hawliau-dynol/article-10-freedom-expression); it doesn't infringe on a student's religious freedoms.
1.3.1.1. Con: Religion is a [personal matter](https://www.deseret.com/1992/9/22/19006165/religion-is-a-personal-matter); it is not for public display via symbols.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Individuals have the right to celebrate and worship as they please, including wearing symbols of their faith.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: It can be considered impolite to bring up religion during social conversations; most [Americans never talk about it](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/15/many-americans-dont-argue-about-religion-or-even-talk-about-it/) outside of their immediate family.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Freedom of expression is a [core human right](http://www.law-democracy.org/live/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foe-briefingnotes-1.pdf)(Freedom of expression is a core human right which is guaranteed under international law and \nby virtually every constitutional bill of rights in the world. It is key to human development, dignity, personal fulfilment and the search for truth, and a fundamental pre-requisite for democracy and good governance. It facilitates free debate about and between competing political parties, enables citizens to raise concerns with authorities and ensures that new policies and legislation may be \nthe subject of careful scrutiny.).
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Self-expression should have limits.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Student dissatisfaction with a particular teacher could be displayed through a disrespectful attitude and demeaning or disparaging remarks; these forms of "self-expression" [should not be tolerated](https://www.myschoolmyrights.com/student-expression/) in the classroom.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Many countries do not recognize free speech as a core human right.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Freedom of expression](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2019/democracy-retreat)(Freedom of expression has come under sustained attack, through both assaults on the press and encroachments on the speech rights of ordinary citizens. Freedom in the World data show freedom of expression declining each year over the last 13 years, with sharper drops since 2012. This year, press freedom scores fell in four out of six regions in the world. Flagrant violations, like the imprisonment of journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo for their investigative reporting in Myanmar, have become more widespread. Even more stark have been the declines in personal expression, as governments have cracked down on critical discussion among citizens, especially online. The explosion of criminal cases for “insulting the president” in Turkey—more than 20,000 investigations and 6,000 prosecutions in 2017 alone—is one of the most glaring examples of this global trend.) has been declining for more than a decade across the globe.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Free speech gives and ensures people the ability to express their religious and political beliefs without fear of reprisal.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Religion is also a [form of culture](https://www.e-ir.info/2017/01/08/religion-and-culture/) and an integral part of an individual; denying reasonable expressions of religion is the same as denying culture.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Hundreds of millions of people [live without religion](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-atheist-countries) just fine; religion being integral to some individuals does not mean it is integral to all individuals.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Public display of a particular belief does not equate to an attempt to influence others towards said belief.
1.3.1.5. Con: A student's right to [free religious exercise](https://www.findlaw.com/education/student-rights/religious-accommodation-for-students.html) could be inhibited by the presence of conflicting or opposing religious symbols worn by their teacher.
1.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.4.4.2.
1.3.2. Con: Not belonging to a religious faith is similar to not belonging to a political party; it is a form of neutrality that should be demanded from teachers.
1.3.2.1. Con: Religious symbols should be treated like any other personal symbols of preference, like a favorite band or sports team, or a hobby.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Influencing a child to pick up gardening is quite different from influencing them to join the teacher's religion.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: The impact of religion is much more far reaching than music, sports, or other hobbies.
1.3.2.2. Con: Religious neutrality in schools does not mean that all religion should be scrubbed from the school experience; there shouldn't be any issues as long as religious doctrine isn't taught as fact and educators don't favor any particular religion.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Removing all religion would warp history, literature, and cultural studies.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: Religion and history are [deeply intertwined](https://history.yale.edu/undergraduate/regions-and-pathways/religion-context), and one can rarely be studied without the other.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Religion can still be referenced as a matter of historic fact even if its moral and theological dimensions are not taught.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Teachers are encouraged not to be political in classrooms because it ultimately ends up [shaping](https://www.educationworld.com/a_news/should-educators-include-political-opinions-classroom-discussions-41363729) children's own political opinions, rather than letting them develop it themselves.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Per UK law, teachers are forbidden from promoting [partisan political views](https://www.careerteachers.co.uk/career-advice/blog/should-teachers-talk-about-politics-in-the-classroom) in schools.
1.3.3. Pro: Schools have a responsibility to protect the freedom of expression of teachers.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Schools should foster, not stifle, self-expression, among both their teachers and their students.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In a world where people are openly expressive about everything, children need to understand that those around them have different beliefs, and they can't do that if the world around them is censored.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: People are [more vocal](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20191218-the-decade-that-saw-queerness-go-mainstream) about LGBT+ rights than ever before.
1.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement [brought diversity to the forefront](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/28/us/black-lives-matter-evolution/index.html) of discussions about society.
1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.2.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: It is not within the scope of education to foster self-expression.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Self-expression is more of a [privilege or reward for good behavior](https://www.eera-ecer.de/ecer-programmes/conference/21/contribution/37984/)(Self-expression is rather a privilege or a responsibility at school; it is not perceived as a right in its narrow sense. It is a desirable notion only as long as it respects the limits created by the oppressive structures. However, the limits make it possible for the resistance, sometimes even the rituals of resistance, to occur.) than a uniform right given to all students.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: There is evidence that self-expression can [actually be harmful](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/how-self-expression-damaged-my-students/262656/) to children.
1.3.3.1.4. Pro: As religious symbols are only symbolic, their outward display does not inherently promote what they symbolize. Therefore, they do not interfere in the neutrality of instruction in classrooms.
1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: The message of the symbol depends on its prominence in display, a trait that is unfortunately subjective. As long as the symbol is modest and tasteful, it should be acceptable.
1.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The modesty and tastefulness of a symbol is equally, if not more, subjective.
1.3.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: Many religions have [similar definitions of modesty](https://www.cleomadison.com/define-modesty/); their religious symbols would be reflective of their religious zeal.
1.3.3.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Modesty is an essential aspect of Islam; hijabs are literally a [symbol of modesty](https://www.thewhig.com/2015/12/11/hijab-symbol-of-modesty-and-faith).
1.3.3.1.4.2. Con: While the teacher may not intend anything by the symbolism of the symbol, students may interpret it in a different way than intended.
1.3.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Students who have been taught or exposed to different beliefs regarding religious symbols could take different, possibly harmful, meanings from their display.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Good teachers may be discouraged from joining or staying in the profession if they can't wear their religious head coverings.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: There will be many other teachers who do not wear religious head coverings who can take these jobs instead.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Con: Accepting that an entire religious group would be systematically eliminated from contention for certain jobs is inherently discriminatory and a net negative for the school in question.
1.3.3.3. Con: A school's primary responsibility is to students, not to teachers.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Schooling has a greater influence on the lives of students than on the lives of teachers.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: The teacher has already chosen their career path; students are yet to decide what they want to do with their lives.
1.3.3.3.1.2. Con: Teachers are expected to [teach at a high level](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1525208719/davisk12utus/rzldsvn5vro4u1qjg0bd/MicroPD-ExpecationsTheTeacher-LeaderNotesAutosaved.pdf)(p. 1-2) year in and year out, so the impact of the school environment on teachers' lives is much greater.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: The obligations to one group do not supersede responsibilities to the other.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: The power imbalance between the student and teacher means that the school system should err on the side of protecting the child, rather than the teacher.
1.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: A teacher has an inherent position of authority over a student by virtue of their role.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Con: To suggest that decisions on the right to display a religious symbol - or any human right - should be decided on the basis of the relative power of the individual is extremely dangerous.
1.3.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: The freedom of expression of an individual should not depend on someone else's assessment of their power.
1.3.3.3.3.2.2. Pro: Since power is a nebulous and abstract concept, this sort of policy paves the way for curtailing certain peoples' freedom of expression.
1.3.3.3.3.2.3. Con: Using power as a metric can help to better preserve the rights of weaker groups in society.
1.3.3.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: Through the use of power as a metric, it becomes possible to identify which groups in society do not have power, consequently making it possible to create rules that protect them.
1.3.3.3.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Welfare can be seen as an example of society identifying those members which are more in need and creating a system to benefit them.
1.3.3.4. Con: Schools do not have to protect an absolute freedom of expression - teachers would rightly be forbidden from using offensive speech or swear words in the classroom.
1.3.3.5. Pro: When teachers display their religious beliefs in the classroom, students increase their awareness and understanding of those religions.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.3.3.5.2. Pro: By interacting with teachers, the parents of students are also given a lesson in respect and the ability to coexist with others who do not share their same beliefs. A teacher being able to wear a symbol of their beliefs in the classroom helps create these teaching opportunities.
1.3.4. Con: Students do not have the freedom of expression in schools and neither should teachers.
1.3.4.1. Con: The US Supreme Court [upheld students' freedom](https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/student-speech-and-privacy/student-dress-code)(As students grow and develop their identities, they often use clothing as a way to express who they are and what they believe. This can be through items like a political T-shirt or religious garb such as a headscarf.) to dress as they please, saying that students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Religious wear, [including headscarves](https://www.aclu.org/other/discrimination-against-muslim-women-fact-sheet), were also included in this Supreme Court decision.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Students typically have to [adhere to dress codes](https://www.k12academics.com/School%20Uniforms/school-uniforms-united-states) at school; certain outfits and clothing styles are banned.
1.3.5. Con: Allowing overt displays of religion by teachers in secular schools would open the door to any and all belief systems to be put on display by a teacher.
1.3.5.1. Con: Unless it falls under certain prohibited categories such as obscenity, indecency, or libel, teachers already have this right.
1.3.5.2. Con: The employment contract should specify whether teachers can wear such symbols, and in the absence of a contractual provision, it should be assumed that they are permitted to do so.
1.3.5.3. Pro: The wearing of any trinkets or religious symbols which may cause others to feel offended or even threatened should be banned.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: Banning something because someone perceives it as offensive is [not supportable](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-moses-right-not-to-be-offended-ipso-freedom-of-speech-a9260741.html) within a tolerant society.
1.3.5.3.2. Pro: Banning religious symbols entirely is an easy way to avoid any possible problems.
1.3.5.3.3. Con: It is impossible to discern what would be considered offensive.
1.3.5.3.3.1. Pro: Christians would likely claim that [satanic symbols are offensive](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/an-insult-to-the-people-of-the-cross-sacrilegious-symbols-have-n/10094654), but one group being protected can't turn those protections around against another group.
1.3.6. Pro: To prohibit a person, regardless of their occupation, from wearing religious icons is a simultaneous violation of the freedom of religion and freedom of speech.
1.3.6.1. Pro: It is not just a matter of the freedom of speech, but also cultural habits and the feeling of protection and blessing some people gain when carrying such symbols.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: If carrying a symbol such as a [pride flag](https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g32867826/lgbt-pride-flags-guide/) would be permissible, so by the same token, religious symbols should be permitted.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: There is no guarantee that a pride flag, which can be considered controversial, would be permitted either.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: The feeling of protection and blessing is more important for children than teachers; teachers should forego their own symbols if they jeopardize those feelings in their students.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: Any expression of cultural habit or religious bias could prevent a child from being able to question those very entities for fear of upsetting a teacher.
1.3.6.1.3.1. Pro: An opinion is already denoted by 'advertising' the belief, indicating that expressions of allegiance can be viewed as oppressive and prejudicial to teaching.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Major world powers agree that people should have the freedom to wear the religious symbols they please.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The 196 sovereign nations of the UN ratified the wearing of religious symbols as an international human right. [The actual text](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-9-freedom-thought-belief-and-religion) specifies a few exclusions, none of which include teaching.
1.3.6.2.2. Pro: In the US, prohibiting religious symbols in the classroom would be a direct violation of two clauses of the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/)(Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.); the Freedom of Religion, and Freedom of Speech.
1.3.6.2.2.1. Pro: According to [Title VII](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, accommodations must be made for the religious needs of employees that do not cause undue burden for the employer.
1.3.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: It is not an undue burden for an employer to allow an employee to wear a cross necklace to work.
1.3.6.2.2.2. Con: The [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) does not require the government to allow religious symbols to be worn.
1.3.6.2.2.2.1. Con: In [Texas vs. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson), the US Supreme Court also included protected speech to mean "expression" \(anything that can reasonably be interpreted as having a message\), covering behavioral and symbolic speech, such as artistic methods and symbols worn by the person.
1.3.6.2.2.2.2. Con: The Constitution protects a person’s “free exercise” of religion. While they might be partially federally subsidized, [schools are not federal property](https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html), nor are teachers federal employees. Therefore, barring them from wearing religious symbols could be considered unconstitutional.
1.3.6.2.2.3. Pro: If students are permitted to wear what they like unless their attire is [vulgar or lewd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethel_School_District_v._Fraser)(Bethel School District v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 \(1986\), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court involving free speech in public schools. High school student Matthew Fraser was suspended from school in the Bethel School District in Washington for making a speech including sexual innuendo at a school assembly. The Supreme Court held that his suspension did not violate his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.), promotes [illegal drug use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_v._Frederick)(Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393 \(2007\), is a United States Supreme Court case where the Court held, 5–4, that the First Amendment does not prevent educators from suppressing student speech that is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use at or across the street from a school-supervised event.), or is likely to [cause serious disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District)(Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 \(1969\), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court that defined First Amendment rights of students in U.S. public schools. The Tinker test, also known as the "substantial disruption" test, is still used by courts today to determine whether a school's interest to prevent disruption infringes upon students' First Amendment rights.) at school or violate other students’ rights, then teachers should also be granted the same freedoms.
1.3.6.2.3. Con: In secular nations, government support or lack thereof is irrelevant. It should be up to the individual school or district to establish rules around religious symbols in the classroom.
1.3.6.2.3.1. Pro: The government should not be deciding where to draw the line for free speech. A teacher is a professional and should be able to conduct themselves in a manner that is impartial, with or without the symbols.
1.3.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: Teachers should not be judged on how they look; but rather, by their skills, teaching ability, and the way they manage their class.
1.3.6.3. Con: Teachers have a [duty of care](https://www.slatergordon.com.au/personal-injury/public-liability/what-is-duty-of-care) towards vulnerable children. This outweighs their rights towards free expression of religion.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: The apparel worn by teachers does not hurt the children physically or psychologically.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: If it were physically or psychologically threatening, it would be banned for other reasons, not on religious grounds.
1.4. Pro: Public school classrooms are mandated, sanctioned, and funded by the state. Teachers do not have the right to violate this sanctity with their religious symbols.
1.4.1. Pro: Teachers should not be able to manipulate the religious beliefs of children in a public school setting.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Opinionated expression in public schools gives teachers a platform to have power outside the child's school life.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: This gives teachers the capacity to interfere with the moral lessons that parents may be teaching their children at home.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Wearing a cross or similar objects does not constitute "opinionated expression."
1.4.1.1.3. Con: There is nothing wrong with teachers having an influence on their students' lives outside of school.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: The literal purpose of school is for students to learn from teachers and gain an education, ultimately preparing them for the "real world" outside the classroom.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: The ability for teachers to influence their students outside of the classroom may help them pursue new hobbies or special interests.
1.4.1.1.3.3. Con: If an overbearing teacher assigns too much homework to their students, it would reduce the amount of free time they have to explore new activities, interests, and hobbies outside the classroom.
1.4.1.2. Con: A teacher wearing a cross or other religious symbol does not manipulate the beliefs of the child.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Manipulation is to influence with malicious intent; it is unlikely that teachers would engage in such behaviors.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: It takes more than seeing a symbol for someone to be manipulated.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: Regardless, even if they do not manipulate them, teachers influence the decisions of children.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Con: If parents don't take an active role in the education of their child, anything and anyone can influence them.
1.4.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: While a teacher is certainly one influence, a classmate could also influence another child. Ultimately, it is the parents' job to promote or filter out what a child learns at school if they consider it against their values.
1.4.2. Con: The assertion: "teachers should not be allowed to wear religious symbols at school" also refers to private schools, therefore, an argument based purely on public school classrooms is not conclusive whatsoever.
1.4.3. Con: Limiting constitutional rights requires a [very high threshold](https://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/limitations_clauses.pdf)(p. 2) that is simply not met by the quite minor potential for a religious symbol \(that is not indecent or obscene\) worn by a teacher to influence students.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Teachers do not shed their constitutional rights at the school doors unless it causes serious disruption to education or falls under some of the unprotected speech categories such as obscenity, indecency, or libel.
1.4.3.2. Con: It is difficult to ascertain whether a symbol is obscene or indecent; religion itself shapes a great deal of the level of acceptability.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: To some, a cross with a near-naked man could be considered indecent. To others, someone wearing a skirt, pair of pants, or a pasta strainer on their head could also be considered indecent.
1.4.4. Pro: Students come from a [wide variety](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/08/22/understand-todays-world-more-students-should-study-religion-essay) of religious backgrounds. If teachers wear religious symbols, students could feel pressured or intimidated into [suppressing](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/can-i-say-that-can-i-wear-that) their own expression of their faith because the authority figure appears to support a different religious view.
1.4.4.1. Con: The religious background of any given student was likely influenced by their parents and is very unlikely to change because of a religious symbol worn by a teacher.
1.4.4.2. Pro: If a student feels suppressed in the classroom, it will likely affect their ability to learn and stay focused.
1.4.5. Pro: A school that employs a significant number of teachers wearing religious symbols could give off the impression of being a religious school.
1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.4.4.2.2.1.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Repeated perception of certain symbols within a given environment can [turn into hard-held beliefs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00057.x).
1.4.5.3. Con: The personal choice to wear religious symbols does not imply [a fusion of state and religion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/establishment-of-religion).
1.4.5.4. Pro: Symbols worn authority figures are associated with power. A teacher wearing religious symbols may thus suggest to students that the rules and values associated with that particular religion will affect how they are perceived and judged by this authority figure.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: The relationship between teachers and students is [bidirectional](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23870747.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A2327886fcec8a5a9a36c1eff064c54a1)(p. 15); teachers who wear religious paraphernalia and leave poor [impressions](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/03/religion-in-the-public-schools-2019-update/) on students may end up causing them to unfairly associate religion with poor perceptions.
1.4.5.4.2. Con: A teacher wearing a religious symbol may or may not suggest some value association to the student. It is impossible to curtail [freedom of expression](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/03/religion-in-the-public-schools-2019-update/) on the basis that it might communicate something unwanted.
1.4.5.4.2.1. Pro: People are free to interpret a given person in the manner in which they choose, regardless of the way that person actually presents themselves.
1.4.6. Con: As long as teachers are not proselytising their beliefs, it should not matter.
1.4.6.1. Con: Religious symbols are a form of advertisement for the religion and like other forms of advertising, should be controlled when targeted at children.
1.4.6.2. Con: Teachers are [role models](https://teach.com/what/teachers-are-role-models/) for children - as such, they influence them deeply even without verbally expressing their beliefs.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.4.2.2.
1.4.6.3. Pro: The majority of children will not notice or understand religious symbols and as such they will not be influenced by them.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Children are unlikely to understand the meaning of certain symbols unless they are deliberately explained to them. Since this is not part of the curricula taught in public schools, they would learn this elsewhere, such as from their families or in church.
1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: Children almost certainly make associations with these symbols due to contact with friends and family, and at school; religious symbols indeed have an impact regardless of whether or not the meaning of these symbols has been explicitly taught to them.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: In general, it is difficult to determine what constitutes a religious symbol.
1.4.6.3.2.1. Pro: In some cultures, specific items of clothing are symbolic and sometimes religious, but more unknown or ambiguous outside of their domain.
1.4.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.4.6.3.2.1.2. Con: Some of the more obscure religions could be favored by the ignorance of school officials not knowing if a given item is religious or not.
1.4.6.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Many [Greek letters have religious meanings](https://www.churchpop.com/2015/08/14/8-ancient-christian-symbols-and-their-hidden-meanings/), depending on the composition and context.
1.4.6.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Many people are unfamiliar with the symbols of the [occult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_occult_symbols).
1.4.6.3.2.1.2.3. Con: If one were to ban religious symbols, it would be prudent to familiarize oneself with them and create a running list of the ones considered to have religious connotations.
1.4.6.3.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.5.1.1.
1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro: Occasionally, certain objects are considered religious by one religion, while another considers them a normal everyday object.
1.4.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Cows are revered](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sanctity-of-the-cow) by Hindus in India, but slaughtered for food in most of Europe and North America.
1.4.6.3.2.2.2. Pro: [Pastafarians wear pasta strainers on their heads](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/18/pasta-strainers-and-pirates-how-the-church-of-the-flying-spaghetti-monster-was-born) in reverence to the Flying Spaghetti Monster, their deity. Others use pasta strainers to separate boiled water from the cooked pasta.
1.4.6.3.2.2.3. Pro: A number of seemingly innocuous objects including [trees, pottery, rope, beard clippings, and stoneware](https://listverse.com/2019/11/14/10-common-objects-with-major-religious-significance/), are considered religiously significant by one religion or another.
1.4.6.3.2.2.4. Con: It is important to respect all objects of religious significance, no matter the origin or insignificance to another religion.
1.4.6.3.2.2.5. Con: If one of these symbols is worn by a teacher who believes in the relevant faith, it is a religious symbol. If not, then it isn't.
1.4.6.3.2.3. Con: While this may be true, many symbols, such as crosses, are obviously religious.
1.4.6.3.2.4. Con: People are more likely to treat the religious symbols they wear with greater respect than they would any random trinkets. This could lead children to be able to better recognize which items are religious symbols.
1.4.6.3.3. Con: Subconsciously, our brains are always [aware of our surroundings](https://theconversation.com/how-advertisers-seduce-our-subconscious-60578), and can draw comparisons and make associations without our active input.
1.4.6.3.3.1. Pro: The [limbic system is permanently on high alert](https://theconversation.com/how-advertisers-seduce-our-subconscious-60578), constantly perceiving stimuli and assigning meanings to them.
1.4.6.3.3.2. Pro: This subconscious activity can cause children to associate the religious symbols they see with either positive or negative experiences, depending on their relationship with the teacher, school, and classroom.
1.4.6.3.3.3. Con: A child's brain is [frequently overstimulated](https://www.healthline.com/health/sensory-overload#in-children). It might not be able to make associations because there might be too much going on for it to draw conclusions.
1.4.6.4. Pro: Awareness of a range of beliefs does not impact the freedom of choice of the individual.
1.4.6.4.1. Pro: Seeing a religious symbol worn by a teacher is not necessarily a bad thing; it could be an opportunity to learn about a new viewpoint.
1.4.6.4.1.1. Pro: In school, children are exposed to a wide range of viewpoints on topics like religion, culture, and race, and are taught tolerance and compassion. In comparison, at home, they are frequently only given a singular viewpoint.
1.4.6.4.1.2. Con: There are other, more meaningful forms of learning about a new viewpoint than seeing a religious symbol worn by a teacher.
1.4.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.4.4.2.
1.4.6.4.3. Con: There would be no way to choose between religions if we never have the opportunity to learn about them all; this severely impacts the freedom of choice.
1.4.6.4.3.1. Pro: If you don't give a child any choices in the first place, you ensure there is nothing to choose from and further limit their worldview.
1.4.6.5. Pro: What the teacher actually says and teaches will have far more influence on the child than what the teacher wears.
1.4.6.5.1. Pro: Ensuring the neutrality of the subject matter being taught is far more important than restricting the teacher's right to wear the jewelry they desire.
1.4.6.5.2. Con: An [indecent outfit worn by a teacher](https://www.her.ie/news/teacher-comes-fire-inappropriate-clothes-wears-school-311063) can also have a profound negative impact on a child.
