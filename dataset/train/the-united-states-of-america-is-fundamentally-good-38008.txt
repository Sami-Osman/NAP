Discussion Name: The United States of America is fundamentally good.

1. The United States of America is fundamentally good.
1.1. Con: Economic inequality is increasing in the United States.
1.1.1. Pro: From 1980 to 2016, economic inequality in the United States has increased by almost [20%](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/#:~:text=By%20either%20estimate%2C%20income%20inequality,perfect%20equality%20to%20complete%20inequality\).).
1.1.2. Con: From 2017 to 2018, the poverty rate dropped by [0.5 percentage points](http://census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20there%20were%2038.1,million%20fewer%20people%20than%202017.&text=Among%20this%20group%2C%20the%20poverty,not%20statistically%20different%20from%202017.). Even if economic inequality is increasing, more people have been lifted out of poverty.
1.1.2.1. Con: Even though the poverty rate has dropped between 2017 and 2018, the median household income still remains unchanged at [$63,200](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/us/politics/gao-income-gap-rich-poor.html), indicating that this has not made the lives of people necessarily better.
1.1.3. Pro: The wealth gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing in the United States.
1.1.3.1. Pro: In the United States, the share of top 1% wealthiest individuals has [increased](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-richest-10-of-households-now-represent-70-of-all-us-wealth-2019-05-24) from 23% in 1989 to nearly 32% in 2018.
1.1.4. Con: Equality of economic outcome among participating citizens is not a marker of fundamental goodness. In fact, nations participating in socialism that do seek equal economic outcomes have historically been far more tyrannical and evil than America.
1.1.4.1. Con: Marxism and socialism are not interchangeable, [social democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) have typically fared way [better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Country_Index) than America in these regards.
1.1.4.2. Con: Equality of economic outcomes is a marker of fundamental goodness. However, in the case of the 20th century Marxist experiments, this came at the cost of other metrics of goodness.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489) suggest that there is hardly any correlation between wealth and [happiness](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/02/26/does-money-equal-happiness-does-until-you-earn-much/374119002/) past a certain [threshold](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489) where basic needs are properly met. This means drastic wealthy inequality such as for Jeff Bezos is a huge drain on global happiness with minimal benefit to his own happiness.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: It does not follow from a lack of correlation between wealth and happiness past a certain threshold that those with wealth are necessarily preventing the happiness of others.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Con: Happiness is not necessarily a valid measure of fundamental goodness.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Nearly all attempts at implementing [socialist principles](https://www.prageru.com/video/capitalism-vs-socialism/) have led to tyranny, poverty, and destruction of citizen motivation and innovation.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: In capitalism, the customer is free to make choices about what they purchase, thus directing and shaping the economy. In socialism, [the customer is powerless, under the control of the government.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYeYPcougmA)
1.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Late-stage socialist failures, such as Venezuela, eventually run out of essential items, leaving the citizenry in [desperate conditions](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/venezuela-runs-out-toilet-paper-katherine-connell/).
1.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: In socialist societies, self-interest is not eliminated but is instead [focused on gaining political power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWsx1X8PV_A).
1.1.4.2.2.4. Pro: [Capitalism](https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/09/democratic-capitalism-michael-novak/) leads to economic democracy, empowering citizens to direct and shape the economy. Socialism inevitably [leads to the economic dictatorship of the elite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWsx1X8PV_A), who makes decisions about what they think citizens want and how much they should pay for it.
1.1.4.2.2.5. Con: [Social democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) are considered a form of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy#Definition) and they do [not](https://www.commondreams.org/further/2009/05/11/worlds-happiest-countries-social-democracies) lead to tyranny, poverty or the destruction of motivation and innovation. [\[2\]](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/social-democracies-top-global-happiness-index-again-u-s-falls-again/)
1.1.4.2.2.6. Con: This is a conflation of Marxism with socialism, which does not account for [social democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy#Definition) or [revisionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionism_\(Marxism\)).
1.1.4.2.2.7. Con: The linked PragerU video in no way, shape, or form refers to "all versions of socialism". It specifically relates to the Marxist idea that a supreme government would be required to dismantle markets and capitalism. It has no relevance for [social democracies](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/social-democracies-top-global-happiness-index-again-u-s-falls-again/) or [anarcho-communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism).
1.1.4.2.3. Con: Equality of economic outcomes is an inaccurate indicator of fundamental goodness because it does not say anything about the real standard of living of, e.g., the poorest.
1.1.5. Con: The United States of America is the land of opportunity giving every citizen equal opportunity to prosper.
1.1.5.1. Pro: In America, everyone has the same opportunity to an education.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Everyone in America has the same opportunity to choose career paths.
1.2. Con: America's democratic political system is broken and unstable, causing harm and suffering as a result.
1.2.1. Pro: Donald Trump's legitimacy as president is questioned by many.
1.2.1.1. Pro: [Polls indicate that](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/majority-young-americans-view-trump-illegitimate-president-poll-n735426) a majority of young Americans view Trump as an illegitimate President.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The [GenForward poll found that 57%](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/majority-young-americans-view-trump-illegitimate-president-poll-n735426) of young adults saw Trump's presidency as illegitimate.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The Trump administration has sown widespread discontent and disharmony.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Most US citizens [do not approve](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) of President Trump.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The number of Americans who approved of Trump rose by [5%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/trump-approval-rises-but-more-americans-support-biden-for-president-poll-idUSKCN21W346) in April 2020.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Trump's approval ratings [fell sharply](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) from May 2020 and show no signs of picking up.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: A poll conducted by Reuters in April 2020 [indicates that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/trump-approval-rises-but-more-americans-support-biden-for-president-poll-idUSKCN21W346) only "45% of adults in the United States said they approved of Trump’s job performance".
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Many Americans believe [race relations](https://www.axios.com/poll-political-system-rigged-trump-c3f84eaa-7e94-441d-ba78-fb477d2b47e3.html) have gotten worse during Trump's presidency, accusing him of inciting racial hate and violence.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: People's beliefs do not necessarily reflect reality.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Since Trump's presidency, there has been an [increase](https://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/) in violent and verbal assaults against minorities, Muslims, and immigrants.
1.2.1.3. Con: Who is president does not always reflect the morals and values of the United States people.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Who US citizens vote for, gives some insight into what they believe in and stand for.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: A substantial portion of US citizens believes the US political system is [rigged](https://www.axios.com/poll-political-system-rigged-trump-c3f84eaa-7e94-441d-ba78-fb477d2b47e3.html) and therefore they believe who becomes president is not always majority's choice.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: In some instances, people vote for who they consider being the '[lesser of two evils](https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/25/news/economy/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-lesser-of-two-evils)'.
1.2.1.4. Con: Even if some people question Donald Trump's presidency, he came into power through a democratic electoral process in 2016. Therefore, he is a legitimate president.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Popularity is not legitimacy.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: The majority rules premise underlying democracy does loosely mean that popularity equates to democratic legitimacy.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. Trump [appeals to people's baser instincts](https://qz.com/653524/trump-supporters-are-operating-on-biological-instinct/).
1.2.1.4.3. Con: The fact that Hillary Clinton won the [popular vote in the 2016 elections](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final-count/index.html) means that the majority of voters in the United States did not want Trump in power. Hence, questioning his legitimacy as president is justified.
1.2.1.4.3.1. Con: The US electoral system is not based on the popular vote and most presidents win by small margins.
1.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.2.2. Pro: The corruption in the political duopoly of the U.S, means that neither party represents the common people.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The two parties somehow produce candidates that people are entirely unimpressed by, forcing them to continually choose between the lesser evil.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Hillary vs Trump](https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/25/news/economy/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-lesser-of-two-evils/) was an example of two candidates, where both of them were thoroughly despised.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: In the current election of Biden vs Trump, one is forced to choose between Trump who is [thoroughly disliked](https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2020/05/daunting-poll-results-for-team-trump-voters-say-they-dislike-biden-less-than-they-dislike-trump/), and Biden who [many believe](https://www.the-sun.com/news/1060753/joe-biden-2020-dementia-election-day-trump-health/) is suffering from [dementia](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&ei=U14tX7ThPMq6kwWKwKqgCw&q=Joe+Biden+dementia&oq=Joe+Biden+dementia&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1D2Dlj2DmC8FWgAcAB4AIAB1QGIAZ4DkgEDMi0ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwj01tSkoInrAhVK3aQKHQqgCrQQ4dUDCAs&uact=5) or Alzheimers.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: People have an opportunity to vote for presidential candidates in the often very competitive primaries, suggesting that those who win have impressed many.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: The Democratic Party is incredibly powerful in deciding which candidates even get a chance. Candidates that don't toe the party line are unlikely to be given such a chance.
1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: There was much controversy around the various [tactics](https://deadline.com/2019/11/andrew-yang-refuses-to-appear-on-msnbc-1202793929/) used to [silence](https://www.fastcompany.com/90370749/andrew-yang-got-least-democratic-debate-speaking-time-yang-gang-furious) the popular candidate Andrew Yang.
1.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Tulsi Gabbard has accused the Democratic Party of [corruption](https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-blasts-hillary-clinton-corrupt-democratic-party-machine-elite-dnc-leaders-1466541) as there have been many attempts at [silencing](https://medium.com/\@michele.delangeavl/the-silencing-of-tulsi-gabbard-is-bad-for-america-f3c3a34c822f) her.
1.2.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: Bernie Sanders, one of the most popular progressive candidates has repeatedly been [sidelined](https://truthout.org/articles/the-bernie-blackout-is-real-and-these-screenshots-prove-it/) or [silenced](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/26/487560887/they-cannot-silence-us-sanders-supporters-protest-after-clinton-nomination?t=1601466615086) by the [Democratic](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/10/trying-silence-sanders-corporate-media-delegitimize-themselves) Party.
1.2.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The investigative documentary "[Bernie Blackout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2XrCdnSrC4)" suggests that Bernie was unfairly [excluded](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/msnbc-graphic-bernie-sanders/) from [mainstream media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_coverage_of_Bernie_Sanders) due to his anti-corporate, anti-establishment views.
1.2.2.1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Given that corporate media and the Democratic party have this much power to silence candidates, it's unlikely for candidates that don't toe the party line to make it through.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Considering that campaign spending of around a [billion dollars](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/cost-of-becoming-president/) is often [required](https://howmuch.net/articles/how-much-us-presidents-spent-campaign), it's likely that collusion with either political party or large corporations plays a bigger role than any pure merit on behalf of the candidate.
1.2.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Policies such as [SuperPACS](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php) or other [political peculiarities](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/) allow for potentially [unlimited](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/maximum-contribution-presidential-candidate) donations from billionares or other lobbyists.
1.2.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Leading [lobbyist](https://www.statista.com/statistics/257372/top-lobbying-firms-in-the-us-by-expenses/) firms inject huge amounts of money into the political system, but these are only the officially recorded numbers.
1.2.2.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The Nation suggested in 2014 that [lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States) activity was increasing and "going underground" as lobbyists use "increasingly sophisticated strategies" to obscure their activity.
1.2.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: Most lobbying money in the U.S comes from fewer than [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States) firms \(with low turnover\), suggesting a kind of capitalist oligarchy.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: This was recently exemplified by AOC's symbolic [nomination](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/politics/aoc-bernie-sanders-nomination-speech.html) of Bernie Sanders.
1.2.2.2. Pro: In the US, big banks or Wallstreet firms support candidates financially, thereby continuing to receive benefits throughout their political careers.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Bill and Hillary Clinton earned [153 million dollars in speaking fees](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-paid-speeches/index.html), much of which was derived from big banks or Wallstreet firms that could have received benefits throughout their political careers.
1.2.2.3. Pro: The lack of viable political alternatives compared to other modern democracies such as Switzerland or the Nordic countries makes the U.S locked in "the lesser of two evils" mindset.
1.2.3. Pro: Ludicrous amounts of [money](https://howmuch.net/articles/how-much-us-presidents-spent-campaign) are required for any succesful political campaign.
1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.2.
1.2.4. Con: America’s current political system has little to do with American fundamentals \(e.g. the Declaration of Independence is not broken, causing harm, or suffering\).
1.2.4.1. Con: Corruption in America's political system is relevant to every aspect of America, including its founding documents and ethos.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: America's current political system has its foundation in its founding documents and ethos.
1.3. Con: The US was created in a way that was not fundamentally good.
1.3.1. Con: Most empires were founded on atrocities. Therefore, the suggestion that the US can only be fundamentally good if it was created in a morally righteous way is unrealistic and an unreasonably high bar.
1.3.1.1. Pro: During the [An Lushan Rebellion a fifth~ of the world population](https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Images/Articles/About-Bill-Gates/Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature-in-Graphs-and-Numbers/Steven%20Pinker%20-%20Better%20Angels%20in%20graphics/BA_ModernWarfare.ashx?h=337&w=600) was brutally wiped out. [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Lushan_Rebellion)
1.3.1.2. Con: Other empires having a history of atrocities has no bearing on the goodness of the US.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Without a comparative standard we are simply comparing everything to a fictional utopia.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: If the US was the least racist, least atrocious, and most progressive, of it's time, then that means the US is good comparatively.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: It's important to criticize what we know to be wrong by virtue of modern norms, regardless of the historical context.
1.3.1.2.4. Pro: We should not let the lowest common denominator influence our standards of goodness.
1.3.2. Pro: The U.S. allowed [slavery at formation, and let slavers count slaves as part of their population](https://www.britannica.com/topic/three-fifths-compromise).
1.3.3. Con: Due to the progress of civilization, the founding of every historical empire would seem "not good" by today's standard, as slaves, military atrocities, ethnic cleansing, were ubiquitous throughout history.
1.3.3.1. Con: That many people or empires committed atrocities does not make the continued commission of those atrocities good. This is especially true for the U.S., which had the benefit of centuries of hindsight.
1.3.4. Con: Great people of every generation tend to be blind to the moral injustices of the society they are born into, as [Socrates and Plato](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/ethics/philosophers_1.shtml) were to slavery, therefore every past generation could be perceived as evil by the next, if they so wish.
1.3.5. Con: No country is fundamentally good or bad. Every country has to be continually judged based on its' actions towards its' own people and on the world stage.
1.3.6. Pro: Native Americans were [slaughtered](https://www.history.com/news/native-americans-genocide-united-states) in order to take over the land.
1.3.6.1. Con: Native Americans were primarily killed by [diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_disease_and_epidemics) introduced by immigrants, not slaughter.
1.3.6.2. Pro: A country cannot be considered fundamentally good for killing millions in order to develop.
1.4. Pro: The US has high regard for human rights protections.
1.4.1. Pro: The rights of minority groups are protected in the United States.
1.4.1.1. Con: Minority groups had to [fight for and demand protection](https://minorityrights.org/country/united-states-of-america/) in the US; it was not something the US saw as necessary, despite its history of discrimination and violence towards these groups.
1.4.1.2. Con: There are [hate crimes against minorities](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crimes-case-examples?), usually with several [deaths](https://www.statista.com/topics/4178/hate-crimes-in-the-united-states/).
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that there could be up to [250,000 hate crimes a year](https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-endures-in-america-and-with-it-our-effort-to-document-the-damage) in the US.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: Hate crimes in the US against Asian-Americans have been on a [decline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/13/hate-crimes-against-asian-americans-have-been-declining-years-will-coronavirus-change-that/) in recent years.
1.4.1.3. Pro: [Religious minorities](https://editorials.voa.gov/a/u-advocates-religious-minorities/4297058.html) are protected in the US.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: [Anti-Muslim](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/anti-muslim-activity/) rhetoric and actions have increased in the US.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: [52%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/157082/islamophobia-understanding-anti-muslim-sentiment-west.aspx) of Americans believe that the US does not respect Muslims.
1.4.1.4. Con: Under Trump, [racism](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/04/09/race-in-america-2019/) is worsening in the United States.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Around [56%](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/04/09/race-in-america-2019/) of Americans think that Trump has made race relations worse under his rule.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: What Americans think about racism doesn't necessarily reflect reality. Perception can easily be distorted by consuming one-sided media or confirming one's own opinion in filter bubbles.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: A [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/284033/americans-improved-mixed.aspx) showed that the public is increasingly satisfied with race-relations under Trump's presidency.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: With universal access to social media, [more people](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/04/09/how-americans-see-the-state-of-race-relations/) are able to publicly express their racist viewpoints.
1.4.1.4.3. Con: A study indicates that racial rhetoric and policies emerging from the White House under Trump have actually decreased racial prejudice in the US by [some measures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/24/racial-prejudice-trump-presidency-study/).
1.4.1.4.4. Pro: The US is currently witnessing [unprecedented protests](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/06/2020-not-1968/) against racism in the country.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Rights of sexual minorities are protected in the United States.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: In the United States, the LGBTQ+ community is increasingly gaining legal equality.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: The U.S. [allows discrimination](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/12/868073068/transgender-health-protections-reversed-by-trump-administration) against people who are LGBTQ+ in receiving even essential medical services.
1.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: [Transgender people are increasingly gaining legal equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_the_United_States).
1.4.1.5.1.3. Con: [Non-Binary Genders are not federally recognized.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_recognition_of_non-binary_gender#United_States)
1.4.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Federal recognition of non-binary genders may not be far off now that many [states are beginning to recognize them](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/nonbinary-drivers-licenses.html).
1.4.1.5.1.4. Pro: [Same-sex marriage](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33290341) is legal in the United States.
1.4.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Same-sex marriage was only recently legalized by a narrow vote by the U.S. Supreme Court \(in [Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)\), rather than guaranteed outright. This means same-marriage illegalization could be re-constitutionalized.
1.4.1.5.1.5. Pro: Members of the LGBTQ+ community are legally protected from [job discrimination](https://globalnews.ca/news/7066333/us-supreme-court-lgbtq-job-discrimination/) in the United States.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: Discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community makes it difficult for its members to access [healthcare services](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2018/01/18/445130/discrimination-prevents-lgbtq-people-accessing-health-care/).
1.4.1.5.3. Con: Members of the LGBTQ+ community face high levels of [sexual harassment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31659745/) in the US.
1.4.2. Con: The United States does not have a good track record of respecting human rights.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The US has been actively involved in human rights violations in its own country and around the world [\[1\]](https://www.kialo.com/the-us-has-been-actively-involved-in-human-rights-violations-in-its-own-country-and-around-the-world-32290.117?path=32290.0~32290.3_32290.117).
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Under the guise of protection against terrorism, human rights and civil liberties of ordinary US citizens and even non-US citizens wordwide are being violated [\[1\]](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/social/rights).
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: The USA's arms export policy has resulted in American weapons aiding terrorism \(state-sponsored or otherwise\) all over the world [\[1\]](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy).
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: The US has been operating [Guantanamo Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp) since 2002 as a black site prison that [tortures prisoners](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/778944195/a-legacy-of-torture-is-preventing-trials-at-guant-namo) who get no trial.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: There have been countless examples of [police misconduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_misconduct) that infringe on human rights which spawned movements like [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter).
1.4.2.1.5. Pro: The United States funds wars and coups d'état to maintain its economic power around the world.
1.4.2.1.5.1. Pro: The United States financed a military dictatorship in [Brazil, Argentina, Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change_in_Latin_America) and many other countries, to maintain its economic exploitation.
1.4.2.2. Con: There are countries where atrocities are still happening, despite being abolished or non-existent in the US.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: In many countries, [slavery](https://theconversation.com/slavery-is-not-a-crime-in-almost-half-the-countries-of-the-world-new-research-115596) is not a crime.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The last case of lynching in the US occurred in [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States#After_the_civil_rights_movement). Across Latin America, lynching remains a [common](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-24/lynching-still-common-practice-across-latin-america) practice.
1.4.2.3. Pro: In June 2018, the US [withdrew from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_United_Nations) the United Nations Human Rights Council \(UNHRC\).
1.4.2.3.1. Con: The withdrawal was [justified](https://www.bbc.com/news/44537372) given that the UNHRC was allowing "countries with questionable human rights records" to become a member of the Council.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: The US itself has a [questionable human rights record](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-states). Therefore, withdrawing from the UNHRC on grounds of other member states having questionable records is at best hypocritical, and at worst just an excuse.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.2.4. Con: The relevant question is not whether the U.S has a good track record in a fictional vacuum, it's how it compares to other historical powers. There does not seem to be any major nation with a good track record of what we today refer to as human rights. China, the Soviet Union and Germany are all implicated in human rights violations far worse than the U.S.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: The [Soviets were guilty of a brutal list of war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes) including mass rapes, ethnic cleansing and more.
1.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: During the [German occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany), the mass rapes committed by the Soviet Union are estimated to hundreds of thousands, while the same statistics for the US are around 11,040.
1.4.2.5. Con: Without a metric or ranking by which to compare superpowers or major empires throughout history, it's difficult to assess their respective track records in upholding human rights.
1.4.2.6. Con: The notion of human rights is [incredibly recent by historical standards](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-1/short-history.htm). This calls into question the inflated expectations of modern generations with access to luxuries, rights, and possibilities unimaginable to previous generations mired in slavery, starvation, sickness and scarcity.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: The notion of human rights is not common to all countries around the world currently either. Many countries [suffer at the hands of horrible regimes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2017/01/26/the-most-and-least-corrupt-countries-in-the-middle-east/#78ba1f1b3434) with living standards unimaginable to those living in the wealthiest country in the world, or in the West generally.
1.4.2.6.2. Con: While the concept of human rights was not legally codified until relatively recently, people could still likely recognise that individuals have basic material and moral needs.
1.4.2.6.2.1. Pro: Countries like the US fought against Nazism in WWII prior to any international law on human rights, such as the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR\)](https://www.un.org/en/sections/universal-declaration/history-document/index.html). This indicates that they comprehended that Germany was violating something important, even if the term "human rights" hadn't been coined yet.
1.4.2.6.3. Con: [The Bill of Rights](https://www.humanrights.com/what-are-human-rights/brief-history/declaration-of-independence.html) - which evidences an early notion of fundamental human rights - has existed almost since the very founding of the United States.
1.4.2.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.2.7. Pro: The death penalty is [still practiced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States?) in the United States.
1.4.2.7.1. Con: [Twenty-two states](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state) have abolished the death penalty; therefore the US is making positive changes to its track record.
1.4.2.8. Con: Mankind, across all time and space, has not had a good track record of respecting human rights. This is not a unique trait to America. However, America is exceptional in that its [founding documents](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/founding-principles/) seek to respect and preserve the God-given human rights that every person deserves.
1.4.3. Pro: The USA is the only superpower with high levels of societal freedom.
1.4.3.1. Con: [Violence](https://towardsdatascience.com/has-global-violence-declined-a-look-at-the-data-5af708f47fba) has been declining dramatically over the last centuries.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: [Homicide rates](https://ourworldindata.org/exports/homicide-rates-across-western-europe-10583a5a083e2959491228e50201be98_v4_850x600.svg) across Western Europe have plummeted enormously over the last 700 years.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The proportion of the [total population affected by massive wars has been declining significantly](https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Images/Articles/About-Bill-Gates/Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature-in-Graphs-and-Numbers/Steven%20Pinker%20-%20Better%20Angels%20in%20graphics/BA_ModernWarfare.ashx?h=337&w=600).
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Human lives should be measured in absolute numbers. In this regard, World War II was the deadliest military conflict in [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties).
1.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Absolute numbers make it impossible to make societal comparisons. If ISIS brutally kills 100% of 10 prisoners, that is a very different scenario to the U.S Military killing 0.001% of 1 million inadvertently during warfare.
1.4.3.1.2.1.2. Con: By this principle, it'd be impossible for ancient wars to be the deadliest military conflict even at 99%+, if total population was less than \(2% of 2 billion~\)
1.4.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: Human suffering ought to be quantified absolutely, to refrain from trivializing such atrocities with percentages.
1.4.3.1.2.1.4. Pro: Counting human lives as a % of global population discounts their value as population increases.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: During the [An Lushan Revolt](https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Images/Articles/About-Bill-Gates/Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature-in-Graphs-and-Numbers/Steven%20Pinker%20-%20Better%20Angels%20in%20graphics/BA_ModernWarfare.ashx?h=337&w=600) in the 8th century, 17.2% of the world's population was killed.
1.4.3.1.2.2.1. Con: [70-85 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) people died during the Second World War. That is ca. [30% of the world's population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population) in the 8th century.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: Domestic violence [is on the decline](https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Images/Articles/About-Bill-Gates/Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature-in-Graphs-and-Numbers/Steven%20Pinker%20-%20Better%20Angels%20in%20graphics/BA_DomesticViolence.ashx?h=337&w=600).
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Sexual and physical abuse of children [has been rapidly declining in the U.S](https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Images/Articles/About-Bill-Gates/Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature-in-Graphs-and-Numbers/Steven%20Pinker%20-%20Better%20Angels%20in%20graphics/BA_USChildAbuse.ashx?h=337&w=600).
1.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: This graph on reduction in[domestic violence from 1993 to 2005](https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/MC11slides/sp-Slide073.jpg) corroborates this claim.
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: The rate of violent crime, murder and non-negligent manslaughter has [reduced between 1995 and 2014.](https://pointofview.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/violence-declining-graph.png)
1.4.4. Pro: The US was founded on positive ideals such as "[all men are created equal](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)."
1.5. Pro: The US has made positive contributions to other countries.
1.5.1. Pro: The US has made costly military interventions abroad for benevolent purposes.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The US played a commendable role in WWII.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: The United States was only part of the victory in WW2. Much of the effort came from the [Soviet Union](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/the-soviet-union-helped-save-the-world-from-hitler-a7020926.html), [United Kingdom](https://ww2db.com/country/united%20kingdom) and [others too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_by_country).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: After [Japan](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/japan-reconstruction) and Germany were defeated in WW2, the U.S benevolently supported both countries so they could get back on their feet. \[1\]
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [US occupying forces](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/japan-reconstruction) helped stabilize Japan's economy by carrying out tax reforms, controlling inflation, and providing raw materials to Japanese industries.
1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: This does not negate the [war crime](https://theweek.com/articles/716819/atomic-bombings-hiroshima-nagasaki-war-crimes-full-stop) of dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Imperial Japan was responsible for[atrocious war crimes during WW2,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes)which could only be stopped by military intervention.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Unit 731 is considered to be the worst, or one of the worst cases of horrible war atrocities.](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/world/unmasking-horror-a-special-report-japan-confronting-gruesome-war-atrocity.html)
1.5.1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The [Rape of Nanking is another example of a horrendous warcrime](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-rape-of-nanking) committed by Imperial Japan.
1.5.1.2. Con: The US allegedly committed war crimes in the [Vietnam war](https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/08/us-must-investigate-alleged-war-crimes).
1.5.1.3. Con: In 1973, the US helped install [Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) in Chile.
1.5.1.4. Con: The Iraq War, which took the lives of [thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269729/documented-civilian-deaths-in-iraq-war-since-2003/), was considered to be [illegal and illegitimate](https://www.wagingpeace.org/the-war-on-iraq-as-illegal-and-illegitimate/).
1.5.1.4.1. Con: [Saddam Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saddam_Hussein's_Iraq) and [his sons](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,454453,00.html) were guilty of horrible human rights violations, the attempt to take them out and re-instate a better government was justified.
1.5.1.5. Pro: The United States took part in the humanitarian military intervention in [East Timor](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/30/australia-cast-itself-as-the-hero-of-east-timor-but-it-was-us-military-might-that-got-troops-in) and helped [prevent mass violence](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/timor-leste-international-intervention-success-story-24713) in the country.
1.5.2. Pro: The majority of [technological inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_inventions) that have improved the world came from the U.S.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The U.S was the primary force behind the [invention of the Internet](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet), which has enhanced globalization and made cooperation easier.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: The [U.S. itself](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet) did not invent the internet; it was the work of [multiple scientists](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/) both [in and outside of the U.S](https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-internet).
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: One of the most significant inventions of our time, the Internet, was based upon the [ARPAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) which was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency \(ARPA\) of the United States Department of Defense.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Although the Pentagon's ARPANET was tasked with creating the world wide web, in fact it was the work of [researchers from across the world](https://www.govtech.com/e-government/Who-Invented-the-Internet.html) representing many different organizations.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The majority of the huge internet companies \(Facebook, Google, Amazon etc.\) are from the U.S
1.5.2.3. Con: This shows technological ingenuity but is not demonstrative of fundamental morality.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: There is no empirical way to verify the morality of technology companies that improve the world.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Capitalism could coincidentally align profit motives with technological improvement of the world.
1.5.2.4. Pro: -> See discussion #37559: The world is getting better.
1.5.2.5. Con: Most of these technological inventions were created by private entities who could have been based anywhere and not the state itself. Consequently, the U.S. cannot be credited with these inventions.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: [Silicon valley](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/103015/biggest-companies-silicon-valley.asp) - the home of technological innovation - is dominated by private companies like Apple and Google.
1.5.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.5.2.5.3. Con: Since the U.S is not a state economy, but a capitalist economy \(privatized ownership of capital\), it's a natural corollary that a majority of inventions will be privatized, just as all inventions could be state inventions in North Korea, since Kim Jong-Un owns everything.
1.5.2.5.3.1. Con: The fact that the US is a capitalist economy means that technological inventions that could improve the world are held to ransom by profit-driven companies. As a result, the potential moral goodness of the US' capacity for innovation is often muted.
1.5.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: In 2015, [Turing Pharmaceuticals](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html) increased the price of the life-saving drug, Daraprim, from $13.50 to $750.
1.5.2.5.4. Con: The distribution of [inventions per capita throughout the world](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XSb7r0oWRNJKAsm5tyIPMk6CrEaqWymKVkVKj6FzLjEdKQD88Tq6GyPUgwybzSQAeN-FDPxqplACvIWpGX1AXkv4Xa8CggQXUOxD7F0EzfSfHfZrANXJQLoFrNqNdtMSUqHVC2bq) is non-random, there is no evidence to suggest that invention per capita is untethered to location, culture, laws and country, quite the contrary.
1.5.2.6. Con: The US only [ranks 9th](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-10-most-innovative-countries-bloomberg-says-2020-1?r=US&IR=T) in the list of the world's most innovative countries, which indicates that it is not the world leader in technological innovations.
1.5.2.6.1. Con: The US may not be the most innovative country. However, because of its global influence, reach, and language, the US spread its innovations more effectively than others.
1.5.2.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.2.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.
1.5.2.7. Con: Selling technological inventions for profit is not an indicator of morality.
1.5.2.8. Con: Conversely, many of the technological companies [such as Facebook](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2019/11/google-facebook-surveillance-privacy/) and other tech monopolies that arguably have done [incredible harm](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/08/big-techs-heavy-hand-around-globe) also came from the U.S.
1.5.2.9. Con: The technology created for war and destruction outweighs that which improves the world.
1.5.2.9.1. Con: Fewer people are living in [extreme poverty](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-fewer-people-live-extreme-poverty-ever) than ever before.
1.5.2.9.1.1. Pro: [This graph corroborates](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dxx0lSx4OntDJr6pJwUQK9XwOTE=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale\(\)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13743810/world_population_in_extreme_poverty_absolute.png) this conclusion.
1.5.2.9.1.2. Pro: [The United Nation's target](https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml) of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline.
1.5.2.9.2. Con: [Average life expectancy is rapidly increasing.​](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/chart4.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=648)
1.5.2.9.2.1. Pro: Substantial [global progress](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/children-reducing-mortality) has been made in reducing child deaths: The total number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.3 million in 2018. On average, 15 000 children under-5 die each day compared with 34 000 in 1990.
1.5.2.9.2.1.1. Pro: These numbers are especially impressive given that world population has risen from: 5.281 Billion in 1990, to 7.594 billion in 2018.
1.5.2.9.3. Pro: The US is one of the [largest](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-worlds-25-largest-arms-manufacturers-in-the-world-2019-11#6-general-dynamics-corp-us-194-billion-20) weapons manufacturers and exporters in the world.
1.5.2.9.3.1. Pro: The US has [exported](https://www.rferl.org/a/us-russia-lead-world-global-arms-exports/29814176.html) weapons to over 98 countries in the last 5 years.
1.5.3. Con: The US media disseminates inaccurate news and information, which has detrimental consequences globally.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Many argue that fake news, often highly partisan, helped [Donald Trump get elected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/17/facebook-fake-news-writer-i-think-donald-trump-is-in-the-white-house-because-of-me/). Trump's election has resulted in [detrimental economic impacts globally](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/donald-trump-economic-consequences-us-election-growth).
1.5.3.2. Pro: [Right-wing or conservative news channels](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2020/04/people-who-rely-on-conservative-media-for-covid-19-news-are-less-informed-more-likely-to-believe-conspiracy-theories-study-finds/) in the United States, such as [Fox News](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1185825.shtml), have been spreading conspiracy theories regarding the coronavirus. Misinformation of this sort can be detrimental to [people's health](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-misinformation-health-advice).
1.5.4. Pro: The majority of medical research and innovation comes from the United States.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Of almost 3,000 articles published in biomedical research in 2009, [40%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/03/23/the-most-innovative-countries-in-biology-and-medicine/#2ff333401a71) came from the US.
1.5.4.2. Con: Many medical research and innovation companies are moving out of the US. This might threaten its standing as a major medical research and innovation player.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/), a premier biopharmaceutical company, has [moved](https://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708) its antibiotic research to Shanghai from the US.
1.6. Pro: American culture and media have spread progressive attitudes and notions of freedom around the world.
1.6.1. Con: The US has [supported oppressive governments](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL2003/S00173/50-oppressive-governments-supported-by-the-us-government.htm) around the world which limited the freedoms of their citizens.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Until 2017, the US was involved in providing military assistance to [73% of the world’s dictatorships](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL2003/S00173/50-oppressive-governments-supported-by-the-us-government.htm).
1.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.6.1.3. Con: In many of those cases, the US is lessening oppression by supporting dictatorial governments that are more stable and tolerant than the alternatives.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.1.
1.6.1.3.2. Con: This is not the case in [Latin America](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766581/obo-9780199766581-0015.xml); several countries were developing their free democracies and entered military dictatorial regimes that [violated human rights](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/13/no-justice-horrors-brazils-military-dictatorship-50-years#) after [US intervention](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4307854/mod_resource/content/1/Spektor%20US%20Military%20Coup%20in%20Brazil.pdf). It is called the dark age of Latin America.
1.6.1.3.3. Con: It is overreaching and morally arrogant for the US to pick and choose which dictatorial regimes to permit and which to dismantle.
1.6.1.4. Con: Many of these governments were oppressive long before the US attempted to help.
1.6.2. Pro: The [movie industry](https://www.rifemagazine.co.uk/2016/05/influence-and-appreciation-of-film-in-todays-society/) - which is dominated by Hollywood - strongly influences society.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Movies create can catapult social issues into the public consciousness.
