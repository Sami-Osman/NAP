Discussion Name: Should there be a upper age limit for voting?

1. There should be an upper age limit for voting.
1.1. Pro: If the elderly are allowed to vote they would be interfering with younger generations and their ability to take responsibility for their own futures.
1.1.1. Con: Allowing the elderly to vote doesn't take away the ability of younger people to vote and their ability to take responsibility for their own futures.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In the US, it is shown that if young voters improved their [turnout rate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/02/11/yes-young-people-voted-at-higher-rates-in-2018-but-so-did-every-age-group/), the influence of older voters in deciding governments is diminished.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the [2018 US presidential elections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/02/11/yes-young-people-voted-at-higher-rates-in-2018-but-so-did-every-age-group/), Democratic candidates would have done much better if a larger proportion of the young electorate would have voted.
1.1.2. Pro: In some recent [elections](https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/17/election-results-reveal-massive-divide-old-young-voters-11920781/), the political choices of the elderly and the young have been ideologically opposite.
1.1.2.1. Con: All groups with opposing or competing interests are likely to interfere with the interests of one another. Thus, this argument is not specific enough to explain why the elderly should be prevented from voting.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: One group, which is the young, is more likely to live with the consequences of contemporary political choices. Therefore, opposite interests can interfere with the lives of the young for longer.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Brexit is a political decision that is hard to reverse. The elderly in the UK supported it [disproportionately more than the young](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/) who will have to live with this irreversible political decision.
1.1.2.2. Pro: In some countries, [young people](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328716300520) are disproportionately smaller in number. This can mean that if there is a conflict between their interests and the interests of the elderly, the interests of the elderly are likely to be catered to.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Equivalency among interests can be achieved by assigning different [weightage to votes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328716300520) of different groups, without taking away the right to vote.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The [decreasing number of younger voters](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/48304/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-Cohort_size_matters_democracy_is_in_danger_as_young_peoples_disenfranchisement_accelerates%20%281%29.pdf) is bad for democracy because government policies will likely impact the lives of those currently young for a longer period of time.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Citizens belonging to all demographic groups have the right to vote. The [disenfranchisement](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/48304/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-Cohort_size_matters_democracy_is_in_danger_as_young_peoples_disenfranchisement_accelerates%20%281%29.pdf) of one social group does not justify the disenfranchisement of another.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Older voters are generally [less supportive of government funding](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/) of projects that benefit younger generations in the long run.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: During a [German referendum](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/), support for a massive transport project that would improve regional connectivity and free spaces for urbanization was significantly less among older voters.
1.1.2.4. Pro: In the UK, the elderly were more likely to support [Brexit](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/) than the young.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: Support for Brexit among the elderly should be seen as rooted in genuine concerns around [economic issues such as pensions.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-why-did-old-people-vote-leave-young-voters-remain-eu-referendum-a7103996.html) These are legitimate concerns that should base people's electoral decisions.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: A [survey](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39149/bsa34_brexit_final.pdf) found that education was a better predictor of preference for Brexit than age. The proportion of young people with a degree who voted remain was only 10% more than old people with a degree.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: Voting in a referendum is a genuine expression of political view in a democracy and should not result in disenfranchisement.
1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: [Men are more likely](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2879390) to have voted in favor of Brexit than women, but this wouldn't entail their electoral disenfranchisement.
1.1.3. Pro: Political parties are increasingly focused on the [demands of older voters](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17531055.2017.1410759) among other segments of the electorate.
1.1.3.1. Con: Voter participation among the elderly is [higher than among the young](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-856x.2006.00243.x). Since their votes play a bigger role in electing the government, their interests are naturally considered dominant.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: If younger people would like parties to take their interests more seriously, they should vote in larger numbers.
1.1.3.2. Con: Practices such as [gerrymandering](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2020/07/08/487426/partisan-gerrymandering-limits-voting-rights/) demonstrate that in US politics, it is the benefit of the voter to the party, not the parties benefit to the voter which is the motivation for a party to target a demographic such as the elderly.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Basing important policies upon the opinion of the elderly can virtually result in a state of the [gerontocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontocracy), which is a form of oligarchical rule.
1.1.3.4. Con: At the level of macroeconomic policy, the discourse has been gradually shifting away from providing [welfare](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120883882500225) to the elderly.
1.1.3.5. Con: Increasing focus on the demands of the elderly generates public good because it forces the government to increase public spending for [pension and health systems](https://www.imf.org/external/np/g20/pdf/2019/060519a.pdf). \(pg 1\)
1.1.3.5.1. Pro: The demands of [pensioners](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08959420902955917) were instrumental in setting up the modern welfare state system in the West.
1.1.3.5.2. Con: Healthcare would be important for governments independent of the specific importance of healthcare to the elderly as it is valued by people of all ages.
1.1.3.6. Con: It is a good thing when one social group's electoral participation results in attracting higher political attention for the interests of that group. This restores faith in the idea that citizen groups can have political clout through voting.
1.1.3.6.1. Con: If politics is seen to increasingly pander to the interests of the elderly instead of the interests of the young, the [young will increasingly lose faith in electoral participation](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8857377/Study-shows-millennials-losing-faith-democracy.html).
1.1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Today's young are more likely to remain as citizens of democratic countries for a long time to come. Their disenfranchisement poses an existential threat to [electoral democracy](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/48304/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-Cohort_size_matters_democracy_is_in_danger_as_young_peoples_disenfranchisement_accelerates%20%281%29.pdf).
1.1.3.7. Con: The implied claim here is that the elderly should not be allowed to vote as often \(age limit\) because they vote more often \(by choice\). The implication is that we should somehow remove voters from every identifiable cohort that votes more often, i.e. suppress voter turnout.
1.1.4. Con: The prospect of death is inevitable for all people and one's proximity to it should not determine the value of one's vote.
1.1.4.1. Pro: If all people are going to die, it is inconsistent to cite this as a reason for some groups not being allowed to vote.
1.1.4.2. Pro: It is not possible to predict exactly when one is going to die. Thus it is not possible to accurately determine one's proximity towards death.
1.1.5. Con: [Authoritarian populist governments](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2018/09/Norris.pdf) are often elected by the elderly vote. Such governments are likely to negatively impact democratic institutions which impact the political lives of the young.
1.1.5.1. Pro: In the US, [younger voters favor liberal policies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/02/11/yes-young-people-voted-at-higher-rates-in-2018-but-so-did-every-age-group/) while the elderly favor conservative policies. If governments are consistently decided by the elderly, the political character of the government is likely to be conservative, contrary to what young voters want.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: If the liberal policies are not sufficient to motivate young voters to actually vote, it could be argued that those liberal policies are not as desirable as claimed.
1.1.5.2. Pro: In the UK, the elderly voted significantly more for Brexit than the young. The negative impacts of [Brexit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b8d097b0-3ad4-4dd9-aa25-af6374292de0), however, will disproportionately impact the young in the UK.
1.2. Con: The elderly have [specific social and political needs](http://www.vikerkaar.ee/archives/26531?fbclid=IwAR3Lq0Vzk2anrP8ku2fB8-TIYhG3qYq0SpCQ1BiUIerFtZdXiCZiHyMErS8), which need political representation through electoral participation.
1.2.1. Pro: Elders make up a significant portion of the voters and can therefore have a lot of influence on the outcome of an election.
1.2.2. Con: Voting participation among the elderly is higher than among the young. This has sometimes led to their interests being given undue precedence over the [interests of young people](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/11/britain-favours-old-over-young-too-long-inequality-poverty-pensioner).
1.2.2.1. Pro: In the UK, the elderly are [wealthier](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/08/older-voters-election-2019-assets-tax-labour-tories-social-care) than other age groups. Their preferred taxation policies can depart from the interests of voters in other age groups who would benefit from more redistributive policies.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The elderly generally have paid more taxes and therefore have should be allowed a greater voice in decisions concerning financial policy.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Political parties have pitted the elderly against younger voters in attempts to gain from [polarization](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/23/old-people-enemies-young-generational-compact).
1.2.2.3. Pro: Voter turnout levels for older people are [consistently higher than for younger people.](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics)
1.2.2.4. Con: Politicians such as [Bernie Sanders](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/7/18216899/bernie-sanders-bro-base-polling-2020-president) have primarily campaigned around the interests of the young.
1.2.2.5. Con: The solution to a disparity in voter participation rates among different groups is to take measures that encourage the group with lower participation rates to vote more.
1.2.3. Con: The elderly are [less productive](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22452) and therefore make a relatively lower contribution to the economy. Their interests should also be given less importance than the interests of those in productive age groups.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The [negative contribution](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736\(14\)61464-1) of the elderly to the economy is also higher because the government is required to spend on assistance and welfare.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In the US, it is estimated that the [government will spend over half the federal budget](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2019/02/01/the-federal-government-will-spend-half-its-budget-on-older-adults-in-ten-years/?sh=2bfcd61c56b6) on older adults in the form of health care and retirement benefits.
1.2.3.2. Con: It is a duty of governments to [take care of people](https://www.cairn-int.info/journal-revue-europeenne-des-sciences-sociales-2017-1-page-127.htm?try_download=1#) who are no longer able to be productive. If the elderly did not have a right to vote, the state would have less incentive to perform this duty.
1.2.3.3. Con: A study in the UK showed that in 2011 the elderly contributed [40 billion pounds](http://www.cpa.org.uk/cpa/policies_on_ageing.html) more than what the state spent on them.
1.2.3.4. Con: Productivity should not be measured only through economic contribution. The elderly contribute insights gained through their cultural and social experience.
1.2.3.5. Con: Even if the elderly do not sufficiently contribute to the economy, the [macroeconomic situation](https://www.imf.org/external/np/g20/pdf/2019/060519a.pdf) of a country is significantly impacted by them. Therefore, their interests and political choices should be taken seriously.
1.2.4. Con: Many people [vote against their social and economic interests.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201712/why-do-people-vote-against-their-best-interests)
1.2.4.1. Con: In the [UK](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/), evidence suggests that the elderly vote based on their economic interests.
1.2.4.2. Pro: In America, many elderly people [vote against their interests](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/opinion/2020/09/seniors-for-trump-voting-against-their-own-interests-letter.html).
1.2.4.3. Con: People should have the right to vote for what they perceive to be in their interest, regardless of whether it is actually in their best interests.
1.2.4.4. Con: Interests are self-defined and thus correspond with individual voting behaviour.
1.2.4.5. Pro: Many working-class people [vote against their economic interests.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/books/review/the-system-robert-reich-break-em-up-zephyr-teachout.html)
1.2.4.6. Pro: [Resentment](https://vocal.media/theSwamp/why-do-people-vote-against-their-own-interests) can be a driving factor in people voting against their interests.
1.2.5. Con: Not all groups whose [interests](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#6) are impacted by political class are allowed to participate in elections. Non-citizens, for instance, are not allowed to vote even though they are an interest group.
1.2.6. Pro: Younger generations are not affected as much by things like retirement policy. Elderly people are a constituency with unique interests.
1.2.6.1. Con: Many groups have interests that are specific to members of that group.
1.2.7. Pro: Political parties are less likely to represent the interests of the elderly if the elderly do not make up a part of the electorate.
1.2.7.1. Con: Most non-elderly people hold the view that the [state should support the elderly](http://www.cssr.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/256/Publications/WP436Seekings.pdf) through pension and care. There does not seem to be a need for the right to vote to put such welfare systems in place. \(pg. 9\)
1.2.7.2. Pro: If the elderly are not allowed to vote, political parties are less likely to campaign on policy issues that affect the elderly as they would have no say in who is elected and who is not.
1.2.8. Con: There are non-electoral processes and mechanisms through which the needs of the elderly are [represented in policy making](https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/57/11/M705/625761).
1.3. Pro: Political views and opinions of the elderly are not relevant to contemporary times and therefore they should not be given a political choice.
1.3.1. Con: Witnessing decades of changes in governmental power, the elder have the wisdom to make an well-informed decision.
1.3.1.1. Con: Past performance is not indicative of future results.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The elderly have a wealth of [life experience](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/older-peoples-views-and-experiences-resources-later-life), which plays an important role in making important decisions.
1.3.1.3. Con: It is not required to directly experience a historical event in order to learn from it.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The elderly may be better able to predict certain societal outcomes dependent on who is in power, based on their experience.
1.3.1.5. Con: Having wisdom does not mean it will be used wisely. The elderly may do what is within their best interest, instead of looking at the needs of the nation as a whole.
1.3.2. Pro: The elderly are often stubbornly loyal to a political party.
1.3.2.1. Con: Partisan loyalty is not a feature of only the elderly. [Young voters](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/23/only-a-quarter-of-older-people-would-consider-voting-labour-poll-shows) also tend to be loyal to a particular party.
1.3.2.2. Con: Older people have seen the politics for longer time, therefore they have more knowledge about the candidates and parties.
1.3.2.3. Con: The elderly in the US have [shifted their voting preference](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/09/28/biden-older-voters-trump-advantage/) from the Republican party to Democratic. This shows that they do not have stubborn partisan loyalty.
1.3.2.4. Pro: The elderly seem to prefer [conservative](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/mr-personality/201410/why-are-older-people-more-conservative) parties and policies.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: The elderly, in the UK, are more overwhelmingly less likely to vote for the [Labour party](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/23/only-a-quarter-of-older-people-would-consider-voting-labour-poll-shows).
1.3.2.4.2. Con: The elderly of our times prefer conservative parties not due to their age but because certain [political events](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/08/upshot/how-the-year-you-were-born-influences-your-politics.html) were prominent during their youth. This suggests that our experience shapes our political preferences more than age.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Once formed, people's personalities tend to remain stable throughout their lives. Aging does not significantly impact [personality](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/1/12051622/brexit-vote-age-gap-aging-science-psychology).
1.3.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Age plays an important role in the construction of one's [social identity](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/).
1.3.2.4.2.2. Pro: Several studies in the US have shown that those who are currently the elderly formed their political preferences during younger days.
1.3.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/cohort_voting_20140605.pdf) in the US showed the political preferences of those currently old were formed during their younger days. This has been especially true for those who identify as New Deal Democrats, Eisenhower Republicans, Baby Boomer, and Reagan Conservatives.
1.3.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: A [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/21/jfk-torch-bearers-now-vote-more-republican/) showed that Americans who were in their teens during Truman and Eisenhower eras are now more likely to identify as Republicans.
1.3.2.4.2.2.3. Pro: A [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/21/jfk-torch-bearers-now-vote-more-republican/) those who came of age during the Bill Clinton era are more likely to vote Democratic and those who did not.
1.3.2.4.3. Con: And youth seem to [prefer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/17/next-generation-voters-are-more-liberal-more-inclusive-believe-government/) liberal policies, which proves nothing about which is better.
1.3.2.4.4. Pro: Older people are more likely to hold views [against financial reforms](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/71/1/115/1589476) than younger people.
1.3.2.4.4.1. Con: [Fiscal conservatism](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/spain-covid-deaths-nursing-homes-madrid) can hurt the well-being of the elderly when it constricts medical spending. It is unlikely that the elderly will continue to support such measures for long.
1.3.2.4.5. Pro: The elderly are less likely to support [policies concerning the protection of the environment](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/22/every-generation-votes-in-their-own-interest-but-in-an-ageing-world-thats-a-problem/) and the use of sustainable energy.
1.3.2.4.6. Con: Our [political identities](https://www.thecut.co/2017/04/what-shapes-your-political-beliefs-at-18-35-and-50.html) are formed through a complex interaction of several factors, including social traits, genes, and social position, and cannot reliably be reduced to a single factor such as age.
1.3.2.4.7. Pro: In the UK, the elderly are more likely to hold [socially conservative views](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/generation-wars-over-brexit/) associated with nationalism, Euroscepticism, and immigration.
1.3.2.4.8. Con: Conservative policies and parties are still relevant to contemporary times.
1.3.2.4.8.1. Pro: Many of the [current ruling parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ruling_political_parties_by_country) across the world espouse conservative ideologies.
1.3.2.5. Con: The elderly know their own ideology and which party supports it more closely. Voting for that party is not a blind process, limited attention to policy details notwithstanding. Indeed, most voters vote this way regardless. A policy awareness test would dramatically reduce voting eligibility
1.3.2.6. Con: Changing the rules will invite efforts to game the system.
1.3.2.7. Pro: In [Tanzania](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17531055.2017.1410759), the elderly are less likely to look beyond the incumbent party while younger voters are more inclined towards the opposition parties.
1.3.3. Con: There are no defined sets of opinions relevant to contemporary times as individuals [hold a variety of viewpoints.](https://www.futurity.org/political-polarization-parties-united-states-2260412-2/)
1.3.3.1. Pro: The views of an individual can change across the course of their lives. Therefore it is plausible that many elderly people have adopted views that are modern and relevant to contemporary times.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Older people are [less likely to change their views](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-08-17/survey-14-percent-of-adults-have-changed-their-mind-because-of-social-media).
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: [Surveys](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45098550) concerning a hypothetical second referendum on Brexit should the elderly have changed their views on political ideas such as Brexit.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: [Views are often based on emotions and group membership](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_is_it_so_hard_to_change_peoples_minds). This means that it can be difficult to use reason in order to change someone's mind. Thus, the views of the elderly may not change in accordance with the general perspectives of contemporary society.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: The argument, that one's views are based on emotion and group affiliation with resulting resistance to change, is one which applies equally to people of all ages, not just the elderly.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: [14% in the US](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/15/14-of-americans-have-changed-their-mind-about-an-issue-because-of-something-they-saw-on-social-media/) say that they have changed their view on an issue due to social media.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: Older adults are [increasingly active on social media.](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2017/52/social-media-on-the-rise-among-seniors)
1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: When considering social media use amongst different age groups in the United States, adults over the age of 65 are the [least active on social networks.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/471370/us-adults-who-use-social-networks-age/)
1.3.3.2. Pro: Diverging voting behaviour between individuals shows that people hold different viewpoints.
1.3.4. Con: The elderly are still a part of modern society. Being older does not automatically mean that they hold views that are outdated.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The elderly do not make voting decisions as a [monolithic group](https://watermark.silverchair.com/18.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAq0wggKpBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKaMIIClgIBADCCAo8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM5AWIZ3PzpzcVJze4AgEQgIICYKI69IyS9RO5NIXj0ypuGN8wrN2ktOo-AHnqhio7Lt0NtGOjb92ykkApP3cVZodKTvpMgRpAKQMyexoJ0NxOHrO8bYYepAP-IvngNr1qVQxfBB4otIJACgZku7-GWlw52IVGvWIFdgfSm56dq8CbREyC-M7lCeBQ1O0FhIZsr6m66e4oGPOkqPY-B9clRnu2qFp43RdU5orJ4cMVdtwdJmfWVk2YkgBmGmgHBDr0p1iN041WTuUjfbwgnTAsH-Sqz9d1rwzBq9IcmoxUB3ahmRauA5jxh_NfdHfnmQpnxNgP3Teiz3xY0clFFSq1C3RD_OzudANfsFqrZt1yjBLZgXVwgS6RjpV0UfVNerdOb4ZzOVKAepK37vcs-F-Frz4NUsL39ZBX5NuC5mLVc01TsyMZ3ztZTC1g8YV7uyZ_L04TNb_2UJBzoIIWZmMR0IsZ8UZKuak1Kr4kTVyF94NSBWBUiTnSpgz-YTJGcFIUgzMt7-4QNXkfWwB8fGvRAV9i6h0_NP7HGSYgdbedw--J7i8vhhmIZKgGqkkRCwhiE6zdms5f3ShllLVWAtXCLcllLSC8xmFwVe18jslrRjy-8Rf35jUsCkYgvLz4TOrnA_qB2TYddO0qeM7rWRGyo9aLw9DTksoghoiIdFIBFGhAs6uLdO3YPmeE8ui9QpDXpbepUJ5syEZn5AvcU18XI5YFnTOdJDuO5y4o0O7wTcIkaOdFPSsETdXTRH21rzKZFZ-UE4N8M42qUmwlTc4NL6y5SX7FXZj91wpil5bgZD0QgC5FJZPruS5FhRI2xbKKgACF). Like members of other social groups, the voting behavior of individuals within that group tends to vary.
1.3.4.2. Pro: It is [ageist](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190521124530.htm), and therefore unethical, to hold the view that the elderly lack knowledge or relevance.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Many elderly people spend a lot of time watching or listening to the [news](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/01/heres-who-gets-news-from-tv-the-elderly-pew-finds-again/) and keeping up with current events.
1.3.4.4. Con: Whether or not someone is part of modern society should be determined on the basis of whether or not they hold views that align with the values of modern society.
1.3.4.5. Pro: In 2030, baby boomers are projected to [outnumber](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-41-population-projections.html) children for the first time in US history. Their needs are thus an important part of modern society, and growing.
1.3.4.6. Con: Even if the elderly are a part of society today, many of their experiences are from an earlier era.
1.3.5. Pro: The elderly are most likely to hold [prejudiced beliefs](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-older-people-racist-2018-7) that many would consider outdated in contemporary times.
1.3.5.1. Pro: People become stuck with certain views as they grow older and are less open to change, while norms and values of societies are always fluid and progressing. This makes the perspective of elders incompatible with the progression of society.
1.3.5.2. Con: Those who have morally dubious views should still be allowed to vote.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Preventing people from participating in social and political life is likely to make them feel alienated and unlikely to change their views.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: Having contradictory views does not entail that one should lose the right to vote. Voting is a legitimate way for citizens to voice their views on society.
1.3.5.2.3. Pro: People should be allowed to use their personal bias, whether justified or not, to inform their voting decision.
1.3.5.3. Pro: The elderly are more likely to hold nationalistic [and xenophobic views](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-the-darkness/201806/the-politics-ageing).
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: People holding xenophobic views are more vulnerable to votes based on [fear of the other](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-the-darkness/201806/the-politics-ageing).
1.3.5.4. Con: Even if it is true that the elderly today hold prejudiced beliefs, it does not follow that the elderly in the future will also these beliefs.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: A [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240707200508?ssource=mfr&rss=1) conducted in the US showed that the elderly today held less prejudiced beliefs than the elders of the previous generation.
1.3.5.5. Pro: A [survey in the UK](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39147/bsa34_moral_issues_final.pdf) showed that the elderly were far less tolerant towards same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights than the young.
1.4. Con: Older generations have been granted the democratic right to vote. They should not lose that right because of age.
1.4.1. Pro: Voting is a way of exercising one's [right to free speech](https://ylpr.yale.edu/voting-speech). Revoking the right to vote is an infringement upon free speech.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Voting is an important way for citizens to [express their opinions](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/right/article-3-of-the-first-protocol-right-to-free-elections/) concerning institutions and policies that govern their lives.
1.4.1.2. Con: Voting is not an example of [legally protected speech](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/is-voting-speech/).
1.4.2. Con: The right to vote is not absolute.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If the elderly are unable to make an adequately informed decision as a voter because of their age, they should not be granted that privilege.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Restricting votes of social groups, like women, was justified on the grounds that they could not make informed decisions. Judgments concerning the voting decisions of the elderly are similarly problematic.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: A blanket denial of voting privilege for the elderly, without regard to individual circumstances, is a grave [breach of the right to vote](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/right/article-3-of-the-first-protocol-right-to-free-elections/) and is not legally sustainable.
1.4.2.2. Pro: In many places, [certain conditions](https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote) must be met for an individual to be afforded the privilege to vote.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Just because voting requires certain conditions to be met, it doesn’t mean that any restriction is allowed. The [restrictions must be proportionate](https://www.bihr.org.uk/blog/right-to-vote) and on reasonable grounds.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: It is difficult to determine a cut-off age after which people lose voting rights in a way that is not arbitrary and is reasonable.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Most countries set the [minimum age](https://rm.coe.int/doc/090000168071a5ed) of voting to 18, which is also arbitrary and doesn't correspond to any real shift.
1.4.2.3. Con: Voting is an [inalienable right](https://www.wuft.org/news/2020/10/30/its-your-inalienable-right-gainesvilles-homeless-population-encouraged-to-vote/) that cannot be taken away by any government.
1.4.2.4. Con: Even if voting rights are not absolute, they are important to the [preservation of human rights](https://www.bihr.org.uk/blog/right-to-vote) and freedoms which are considered absolute.
1.4.2.5. Con: The right to participate in free and fair elections is critical for a country to maintain its status as a democracy.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Voting [allows citizens to choose their representatives](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/lesson-plans/Intermediate_RightsandResponsibilities_handouts.pdf). This is a critical component of a democracy.
1.4.3. Pro: Society considers all conscious adult citizens as equals. The elderly are adult human beings, who are capable of making conscious and informed decisions, and should thus not be considered less equal to other adult citizens.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The proportion of the elderly is increasing within the [population of most countries](https://www.imf.org/external/np/g20/pdf/2019/060519a.pdf). Withdrawing their right to vote would disenfranchise an increasingly large percentage of the citizenry.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: As equal citizens in a democracy, the elderly also have a [duty to vote](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2) and to participate in the creation of good government. The state should not interfere in them being able to fulfill this duty.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Removing their right to vote would also remove their duty to do it.
1.4.4. Pro: Increased participation of the elderly in elections plays a critical role in sustaining [local democratic institutions](https://www.democraticaudit.com/2013/11/17/older-people-are-the-key-to-sustaining-local-democracy/).
1.4.5. Con: The fact that elderly are allowed to vote shows the flaws of democracy, as they often represent a large group of the population but are not the group who still works and pays taxes.
1.4.5.1. Con: The job of Government is supposed to be to represent the interests of everyone in the society, not just the ones capitalism deems most valuable.
1.4.5.2. Con: Older people, by virtue of age, have contributed to the government system the longest \(taxes etc.\). They have therefore earnt the right to vote to a greater degree than younger people.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: The right to vote should not be dependent on the relative contribution made by any individual to society.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: If the right to vote were dependent on the relative contribution made by any individual to society, it would follow that all people from lower socio-economic backgrounds have less of a right to vote than wealthy individuals.
1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: The right to vote should be afforded to all individuals by virtue of that individual possessing citizenship.
1.4.5.2.1.2.1. Con: This assumes that all citizens are equal by virtue only of having citizenship. Most citizens are born as citizens, therefore there condition of citizenship has no bearing on their merit as a good citizen.
1.4.5.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: A citizen that contributes to society and meets all obligations asked of a citizen \(voting, jury duty, adhering to laws etc.\) is more deserving of the privileges granted a citizen, such as voting.
1.4.5.2.1.3. Con: It is not the relative size/length of contribution which is important, but the commitment to society that is represented/demonstrated by those contributions, which is the important consideration.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: Even if an individual is older than another, this does not guarantee that they have contributed more in taxes.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: If the younger individual has a much larger income relative to the older person, it is possible they have made [more contributions in tax.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/income-tax/half-income-tax-paid-top-five-per-cent/)
1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: Living for longer does necessitate greater economic productivity.
1.4.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: It is plausible that among two people, the older one has contributed less to the economy because they were not able to be productive due to a health condition. Age, therefore, doesn't necessarily entail greater contribution.
1.4.5.2.2.3. Con: This misconstrues contributing longer with contributing more. It is the commitment to contributing to society over a long period of time which is important, as opposed to the absolute magnitude of that contribution.
1.4.5.3. Pro: The average retirement age in the US is [64 years of age.](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/average-retirement-age/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=282de21e92a5b3a5292ad7c091891b50ab704f7a-1606077648-0-Ad4seGNDK7Whe0yolAkLKm8EWtdRCOGq7ZSa5Hi3wvt2qZ_3bLnIwOey4SZaHXfWDFweaC28o89H1Ls4MZyB-me2rfP8B9J90_k9yn_Ejkq82SQBSJUL_i4YFlHvaLjT1G796k_s5n79R9OcWWigJfmiJBbNO-OolyK2CB9tjmujWJEFvdmPvwhmkT45LNHp4nIrYHslBp9tjJhuh9XjllNbCC89YZC4T8rv5fzL_dMwf3ruLFXGwoXY33k4-Rx6cr5Hl_NgQLHhOz8SAXiMelksxWecB5pCiaj8dxUGP04EGkQdwXcc5Ez6hWduknsloOoCA8zKFfmjTjM2PpEVO0z6dfuR62CFVn2hcIDiciK3aWUWFlKigKBnZdEMu1P3h3pOZ4KPyCE827jnVfetE5dx8-NGT_6T0wabRjXmzT3M)
1.4.5.4. Con: The solution to flawed voting systems is to introduce more representative voting systems, not to prevent a group from voting.
1.5. Pro: Older people are more likely to suffer from cognitive issues which may affect their ability to cast an informed vote.
1.5.1. Pro: Older people are [more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190708135940.htm) than younger people. This can negatively impact their decision-making.
1.5.1.1. Con: Not all older people suffer from Alzheimer disease.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Only around [10% of people aged 65 or older](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures) have Alzheimer's.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: It may not always be clear who suffers from afflictions such as Alzheimer or a generally deteriorating memory.
1.5.1.2. Con: Being more likely than other groups to suffer from Alzheimer's disease does not mean it will impact the decision-making behavior of the elderly.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: [Dementia](https://www.alzheimersonline.org/page/about-us/whats-on/blog/how-does-dementia-affect-long-term-memory/) experienced with Alzheimer's can affect episodic, semantic, or procedural memories. The loss of these memories may or may not influence political decisions.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: A diagnosis of Alzheimer's [does not automatically entail that a person does not have the capacity](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/policy-and-influencing/what-we-think/decision-making) to make decisions.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Alzheimer's can negatively impact the ability to make a decision because it can [affect parts of the brain involved in remembering, understanding, and processing information](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/policy-and-influencing/what-we-think/decision-making).
1.5.1.4. Con: Even if older people are more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease, according to the Mental Capacity Act, it [must be assumed that a person has decision-making capacity, until proved otherwise.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/)
1.5.2. Pro: Society prevents people under the age of 18 from voting because their cognitive abilities aren't sufficient to make informed decisions. As the cognitive abilities of people decline as they age, they should also be excluded from the voting process.
1.5.2.1. Con: The limitation is not that of lack of cognitive ability-individuals with mental health problems and those mentally challenged still have the right to vote, so this is not the case. The reasoning is that of a lack of maturity and \(in general\) those under the age of 18 lack the political know-how and maturity to make an informed decision about their political opinions.
1.5.2.2. Con: Even if the reason why under 18's are not allowed to vote currently is due to their cognitive abilities, this does not mean that should be the case.
1.5.3. Con: Even if elderly people are more likely to suffer from cognitive issues, they should still be allowed to vote.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Young people also [suffer from cognitive issues.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016517/) Thus, the metric to determine whether one can vote, should be cognitive ability, and not age.
1.5.3.2. Pro: It is difficult to create a consistent metric for precisely when one is sufficiently informed to cast a legitimate vote.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: It is likely to be difficult to measure how informed someone is.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: An individual may be more informed in some areas of politics, compared to other areas of politics.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Depending on the specific presentation of their cognitive issues, it may not effect their ability to vote wisely.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: For some elderly, cognitive issues may present as [minor memory loss](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/do-memory-problems-always-mean-alzheimers-disease) and for specific memories. This may not impair their voting ability.
1.5.3.4. Pro: Like with physical disabilities, the state has a duty to make elections [accessible](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/changing-electoral-law/accessibility-elections) for voters with mental disabilities.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: [Voting participation](https://legalresearch.blogs.bris.ac.uk/2019/11/mental-disability-and-voting-rights-bridging-the-knowledge-and-uptake-gap/comment-page-1/) among the mentally disabled is poor and the state should improve this by making it easier for this group to vote.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Mental incapacity to vote should not entail [legal incapacity](https://legalresearch.blogs.bris.ac.uk/2019/11/mental-disability-and-voting-rights-bridging-the-knowledge-and-uptake-gap/comment-page-1/) to vote.
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: The legal right to vote should not be based on mental or physical capacity, but on the egalitarian idea of every citizen having an equal right to vote.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: If an individual is deemed as lacking the mental capacity to make sound and competent decisions regarding their own circumstances, they are likewise not capable of making sound and competent voting decisions influencing the circumstances of their nation.
1.5.4. Pro: The elderly constitute the majority of people with [dementia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30520403/), a condition that diminishes one's agency to make life decisions.
1.5.4.1. Con: Not all suffering from [dementia](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=bioethics_papers) are incapacitated in their ability to vote.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Many older people suffering from dementia are [unfairly denied a right to vote](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=bioethics_papers) because they are incorrectly assessed as being incapable of making political decisions.
1.5.4.2. Pro: [Decision making](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2501805/) among the elderly with dementia are influenced by several factors, including the family's wishes, and the care available.
1.5.4.3. Con: [Only 5-8%](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia) of those aged above 60 years old suffer from dementia.
1.5.4.4. Con: If we are to disenfranchise people based upon mental ability, restricting it to one group is prejudicial to their interests still. That is, we say seniors with an IQ \< 80 cannot vote, but youth can.
1.5.4.5. Con: In many [countries](https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/57/11/M705/625761), the incidence and prevalence of dementia among the elderly have fallen over the past decades.
1.5.4.5.1. Con: Even if the proportion of the elderly with dementia is decreasing, the [absolute number of older people](https://www.thelancet.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=e_1_5_1_2_7_2&dbid=16&doi=10.1016/S2468-2667\(18\)30118-X&key=10.1093%2Fageing%2Fafx201&cf=) with dementia and ensuing complex care needs is likely to rise.
1.5.5. Con: People who are severely incapacitated to make decisions are anyway [excluded from the voting](https://www.anthonygold.co.uk/latest/blog/do-you-need-mental-capacity-to-vote/) process because it is not allowed for their caretakers to vote for them.
1.5.5.1. Pro: In the US, the [registration](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/208220822.pdf) into the ballot is rejected if there is a doubt that a guardian will inform someone's decision during the vote. \(pg. 3\)
1.5.6. Con: The elderly who suffer from cognitive issues, often require assistance from caregivers who help them make important decisions. The caregivers should also be allowed to make voting decisions in cases where the elderly do not have the rational capacity to do so.
1.5.6.1. Con: Even if a caregiver has the rationality to cast an informed vote, this does not mean that they will be able to adequately represent the interest of another individual.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: A caregiver can use the knowledge they have about the person they care for to make reasonable assumptions about which way they would want to vote.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Legally, [one person has only one vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man,_one_vote). Considering the caregiver's influence upon deciding the vote for the person they vote for, there should not be legally allowed to do so.
1.5.6.1.2.1. Con: In theory, the caregiver would still only have one vote. The vote they make on behalf of another person would be a vote that represents the interest of that person, not those of the caregiver.
1.5.6.2. Con: Only a [small proportion](http://www.cpa.org.uk/cpa/policies_on_ageing.html) of the elderly population are care-dependent.
1.5.7. Pro: People [under the age of 18](https://saratogafalcon.org/content/voting-age-should-not-be-lowered) are usually not allowed to vote because there are concerns about whether their voting choices would be independent and informed.
1.5.8. Con: The elderly are more vulnerable to [misinformation](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-08-07/fake-news-older-people-social-media), making it likely that their political choices are based on false information or propaganda.
1.5.8.1. Con: [Low information voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_information_voter) are not necessarily the elderly, but people of any age who follow media portrayals of candidates as their main source of info than doing deeper research from many sources.
1.5.8.2. Pro: Older people are more likely to [share fake news online](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-01-09/study-older-people-are-more-susceptible-to-fake-news-more-likely-to-share-it) that impacts their electoral decisions.
1.5.8.2.1. Pro: There are anecdotes suggesting that Trump-related fake news impacted some [people's decision to vote against Hilary Clinton](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-01-09/study-older-people-are-more-susceptible-to-fake-news-more-likely-to-share-it).
1.5.8.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18174631/old-people-fake-news-facebook-share-nyu-princeton) found that people over the age of 65 share fake news the most.
1.5.8.2.3. Con: Even if it is true that older people share more fake news, their [social media usage](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18176162/fake-news-old-people-nyu-study-silver-lining) is less. This suggests that it might not significantly impact elections.
1.5.8.2.4. Pro: Misinformation is one of the key ways [foreign governments interfere](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/808275155/how-russia-and-other-foreign-actors-sow-disinformation-in-elections) in the elections of a country. This undermines the sovereignty of a country.
1.5.8.3. Con: Governments should curb misinformation by educating the elderly and not by disenfranchising them.
1.5.8.3.1. Pro: There is evidence that [educational programs](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/26/809224742/with-an-election-on-the-horizon-older-adults-get-help-spotting-fake-news) that aim to help older voters identify misinformation over social media are effective.
1.6. Con: Taking away the vote from the elderly would further stigmatize them.
1.6.1. Con: Putting an upper age limit on voting wouldn't further stigmatize the elderly since there are many activities, such as driving, that they cannot participate in as they get older. Voting could be one such activity.
1.6.2. Con: Hurting the feelings of a small group of people is moral, if it produces a positive outcome for the vast majority of people.
1.6.2.1. Pro: According to Bentham, the moral quality of an action is determined by its impact on human happiness. Thus one should aim toward [the greatest happiness for the greatest number.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-010-9204-z)
1.6.2.2. Pro: People are able to implement [strategies to regulate their emotions](http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/what-is-emotion-regulationsinfo-brief.pdf). Therefore, even if the feelings of a group are hurt, they are likely to be able to cope with this.
1.6.2.3. Con: Taking away the vote from the elderly does not guarantee a positive outcome for the majority in society.
1.6.2.4. Con: If the [elderly vote against progressive causes](https://time.com/4457131/why-older-people-shouldnt-vote-and-other-ideas-unpopular-with-my-parents/), taking away their right to vote will produce a positive outcome for the majority of people.
1.6.3. Pro: There is much [stigma surrounding aging and frailty](https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/01/frail-older-people-social-care-nhs-resources-stigma).
1.6.4. Pro: People hold ageist views towards the elderly for their political choices. In the UK, for instance, some people hold harmful views towards [older voters](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/886323/Brexit-news-baby-boomer-generation-remainer-abuse-european-union-vote-leave) who chose Brexit.
1.6.4.1. Pro: A UN expert of human rights made a public statement expressing concern regarding how old people were being wrongly deplored for their support for [Brexit](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20241).
1.6.4.2. Con: People hold hateful views towards those from many different demographics. Thus, the argument is not sufficiently specific to explain why the elderly should be protected.
1.6.5. Con: Just as the elderly should lose their right to drive cars if they're no longer able to drive competently, they should lose their right to vote if they're no longer able to make a competent decision as a voter, regardless of how this makes them feel.
1.6.5.1. Con: It is difficult to measure "competent" voting decisions because most voting decisions are moral questions, and also there could be bias from the one measuring.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Voting decisions impact the lives of many, and therefore it is okay to constrain individual right to vote for the greater good of society. This is the same as constraining someone's right to drive for public safety.
1.6.5.3. Con: If the elderly were legally categorized as incompetent, whether this is accurate or not, it is likely that this will result in more people undermining elderly people at large.
1.7. Pro: Relative to the rest of the population, the elderly will not be impacted by the election for as long, due to their age.
1.7.1. Pro: The implications of political decisions can last for decades or generations. The elderly are likely to live with these implications for a relatively shorter duration than a younger voter.
1.7.1.1. Con: Although the elderly may not be impacted by the election for as long a period of time, the impact may be more severe in the short term.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Even if not for long, the elderly are critically impacted by elections. This is because they are especially [vulnerable](http://www.aecliving.com/importance-of-the-senior-vote/) to policy changes because of their greater dependence on government assistance.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html), for instance, overwhelmingly impacts the lives of the elderly. This entails that they have greater stakes in government policies that concern health.
1.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: An increasing proportion of the elderly is [self-employed](http://More older people becoming self-employed https://acnzonresearch.wordpress.com/2018/03/08/more-older-people-are-becoming-self-employed/), making them even more vulnerable to changes in economic policy.
1.7.1.1.1.3. Pro: [The elderly tend to suffer more from health conditions](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/05/09/527453473/old-people-get-very-little-health-care-in-the-developing-world). Thus, they are generally more dependent on government healthcare provisions.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: [Retired employees](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/aging/articles/why-older-citizens-are-more-likely-to-vote), who are generally the elderly, are often dependent on government benefits for a living.
1.7.1.1.3. Pro: In [Korea](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east-asian-studies/article/is-class-voting-emergent-in-korea/F30D9B8BA1405E132E96C75F4F6E2651), the elderly predominantly constitute the economically weaker class and are therefore more severely impacted by the economic decisions of the government.
1.7.1.2. Pro: In order to increase the importance of interests of the young, people have suggested that the citizen's vote should be [weighted inversely to the age](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/younger-citizens-should-be-allowed-more-votes-than-those-over-60-20160706-gpzq69.html).
1.7.2. Pro: Voting is an act of engaging with stakes in the future of a country or region. The elderly, by nature, have little stakes in the future and therefore their participation is election is not justified.
1.7.2.1. Con: The elderly do not have any less stake because of their impending demise. People still have stakes in the future or future generations and make political choices accordingly.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Due to greater participation in the elections, the elderly have disproportionate power in [deciding governments](https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2020/older-adults-voting.html) in many countries.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Many [successful new parties](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1354068820966573) that were formed in the last few decades were successful because they appealed to the rights of the elderly.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: Greater power for the elderly is justified as they make up a larger portion of the electorate.
1.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: If the elderly do tend to vote in larger numbers than other social groups, this does not translate to disproportionate power because other people are able to choose to vote.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1. Con: One reason why the elderly vote more is because it is [easier for them](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/aging/articles/why-older-citizens-are-more-likely-to-vote). Most elderly do not relocate often and do not need to register each time they move. This is unfair to the young who need to relocate more frequently.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if it is harder for younger people to vote, the solution to this is to find ways to make it easier for younger people to vote.
1.7.2.2.2.2. Pro: In the US, as of 2020, [52% of registered voters are aged 50 or above](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/).
1.7.2.2.2.3. Pro: In the UK, political participation is [significantly higher](http://blogs.bath.ac.uk/iprblog/2019/05/21/the-rise-of-the-grey-vote/) in those aged 55 and above.
1.7.2.2.3. Con: The elderly do not all vote the same way. Thus, it is inaccurate to describe the elderly as a social group with disproportionate power.
1.7.2.3. Con: Many elderly people live for a significant period. Thus, although they may have less of a stake in the future, they do have a sufficient stake in it to vote.
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Life expectancy has [generally been increasing over time](https://qz.com/1632163/human-life-expectancy-keeps-increasing-but-how-far-can-it-go/).
1.7.3. Con: The elderly will be affected by the results of the election for as long as they live, which can be much longer than the political terms of office.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.3.1.
1.7.3.2. Pro: In most countries, there are [elections every four or five years.](https://qz.com/291933/why-the-us-is-the-only-country-in-the-world-to-have-elections-so-often/)
1.7.4. Con: The right to vote is not conditional on being impacted more by political decisions, relative to other social groups.
1.8. Con: Age has nothing to due with mental acuity.
1.8.1. Pro: Not all people who are elderly are cognitively deficient. Generalizations concerning a large group that can include people from ages 50 to 100 are unlikely to be a reliable basis on which important policy decisions should be made.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Given the differences in cognitive abilities of elder people at the same age it would be incredibly hard to establish a specific age after which they would not be allowed to vote anymore.
