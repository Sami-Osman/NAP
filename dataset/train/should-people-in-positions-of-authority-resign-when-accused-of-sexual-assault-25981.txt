Discussion Name: Should People in Positions of Authority Resign When Accused of Sexual Assault?

1. People in positions of authority should resign when accused of sexual assault.
1.1. Pro: Resigning would be perceived to be a noble act.
1.1.1. Pro: Resigning would constitute acknowledgement of wrongdoing in the face of a true accusation.
1.1.1.1. Con: Resigning could be viewed as an admission of guilt even if the accuser is innocent.
1.1.2. Con: Contrition on the part of people labeled as monsters is rarely rewarded.
1.1.2.1. Con: People who are \(or are labelled as\) monsters rarely offer true contrition.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Not every accused person should be contrite. 'People labelled as monsters' can still include innocents being falsely accused and in those cases, they have no obligation or reason to be contrite about their \(false\) accusation.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Either the assault did not happen, in which case the person has nothing to feel guilty for, or they did it, and if they did it probably didn't feel remorse while doing so, so would less likely care about it now.
1.1.3. Con: High positions in society should only be held by people who are above reproach.
1.1.3.1. Pro: That one may have committed sexual assault has substantial bearing on one's character.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: That one could be accused of something is immaterial to their character.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: People with poor character can make poor and self-serving decisions.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: People who have committed sexual assault will likely be biased against individuals who complain of sexual harassment and assault, or even of individuals of a particular gender altogether.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: This, in turn, negatively affects the image of the company, party, or campaign.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Those who are in a position of authority have influence over others through this position of authority. This creates an additional need for good behaviour to set an example for those they influence.
1.1.3.3. Con: Anyone in a position of power is a target for attempts to unseat them. False allegations are one method to target that person, and are unrelated to their actual behavior.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: People who make allegations targeting people in power are under more scrutiny and have to offer a convincing story / proof before the public actually believes them, precisely because people know and suspect that the accusation could just be a shot at the powerful person's reputation.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Regardless of the jeopardy involved, false accusations still [happen](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/3/another-kavanaugh-accuser-admits-fabricating-rape-/). Ideology is a powerful motivation when public figures are involved.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: The scrutiny that will come to bear on those people may take weeks or years to properly investigate the claim. The accused does not have weeks or years to decide to resign or not.
1.1.3.4. Con: No one is above reproach.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Even celebrities face completely [false](https://www.grunge.com/121077/celebrities-accused-crimes-never-committed/) allegations.
1.1.3.5. Con: The invasion of Iraq killed [hundreds of thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) of innocent people, and no-one responsible has been tried at the Hague \([yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbmarWHlKTQ&feature=youtu.be&t=67)\). It would be nice if high positions in society were only held by those who are above reproach, but that's not the standard they're really held to, and standards that are selectively applied are nothing more than a partisan weapon.
1.1.4. Pro: Regardless of whether a person committed sexual assault, they should resign because their accuser believes an assault was committed against them. Therefore the accuser is a victim.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The accused person may genuinely believe they did not commit an assault, but has an altered memory or interpretation of events during an assault that they actually did commit.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The accused may believe they did not commit assault due to being unaware of what constitutes assault.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The accused may be in denial.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: The accused may have been under the effects of drugs.
1.1.4.1.4. Pro: The accused may be suffering a psychological disorder that causes them to rationalize, be unaware of, or not understand the moral impact of a sexual assault.
1.1.4.2. Con: The accused cannot know what the accuser believes happened or not.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: There are people who falsely report assault for personal gain or as revenge for another offense. In this case, the accuser is not a victim nor do they believe they were assaulted, but they do know they would like to harm the target of their accusations.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Knowing the mind of an accuser isn't necessary to empathize with them.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: That empathy should not result in a life changing resignation for a false accusation.
1.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The accused can judge based on the conviction of their accusers whether the person really believes their expressions.
1.1.4.2.2.3. Con: Someone falsely accused is unlikely to sympathize with their accuser.
1.1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: One can still have compassion for an accuser's expressed distress while still being perturbed by the consequences of a false accusation.
1.1.4.2.2.3.1.1. Con: If that sympathy doesn't include taking the action of resigning, it isn't pertinent to the thesis.
1.1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: It is difficult to sympathize with a false and potentially life destroying false accuser - especially since their possible motivations may include a range of crimes.
1.1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Empathizing means, in part, to understand the emotions behind a person's actions. One can dislike the consequences of being accused of a crime they do not believe they committed while still understanding the position of the accuser.
1.1.4.3. Con: The accusing person may genuinely believe they were sexually assaulted, but actually has an altered memory or misinterpreted events in some manner, but no assault actually took place.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: The accuser may genuinely believe they were assaulted, but is mistaken due to "suggestion" or "false memories". \(Which is why claiming anyone involved has amnesia isn't useful.\)
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: The accuser may have been under the effect of drugs.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: The accuser may be in denial.
1.1.4.3.4. Pro: The accuser may believe they were assaulted because they don't understand what constitutes assault.
1.1.4.3.5. Pro: The accuser might be suffering from a [delusion](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/guide/delusional-disorder#1) or hallucination associated with several specific types of mental illness.
1.1.4.4. Con: The accused person isn't responsible for what the accuser believes.
1.1.4.5. Con: No one has an obligation to react against themselves simply because another person feels victimized.
1.2. Con: An accusation of sexual assault should be resolved through the justice system alone.
1.2.1. Con: An individual resigning from their position of authority does not replace any process involving the justice system.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The justice system would still be involved after the individual resigns, as they have still been accused of illegal conduct. Even where someone is accused in the workplace and in the legal system, resigning would not mean the accusation would be automatically resolved.
1.2.2. Pro: Everyone is entitled to fair judicial treatment.
1.2.2.1. Con: In many cases, the only evidence is the victims' report of what happened. Courts often don't consider that sufficient to proceed.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Victims in many areas, such as [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_kit#By_country), have access [rape test](https://www.rainn.org/articles/rape-kit) kits. They can be free and anonymous, lowering any reason for someone to not use one if they believe they've been raped.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Even just looking at the rape kit source provided, the test is horribly invasive, with external and internal examination. Someone whose body and right to sexual choice has been violated has plenty of reason to not make use of the test.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Thousands upon thousands of [rape kits have gone unprocessed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/16/untested-rape-kits-evidence-across-usa/29902199/). Knowing this, rape survivors are likely to have low confidence in the effectiveness of making use of a kit.
1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: Not all sexual assault is rape.
1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: Washing the victim and using a condom may prevent any DNA being found on the victim.
1.2.2.1.1.5. Con: Cleaning one's self, which may the first thing a victim would like to do, removes the evidence.
1.2.2.2. Con: The safety of vulnerable persons under a damaging authority needs to be prioritised in the first instance.
1.2.2.3. Con: The accused resigning would not prevent them from receiving judicial treatment in the justice system.
1.2.2.4. Con: Judges and justices \(other than as public commenters\) are not in play regarding whether individuals with authority should resign.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Judicial principles in some countries guarantee individuals the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Such principles relate to court room attitudes, and not public opinion.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Con: It is dangerous to put public opinion above the judicial system. Flawed as they can be, judicial systems are an attempt to regulate a society's collective morality in a durable form, less prone to short-lasting whims than the easily manipulated public opinion.
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: It is dangerous to assume all accusations are true, as it denies the accused the opportunity to defend themselves against possibly false allegations.
1.2.3. Con: The justice system has flaws, [especially](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-14/why-do-so-few-sexual-assault-result-in-convictions/10492256?fbclid=IwAR0KiiRKw7BdMBLlTv237V_tTb9s8VtDHfwBdHX4sIg4-HdCpSM0sS7eUk4) in sexual assault cases.
1.2.3.1. Con: This shows a need to improve the criminal justice system rather than introducing new policies which force people to resign when accused of sexual assault.
1.2.3.2. Pro: In a [2008 rape and assault case](https://www.bustle.com/p/9-infuriating-things-judges-have-said-when-ruling-on-sexual-assault-cases-54674), California Judge Derek Johnson said that if someone doesn't want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down. And that the body will not permit that to happen. Hence he decided that the victim in this case didn't put up a fight.
1.2.3.3. Pro: The [justice systems and judges](https://www.bustle.com/p/9-infuriating-things-judges-have-said-when-ruling-on-sexual-assault-cases-54674) around the world still need profound improvements in how they treat victims of rape and sexual assault.
1.3. Pro: Resigning may help the organization avoid the negative consequences of one of their authority figures being accused of sexual assault.
1.3.1. Pro: When people in key positions are accused they lose respect and their effectiveness decreases, therefore they are not capable of carrying out their function.
1.3.1.1. Con: Despite whatever reputation damage, [Justice Kavanaugh's powers as a Supreme Court Justice](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/courts/news/2019/08/05/473160/harassment-accountability-erosion-judicial-legitimacy/) are not diminished in any way.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Brett Kavanaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh_Supreme_Court_nomination) remains a working member of the SCOTUS \(Supreme Court of the United States\).
1.3.1.1.2. Con: After the Kavanaugh scandal, Democratic candidates wanted [the Supreme Court justice impeached](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/09/democratic-candidates-call-for-brett-kavanaugh-impeachment-after-latest-sexual-assault-allegations) over the allegation of sexual misconduct.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Because [sexual assault is a punishable crime](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Sexual-Assault.htm), if a person is accused of this, they will be seen as criminals.
1.3.2. Pro: A sexual assault allegation, whether it is verifiable or not, can bring into question the [integrity of the office, position or organization](https://worknest.com/blog/how-should-employers-respond-to-sexual-harassment-complaints/) and create a hostile environment.
1.3.2.1. Con: A sexual assault has already created a hostile environment for the victim. Organizations should have clear [protocol guidelines on how to act in case of sexual assault allegation](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/303675).
1.3.3. Con: It may be advantageous for the person to offer to take unpaid administrative leave, rather than resigning from their post, while an investigation into the claim is conducted.
1.3.3.1. Pro: This provides for a fair hearing.
1.3.3.2. Pro: This gives dignity to the claimant by taking action.
1.3.3.3. Pro: This recognizes the severity of the crime.
1.3.4. Pro: The organization could avoid invasive investigation.
1.3.4.1. Con: Public perception may move the opposite direction. If the accused resigns without an investigation, it may give the impression that the organisation is trying to cover something up, wash it aside instead of addressing systemic issues.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The [Catholic church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) is an example of this.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The main subject would be removed from the company, and thus investigation would focus on the individual in their own capacity, not in their capacity as an official of the organization.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: This does not follow in regards to a criminal investigation; if the abuse did not occur in the context of a workplace the company would not be under investigation.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: If the assault happens at work the investigation would pursue how it could have happened, what rules allowed the abuse to occur. The resignation of the accused would not protect the company from investigation or criticism.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: When a person as a position of authority they come representatives of an organizations.
1.3.5. Con: Resigning might mean validating a false allegation and unnecessarily defaming the company.
1.3.5.1. Con: False accusations are too infrequent to be a significant concern.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: False allegations of sexual violence are [no more common than rates of false reports of other crimes](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/false-sexual-violence-assault-rape-allegations-truth-rare-international-day-for-the-elimination-of-a8077876.html), such as false report of burglary.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: This conflates false and demonstrably false. In most cases we can't decide guilty or innocent due to lack of evidence. This is equally as illogical as claiming that every rape case that doesn't result in prosecution is false.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: They may not be as infrequent if they could be used as an almost risk free way of getting someone fired.
1.3.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: Only 5%-33% of real rapes are reported. Of all rape accusations, [about 5%](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rape-allegations-fabricated/) are false.
1.3.5.1.3.1. Con: This claim dramaticaly overstates the case made by the sources. The sources argue that we can say with confidence that 5% are fabricated. It doesn't argue that only 5% are false, and that 95% are probably true.
1.3.5.1.3.2. Con: Such a consideration is tantamount to the argument "Since sexual assault is only [5% of all violent crime](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf), other forms of violence are far more important." Sexual assault is important, however, just as false reports of rape are important.
1.3.5.1.3.3. Pro: In comparison, the number of estimated real rapes among the reported rapes further diminishes the prominence of falsely reported rape.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1. Con: The above claim is illogical as it attempts to say that real instances of rape have a correlation with instances of fraudulent claims. There is no connection, and this has been pointed out [before](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/09/the-truth-about-a-viral-graphic-on-rape-statistics/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.6a2bbfc3c9a9).
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Both "real instances of rape" and "instances of fraudulent claims" could be said to be of category type, "hazard to society", or, put simply, "Problem" as a subcategory labeled "sexual assault". The above claim asserts that the "Problem", "Actual Rape", represents a much larger hazard to a much larger subset of society than does "Fraudulent Claims". The implied conclusion is that any social changes proposed should consider the relatively "negligible" size of one problem to the other.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Using the size of a problem to propose and enforce a new injustice does not make society better. You can't replace one injustice with another, no matter how much better the numbers are.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Due process should not be discarded for a utilitarian calculus that privileges the claimant.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Utilitarian solutions focus on consequences based on the principle, "Greatest good for the greatest numbers". This can result in the sacrifice of basic principles, like justice, sovereignty of the individual, or equality, for the sake of perceived benefit to a majority. The moral principles upon which democratic liberal societies are based should not be compromised in a numbers game. This would include the idea of "due process".
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Utilitarianism seeks the greatest good for the greatest number \( Bentham, Mills \). By definition then, minorities may not gain from a utilitarian equation. If rape were a small problem, instead of the large problem it is today, by the lights of a utilitarian, it may not warrant attention. This may, in fact, be a contributing factor in what is already happening -- HR departments dismissing claims due to low reporting and not wanting to confront the issue.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.2. Con: There is a taxonomic class labeled "Problems in society". A subclass labeled "Sexual Assault" further subdivided into classes: "rape" and "false claims" \( though you could put "false claims" under a subclass called "Reports of"\). If one were to count the instantiations of classes "rape" and "false claims" one finds their relative sizes massively skewed towards "rape".
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: This is another false claim. Actual rape is a violent crime. False accusations are a type of non-violent crime that includes perjury, fraud, libel and perversion of justice.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.3. Con: Decisions about the problems related to sexual assault must consider the relative sizes of all associated issues and prioritize which ones to give the most attention to keeping in mind that perfect solutions likely do not exist. What are some problems associated with the topic "sexual assault"? There are 2 compared in the grandparent claim: False claims, rape.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: We should privilege the problem of "actual rape" over the "negligible" problem of "false claims" as "actual rape" represents a much larger problem in society. In practice this might mean making reporting easier *not harder*. We might also offer *more* trust to claimants and less energy worrying about the plight of the rare victim of a "false claim".
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Actual rape has no more privilege to "acceptable" rates of false accusation than any other crime. And treating it like it does will only increase the use of false accusation as a weapon.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.
1.3.5.1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: Considering that all reported and unreported sexual assault is only [5% of all violent crime](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf), the philosophy of the above claim is that sexual assault should be the lowest priority of all violence, and should be ignored until robbery, murder and domestic abuse are under control.
1.3.5.1.3.4. Pro: Being raped may be more harmful than a false rape accusation. That, along with real rapes being 60-400x more likely than a false rape accusation, real rapes are far more of a concern than false rape accusations.
1.3.5.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.3.1.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2. Con: A false accusation of sexual assault can lead to an [average sentence of 5.4 years prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Punishment) \(with all the dangers of sexual assault in prison\) and permanent status as a registered sex offender and felon. This is arguably worse than being raped, since it contains the strong possibility of sexual assault against the accused along with all the other legal and social penalties.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.1. Con: If we can assume severity of victimization can be quantified, actual rape is not "worse" than the hypothetical chance of being sexually assaulted.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.2. Con: Prison inmates in the US have a [a similar occurrence](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) of sexually assault as the general population \(overall, about 1 in 28 sexual violence victims in prisons every year compared to 1 in 33 men raped overall\).
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3. Con: Those who experience completed rape are also innocent victims who undergo social penalties, legal proceedings and procedures \(testifying, prepping, rape kits, sworn statements, lineups\) which can occur over long periods, [are more likely to be victimized again](https://www.girlsglobe.org/2015/08/04/the-repetition-compulsion-why-rape-victims-are-more-likely-to-be-assaulted-again/), and have a heightened likelihood to experience various types of severe psychological distress. Being falsely accused of rape and sentenced is still not worse than what rape victims undergo.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: People falsely accused of rape also undergo social penalties, much much more severe than someone who has been raped, the same amount of legal proceedings, and no doubt undergo a great deal of psychological distress. Rape victims may well experience more suffering than the falsely accused, but this is a poor argument for that notion.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Sometimes when people are actually rapists, they may only serve a few years in prison and are not placed on sexual offender lists; they are not raped in prison; they have bonds and lawyers to keep them from enduring extended legal proceedings. Perhaps the worst case scenario one could encounter from being falsely accused of rape is terrible, but the legal system and society doesn't always deal with people the same way. On the other hand, all rape victims suffer terribly due to their attack.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Pointing out that not all false accusations are the as bad as the worst case scenario isn't a sufficient counterargument.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: "Rape isn't as bad as being falsely accused of rape. Sometimes when somebody has actually been raped, they have no recollection of it whatsoever. On the other hand, everyone who has been falsely sentenced to jail time is going to suffer terribly due to their predicament." The parent is little more convincing than this.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Not all those who are sentenced to jail time suffer terribly. Some may have their sentences differed, or serve in low security prisons. Everyone who is raped "and knows about it" suffers as a consequence, as the crime is defined by its unpleasant physical and psychological violation of human autonomy.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: That someone doesn't remember their rape doesn't suggest they don't carry severe baggage from a number of factors in association with the event.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: One must consider a weighted average of all outcomes. Demonstrating that the least bad rape is worse than the least bad false rape conviction isn't sufficient.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.4. Con: The claim makes the penalty for being found guilty of sexual assault purely hypothetical. With a likelihood of incarceration if found guilty, it is not.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.5. Con: Violent trauma cannot be quantified as "worse" than any other form of violent trauma.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.6. Con: Only [5% of rape accusations end in conviction](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system). Therefore, false accusations may only be worse than rape in the rare case that they lead to conviction.
1.3.5.1.3.4.2.7. Pro: In some countries, the accused may be castrated when convicted.
1.3.5.1.3.4.3. Pro: If only 5% of rapes are reported, then there are 20x more real rapes than reports of rape. If only 5% of rape reports are false, and 95% are true, then there are 20x more true reported rapes than there are false reported rapes. If so, then real rapes are 400 \(20*20\) times more common than fake rape accusations.Swapping 5% for 33% and 95%\(1-0.05\) for 37% \(1-0.67\) results in a 60x difference in real vs false rapes.
1.3.5.1.4. Con: Even if false accusations are rare, when they do occur they can ruin the lives of multiple parties. Therefore, false accusations can be a problem deserving serious attention.
1.3.5.1.5. Con: [False allegations](https://www.businessinsider.com/brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-accuser-judy-munro-leighton-2018-11) are more likely in the case of rich, famous or powerful figures because of the [rewards](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a24472435/false-assault-allegations-metoo-mueller/) such [claims](https://www.grunge.com/121077/celebrities-accused-crimes-never-committed/) can bring to their opponents. Especially in an era where false claims and conspiracy theories are rampant in [politics](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/14/conspiracy-theories-misconceptions-rampant-politics).
1.3.5.1.5.1. Con: The source material acknowledges that while a false allegation against a prominent figure can occur, alleging sexual assault still carries [huge repercussions](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/21/politics/christine-blasey-ford-kavanaugh-fbi-threats/index.html) for the accuser, even without considering [potential repercussions](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a24472435/false-assault-allegations-metoo-mueller/) if the false nature of their claim was discovered. Because of this, false allegations are unlikely to ever become commonplace.
1.3.5.1.5.1.1. Con: Because allegations and even [convictions of sexual assault](https://newrepublic.com/article/152305/who-to-believe-sexual-assault) require no corroboration, there are no obvious repercussions for false or unconvicted accusations.
1.3.5.2. Con: When the other alternative is fighting a full-on court battle against an individual, resigning is the better option, since companies using their power to fight an individual can be frowned upon, even seen as cruel and abusive, further hurting the company's reputation.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Figures in positions of power are more likely to be targeted using false claims than other people because their positions and influence have such high economic or political value.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: [Official figures suggest](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf) that the number of rapes and sexual assaults which are never reported or prosecuted "far outweighs the number of men convicted of rape because of [fake accusations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684)."
1.3.5.4. Con: A company would take a larger public relations hit from continued association with an accused sexual offender.
1.3.6. Con: If the organisation is partly at fault, such as due to being rife with corruption or institutional sexism, allowing one individual to take the fall and spare the organisation further criticism is bad.
1.3.7. Pro: Being accused of sexual assault can harm a campaign whether or not the [political figures](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-03-12/factbox-prominent-us-political-figures-accused-of-sexual-misconduct) have done so or not.
1.4. Pro: Sexual assault is a widespread issue, and should be treated with the utmost seriousness.
1.4.1. Pro: People who are innocent can be exonerated later.
1.4.1.1. Con: With a public figure, many people will not change their mind once an accusation has been made. The stigma of alleged misconduct will follow them forever.
1.4.1.2. Con: It is a [human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence#The_fundamental_right) to be innocent until proven guilty.
1.4.2. Con: Seriousness also implies making sure that the assault actually happened before passing judgment and making rash decisions.
1.4.3. Con: Without a proper trial, clear factual evidence, witness testimonies etc, claiming sexual assault/harassment willy-nilly devalues the seriousness of Sexual Assault.
1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.4.3.2. Pro: An accusation without any evidence of wrongdoing is not grounds to proceed with a trial. Prosecuting and/or convicting people without evidence has had terrible consequences throughout history.
1.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.5. Con: False accusations of sexual assault could be used as a weapon to denigrate people.
1.5.1. Pro: Just the threat of false accusations could possibly fall into the realm of blackmail. This could lead to tension, and ultimately mistrust, between people in positions of authority and the people under their authority.
1.5.2. Pro: It's too easy to just make [false accusations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation). A person can just claim publicly that this or that did happen - regardless of whether it ever really happened - and it's often hard to prove it without doubt.
1.5.2.1. Pro: In today's outrage culture, many people will assume the worst of intentions. For example, a tape where the president makes a joke about sexual assault is quickly used as evidence that "he's a rapist".
1.5.2.2. Pro: If a person suggests that the person making the allegations might not be telling the truth, one is quickly accused of "denying the victim" and thus being guilty of causing "additional trauma".
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.5.4. Pro: People shouldn't resign after 'just' being accused of sexual assault. If they are proven guilty, later on, then they could resign, but not when it hasn't been proven.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Just because someone is accused doesn't mean that they actually raped someone.
1.5.4.2. Con: The accused will likely know if they committed sexual assault, so if they resign it should only be because they committed the assault.
1.5.4.3. Con: It is statistically unlikely for these accusations to be [false](https://www.dailygamecock.com/article/2020/03/column-sexual-assault-accusations-should-affect-your-vote-allen-opinion).
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Research shows that only about 2 - 8% of sexual assault allegations are falsified \([p. 2](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018-10/Lisak-False-Reports-Moving-beyond.pdf)\).
1.5.5. Pro: An angry ex-lover or business competitor could use this device as an act of vindictive payback.
1.5.6. Con: When such an accusation arises, the person who made it is often faced with skepticism, disbelief and sometimes outright insults and threats. People are inclined to believe a person of authority first. An individual would take an unnecessarily high risk making a false sexual assault claim just to harm someone's reputation / career.
1.5.6.1. Con: Some people fake crimes against themselves for attention. It's not hard to get away with falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you as it's almost impossible to disprove.
1.6. Con: Sexual assault and other sexual abuses are mostly unrelated to authority. These actions have no bearing on one's ability to run a business or hold a political position.
1.6.1. Pro: As long as a person's character or public image is not a qualification for the position, then there is no reason to act before a thorough investigation can be conducted by the proper authority.
1.6.2. Con: Conduct does not have to be "related to authority" to warrant an actor's resignation.
1.6.3. Con: The parent is a [Strawman Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) in that it overly expands the scope of debate to sexual conduct in general, then attacks that argument based on the new definition. This debate is clearly limited in scope to sexual assault, not to all sexual conduct.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.6.5. Pro: This is especially true in regard to events which happened early in a person's life, which is not an indicator of a person's mindset years or decades later.
1.6.5.1. Con: Many of the people who are 'called out' for sexual assault years after the fact did not take responsibility for their actions, and thus marking their character as averse to justice, kindness, and honesty.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.2.
1.6.6. Con: Many sexual assaults involve exertion of authority.
