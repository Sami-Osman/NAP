Discussion Name: Should the US completely restore relations with Cuba?

1. The US should completely restore relations with Cuba.
1.1. Con: Cuba is an ally of North Korea and Iran.
1.1.1. Pro: Cuba has a history of [smuggling arms](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26210187) to and from North Korea.
1.1.2. Con: North Korea and Iran have seats at the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states#gotoI), and they are recognized states; having relations with them is not a violation of any international law.
1.1.3. Con: Given recent reconciliations with North Korea, perhaps this isn't quite as much of an obstacle.
1.1.4. Con: Restoring relations with Cuba could weaken the strength of this alliance.
1.2. Pro: Restoring relations with Cuba would benefit the U.S. economically.
1.2.1. Pro: The normalization of relations with Cuba would open an untapped, nearby market of over [11 million people](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/013015/what-cubaus-relations-means-us-industry.asp), allowing U.S. businesses to gain consumers.
1.2.1.1. Con: Companies may be discouraged from doing business in Cuba, due to its [strict domestic policies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-trade/blooming-u-s-business-interest-in-cuba-wilts-under-trump-idUSKBN1DA1VJ), restrictions on labor, shortage of physical currency, and poor-quality telecommunications.
1.2.2. Pro: Industries such as travel, agriculture, and banks would profit immensely from normalization of relations, thus benefitting U.S. economy at large. [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/013015/what-cubaus-relations-means-us-industry.asp)
1.2.2.1. Pro: Specifically for the agricultural sector, food exports to Cuba could total over [$1 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-trade/blooming-u-s-business-interest-in-cuba-wilts-under-trump-idUSKBN1DA1VJ), leading to substantial growth.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The US travel industry would benefit from Americans being able to travel to Cuba again.

1.3. Pro: Normalizing relations will benefit the people of Cuba.
1.3.1. Con: The Cuban economy is largely [state owned](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/cuba), which means that most economic benefits gained from normalization will go to the government rather than the people.

1.3.1.2. Con: Cuba has a higher literacy rate than in USA and a higher life expectancy [soapboxie.com](https://soapboxie.com/economy/Has-Cuban-Socialism-Been-A-Success)
1.3.2. Pro: Cubans are suffering from the embargo, which has caused poverty in the country. Normalizing relations will allow the country to import more essential goods.

1.3.4. Con: Having normal relations with a rogue nation may be risky for Cuba and its people.
1.4. Pro: Improved diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US could set an example for other countries locked in long-standing bilateral conflict.
1.4.1. Con: Improved relations could also send a message to dictatorial regimes that they will be rewarded for their behavior after enough time passes.
1.4.2. Pro: Improved US-Cuba relations could serve as a template for improved US-Iran or US-North Korea relations.
1.4.2.1. Con: There are too many differences, particularly involving Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs, for Cuba to serve as a template.
1.5. Con: Warm diplomatic relations are always conditional on behavior. Cuba has the power to restore relations by adhering to international norms for [human rights](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/cuba).
1.5.1. Con: The United States cannot demand that Cuba adhere to international norms for human rights when the United States is a [violator of human rights](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/united-states) in large scale.
1.5.2. Pro: Cuban law contains many repressive policies, [including](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/26/cuba-fidel-castros-record-repression) "surveillance, beatings, arbitrary detention, and public acts of repudiation."
1.5.2.1. Con: The US doesn't want Cuba to adhere to international human rights; it wants Cuba to adhere to US foreign policy. This is different.
1.5.2.2. Con: According to the article linked above, the US embargo is partly to blame for the Cuban government not introducing reforms.
1.6. Pro: Establishing stronger diplomatic ties with Cuba could incentivize the Cuban government to adopt more liberal policies.
1.6.1. Pro: With [Venezuela](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2014/12/23/the-geopolitics-of-u-s-cuba-relations/) \(one of Cuba's main economic supports\) experiencing political and economic turmoil, the island is looking desperately to outside countries to preserve its economic integrity.
1.6.2. Con: Warm relations is the incentive. Giving it before Cuba makes fundamental changes eliminates US leverage to actually cause change.
1.7. Pro: The US embargo of Cuba has failed to achieve its goals.
1.7.1. Pro: The Castro regime is still in power and stable, more than fifty years after the embargo came into effect.
1.7.2. Con: Cuba is not a friend of U S and has demonstrated this by allowing USSR to place offensive missiles on its territory. [Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917](http://legisworks.org/sal/40/stats/STATUTE-40-Pg411.pdf) prevents reversing course unless Cuba reverses course and becomes a friend of U S.[legisworks.org](http://legisworks.org/sal/40/stats/STATUTE-40-Pg411.pdf)
1.7.2.1. Con: The United States has the right not to trade with Cuba, but it does not have the right to punish states who trade with Cuba, such a policy is beyond the scope of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, and it's also a violation of the international trade regime.
1.8. Con: A relationship with Cuba will open up the U.S. to possible terrorist threat.
1.8.1. Con: Cuba has never conducted an act of terror in the United States or against the United States.
1.8.2. Pro: In recent months, Cuba has become [increasingly close](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-russia-analysis/cuba-boosts-trade-ties-with-cold-war-ally-russia-as-u-s-disengages-idUSKBN1ED0FI) with Russia economically, increasing imports from Russian industries. This could potentially lead to a Cold-War era relationship, using Cuba as a proxy venue to terrorize the U.S.
1.8.2.1. Con: According to this article, this is only happening because the US under Trump is pulling away from Cuba.
1.8.3. Pro: Russia has already pursued efforts to spy on the U.S. through informants and cyber warfare. With the geographical closeness of Cuba and the U.S., Russia could use Cuba to increase its observance on the U.S. and gain geopolitical advantage.
1.8.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that Russia will utilize Cuba to strike the U.S., due to their limited military and technological capabilities.
1.8.4. Pro: Cuba has already demonstrated their hostility towards the U.S., through the "[sonic attack](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/castro-huddles-with-russia-as-us-cuba-relationship-crumbles)" on U.S. officials on the island.
1.9. Con: Restoring ties would upset interest groups and allies that are important to the US.
1.9.1. Pro: Cuban organizations, particularly in Miami, largely [support](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article156579409.html) President Trump's efforts to make policy more strict. By retracting on this, Trump risks upsetting these organizations and substantial protest.
1.9.2. Con: Restoring ties could also improve relations with other countries throughout Central and South America.
1.9.3. Pro: Diplomatic ties with a Communist country goes against American ideals of freedom and democracy. By doing so, the U.S. also risks ideological criticism from domestic sources.
1.9.3.1. Con: America maintains diplomatic ties with China, Vietnam, and Laos.
