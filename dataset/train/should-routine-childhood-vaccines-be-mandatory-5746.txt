Discussion Name: Should Routine Childhood Vaccines Be Mandatory?

1. Routine childhood vaccination against preventable diseases should be mandatory worldwide.
1.1. Con: Mandatory vaccination is a breach into individual liberty.
1.1.1. Pro: It is a breach into the liberty of parents to choose the best healthcare for their children.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Substances contained inside vaccines might be seen as unethical by individuals holding certain religious beliefs or ethical positions.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Certain vaccines [use DNA from aborted fetuses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/wi-38) in production, which might be considered unethical by people holding pro-life religious beliefs.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Catholic Church issued [a statement](https://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=2410) where they accepted this fact but still allowed believers to use such vaccines.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Porcine gelatine](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/824013/PHE_vaccines_porcine_gelatine.pdf) \(i.e. gelatine that originates from pigs\) is used as a stabiliser in many vaccines at the [NHS](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/460069/8584-Vaccines-porcine-gelatine-2015-2P-A4-04-web.pdf), yet certain religions prohibit the consumption of, or contact with pig-derived products.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Religious beliefs are not receivable arguments when it comes to making decisions impacting the whole society, it can only have value inside a community made of people sharing the same beliefs. Therefore, since vaccinating children is a matter of national health, only rational, science based arguments should be accepted.
1.1.1.2. Con: Parents who do not have sufficient knowledge or expertise in health care are not capable of making an informed decision for their children's healthcare.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: If the specific vaccine decreases the risk of death or other serious health impacts for a child whose parents oppose vaccination, compulsory vaccination might be seen as a way to defend the right to healthcare for the child \([Bradley, 1999](https://jme.bmj.com/content/25/4/330)\).
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: For instance, a judge in the US ruled [in favour](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/judge-rules-jehovahs-witness-boy-blood-transfusion) of blood transfusion for the child of a family of Jehovah's Witnesses against their consent.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The 'child' can make up their own mind when they are older and at the age of consent.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The above claim in no way addresses the child's right to healthcare 'during childhood'. If parents refusing vaccine are denying their child's rights, it is not sufficient to say that the child will be able to reverse the decision as an adult \(even assuming he/she survives that long\). This is not the precedent set for dealing with other parental actions that endanger the child's life, i.e. child abuse.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Parents need to be provided with all information \(pro's and con's\) so they can make an informed decision.
1.1.1.3. Con: Belief systems are never sufficiently important to justify risking a child's life or those of other people.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Many parents are distressed by the fact that shots make babies cry. Their wishes and decisions to avoid this should be respected.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The harm of a shot to the baby is too brief to matter, especially when weighed against the benefit of protecting them against diseases and infections.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: Taking a baby away from an abusive mother would make it cry but the act is still just. Therefore not all rules and procedures that make babies cry are wrong.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: A cry is only the manifestation of the disagreement from the baby about something. It is therefore unreliable due to the imprecision and the subjectivity of the information.
1.1.1.5. Con: If the parents have liberty to choose the best health care, they also have to have liberty to choose the worst health care. Since the government does not allow parents to harm their children, which is breach of their liberty to do so, it should also not allow them to harm their children by mandating them to be vaccinated.
1.1.2. Con: Individual liberties are generally accepted as being outside of the governments control or purview. Governments are obligated to care for the health and well being of it's citizenry. This puts vaccination into the area of civil liberty, or laws for the good of the community.
1.1.3. Pro: Many people object to getting vaccinated because it violates religious conventions.
1.1.3.1. Con: For religions that do not permit injected vaccines, alternate forms of many vaccinations are available--e.g. the polio vaccine is given as an oral form in several countries.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Polio is the [only routine childhood vaccine that is available in oral and injected forms](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html). There is no oral form of vaccine for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Hepatitis B, HIB, Diptheria, Pertussis, or Tetanus. There is no oral flu vaccine, although there is an intranasal one.
1.1.3.2. Con: Many people object to PE and forge a note from their Mom. There are few examples of [religions objecting to vaccination](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/heres-where-major-religions-actually-stand-on-vaccines_us_58dc3ef0e4b08194e3b71fc4). However individual preachers may lead their own flock according to personal interpretations or prejudices.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Religion is inherently following doctrine. If this is from an individual, an organization, or a holy book, religion still should be respected.
1.1.4. Con: We don't have individual liberty to neglect children. In a situation where a parent \(without the approval of a doctor\) has no good reason not to protect their children, it is not 'liberty' but just neglect.
1.1.4.1. Con: Where it comes to medical treatment, individuals must have the right to not trust the government or medical experts. Non-treatment is not neglect, unless the treatment can be risk free. Treatment is always a choice to weight up the benefits with the risks. Death or injury in a forced treatment is not acceptable even in a very small chance.
1.1.5. Con: We already [ban substances](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/anti-doping/youth-space/what-drugs-are-banned/) that cause harm to humans, which lessens liberty in exchange for societal benefits, as mandatory vaccination would.
1.1.5.1. Con: Banning something is totally different from forcing someone to take something against their will. They are not the same.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Making any behavior mandatory, OR banning any behavior, are both limitations on individual liberty.
1.1.5.2. Con: During alcohol prohibition in the US, it became apparent that the ban on alcohol caused more harm than alcohol itself. [As a result, the constitutional amendment prohibiting alcohol was repealed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeal_of_Prohibition_in_the_United_States) Using state violence in hopes of achieving societal benefits has a terrible track record.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Outlawing a product \(such as alcohol\) may predictably result in a black market based on the profit motive of selling that product. It is unlikely that criminal gangs will form for the purpose of skirting vaccination laws.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: The parent resolution says nothing about using violence to enforce the mandate for vaccines.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: Similar efforts are underway to eliminate prohibition of [marijuana](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html).
1.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Recreational marijuana has been legalized in [Canada.â€‹](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-26/canada-legalised-marijuana-why-are-people-buying-from-criminals/11627700)
1.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Recreational marijuana has been legalized in [Mexico](https://mjbizdaily.com/mexican-senate-commissions-approve-marijuana-bill-legalizing-recreational-use/).
1.1.5.3. Con: There is nothing inherent about anti-vaxxers that suggests they must support the drug war.
1.1.5.4. Con: While we do ban harmful substances, in no other case - except for emergency situations - is a medical therapy mandated for the greater good.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: The government can pressure people into treatment, with people that have had drug abuse problems this [seems to be effective](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-abuse-treatment-criminal-justice-populations/legally-mandated-treatment-effective)
1.1.6. Pro: Pushing a needle into a person without their consent constitutes [assault](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/assault).
1.1.6.1. Con: Officials 'assault' people who put others at risk on a routine basis, such as police arresting criminals. Mandatory medication, when someone poses a threat of harm, is legitimate, such as medically treating violent psychosis.
1.1.6.2. Con: The legal [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault) of assault involves harm or unwanted physical contact. Thus consent is critical: many medical procedures \(such as cutting someone open and removing their appendix\) in the absence of consent, would constitute assault.
1.1.6.3. Con: A lack of vaccination puts "weaker individuals" \(immune deficient, and children too young to get vaccinated yet\) at risk and can lead to their infection. Those who know that they suffer from a transmittable disease that can gravely endanger the lives of weaker individuals, and still refuse to be vaccinated, could be classified as assaulting those who are vulnerable.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Assault in many developed nations and U.S. States are based on knowingly and intentionally performing an unconsentual action on someone. Someone who unknowingly or unintentionally spread a disease couldn't be held accountable for assault.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: Not everyone believes that [positive and negative moral obligations](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights) exist in equal weight \(if positive obligations exist at all\). "Thou shall not murder" is meaningfully different from "Thou shall feed all starving children."
1.1.6.4. Con: [Injection by needle is not a necessary condition for receiving a vaccination.](https://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6084095/painless-needleless-vaccines-injections-afluria-pharmajet)
1.1.6.5. Con: Even if pushing a needle into a person without their consent does constitute assault, the [social contract](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism-contemporary/) may suggest that individuals who are born into and live in a society are morally obligated to consent to its laws and customs.
1.1.7. Pro: Individual liberty is protected in the case of many other individual choices that pose a greater health risk and cost for society, hence rendering vaccines mandatory is arbitrary and unwarranted.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Smoking is still allowed, although secondhand or 'passive' smoking poses a [high health risk](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/secondhand-smoke.html) to society.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Smoking is not allowed in public places, only in regulated areas. You could argue that non vaccinated people should therefore be confined to specific areas.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: You can identify someone smoking and avoid them pretty easily, you do not know if someone is vaccinated. If you would mark non vaccinated people, than it would be an equivalent.
1.1.7.2. Con: Individual liberty is not protected when behaviors have been proven to be risky to other people's life. For example, a person cannot drink while driving, or over-speed because it is considered a dangerous behavior.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Smoking is allowed while second hand smoke still exists. Driving is on public spaces, while being vaccinated affects someones bodily autonomy. Smoking is a better comparison if someone can put themselves at risk.
1.1.7.3. Pro: It is still permissible to eat meat although farming is one of the leading drivers of [climate change](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/neal-barnard-md/cowsnot-coalare-the-real-_b_5526979.html).
1.1.7.3.1. Con: While outlawing meat eating would contribute to slowing down the climate change, [it would not stop it](https://reason.com/2019/07/29/why-giving-up-meat-wont-have-much-of-an-effect-on-climate-change/). Vaccination with high enough rate does prevent outbreaks completely and can even lead to disease elimination.
1.1.8. Con: Becoming infected with a preventable disease, having chosen not to receive the vaccination, then infecting another person breaches that person's individual liberty.
1.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.
1.1.9. Con: Individual liberty may be a necessary sacrifice depending on the severity of the risk to the public's health.
1.1.9.1. Pro: In a civilized society, the needs of the many should, at times when the impact is greatest, be above the needs of the few or individual. Eradicating or limiting a disease by use of vaccinations is for the greater good of society.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Due to the scarcity of resources, seeking to eradicate any one disease might come at a loss to society. This would be the case if the ratio of benefits to cost for such mandatory immunisation campaign were lower than that for alternative measures that benefit public health.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: Seeking to eradicate one disease may strengthen healthcare infrastructure, as the [Global Polio Eradication Initiative](http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconomicCase.pdf) has done in developing countries. The resources poured into eradicating one disease, have resulted in improved access to healthcare for many conditions. \(p. 2\)
1.1.9.1.1.2. Pro: These alternative measures could include providing more resources to accidents and emergency departments, which are [severely under-resourced](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/2/e019024).
1.1.9.1.1.3. Con: Strategies to eliminate certain diseases completely \(like smallpox, polio and measles\) may free up future resources, by saving the money that is currently spent annually on the [burden of disease](https://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2013/04/measles-costs).
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: Eradicating certain communicable, vaccine-preventable diseases \(like polio & measles\) worldwide requires that developed countries continue to maintain high rates of vaccination and immunity, even though individuals in those countries are at low risk of exposure to the disease.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Con: Eradication of any diseases is an arbitrary target that hasn't been agreed democratically.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: The erasure of human pain and suffering doesn't need political backing to be morally just.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It requires investing a lot of tax money so it does requires political backing.
1.1.9.1.2.2. Con: Eradication of other non-contagious diseases such as [tetanus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4674006/) cannot be attained via vaccination, since no herd immunity can be attained in this way.
1.1.9.1.2.2.1. Pro: The 'herd immunity' concept only applies to [contagious diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity), i.e. not to vaccine-preventable diseases such as [tetanus](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity).
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: There's a price to pay for living in a civilized society. You sacrifice certain individual freedoms for the benefits of teamwork and being in a social group. In this case, the sacrifice is only the freedom to be ignorant, which is not a high value form of individual liberty.
1.1.9.1.3.1. Con: "Ignorance" is not the freedom at stake here. It is the freedom of deciding what goes into your body. Ignorance simply means not knowing.
1.1.9.1.4. Con: It is the means of a 'few' immuno-compromised individuals that we are protecting. So our rights to bodily choice is affected by the few. Some immuno-compromised are still vaccinated. Only those who have [anaphylaxis](https://vaccine-safety-training.org/contraindications.html) are fully exempt.
1.1.9.1.4.1. Con: Immunocompromised people [should not receive live vaccine](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/guidelines-for-vaccination-of-immunocompromised-individuals-from-the-infectious-diseases-society-of-america-an-in-depth-guide#:~:targetText=Live%20vaccines%20that%20can%20be,%2C%20and%20rubella%20\(MMR\)%20vaccine&targetText=Yellow%20fever%20vaccine%20\(if%20indicated,vaccine%20\(if%20indicated%20for%20travel\)), out of the concern that it will cause active diseases. They can still receive killed/inactivated vaccines, but are less likely to respond and gain immunity from them, because that's what immunocompromised means.
1.1.9.1.4.1.1. Pro: The fact that some immunocompromised people may receive vaccine, does not avoid the issue that they may still be at risk \(and in need of protection through the actions of others\).
1.1.9.1.5. Con: Vaccines have never actually completely eradicated a disease and likely never will. Even the definition of eradication allows for some cases.
1.1.9.1.5.1. Con: Small pox has been eradicated primarily through a successful global vaccination program.[WHO](https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/post-eradication/en/)
1.1.9.1.5.2. Con: Polio is very close to being [eradicated](https://www.cdc.gov/polio/progress/index.htm#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20worldwide%20polio,Asia%20and%20the%20Western%20Pacific.) by vaccines.
1.1.9.1.5.3. Con: The aim of vaccines is to reduce the amount of a virus in circulation in society and thus reduce the amount of infection from that disease, not necessarily eradicate them.
1.1.9.1.6. Pro: They should be mandatory since we're part of a society and thinking individually in this subject is selfish.
1.1.9.1.7. Pro: This follows the principles utilitarianism which states we should make the greatest good for the greatest amount of people.
1.1.9.1.7.1. Pro: We will create more hapinness by saving people than we will create pain by forcing vaccines.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Protecting the liberty of individuals who do not want to vaccinate themselves \(or their children\) may conflict with protecting the liberty of other individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons \(e.g. immunodeficiency\) to safely use public spaces due to the increased risk to their health.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: It cannot be easily generalised by how much the health risk for individuals who cannot be vaccinated would increase due to the presence of other voluntarily non-vaccinated people attending the same public spaces. Considering that vaccine-preventable diseases are far from being the most frequent causes of illness in our society, it could be argued that the health risk would only increase marginally.
1.1.9.2.1.1. Con: Immunocompromised people can still receive vaccines. It is only those who had a reaction \([anaphylaxis](http://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/ASCIA_Anaphylaxis_Training_Resources_NOV05.pdf)\) who are exempt.
1.1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.4.1.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: It is a false equivalence to compare [liberty](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/liberty) to not have foreign matter introduced to your body by force with the liberty to walk about in nature. The latter liberty is not restricted in this case by authority, but by nature itself.
1.1.9.2.3. Con: It is the responsibility of each of us to take care of our own health and well being. It's not one person's responsibility to look after the other, but those who suffer from health issues to look after themselves.
1.1.9.2.4. Con: Immune suppressed individuals can be infected by [individuals recently vaccinated for chickenpox \(varicella\), intranasal flu vaccine within one week, rotavirus, or Oral Polio Vaccine](https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/caregiver-resources/infection-tips/inpatient-visiting-guidelines.html?vgnextoid=20206f9523e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD). As such, vaccinated children can endanger others as they can still carry diseases even though they do not show symptoms themselves.
1.1.9.2.4.1. Con: Oral polio vaccine has not been routinely administered in the U.S. since 1997, when it [switched](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/polio-vaccine) to the injected \(inactivated\) form, which carries zero risk or infection to contacts of the vaccinated person.
1.1.9.2.5. Con: Vulnerable children will be vulnerable to many diseases, not just ones for which vaccines exist. Vaccinating others is therefore not a viable method to manage their condition.
1.1.10. Con: One has the liberty to not get vaccinated, but then one must accept the penalty. Our choices must carry consequences.
1.1.10.1. Pro: [Some countries](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/3/16069204/vaccine-fines-measles-outbreaks-europe-australia) are moving towards levying fines to anti-vaccine parents.
1.1.11. Pro: It is unfair to impose mandatory vaccinations on [animal rights activists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552208/).
1.2. Pro: Compulsory vaccinations would reduce the prevalence of diseases.
1.2.1. Con: Vaccines do not make the virus [extinct](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/top-20-questions-about-vaccination). To do that the geographical source of said virus should be located and sanitized fully, which is close to impossible.
1.2.1.1. Con: This is not about complete extermination, but rather a reduction of illness.
1.2.1.2. Con: Disease control by the combined methods of vaccinations and [eradication of the source of the sickness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373041/) \(killing mosquitoes, draining marshes, eradicating rats etc.\) has proven highly successful in the past
1.2.1.2.1. Con: This is difficult to execute in[poorer countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2626838/) with un\(der\)developed infrastructure and lack of resources
1.2.1.3. Con: Viruses can become extinct if there is widespread vaccination, AND there is no non-human host or reservoir for the virus. This happened for [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox), and there's the potential for it to happen with [measles](https://measlesrubellainitiative.org/) and [polio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis_eradication) in our lifetimes \(depending on your age now\).
1.2.1.3.1. Con: When there's an animal or other reservoir \(i.e. rabies, which is carried by animals; or the plague, carried by rats; or tetanus, which has spores that can live in soil\) the disease can't be eradicated solely by vaccinating humans.
1.2.2. Pro: Mandatory vaccination is needed in order to maintain [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity), protecting those individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
1.2.2.1. Con: High vaccination levels are attained in many countries through information and [public engagement campaigns](https://daily.jstor.org/vaccination-compulsory/), [WHO](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary), and a study commissioned by the EU even found [no link](http://www.asset-scienceinsociety.eu/reports/page1.html) between vaccinations being compulsory and vaccination rates. This suggests that making vaccination mandatory is not strictly needed to achieve herd immunity.
1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.2.1.
1.2.2.3. Con: Herd immunity might not be attainable even if vaccines are mandated due to intrinsic levels of vaccine non-response \(i.e. [failed immunisation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962729/)\).
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: An example of vaccine that does not fully protect against the disease is that against flu, which only cuts the risk of hospitalisation by [30-70%](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/how-effective-is-flu-vaccine#1) elderly people \(not in care homes\). This is in part because of the genetic variations in the virus.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: The above linked source emphasizes that young and healthy people have higher rates of response to the flu shot. Herd immunity cannot be attained by only vaccinating those with compromised immune systems like the elderly. The failure rate in the elderly is the reason for encouraging vaccination in the young healthy population.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Herd immunity is the [slowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) or prevention of the spread of disease, due to a prevalence of immunity in a population. It is not an all-or-nothing marker to be "attained." Thus vaccines that give partial immunity can still save lives, on a population basis.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: In a population with 30% of the people are immune, the infection in question will spread more slowly that in a [population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5922976/) with 0% immunity, other factors being equal.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Failed immunisation is exactly why mass immunization is required to improve protection. If we can reduce the number of vectors \(in this case infected people and all the stuff they come in contact with\) then we can reduce the number of infections.
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Even in areas with 97% vaccination rates, [outbreaks occur](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/207/6/990/898747).
1.2.2.3.4.1. Pro: Measles outbreaks in the United States is a good example.
1.2.2.3.4.2. Con: The link in the above claim describes the "largest measles epidemic in North America in the last decade" as consisting of 725 cases. This is an excellent example of the effectiveness of herd immunity achieved through widespread vaccination.
1.2.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: In the decade prior to an effective vaccine, the U.S. [averaged](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html) 549,000 cases of measles every year.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Many elderly people will be able to avoid sickness.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Elderly people who have adequately vaccinated themselves will not be exposed to any undue risk due to the choice of others preferring not to vaccinate themselves.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: Many vaccines are [less effective in the elderly](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4933-4-9), so they may be less effective despite following all the recommendations. Thus they rely on herd immunity from others being vaccinated.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Con: More research needs to be done on vaccines for the elderly. A study indicates that evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is [lacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22032844).
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.1.1.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Newborn babies can avoid unnecessary diseases.
1.2.2.6. Con: Mandatory vaccination of others, for specific disease\(s\), is not a viable management method for immune-suppressed individuals.
1.2.3. Pro: Compulsory vaccinations would stop 'outbreaks' caused by [misinformation](https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/measles-surge-among-londons-charedi-children/) that convinces segments of the population to avoid vaccination.
1.2.4. Pro: Since the start of widespread compulsory vaccinations in the [United States](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/fact-myth-immunizations.html), cases of once common childhood illnesses like measles and diphtheria have dropped dramatically.
1.2.5. Con: Better [hygiene and sanitation](https://www.jpands.org/hacienda/article36.html) has caused the decline of diseases, not vaccines.
1.2.5.1. Con: Cases of [paralytic polio in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/polio/us/) fell from 15,000 annually in 1955 \(when the first vaccine was introduced\) to 10 per year in the 1970s.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Prior to introduction of vaccine in 1955, cases had been on the increase, despite improvements in sanitation and other societal changes. Remaining cases of polio occurred in un-vaccinated people. Multivariate analysis does not support any alternative hypothesis, but that the vaccine is effective.
1.2.5.2. Con: The primary thesis refers to "worldwide" vaccinations. The above source reports the decline in disease mainly in the US, where sanitation/nutrition have improved greatly over the last century. It would be wrong to argue against vaccinating worldwide, just because first-world countries have lower death rates due to their higher standard of living.
1.2.5.3. Con: Both factors \(vaccines and sanitation/nutrition\) can contribute to decreases in case-rates and death rates. The effect of improving living conditions, is not an argument against using vaccines as well.
1.2.5.4. Con: Improved standard of living has had a much greater impact on death rate, than on the incidence of disease. The case rate \(incidence\) has been greatly impacted by effective vaccine for [measles](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-cases-and-death-rate).
1.2.6. Pro: Many children died before a vaccine for any virus was made available.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The American Academy of Pediatrics \(AAP\) reported over [one million cases and 133 deaths](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/11/16/covid19children111620). Both reports were for children in the United States under 21 years of age.
1.2.6.2. Con: It is unlikely that people who oppose vaccination would be okay with vaccination being mandatory.
1.2.7. Pro: If mandatory vaccines were instituted across the United States \(and other countries\), sicknesses would be more easily eradicated. This also applies to the flu and even the current COVID-19 pandemic.
1.2.8. Pro: Many diseases have been almost eradicated with the help of making vaccines compulsory like [polio](https://www.unicef.org/immunization/polio) and [smallpox](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6293036/). Without vaccines we would have still fight against life threatening diseases that are curable.
1.3. Pro: Vaccinations reduce the need to treat diseases with antibiotics, lowering the chances of antibiotic resistance mutations.
1.3.1. Con: Although reduction of [drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae \(DRSP\)](https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/Health-Topics/drug-resistant-streptococcus-pneumoniae-drsp/) by [pneumococcal conjugate vaccines \(PCVs\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine) has recently become a reality, [Serotype 19A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4028678/), which is both antibiotic resistant and a common cause of disease, is [not affected](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309908702810) by PCV7 and is now increasing worldwide. One of the recommended strategies to deal with this increase is the 'limitation of antibiotic use.'
1.3.1.1. Con: For strains of strep that have been reduced by effective vaccine, there has been great [reduction in the need for antibiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6304973/). Further reduction in the need for antibiotics can be achieved by developing vaccines to strains that were not included in previous vaccines.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.
1.5. Con: Mandatory vaccinations open us \(completely\) up to the potential corruption of pharmaceutical companies.
1.5.1. Pro: Past cases of corruption from 'Big Pharma' companies bribery \[[1](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29274822)\] \[[2](http://www.transparency.org.uk/publications/corruption-in-the-pharmaceutical-sector/)\] remind us that the risk that this will happen again can never be fully avoided.
1.5.1.1. Con: Past corruption cases do not suggest that they can never be avoided.
1.5.2. Con: A solution for this would be to [nationalize the pharmaceutical industry.](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2013/06/socialize-big-pharma/)
1.5.2.1. Con: The race to cash in on new cures and treatments means that these companies do invest huge amounts of money into medical research and development. A nationalized pharmaceutical invest [less into research](https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/science-and-innovation/worldwide-pharmaceutical-company-rd-expenditure/) and would likely have limited funding slowing down the advancements which could otherwise be made.
1.5.2.2. Con: Governments are not immune to [corruption](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/tackling-corruption-in-government/). If the government running the nationalized pharmaceutical industry was itself corrupt there would be very little recourse available to the citizens.
1.5.2.3. Pro: We can nationalize the distribution and delivery practice while letting the private sector continue R&D on new vaccines. This takes the profit motive out of which combinations of vaccines we receive.
1.5.2.4. Con: If it is necessary to nationalize the pharmaceutical industry before mandatory vaccination can be implemented, then we are not \[yet\] ready for mandatory vaccination.
1.5.3. Con: All public vaccinations have to be approved by an [independent committee](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html) regulated by law. This reduces the risk of corruption from pharmaceutical companies.
1.5.3.1. Con: Unless the committee itself has conflicts of interest or becomes simply corrupt.
1.5.3.2. Con: Mandatory vaccinations would mean we have to use every vaccine produced on the basis of risk/reward or 'minimal' side effects. For any such treatment you would need a 0 risk treatment, such a thing does not exist.
1.5.4. Con: Whatever the side effects and business interests - a drug that keeps diseases like measles or smallpox extinct is worth all risks.
1.5.5. Pro: Pharmaceutical companies thrive when people are sick. This creates a strong ethical conflict, which needs to be addressed.
1.5.5.1. Con: There's a famous example which solves your doubt: car manufacturers get money from seat belts, but no one says that we shouldn't use them. Equally, if a pharmaceutical company gets money from vaccines, we shouldn't say that there's an ethical conflict.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: This is not a good analogy, because there is no evidence that car manufacturers make money from people being injured in vehicular accidents. The parent pro alleges that pharmaceutical companies profit by selling drugs to treat illnesses, thus giving them less incentive to prevent illness.
1.5.5.2. Con: \(Even assuming that pharma companies have no internal ethics...\) the FDA requires proof of efficacy, and an acceptable side effect profile, for any product to make it on the market, and there is competition between companies to demonstrate the best results. If vaccines are mandatory, there will still be competition between companies to demonstrate the best vaccines, with the least side effects, in order to gain market share, and this competition will benefit consumers/ patients.
1.5.6. Con: Making anything mandatory \(like seat belts in cars, or carrying car insurance in order to drive\) may create a potential for abuse by the companies who produce the mandatory product. This risk can be balanced by competition within the market of producers, or by government regulation of the industry.
1.5.7. Con: Making vaccination mandatory actually creates incentives for pharmaceutical companies to jump in and create cheaper and better vaccine as you do not have the risk of creating product which will not be used. E.g. check the price list of CDC [www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html)
1.6. Con: Vaccines are not sufficiently effective to justify making them mandatory.
1.6.1. Pro: Vaccines may become ineffective as a consequence of mishandling of the vaccine between the production and delivery site, for instance due to [failure in the cold chain](http://csafeglobal.com/the-cost-of-a-broken-vaccine-cold-chain-part-one-human-cost/).
1.6.1.1. Con: Studies proving efficacy have established [certain protocols](https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/TRS_979_Annex_4.pdf?ua=1) for transport, storage and administration of vaccines; the vaccine is only proven to be effective when those procedures are followed. A failure to maintain these protocols should not be an argument against efficacy; it should only reinforce the importance of proper storage.
1.6.2. Con: There are [many](https://vaxopedia.org/2017/07/10/where-are-the-double-blind-placebo-controlled-randomized-trials-about-vaccines/) well-designed, placebo-controlled and double blinded studies which prove efficacy of several vaccines.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Efficacy as compared to placebo is the scientific standard for medical effectiveness. Vaccines available at the doctors have been shown to be more effective than placebo in various studies. Therefore, despite the range of efficacy levels, [studies](https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/TRS_979_Annex_4.pdf?ua=1) are firm that vaccines are in fact effective.
1.6.3. Con: More than a dozen major infectious diseases have been [controlled in many parts of the world by vaccines](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/11/1607/850248).
1.6.3.1. Con: We are therefore in an ever increasing requirement to vaccinate because it can only be controlled and not eradicated. The effect of multiple vaccinations is not well studied.
1.6.4. Pro: Scientific studies are indicating that vaccine-induced immunity wanes [over time](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/how-long-do-vaccines-last-surprising-answers-may-help-protect-people-longer). Each disease is different in how long immunity lasts. ACIP keeps recommending more and more vaccines and doses as a [work-around](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recommendations.html) for waning vaccines.
1.6.4.1. Pro: With regard to [yellow fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever), a few [studies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/yf-vac-boost.html) indicate that '[without periodic exposure to the pathogen, people gradually lose protection](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/how-long-do-vaccines-last-surprising-answers-may-help-protect-people-longer)' and thus should be vaccinated periodically.
1.6.4.2. Con: Recommendations have been tailored over time to account for many things. Changing recommendations should not lead anyone to "throw the baby out with the bath water" by concluding that vaccines are not beneficial at all.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: The ACIP [changed the polio vaccine schedule](https://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_pol.asp) in 2009 from five doses to four, based on decreasing risk of wild-type polio in the US and the findings of high prevalence of immunity in children and adults who had received four doses.
1.6.4.2.2. Pro: In 2000, the ACIP [changed the polio vaccine recommendation](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/public/index.html) from oral \(OPV\) to injected \(IPV\) to avoid the rare risk of vaccine-derived poliomyelitis.
1.6.4.3. Pro: In 1989, the ACIP [began to recommend](https://gizmodo.com/people-born-before-1989-may-need-another-measles-vaccin-1834304231) a two-dose schedule of MMR vaccine due to outbreaks among people who had received one dose.
1.6.5. Pro: There is [clear](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/measles-outbreak-traced-fully-vaccinated-patient-first-time) research that supports the argument that vaccines are not completely [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC96204/).
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.5.
1.6.7. Con: Vaccines not being fully effective doesn't mean we shouldn't vaccinate.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Contraception isn't 100% effective against preventing pregnancy yet many people use it and hand sanitiser isn't 100% effective at killing bacteria, yet it's a requirement for doctors to use it before any surgery. Nothing is fully effective but that doesn't invalidate its usage.
1.6.8. Con: Vaccines are among the most effective of any treatments modern medicine provides, such as [chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/chemotherapy/chemotherapy-side-effects.html). If you use any modern medicine for any situation, refusing vaccines should be understood be irrational.
1.7. Con: Making this mandatory would adversely affect the physician-patient relationship.
1.7.1. Pro: Parents forced to vaccinate their children against their will might become less likely to comply with future immunisation or health care interventions \([Bradley, 1999](http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/jme.25.4.330)\), which could have an overall negative impact on public health in the longer term.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The doubt of many parents as regards the efficacy of vaccines is a symptom of widespread distrust in government and institutions. Mandatory vaccination would only increase this distrust. Education would be far preferable to coercion.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: People distrust Big Pharma and that distrust is growing daily due to the huge law suits taking place currently with Pharma over the [opioid epidemic](https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/familys-web-makes-it-hard-to-track-cash-from-opioid-maker/news-story/f6f06146f0bbc3d2a52254949f0458c3) and prior medication fraud.
1.7.2. Con: Refusing recommended \(not mandatory\) vaccinations may already adversely affect the physician-patient relationship.[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2532570/)
1.7.3. Con: Even though a physician has the patient's best interest in mind, it seems this would create conflict with parents who should voice concerns and ensure they have a doctor that will engage in discussion about the benefits and risks of vaccines.
1.7.4. Con: Having non-vaccinated patients is putting the physician and other patients at risk, and therefore affecting the relationship adversely.
1.7.5. Con: The physician patient relationship is, in this case, less significant than the health of the patient. Thatâ€™s why it should be compulsory for vaccines to be taken to ensure that even if this relationship was severed due to misunderstanding and lack of education, the priority is vaccinating and ensuring the prosperous health of the patient.
1.8. Con: Rendering vaccines mandatory does not necessarily represent a cost-effective way of improving public health in all countries.
1.8.1. Pro: It would be expensive for countries to give every single person on the planet many vaccines.
1.8.1.1. Con: The administration of vaccines would [reduce healthcare costs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0462) due to vaccine-preventable diseases complications and treatment.
1.8.2. Con: Review of vaccination strategies has [demonstrated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X03007813?via%3Dihub) that the majority of universal vaccination programs are cost-saving from the perspective of society compared to no vaccination. Vaccination programs are among the rare health interventions that are cost-saving.
1.8.3. Pro: The massive backlash and rampant civil unrest following mandated vaccinations will only fuel opposition and encourage defiance. It is far more effective to fund public health education and programs designed to inform the public of the benefit of vaccines.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Education and [nudge mechanisms](https://www.kialo.com/coercion-is-a-blunt-substitute-for-progressive-policies-governments-have-learnt-better-techniques-such-as-nudge-which-4615.677?path=4615.0~4615.1-4615.159_4615.677) work better than universal laws.
1.8.4. Pro: It is unclear how many additional lives could be saved through such a policy.
1.8.4.1. Pro: The beneficial impact of a mandatory immunisation campaign depends on country- and region-specific conditions, which make it hard or impossible to generally state that vaccines must be made mandatory everywhere.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.
1.8.4.1.2. Con: Communicable diseases have no respect for international borders. Efforts to control or eradicate these illnesses must be based on worldwide disease burden, i.e. countries with low incidence of disease need to maintain high rates of vaccination until the disease is eradicated/ controlled everywhere.
1.8.4.2. Con: The number of lives that could be saved is clear from comparing incidence of disease in developed vs. underdeveloped countries.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: More complex statistical analysis techniques such as [multivariate regression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3506578/) are required to establish the [correlation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050267) between immunisation rates and incidence of disease. For this it is necessary to correct for differences in the general state of health among different countries and different periods, e.g. accounting for differences in the healthcare system, diet etc.
1.8.4.2.1.1. Con: This statistical analysis would necessarily be based on historical data, and thus would never be entirely applicable to today's population. By this logic no new product should ever be introduced, nor any new treatment recommended.
1.8.4.2.1.1.1. Con: By this argument it would also not be possible to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccines, since it would be hard to argue that any observed correlation between the incidence in the disease and the immunisation coverage reflects a deeper deterministic link and is not simply spurious.
1.8.4.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.8.4.2.2. Con: Depending on the disease, high incidence of a diseases needs not mean high number of deaths, if a good healthcare service is available.
1.8.4.2.2.1. Con: In countries where there is not good access to health care, it is not only more expedient, but more humane, to provide vaccine and eliminate suffering and death from at least one disease.
1.8.5. Con: A different regimen of mandatory vaccinations can be somewhat tailored to individual countries. Should a malaria vaccine ever be developed, it may not be necessary in colder climes, for instance, though absolutely necessary equatorially.
1.8.6. Con: For some diseases, like [polio](http://polioeradication.org/news-post/a-career-spent-chasing-down-polio/), total eradication is within reach, which would justify the expenditure of public health dollars now, and save money in the future when, as with [smallpox](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/), there may be a day when vaccination is no longer needed
1.8.6.1. Pro: The [Global Polio Eradication Initiative](http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconomicCase.pdf) \(GPEI\) will cost about ten times as much annually, in the short term, as the "routine" immunizations systems worldwide, but the costs will drop drastically when polio is eradicated. Without an aggressive eradication strategy, the costs of "routine" vaccination, treatment, and death and disability will presumably go on forever.
1.8.7. Con: We've never used the criteria of cost-effectiveness before in spending decisions, such as the disproportionate spending of taxpayers money each year into military and nuclear weapons, as well as atomic arms.
1.8.8. Con: Diseases are a method of natural selection. Bypassing them via vaccination is of greater detriment to society due to the increase in hereditary weaknesses.
1.8.9. Pro: Vaccine [shedding](http://medscienceresearch.com/shedding/) is a real [concern](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X01004959).
1.8.9.1. Con: Vaccine shedding is only a concern for those with [severely weakened](http://www.thevaccinemom.com/2015/02/vaccine-shedding-should-you-really-be-concerned/) immune systems.
1.8.9.2. Con: Most vaccines [do not shed](http://www.thevaccinemom.com/2015/02/vaccine-shedding-should-you-really-be-concerned/).
1.8.9.3. Con: There is [almost no](http://www.immunizeusa.org/blog/2016/september/24/vaccine-shedding/) record of any substantial harm done to others \(11 in 50 million for chickenpox, for example\).
1.8.9.4. Con: Vaccine shedding is much higher with wild-type infection than with vaccinated individuals, and the [wild-type pathogens are more likely to cause disease](https://www.nvic.org/cmstemplates/nvic/pdf/live-virus-vaccines-and-vaccine-shedding.pdf) than the attenuated vaccine-type strains.
1.8.9.5. Con: Shedding of attenuated \(weakened\) virus may be [beneficial](http://www.immunizeusa.org/blog/2016/september/24/vaccine-shedding/), by passively immunizing the imunocompetent contacts of the vaccinated child. This is important in third-world countries, where the likelihood of wild-type disease in immunocompetent contacts is much higher than the likelihood of vaccine-type disease in immunosuppressed contacts.
1.8.9.6. Pro: The [circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus \(cVDPV\)](http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/) has the potential to cause health impacts similar to those of the [polio virus itself](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0910074), which has been the cause of multiple outbreaks in the past, and as recently as 2017 in [Syria](http://polioeradication.org/news-post/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-confirmed-in-syria/).
1.8.9.6.1. Con: Vaccination schedules in several countries have replaced the use of [oral vaccines](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/49/8/1287/429938) \(i.e. OPV, which could cause cVDPV\) with safer ones \(IPV\), a trend that is considered positive by some.
1.8.9.6.2. Pro: The circulating [vaccine-derived poliovirus](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/enteroviruses/poliomyelitis) has been responsible for more cases of paralysis than the wild poliovirus in [recent years](http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/).
1.8.9.6.2.1. Con: This does not account for the fact that many more cases of polio have been [avoided](https://www.verywellfamily.com/polio-and-polio-vaccines-2634430) thanks to the vaccine itself.
1.8.9.6.3. Pro: [1 in 2.7 million](https://www.verywellfamily.com/polio-and-polio-vaccines-2634430) cases of oral vaccination against polio \(i.e. with OPV\) results in paralysis.
1.8.9.6.4. Pro: [Recent](https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-september-2019-polio-outbreak-the-philippines/en/) polio out break in the [Philippines](http://polioeradication.org/where-we-work/philippines/) was [Vaccine-derived](https://www.who.int/features/qa/64/en/) Type 2 Polio not the wild type polio.
1.8.9.6.5. Con: Vaccine shedding is mainly a concern through fecal-oral contamination. With the example of circulating vaccine derived polio, the reason this virus mutated back to an infectious form was because the attenuated form was used in areas with low vaccination rates, allowing it to spread and mutate.
1.8.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.2.4.
1.9. Con: There could be negative health impacts for those who are vaccinated.
1.9.1. Pro: There is plenty of [reputable evidence](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all?fbclid=IwAR0qehDATZTdEqGyZZ0WBR6vNoHQzTI42KlaB1HzSueIlojU9zfY1npzd1Y) showing the dangers of vaccines.
1.9.1.1. Pro: A recent [US court case](http://icandecide.org/government/ICAN-HHS-Stipulated-Order-July-2018.pdf) revealed there has been no [quality control](https://cairnsnews.org/2018/11/19/u-s-govt-loses-landmark-vaccine-lawsuit/?fbclid=IwAR2FKezaH6jlZHDLwGqdCDeHmKE83dgJCx9Os0H23UTWpsKNHW-2cj2b_8c) over vaccines manufactured by big-pharma for at least 32 years.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: The above case states there was no evidence that the department of HHS updated the U.S. House & Senate. It does not state that there was no quality control, or no primary evidence from which reports could have been formulated.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Vaccines are [contraindicated](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.html?fbclid=IwAR3sUDdT8un1LUhV-gOKy7hMt6la-vJOZi-E-n9CtqjNvQ_e46lBnWTluwA) for people with certain health issues.
1.9.1.3. Con: Side effects of vaccines are [carefully evaluated](https://www.fda.gov/media/71655/download) by the FDA through intense clinical trials. The process of getting vaccines to market takes years and is often unsuccessful because the standards are so high.
1.9.1.4. Con: The above source is not "reputable evidence." The GreenMedInfo site is known for [fact distortion and promoting pseudo-science.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/GreenMedInfo)
1.9.1.5. Pro: The human immune system already has the [capability](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/fact-myth-immunizations.html) to produce natural antibodies against many germs. It might be possible to get an adverse reaction if the immune system is exposed to increased immunity levels via an artificial source too.
1.9.1.5.1. Pro: Vaccines limit the ability of the body to create [heterosubtypic immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosubtypic_immunity).
1.9.1.5.1.1. Con: [Vaccines do not limit the ability of the human body to generate cross strain protections.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24102979)
1.9.1.6. Pro: A lot of money has been [payed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_Damage_Payment) due to vaccine injuries.
1.9.1.6.1. Con: The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was made in the 1980's after a vaccine scare which has since been discredited. The [website](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html) even says people are paid even when there is no finding of causality.
1.9.1.6.1.1. Con: The VICP is managed by the [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/civil/vicp). The VICP mandate states that it provides "...compensation for vaccine injury-related medical and rehabilitative expenses..." The standard by the DOJ is clear. Money is paid when they believe an injury caused by a vaccine occurred, which is not easy. Less than 10% of people who file a claim with the [VICP](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html) are adjudged to be eligible for compensation. 30% are settled prior to Judgment and the remaining 60% are either withdrawn or deemed not eligible.
1.9.1.6.2. Pro: The [UK Vaccine Damage Payment](https://fullfact.org/online/vaccine-damage-fund/) has paid out 900 times totalling Â£74 million since 1978.
1.9.1.6.3. Pro: The Hannah Poling case in the vaccine court was the first one to receive [compensation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-to-receive-15m-plus-in-first-ever-vaccine-autism-court-award/) for rapid decline in health after receiving a number of vaccines.
1.9.2. Con: There have been [demonstrated health impacts](https://medium.com/\@visualvaccines/graphic-proof-that-vaccines-work-with-sources-61c199429c8c) and deaths to those who are not vaccinated.
1.9.3. Pro: There is a possibility of vaccines containing substances harmful to humans.
1.9.3.1. Con: All things are harmful to humans, at the wrong dose or delivered incorrectly. Even water is toxic at [high enough levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison).
1.9.3.2. Pro: The most common adjuvant used in vaccines \(i.e. [Aluminium oxide hydroxide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Aluminum-oxide-hydroxide), [Alhydrogel](https://www.invivogen.com/alhydrogel)\) might be neurotoxic even at [low doses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X16303043).
1.9.3.2.1. Con: The link is to a study in mice, which tested effect of aluminum on cognitive function in the short term and found adverse effects from [a dose of aluminum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5651828/) which, in humans, would be proportional to 10 to 15 times as much aluminum as contained in one dose of most vaccines.
1.9.3.2.1.1. Con: The link also notes that lower doses might increase the risk due to the mechanism leading to the substance's neurotoxicity.
1.9.3.2.2. Con: The [amount of aluminium](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum) in most vaccines is far less than the amount ingested daily from food, water and other products.
1.9.3.3. Con: The illnesses being prevented by vaccines are much more harmful than the ingredients in the vaccines themselves.
1.9.4. Pro: Since [vaccines can cause harmful side-effects](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm), mandating their use prevents healthcare professionals from weighing the pros and cons of vaccination based on the needs of individual patients.
1.9.4.1. Con: Mandating vaccination does not mean there would not be exceptional grounds. If someone has a history of adverse reactions to vaccines it would be unethical to vaccinate them further.
1.9.4.2. Pro: [Vaccines are proven to cause adverse symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html) for some users.
1.9.5. Con: According to an [analysis](https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html) of the benefit and risk of DTP immunization, if there was no immunization program in the United States, pertussis cases could increase 71-fold and deaths due to pertussis could increase four-fold.
1.9.6. Pro: Vaccines have the potential to cause various diseases and illnesses.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.6.4.
1.9.6.2. Pro: There are [concerns](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism) that some vaccines can cause/have caused autism.
1.9.6.2.1. Con: There is no known mechanism by which vaccines would have caused autism.
1.9.6.2.2. Con: There is a scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause [autism](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf).
1.9.6.2.3. Con: Autism is not a sufficiently serious consequence when compared to the life-threatening illnesses vaccines prevent.
1.9.6.2.4. Con: There is no credible link between vaccines and autism.
1.9.6.2.4.1. Pro: The fear that vaccines increase risk of autism originated in a study by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon. The paper has since been [completely discredited](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/) due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations.
1.9.6.2.4.2. Con: As of March 5th 2020, the CDC only had 2 studies related to the DTaP vaccine use in infants 0-6 months as it relates to causing autism \([study list.](https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stipulation-and-Order-Fully-Executed.pdf)\) One of the studies which combs all studies around the world, by the Institute of [Medicine 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK190028/#sec_0861) finds: "The evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between diphtheria toxoidâ€“, tetanus toxoidâ€“, or acellular pertussisâ€“containing vaccine and autism."
1.9.6.2.5. Pro: These concerns stem from the fact that the [rate of autism has increased in developing countries in the past 20 years](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism), a time period where these countries have also [increased the administration of vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819934/).
1.9.6.3. Con: Despite having some insignificant [side effects](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/safety/side_effects) like fever, childhood immunisation programs massively continue to keep diseases like measles, mumps, diptheria, influenza etc. under control.
1.9.6.4. Pro: Vaccines can lead to [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \(SIDS\)](https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013vv0611-73-0).
1.9.6.4.1. Con: This is simply [not true](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html).
1.9.6.4.1.1. Pro: The World Health Organisation has categorically confirmed that [this is untrue](http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html) - a spurious causal link was drawn and has been debunked.
1.9.6.4.1.2. Pro: Vaccines have not been shown to cause sudden infant death syndrome \(SIDS\). Babies receive multiple vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This age range is also the [peak age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html) for sudden infant death syndrome \(SIDS\).
1.9.6.4.1.3. Pro: Many large studies have found [no link between vaccines and SIDS](https://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/vaccines-common-concerns). In fact, some studies found that babies who died of SIDS were less likely to have been recently vaccinated than babies who did not die.
1.9.6.4.2. Con: One case does not make it a substantive risk.
1.9.6.5. Pro: Vaccines can cause [cancer](https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/vaccine-cancer-connection/).
1.9.6.5.1. Con: This is [absolutely untrue](https://vaxopedia.org/2018/04/25/can-vaccines-cause-cancer/); there are [no known cases](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/did-the-polio-vaccine-cause-cancer/) of vaccines causing cancer.
1.9.6.5.1.1. Pro: The polio vaccine is only linked with causing cancer in [rodents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine), and the same was not replicated in humans. Thus, the polio vaccine [does not cause cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889993) in humans.
1.9.6.5.2. Con: Vaccines can help [prevent](https://www.cancerresearch.org/join-the-cause/cancer-immunotherapy-month/30-facts/10) cancer caused by viruses.
1.9.6.5.2.1. Pro: Scientists and physicians have launched research projects for [therapeutic vaccines](https://www.cancerresearch.org/join-the-cause/cancer-immunotherapy-month/30-facts/10) that can be used to treat cancer.
1.9.6.5.2.2. Pro: Certain vaccines have been developed that have the ability prepare the human immune system against certain infections and therefore help protect it against the cancers caused by these infections.
1.9.6.5.2.2.1. Pro: Hepatitis B vaccine helps [protect against liver cancer](https://www.cancerresearch.org/join-the-cause/cancer-immunotherapy-month/30-facts/10) in humans and human papilloma virus \(HPV\) vaccine protects against [cancer of the cervix and some other genital cancers](https://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/vaccines-common-concerns).
1.9.6.6. Pro: Vaccines can [cause](https://worldmercuryproject.org/news/over-vaccinated-children-and-the-allergy-epidemic/) [allergies](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/evidence-that-food-proteins-in-vaccines-cause-the-development-of-foodallergies-and-its-implications-for-vaccine-policy-2329-6631-1000137.pdf) and [asthma](https://www.worldallergy.org/education-and-programs/education/allergic-disease-resource-center/professionals/vaccination-and-the-risk-of-atopy-and-asthma).
1.9.6.6.1. Con: Major studies have [thoroughly debunked](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccines-and-other-conditions/vaccines-asthma-allergies) this myth.
1.9.6.6.2. Con: Allergic reactions are so rare it can be easily argued there is [no link](http://www.worldallergy.org/education-and-programs/education/allergic-disease-resource-center/professionals/vaccination-and-the-risk-of-atopy-and-asthma).
1.9.6.6.3. Con: While there is a very slight risk for children who already have moderate to severe asthma, the risk for the general population is [almost none](http://www.worldallergy.org/education-and-programs/education/allergic-disease-resource-center/professionals/vaccination-and-the-risk-of-atopy-and-asthma).
1.9.7. Con: Majority of self immune reactions caused by pathogens can potentially be eliminated through genomics in modern vaccines and drug design due to the increasing understanding of microbial pathogenesis that is emerging from the study and analysis of genome. [ncbi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752168/)
1.9.8. Pro: There is still a possible chance that [vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) can led to side effects that can affect a certain system of a child.
1.10. Pro: If diseases like smallpox and polio were eradicated, doctors could be trained for progressive medicine and new discoveries in medicine rather than having to still learn about old treatments for diseases that could long be gone.
1.11. Con: The creation and testing of vaccines [conflicts with](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/animal-testing-101/) animal rights.
1.11.1. Pro: Animals are put through [extreme suffering and distress](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/laboratory/medicinesandvaccines) while undergoing vaccine experiments.
1.11.2. Con: Majority of vaccines are not tested on animals due to their physiological difference to humans.
1.11.2.1. Con: At a physiological and anatomical level, animals and humans are r[emarkably similar.](https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/the-animal-model/)
1.11.2.1.1. Con: Yet, the [immunity](https://www.frontiersin.org/10.3389/conf.fimmu.2011.01.00003/event_abstract) of other animals differs from that of a human in terms of illnesses and protection.
1.11.2.1.2. Pro: Animal organs have even been transplanted successfully into humans in a practice called [xenotransplantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation).
1.11.3. Con: The most important vaccines have already been created, to not give vaccines to people would be a waste of all the suffering that animals have already endured.
1.11.3.1. Con: [New diseases and variants emerge often](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/emerging-infectious-diseases), if we continue to rely on animals for vaccine testing, then we will continue to violate their rights to develop vaccines.
1.12. Pro: Mandating childhood vaccines ensure that parents choices do not compromise child well-being later in life.
1.12.1. Pro: Many parents of children born in the 80s and 90s were impacted by the false [Vaccinne-Autism link](https://time.com/5175704/andrew-wakefield-vaccine-autism/) and became suspicious of vaccines. This means their children are now unprotected.
1.12.2. Con: It is unwise to trust governments and pharmaceutical companies over parents.
1.12.2.1. Con: Vaccines are ultimately designed, administered and approved of by medical professionals and are, as such, subject to high levels of review.
1.12.2.2. Con: Parents often have little to no knowledge about the impact and outcome of vaccination.
1.12.2.3. Con: Parents are more invested in their individual child's well being than the community perspective.
1.12.2.4. Pro: A parent knows best what is right for their child.
1.12.2.5. Pro: Governments show corruption in all areas of their work, there is no reason to trust they are operating in the 'common good' in their work around vaccines.
