Discussion Name: Should the US Recognize Palestine as a State?

1. The US Should Recognize Palestine as a State.
1.1. Con: The US should not support the two-state solution, as it is not the best outcome for the region.
1.1.1. Pro: A one-state solution encompassing both Israel and Palestine would allow both groups to inhabit the same space in peace.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Reports on polls indicate that more Israelis \(39%\) support a [joint state for the two peoples](https://knessetjeremy.com/2016/12/30/smith-poll-39-1-state-for-2-peoples-31-annex-settlement-blocks-30-2-states-for-2-peoples-based-on-1967-lines/) than support a two-state solution \(30%\).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The [cited statistic](https://knessetjeremy.com/2016/12/30/smith-poll-39-1-state-for-2-peoples-31-annex-settlement-blocks-30-2-states-for-2-peoples-based-on-1967-lines/) implies that six out of ten Israelis \(61%\) prefer solutions other than a single state for both Palestinians and Israelis.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The former Israeli President, Reuven Rivlin, has said that he would rather [accept Palestinians as Israeli citizens](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-official-accepting-palestinians-into-israel-better-than-two-states-1.287421) than accept the creation of a Palestinian state.
1.1.1.2. Con: The Arab citizens of Israel already experience large-scale discrimination and feel treated as second-class citizens or [even enemies](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3391545,00.html), even though they are legally equal to other citizens. Judging from this, Israel has probably little interest in a joint state with Palestinians as equals.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Israel is characterized by inequality along ethnic lines. More than half of all Arab families in Israel are classified as poor compared to a fifth of Jewish households; the life expectancy of Arabs is about four years lower than that of Jews, their infant mortality about twice as high \([pp. 8-10](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: 24% of Arab citizens believe that Israel is in good or very good condition, compared to 42% of Jews \([p. 1](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)\). This indicates that Arab citizens are not satisfied with their situation in the state.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Arab towns and villages are heavily over-represented in the lowest socio-economic rankings of Israel, and the unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages in the Naqab are the [poorest communities](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/the-struggle-of-bedouin-poverty-in-the-israeli-negev/) in the state.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: About [half of all Israeli Jews](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/key-findings-religion-politics-israel/) voice in opinion polls that Arabs should be transferred or even expelled from Israel.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Right wing foreign minister [Avigdor Lieberman](http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011124105622779946.html) already plans to swap Arab-Israeli villages in Israel with Jewish-Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: Even if Israel has no intent of treating Palestinians as equals, increased global scrutiny on the state may pressure them into taking more positive actions.
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: Citizenship rights for Jewish and Arab citizens are not equal \([p. 16](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf)\). This extends to laws around immigration and family unification.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: The expulsions in Sheikh Jarrah in the summer of 2021 have highlighted the ways in which Israeli real estate legislation [directly discriminates](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/17/palestinians-sheikh-jarrah-jerusalem-city-identity) against those who would consider themselves Palestinian.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Inequalities between Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel are universal and enduring \([p. 7](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.4.3. Pro: In 2010, [only](https://www.idi.org.il/media/4849/madad_2010_eng_abstract.pdf) 51% of the Jewish citizens of Israel supported equal rights between the Jewish and Arab citizens of the country \(p. viii\).
1.1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: [Eight out of ten](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/25/most-israeli-jews-do-not-see-a-lot-of-discrimination-in-their-society/) Israeli Arabs believe that there is already "a lot" of discrimination against Arabs taking place in Israel.
1.1.1.2.4.3.2. Con: The 2021 elections featured an Arab party in the [winning coalition.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/opinion/israel-government-coalition.html?smid=url-share) This indicates that this attitude might be changing.
1.1.1.2.4.3.3. Pro: The [cited](https://www.idi.org.il/media/4849/madad_2010_eng_abstract.pdf)(The notion that citizenship is a legal status conferring equal •rights has been only partially internalized by the Israeli public: 51% of the general public support full equality of rights between Jews and Arabs. A breakdown of the Jewish public by level of religiosity shows that the greater the level of religious observance, the stronger the objection to equality of rights between Jews and Arabs: only 33.5% of secular Jews are opposed to such equal rights, in contrast to 51% of traditional Jews, 65% of religious Jews, and 72% \(!\) of ultra-Orthodox Jews. \(pg.viii\)) survey indicates that 72% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe this, whilst only 33.5% of secular Jews do. This is important as the ultra-orthodox are likely to be a [major voting block](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/17/the-ultra-orthodox-will-determine-israels-political-future-haredi-likud-netanyahu-shas-deri-utj/) in Israel's future.
1.1.1.2.4.3.4. Pro: [86%](https://www.idi.org.il/media/4849/madad_2010_eng_abstract.pdf) believe that critical decisions for the state should be taken only by a Jewish majority \(p. v\).
1.1.1.2.4.3.5. Con: As of 2021, Israeli voters have become [more supportive](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/2/analysis-can-united-arab-list-change-israeli-politics)(However, it was not merely the political landscape that has witnessed a change but also Israel’s society. In February 2020, polls indicated only 23 percent of Jewish voters would support the idea that the country’s Arab parties support an Israeli government. In April 2021, a poll found now 48 percent of Jewish voters had warmed up to the idea.\n\nRa’am thus became increasingly cognizant that it can achieve more within the system.\n\nUsually, the Palestine question would dominate the election programmes of the Arab parties, but turnout among the Arab community remained relatively low. This year’s turnout marked the worst in history, at 44.6 percent.) of Ra'am involvement in the governance of the Knesset. This indicates a positive change in attitude towards Arabs.
1.1.1.2.5. Pro: In 2021, the Supreme Court of Israel voted to [uphold](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/israeli-supreme-court-upholds-contentious-jewish-state-law)(Proponents of the 2018 law claimed the legislation merely enshrined Israel’s existing Jewish character.\n\nCritics said it further downgrades the status of Israel’s Palestinian minority, which makes up about 20 percent of the country’s population.\n\nAdalah, a Palestinian rights group that tried to overturn the law, said the court upheld a law that “completely excludes those who do not belong to the majority group”. It said it would “continue to work internationally to expose the discriminatory and racist nature of this law”.) a 2018 law that downgrades the status of non-Jewish Israeli citizens.
1.1.1.3. Con: The popular Palestinian political [slogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Palestine), "From the river to the sea, Palestine will soon be free," suggests that the [end goal](https://www.ajc.org/translatehate/From-the-River-to-the-Sea) is total Palestinian control, which some believe borders on [genocidal intent](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/dutch-university-removes-from-the-river-to-the-sea-banner-after-protests-669847).
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Accusations of genocidal intent may not be born out by [historical record.](https://forward.com/opinion/415250/from-the-river-to-the-sea-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/?mc_cid=84b5599fab&mc_eid=f874fe4ad4)
1.1.1.4. Pro: Palestinians have a strong claim to the territory. Israel, therefore, shouldn't be given an exclusive right to the territory.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Palestinians want, first and foremost, a state of their own as Palestinian Arab people. In 1988 their parliament thus adopted a [declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Declaration_of_Independence). Ever since, November 15 is celebrated as Independence Day in Palestine.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Indeed, among [all imaginable scenarios](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(pg.4) for the region, none is more unpopular in Israel and only one is more unpopular among Palestinians than a joint state.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: The citizenship of Palestinians in a joint state with Israelis that ensures equal rights for everybody could deliver this independence.
1.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Palestinian textbooks display a [world without Israel](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/new-palestinian-textbooks-present-a-world-without-israel-february-2007) and [incite](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/congressional-statement-on-palestinian-textbooks-july-2005) antisemitic feelings. This mindset precludes solution.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: [Israel's Proclamation of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence), issued May 14, 1948, invited the Palestinians to remain in their homes and become equal citizens in the new state.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Several [binding instruments](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp) of international law grant sovereign rights to the Jewish people in the land of Israel. Zero binding instruments of international law support the claims of the Palestinian Arabs.
1.1.1.4.4. Con: Jews have a stronger claim to the land; as the original inhabitants, they were [dispossessed and exiled by the Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire#Dispersion_of_the_Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire) in the first century. The land was subsequently invaded and occupied by several succeeding empires.
1.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Before the [program of expulsion](http://www.meforum.org/263/why-jews-fled-the-arab-countries) from Arab countries, including Palestine, Jewish people had been living in the territory as well.
1.1.1.4.4.2. Con: The Jewish land claim is not incompatible with the claim of the Palestinians. Both states should be recognised because they both have legitimate claims to the land.
1.1.1.4.4.3. Pro: [Arabs invaded in the 7th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant#Conquest_of_Palestine). The claim of the Palestinian Arabs is based on the principle that the descendants of invaders and occupiers have a greater right to inherit property than the descendents of the original owners.
1.1.1.4.4.4. Con: Using the original inhabitants theory is a [slippery slope fallacy](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Slippery-Slope.html); one could easily argue that every country in Europe and the Americas should be given back to the natives that originally occupied the land.
1.1.1.4.5. Pro: The [vast majority](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/palestinian-culture/palestinian-culture-religion)(The majority of Palestinians are Muslim, including those living overseas. All residents in the Palestinian Territories are required to declare a religion on an identification card issued by the Israeli government. According to this record, 98% of Palestinians identify as Sunni Muslims.1 Christianity is the main minority religion, with roughly 52,000 Palestinian Christians believed to be living across the occupied territories as of 2013.2 It is believed the numbers of religiously unaffiliated Palestinians \(i.e. atheist or agnostic\) in the West Bank and Gaza are very low.) of Palestinians, by virtue of being Muslims, have a strong religious connection to the territory.
1.1.1.4.5.1. Con: [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam#Muhammad_\(610%E2%80%93632\)) is a religion that historically started in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism#Origins) is a religion that can be historically traced to the Kingdom of Israel. Muslims have a very strong religious claim to Saudi Arabia and Jews have a very strong religious claim to Israel.
1.1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: Religious connections and claims to territory are not purely determined based on where a religion originated, as various widely-accepted examples illustrate.
1.1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: Christianity has its origins in today's [Middle East](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/the-origin-of-christianity/)(In BAR, Geza Vermes wrote: “Acts identifies the demographic watershed regarding the composition of the Jesus movement. It began around 40 C.E. with the admission into the church of the family of the Roman centurion Cornelius in Caesarea \(Acts 10\). Later came the gentile members of the mixed Jewish-Greek church in Antioch \(Acts 11:19–24; Galatians 2:11–14\), as well as the many pagan converts of Paul in Syria, Asia Minor and Greece. With them the Jewish monopoly in the new movement came to an end. Jewish and gentile Christianity was born.”). And yet the religion's link and claim to territories outside the region that became associated with it much later, like The [Vatican](https://www.history.com/topics/religion/vatican-city), are undisputed.
1.1.1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Muslims have [holy sites](https://guardian.ng/life/7-holiest-sites-in-islam/) that are located both in and outside Israel, but all Jewish [holy sites](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/holy-sites-of-judaism.html) are located in Israel.
1.1.1.4.5.1.3. Pro: Because of their shared history, many of the sites that are sacred to Jewish people are sacred to [Christians](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/holy-sites-of-christianity.html) too. Given that the US is a [Christian-majority](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/) country, they are unlikely to take actions that run counter to the tie between Israel and Judaism.
1.1.1.4.5.2. Pro: According to the Torah, Abraham had two sons: Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael and Isaac are considered respectively the ancestors of the [Arab people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael#World_views) and the [Jewish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac#Islamic_views). If the biblical ancestors of both Jewish and Arab people lived in Israel, both have a strong biblical/religious claim on the territory.
1.1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Their shared ancestry also implies that they are members of a large [family](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/05/000509003653.htm)(If a common heritage conferred peace, then perhaps the long history of conflict in the Middle East would have been resolved years ago. For, according to a new scientific study, Jews are the genetic brothers of Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese, and they all share a common genetic lineage that stretches back thousands of years.)--a fact and sentiment that could be highlighted to promote peace and reconciliation.
1.1.1.4.5.2.2. Con: If ancestry based on religious scriptures is enough to claim a territory, then all human beings should have a claim as both [Jews and Muslims](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/projects/lrc/arabic/women_deceit/texts/Adam_Eve.html) believe that all human beings are the descendants of Adam and Eve.
1.1.2. Pro: Promoting a two-state solution against resistance would repeat what has failed in the past. Smaller steps forward might be a more feasible alternative.
1.1.2.1. Con: Partition was [agreed upon by the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) and enjoys its [continued support](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/UN-chief-No-alternative-to-two-state-solution-for-Israel-Palestinians-481615).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The UN view doesn't represent what Israelis and Palestinians think.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Many Palestinians do not themselves support the two-state plan the US will base its recognition on. This makes it unlikely that such a plan will ever be successfully adopted.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Two thirds](https://mosaicmagazine.com/essay/2017/04/do-palestinians-want-a-two-state-solution/) of Palestinians reject the idea of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a Palestinian state with West Jerusalem being controlled by Israel.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: As of [2009](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(pg.4), the establishment of a historic Palestine from the Jordan river to the sea elicited significantly more support among Palestinians than a two-state solution; more than half even saw this as "desirable" or "essential".
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: By all standards this solution is unrealistic as it would require Israel to be subsumed into a Palestinian state. This would be acceptable neither to Israel nor the international community.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: In 2009, [two thirds of Palestinians](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(pg.4) expressed in that a two-state solution would be at least acceptable.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: According to a [2009 poll](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(pg.11), nine out of ten Palestinians see it as "essential" that all of Jerusalem comes under Palestinian control; splitting the city according to the 1967 borders was "unacceptable" to half of all Palestinians
1.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: This issue is a major obstacle: eight out of ten Palestinians voiced in [2009](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(pg.11) that no deal with Israel should proceed as long as there is no agreement on Jerusalem.
1.1.2.2.1.5. Con: Even if they do not support the American agenda as a whole, [nearly half](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of all Palestinians believe that the primary goal of their nation should be to establish a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital, which is in line with the U.S. plans.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: [Two thirds](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of Palestinians believe that the two-state solution is no longer a viable way forward due to the already existing and expanding Israeli settlements.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: There is [no clear support](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/636) for a two-state solution among Palestinians with roughly equal numbers expressing support and opposition to the idea.
1.1.2.2.4. Con: Palestinians would welcome a show of US resolve in this question. [As of 2009](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(Pg.18), eight out of ten saw the American lack of resolve as a major contributor to the lack of progress in the peace process, second only to Israeli unwillingness.
1.1.2.2.4.1. Con: Only some [4%](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(Pg.7f) of Palestinians welcome a peace-process driven by the United States. They would rather see the negotiations be led by the EU, the UN, Russia and the US together, or Arab nations - or bilateral talks with Israel.
1.1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: This is likely coloured by the failure of US-led talks in the past. If the US were to recognise Palestine and actively engage in diplomatic and trade relations, Palestinian public opinion of the US will surely change.
1.1.2.2.4.2. Con: Almost [eight out of ten](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(Pg.8) Palestinians believe that the Trump administration is pro-Israel. Any American initiative will thus probably be received skeptically.
1.1.2.2.4.3. Con: [More than half](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/poll%2062%20English%20full%20text.pdf)(Pg.13) of Palestinians want the Trump administration to stay out of the peace process.
1.1.2.2.5. Con: [59%](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) of Palestinians express support for a particular two-state plan, conditional on a peace deal between Israel and all nearby Arab states.
1.1.2.2.6. Con: As of 2009, a joint state with Palestinians and Israelis as equal citizens was unacceptable to a [minority](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(PALESTINIANS ONLY\)\nOne joint state – A state in which Israelis and Palestinians are equal citizens \n\nEssential - 18\nDesirable - 13\nAcceptable - 10 \nTolerable - 12\nUnacceptable - 43 \(pg.4\)) of Palestinians; the majority would at least be willing to tolerate or even embrace this solution.
1.1.2.3. Con: The US can accelerate the peace process without directly interfering. For example, it could [neglect to veto](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-vetoes-of-un-security-council-resolutions-critical-to-israel) Security Council resolutions that punish Israeli behaviour counterproductive to peace, like settlement-building.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Getting Israel back to the negotiating table is vital for any real change to occur in the situation of Palestinians, this is highly unlikely.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: Israeli public opinion indicates that Israel has not given up on the two-state solution.
1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Even though the current Israeli government is not negotiating, the Israeli public [supports](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/with-only-40-percent-support-israelis-still-think-2-states-best-option-poll-675838) the establishment of a Palestinian state - [even if](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) safeguards need to be established \(e.g. a multinational security force\).
1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: At the same time, only about [a third of Israelis](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) support the idea of splitting control over Jerusalem. This indicates that, although most Israelis are committed to a two-state solution in principle, in practice they are unwilling to make the concessions necessary to achieve such a solution.
1.1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Surveys emphasize that the support for a two-state solution would probably be at more than 70% in case of a referendum, as about a quarter of the population usually states that they are undecided or unsure \([p. 2](http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20916%20-%20Israeli%20on%20National%20Security%20Index.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.1.2. Con: At the same time, issues other than national security and relations with Palestinians dominate Israeli elections. During the 2015 parliamentary vote, [a majority of voters](http://www.timesofisrael.com/cost-of-living-tops-list-of-election-issues-poll/) saw economic issues as most pressing; only a quarter gave priority to security issues.
1.1.2.4.1.3. Con: While the Israeli public may not oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, the political establishment does, and the political establishment decides what Israel's official stance on the creation of a Palestinian state is.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: The previous leader of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, made it clear that there would never [be an independent Palestinian nation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/on-final-day-of-campaign-netanyahu-says-no-palestinian-state-if-he-wins/2015/03/16/4f4468e8-cbdc-11e4-8730-4f473416e759_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.a1c826e38867) as long as he was in power; this may have worsened the situation in the region.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Netanyahu later [denied](https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-election-netanyahu-idINKBN0MF1SP20150319) abandoning his commitment to the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. He claimed that the state could not be formed while the Palestinian Authority refused to recognise Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people and the Hamas militant group continued to control the Gaza Strip.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Even with Netanyahu ousted, the new political coalition is [unlikely](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/who-is-in-israel-s-new-coalition-government-1.1234863)(With the first test completed, the coalition – which brings together religious, secular, nationalist, leftist, centrist and Arab parties – now has to prove it can overcome its internal contradictions and differences to govern Israel.\n\nThe plan, hashed out in the days before the vote on Sunday night, will see the new government focus on internal issues and righting the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nContentious issues, such as the Arab-Israeli peace process, will be put on the back burner, even as Egypt tries to broker a lasting ceasefire after an 11-day conflict in May between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.) to prioritise Palestine and independence.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: This is likely to be because the 2021 coalition is [incredibly diverse](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/who-is-in-israel-s-new-coalition-government-1.1234863)(Israel’s new grand coalition has won the confidence of the Knesset and is now the official government – ending the 12-year premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nWith the first test completed, the coalition – which brings together religious, secular, nationalist, leftist, centrist and Arab parties – now has to prove it can overcome its internal contradictions and differences to govern Israel.), with members across the political spectrum.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The coalition [approved](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/15/israel-launches-air-raids-on-gaza-palestinian-security-sources)(The new government on Monday approved a “provocative” march by Israeli far-right nationalists and pro-settler groups through occupied East Jerusalem. Thousands of people, waving flags and some chanting “Death to Arabs” paraded in East Jerusalem on Tuesday, drawing anger and condemnation from Palestinians.\n\nIn another anti-Palestinian chant, Israeli demonstrators shouted: “May your village burn.”) an inflammatory far-right march through East Jerusalem that is likely to have inflamed tensions.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Foreign minister Yair Lapid [spoke out against](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/15/israel-launches-air-raids-on-gaza-palestinian-security-sources)(In a scathing condemnation on Twitter, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said those shouting racist slogans were “a disgrace to the Israeli people”, adding: “The fact that there are radicals for whom the Israeli flag represents hatred and racism is abominable and unforgivable.”) the actions of those marching.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Members of the coalition [recognised](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/15/israel-launches-air-raids-on-gaza-palestinian-security-sources)(Mansour Abbas, whose United Arab List \(Ra’am\) party is the first Arab faction to join an Israeli coalition, said Tuesday’s march was “an attempt to set the region on fire for political aims,” with the intention of undermining the new government.\n\nAbbas said the police and public security minister should have canceled the event. “I call on all sides not to be dragged into an escalation and maintain maximum restraint,” he said.\n\nIn past years, the march passed through Damascus Gate and into the heart of the Muslim Quarter, a crowded Palestinian neighbourhood with narrow streets and alleys. But police changed the route on Tuesday to avoid the Muslim Quarter.) that the march should have been cancelled.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: The Israeli police forcibly [removed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/15/gaza-protests-against-israeli-right-wing-march-through-jerusalem)(Ahead of the march, Israeli police forcibly removed dozens of Palestinians from outside the Old City’s Damascus Gate. At least 17 Palestinians were arrested and 33 others were wounded as Israeli police fired stun grenades in the surrounding areas of Damascus Gate.) those protesting the march.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: Netanyahu's stubbornness led President Barack Obama to [state](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-says-the-prospect-of-israeli-palestinian-peace-seems-very-dim/2015/03/24/11206182-d241-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.523e84e2be08) that there was little, if any, possibility of negotiations towards reducing tensions between Israel and Palestine.
1.1.2.4.1.3.1.4. Con: Netanyahu had [claimed](http://www.vox.com/2015/3/19/8258515/netanyahu-palestinian-walkback) that he principally supported the idea of a Palestinian state but that he didn't think it was capable of self-governing. This meant that there was potential to convince him to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
1.1.2.4.1.3.2. Pro: After Donald Trump was elected president, right-wing Israeli politicians [declared](http://www.jpost.com/US-Elections/Donald-Trump/Likud-MKs-react-to-Trumps-victory-in-US-Presidential-Election-472088) that the era of a Palestinian state was over.
1.1.2.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party - a lynchpin of Israel’s nationalist right and current coalition partner and Education Minister - stated that there will [never](http://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-no-palestinian-state-even-if-world-penalizes-israel/) be a Palestinian state, even if the world penalises Israel.
1.1.2.4.1.3.3. Con: If the public supports a two-state solution, then if the political establishment maintains its opposition to the idea, it will likely be voted out in future elections.
1.1.2.4.1.3.3.1. Con: Often Israelis rank [security](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/4/9/israel-elections-what-are-the-key-issues-for-voters)(Security, corruption and the economy are key issues for Israelis before the vote.\n\nThe top concern for voters is security, according to a poll conducted by political analyst Mitchell Barak of Keevon Strategies.) highly as a voting issue, however this does not mean that they would support two states as a resolution to this anxiety.
1.1.2.4.1.3.3.2. Con: Only [16%](http://www.timesofisrael.com/for-43-of-likely-voters-economic-issues-not-the-palestinians-or-iran-are-top-priority/) of Israeli voters ranked deterioration of relations with Palestinians as their most important issue in the 2013 elections. The two-state solution will likely not be the deciding factor in any election.
1.1.2.4.1.4. Pro: The Israeli public perceives the status quo as unsustainable in the long run; specifically, many Israelis believe that the current state of the conflict poses threats to [Israel's security](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/americans-favor-two-state-solution-more-israelis-and-palestinians-do).
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Israel has repeatedly waged war against the Gaza Strip in recent years. From the Israeli perspective, diplomacy is probably a lost cause in this conflict.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Israel has [repeatedly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Defensive_Shield) [undertaken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008–09\)) [military operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense) to stem the tide of Palestinian terrorism.
1.1.2.4.2.2. Con: Israel can wage war against the Palestinians because it knows it can rely on US support to deflect international criticism and scrutiny. American recognition of Palestine could force Israel to change the way it approaches the conflict.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: Israel is [ready](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-pm-seeks-us-okay-to-annex-settlements-cede-arab-cities-to-palestinians/) to do land swaps with Palestine in order to make a secure border for the population of both future states.
1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Israel's unwillingness to engage in peace talks is due to [domestic political considerations](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-offered-israel-secret-peace-deal-in-2016-but-netanyahu-walked-away-a7588526.html). A US declaration may empower small far-right parties, and exacerbate the domestic barriers to negotiating a two-state solution.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Con: Polls [indicate that](https://knessetjeremy.com/knessetjeremy-polling-average-the-israeli-poll-of-polls/) throughout the first half of 2017, Yesh Atid - which supports a two-state solution - has been either the most popular or second-most popular party among Israeli voters.
1.1.2.4.4.2. Pro: 42% of Israeli Jews consider settlements to be [beneficial](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-03-08/poll-plurality-of-israelis-think-settlements-help-security) towards Israel's security. Future governments will be constrained by the will of the public.
1.1.2.4.4.2.1. Con: Jewish settlers in Palestinian territory [regularly come under attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/middleeast/west-bank-kiryat-arba.html?_r=0) by Palestinian extremists.
1.1.2.4.4.3. Con: If domestic politics in Israel make any concessions to Palestinians impossible, this step needs to be taken in order to force the Israeli establishment into coming to the negotiating table.
1.1.2.4.4.4. Pro: This declaration could empower insular, far-right narratives about how [Israel is the only safe place for Jews](http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-to-french-jews-israel-is-your-home/) and that [the world hates Israel](http://www.newsweek.com/tel-aviv-diary-bibi-rails-against-world-536597). This would not encourage moderation or openness.
1.1.2.4.5. Con: Even if Israel did not follow suit and recognize Palestine, Palestinians would still see many benefits to US recognition.
1.1.2.4.5.1. Con: US recognition would up the pressure on all parties to find a solution for the conflict.
1.1.2.4.5.1.1. Pro: The [UN Security Council](https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11722.doc.htm) resolution that called for a swift Israeli withdrawal from the territories captured in 1967 would have passed with US support.
1.1.2.4.5.2. Pro: Palestine would be able to [directly participate](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rosyln-fuller/palestinian-statehood-the_b_978245.html) in international organizations such as the UN and the World Bank.
1.1.2.4.5.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that participation in international organisations would have a notable effect on the political realities on the ground and the conditions under which Palestinians live.
1.1.2.4.5.2.2. Pro: Direct participation in international institutions increases Palestine's lobbying power.
1.1.2.4.5.2.2.1. Con: Power within many institutions is likely to be very small; even states like China have a proportionally small voting power share e.g. [4.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank#Voting_power) at the World Bank, and [6.4%](https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx) at the IMF.
1.1.2.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: If Palestine was a [member](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/leadership/members)(The organizations that make up the World Bank Group are owned by the governments of member nations, which have the ultimate decision-making power within the organizations on all matters, including policy, financial or membership issues.\n\nMember countries govern the World Bank Group through the Boards of Governors and the Boards of Executive Directors. These bodies make all major decisions for the organizations.\n\nTo become a member of the Bank, under the IBRD Articles of Agreement, a country must first join the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\). Membership in IDA, IFC and MIGA are conditional on membership in IBRD.) of the World Bank, it could vote on the Bank's Executive Directors, influencing projects carried out in the West Bank and Gaza.
1.1.2.4.5.2.3. Pro: Although Israel does not recognise Palestine, statehood would allow Palestine to [appear](https://www.icj.org/palestine-icj-makes-submission-to-international-criminal-court-arguing-for-jurisdiction-over-serious-crimes/) before the International Court of Justice vis-à-vis other states to resolve any international disputes in a peaceful manner.
1.1.2.4.5.2.4. Pro: A majority of UN members [voted](https://www.rt.com/news/217975-unsc-palestine-statehood-vote/) in favour of supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state; it only failed in the UN Security Council when the US vetoed against it.
1.1.2.4.5.3. Pro: Recognition would allow Palestine to [easily trade on an international level](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rosyln-fuller/palestinian-statehood-the_b_978245.html) and independently broker foreign investment.
1.1.2.4.5.3.1. Con: The ability to negotiate trade agreements would be useless if Israel maintains its [blockades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip) in Gaza, as it is likely to do.
1.1.2.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: The Gazan blockade is [necessary](https://www.brookings.edu/research/ending-gazas-perpetual-crisis-a-new-u-s-approach/)(Israel, with support from Egypt and, in recent years, from the Palestinian Authority \(PA\), has used a blockade to deter Hamas and deprive it of materiel. This dynamic has led to intermittent bouts of conflict. When the situation escalates, the international community has stepped in, led by Egypt and the U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process \(UNSCO\), to negotiate fragile, temporary cease-fires and marginal economic relief for Gaza.) to prevent Hamas from growing stronger.
1.1.2.4.5.3.1.1.1. Con: With an arsenal of [tens of thousands of rockets](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-rockets-hamas-israel.html) and other mortar projectiles, the current Gazan blockade is clearly useless; it is unlikely Hamas' capabilities would drastically change if the blockade were to be lifted.
1.1.2.4.5.3.1.2. Pro: The US has [also imposed sanctions](http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-imposes-sanctions-on-gaza-institutions-over-hamas-links-1.264983) on Gazan institutions as it realises the link between Hamas and the region. It may be difficult to persuade the US to remove these.
1.1.2.4.6. Pro: Israel is so heavily invested in its settlements and businesses in the Occupied Territories that it would never agree to negotiate a two-state solution.
1.1.2.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.4.2.
1.1.2.4.6.2. Con: There is a trend of [decreasing](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.599003) support among the Israeli public for the settlers. This will likely not be a constraining factor on future governments.
1.1.2.4.6.3. Pro: Israel has currently [established](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.772720) 14 economic zones in the West Bank that entrench its presence in the Palestinian territory.
1.1.2.4.6.3.1. Con: The [economy](http://www.timesofisrael.com/for-43-of-likely-voters-economic-issues-not-the-palestinians-or-iran-are-top-priority/) is the most important issue for most Israeli voters. As [the costs](http://www.haaretz.com/settlements-have-cost-israel-17-billion-study-finds-1.265190) of settlements increase, it is unlikely that settlements will swing the vote in favour of continued occupation. This is likely to stifle the continuation of Israeli economic zones in Palestine.
1.1.2.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: One study found that Israeli settlements in Palestine could cost up to [$17 billion by 2012](http://www.haaretz.com/settlements-have-cost-israel-17-billion-study-finds-1.265190). This has led to increasing opposition to settlements within Israeli society.
1.1.2.4.6.3.2. Pro: Israeli [blockades and draconian controls](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/14/palestine-economy-how-does-it-work)(A complex web of checkpoints and roadblocks make it difficult for Palestinians to travel within the Palestinian Territories for jobs, to bank or to trade. Farmers whose land is now behind the barrier are required to apply for 'visitor permits' which Israel regularly rejects - in Akkaba it approved 49% of applications in 2011, and just 20% by 2012. More recently, a report from the World Bank found that Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone cost the Palestinian economy $3.4bn \(£2.1bn\) a year, or 35% of its GDP.) make it difficult for the Palestinian people to find gainful employment.
1.1.2.4.6.3.3. Pro: Economic zones operate as a convenient way for Israel to get around the issue of legality of settlements: land is declared for industrial use, yet is often [populated](http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/201203_under_the_guise_of_legality) by settlements, and is not that important for the economy.
1.1.2.4.6.4. Pro: There are [406,000 Israeli settlers](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/213234) living in the West Bank, an increase of 29% since 2010. This is nearly 5% of Israel's population.
1.1.2.4.6.4.1. Pro: Ultra-orthodox Jews have [much higher birth rates](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/israel-has-the-highest-birth-rate-in-the-developed-world-and-thats-becoming-a-problem-2015-9?r=US&IR=T) than the general population. Given that [many settlers are ultra-orthodox](http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-look-at-israeli-settlers-by-the-numbers/), the number of Israelis in the Occupied Territories will continue increasing rapidly for the foreseeable future.
1.1.2.4.6.5. Con: The status quo involves nearly complete [alienation from the international community](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.735598).
1.1.2.5. Con: Israel can currently refuse to return to negotiations, despite strong international pressure, as it perceives US support as unconditional; US recognition of Palestine might counter this belief.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Israel believes that [under Republican administrations](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/8/11175136/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gop), it has free rein to do whatever it wants without any risk of jeopardizing its relationship with the US. Showing that a Republican president is willing to exert pressure for peace would force Israel to become more accountable.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: The Obama administration's decision to [break](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-declines-to-veto-un-security-council-resolution-for-israel-to-stop-jewish-settlement-activity/2016/12/23/cd4efe72-c939-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.43b2a1267411) a long tradition of vetoing UN Security Council resolutions criticising Israel was seen as a [strong rebuke](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-settlements-un-vote.html) of Israel, and if the Obama administration had remained in office, it would have been seen as a major shift in US policy towards Israel.
1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: The Obama administration could afford to allow the resolution to pass because it was near the end of the administration's tenure, and because the election had already happened. Under [normal circumstances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_UN_resolutions_concerning_Israel_and_Palestine), an American administration would never have the political support to do something like this.
1.1.2.5.3. Con: Recognition of Palestine is largely symbolic, and a willingness to do so does not signal a willingness to more substantively exert pressure on Israel \(for example, by cutting military aid\), so Israel will continue to act with impunity.
1.1.2.5.3.1. Pro: The US's unfailing support for Israel is the product of a set of [political factors](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5929705/us-israel-friends) that will remain for the foreseeable future, so it is highly unlikely that the US will ever substantively reduce the degree of its support for Israel.
1.1.2.5.3.2. Con: The symbolic gesture in question is massive and unprecedented; a willingness to do it signals a general shift in attitude towards Israel on the part of the US, and Israel would be very worried about that shift in attitude.
1.1.3. Con: [Decoupling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-five-percent/201205/the-decade-peace-in-israel-palestine) the Israeli-Palestine conflict from larger regional and world political issues \(e.g. relations with Iran\) could simplify the peace process.
1.1.3.1. Con: Decoupling would lead to a [failed policy](https://theweichertreport.com/2017/05/28/the-linkage-between-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-and-iran/); Israel's oppressive counter-terrorism and security measures are the result of an Iranian threat. They will not leave until this is resolved.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Analyses of resolutions of similar conflicts in other world regions, such as Mozambique, suggest that peace is more likely to follow when force and authority are replaced with "[weak power](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-five-percent/201205/the-decade-peace-in-israel-palestine)(Case studies of intractable conflicts like Mozambique in the 1980s-90s where sustainable resolutions eventually emerged have taught us that forceful interventions by powerful authorities or third-parties rarely help for long. Paradoxically, they have shown that it is often weaker third-parties who employ softer forms of power \(are trust-worthy, unthreatening, reliable, and without a strong independent agenda\) who often are most effective as catalysts for change.)."
1.1.4. Pro: As no workable alternative is in sight, the only viable option for Israel and Palestine is the continuation and mutual acceptance of the political status quo.
1.1.4.1. Pro: As of 2009, three-quarters of Israelis found the continuation of the status quo at least tolerable and more than half found it to be acceptable or even desirable \([p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Israelis [benefit the most](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210806-the-status-quo-is-being-reinforced-for-israels-benefit/) by maintaining the status quo; their attitudes should not be considered especially important when evaluating if things should change.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Israel currently [controls](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/15/water-war-palestinians-demand-more-water-access-from-israel)(Israel directly controls 85 percent of water resources in the West Bank and has a say in how the rest is distributed, Palestinian officials told Al Jazeera. The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, is seeking Israeli licenses to dig additional wells in the West Bank to fill the enormous need for more water.\n\nAdel Yassin, director-general of strategic planning at the Palestinian Water Authority, told Al Jazeera the Israeli water company Mekorot that supplies the occupied territories controls 42 water wells, 34 of which are located in the Jordan Valley.\n\n“The problem is not a shortage of water but the occupation’s control of our water,” said Yassin.) most of the water supply within the West Bank.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: A lack of economic pressure on Israel also [reinforces the status quo](https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/119288551/lack-of-economic-pressure-lets-israel-maintain-status-quo) and inspires very little change.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The intractability of the conflict \([pp. 610-619](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642446_Why_Does_Fear_Override_Hope_in_Societies_Engulfed_by_Intractable_Conflict_as_It_Does_in_the_Israeli_Society)\) between Palestinians and Israel \([p. 71](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227657606_Socio-Psychological_Barriers_to_Peace_Making_The_Case_of_the_Israeli_Jewish_Society)\) has been linked to underlying emotions and collective emotional \([pp. 447-450](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.8432&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\) orientations that fuel thinking and beliefs which make any progress next to impossible, especially as strong emotions are often [immune](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40607979.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A9d7e89b17ec5614b927244689024ed89)(Revolutionary research in the brain sciences has overturned conventional views of the relationship between emotion, rationality, and beliefs. Because rationality depends on emotion, and because cognition and emotion are nearly indistinguishable in the brain, one can view emotion as constituting and strengthening beliefs such as trust, nationalism, justice or credibility. For example, a belief that another's commitment is credible depends on one's selection \(and interpretation\) of evidence and one's assessment of risk, both of which rely on emotion. Observing that emotion and cognition co-produce beliefs has policy implications: how one fights terrorism changes if one views credibility as an emotional belief.) to logical argumentation.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: As evidenced by the weakened position of the Israeli left and the sustained strength of the right-wing conservative agenda, the Israeli people are [not interested in changing the status quo](https://asiatimes.com/2019/02/israeli-voters-think-the-status-quo-is-just-fine/).
1.1.4.2. Con: The status quo has resulted in [at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)) [least](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense) [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict) wars fought in Palestine within the last decade alone. They resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and destruction of significant amounts of critical infrastructure.
1.1.4.3. Con: Israel violates international law; therefore, maintaining the political status quo is not likely to be a good outcome.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: The effective annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel in 1967 was and continues to be illegal.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: [Customary international law](http://www.unrod.org/docs/ICJ-Advisory2004.pdf)(p. 7) defines Israel's actions as an 'occupation,' not an 'illegal occupation' or occupation which would be considered 'against international law.'
1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Israeli occupation of Palestine has never been judged to be illegal in the 52 years of its existence as [governed by](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2020_01501.PDF)(paragraph 2) the 'regulations annexed to the Hague Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.'
1.1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: [A number of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_Israeli_settlements) United Nations [resolutions](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/446) affirm that Israel, the occupying power, engages in acts that violate international law within Palestine. This suggests that the illegality stems from the coincidence of illegal action with occupation \(even if occupation was legal\).
1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The International Court of Justice found that Israel [effectively annexed](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199588893.001.0001/law-9780199588893-chapter-8) East Jerusalem with the 1980 Jerusalem Law.
1.1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: The extension of Israeli law over East Jerusalem [did not equate to annexation](https://www.polisci.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/Lustick_Has%20Israel%20Annexed%20Jerusalem_1997.pdf)(p. 40). Israel had not annexed East Jerusalem, but merely extended its norms and laws over the eastern half of the city.
1.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: Numerous [UN Security Council](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199588893.001.0001/law-9780199588893-chapter-8) and General Assembly resolutions regard Israeli presence in East Jerusalem as "invalid".
1.1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: The 1980 [Jerusalem Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Law), which proclaimed the whole city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, was condemned as a "[violation of international law](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/DDE590C6FF232007852560DF0065FDDB)" by the UN Security Council.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Israeli actions are [in breach](https://www.wrmea.org/2021-august-september/destruction-as-a-tool-of-oppression-in-the-u.s.-and-israel.html)(The extent and destructiveness of Israel’s demolition/removal plans are striking. The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions estimates that from the beginning of the occupation in 1967 up to 2019, Israel has razed 49,532 Palestinian structures, displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Although Israel’s home demolitions are illegal under international law, the government uses them as a tool for territorial expansion. \n\nOccupied East Jerusalem, Galilee and the Negev \(the Naqab to Palestinians\) are Israel’s most recent targets—labeled by state planners as “at risk” because of the high number of Palestinians living there.) of the material preconditions based in Articles 50 and 51, such as respect for fundamental human rights, or [proportionality](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/17/israel-gaza-conflict-200-palestinians-killed-in-a-week-say-officials) of actions.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Israeli actions violate [Articles 52 and 53](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf)(p. 14) of the International Law Commission. Notably, countermeasures should end once attacks stop, but the occupation has continued even when attacks have stopped.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Fatah [pledged to stop attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/11/israel) on Israel in 2002. Thus, Palestine complied with the demands of Israel.
1.1.4.3.4. Con: Israel has [the right](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2198669?origin=crossref&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents) to occupy and annex Palestine as it was legally captured by Israel.
1.1.4.3.4.1. Pro: The collapse of the Ottoman Empire left a gap in the [de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure) chain of sovereign custody, stifling application of the law. As the [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) occupying power, Israel bears responsibility to those under its authority, but the appropriate disposition of lands must be negotiated.
1.1.4.3.4.2. Con: Palestine has been illegally occupied since 1967, the acting Chairman of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Falilou Kane expressed in an [official letter](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185589/) in 1980 to the President of the Security Council.
1.1.4.3.4.3. Pro: Contrary to the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, the ICC [considers](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/131) the West Bank as 'Occupied Territories' not as 'illegally occupied'.
1.1.4.3.4.3.1. Con: Neither Gaza nor the West Bank are under the control of a hostile army as required to be classified as 'occupied' by [Art. 42](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/195-200052?OpenDocument) of the Hague Convention.
1.1.4.3.4.3.1.1. Con: [50.4% of people surveyed in Palestine](http://www.pcpo.org/index.php/polls/124-poll-no-200) support a third Intifada \(uprising\) against Israel, suggesting the majority of the population sees the country as a hostile force, even if the IDF's military presence is accepted by the Palestinian Authority.
1.1.4.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: The presence of Israeli military forces on the ground in the West Bank was agreed upon by the 1995 interim agreement in [Art. 10](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/IL%20PS_950928_InterimAgreementWestBankGazaStrip%28OsloII%29.pdf).
1.1.4.3.4.3.1.2.1. Con: The Palestinian Authority is [no longer representative](http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Suspended-democracy-for-Palestinians-468995) of the Palestinian people since elections have not happened for the past 10 years. In a democratic Palestine, Palestinians may have voted in support for revoking that treaty.
1.1.4.3.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: The US ended the formal occupation of Iraq with an interim agreement in 2004, despite troops remaining in the country \([p. 4](http://jcpa.org/text/occupation-sharon.pdf)\). These soldiers were no longer considered hostile or combatant because their presence was agreed upon. This is analogous to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
1.1.4.3.4.3.2. Pro: In an advisory opinion the [International Court of Justice](http://www.unrod.org/docs/ICJ-Advisory2004.pdf) refers to the 'occupied territories' \(p. 1\).
1.1.4.3.4.4. Con: Although the occupation in 1967 may have been legal, the continuing belligerent occupation of Palestine for more than 50 years goes against other elements of international law, such as the right of Palestinians to self-determination \([Article 2](https://legal.un.org/repertory/art2.shtml)\).
1.1.4.3.5. Pro: Israel has continued to build settlements in the West Bank which [entrenches](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/the-stream/2017/2/2/entrenching-israeli-settlements-in-palestinian-land) its position in Palestine. These settlements are illegal.
1.1.4.3.5.1. Con: The verdict that settlements are illegal is more influenced by the general [unpopularity](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-illegal-settlements-myth/) of them rather than a close legal scrutiny.
1.1.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: Legal judgements of actors are often influenced by public perception. The general court of the EU, for example, took [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/hamas-taken-off-eu-terror-blacklist) off the EU's terror list, arguing that the inclusion was not based on sound legal reasoning but media reports.
1.1.4.3.5.2. Con: Article 6 of the [League of Nations' 1922 Palestine Mandate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/israeli-settlements-on-the-west-bank-are-disputed-not-illegal/2016/10/03/523c0196-872e-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_story.html?utm_term=.6bb3e2ac010c) encourages Israeli settlements west of the Jordan River. [Article 80](https://legal.un.org/repertory/art80.shtml) of the UN Charter accepts this provision and carries it over into current international law.
1.1.4.3.5.2.1. Con: Palestine was never part of the UN trusteeship system and as such Art 80 does not apply here. The closest Palestine came to trusteeship status was the [unsuccessful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_trusteeship_proposal_for_Palestine) attempt by Harry Truman in 1948.
1.1.4.3.5.2.2. Con: Israel has not held itself [answerable to the United Nations](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/01/27/rogue-state-israeli-violations-of-u-n-security-council-resolutions/), the body which replaced the League of Nations, as such Israel expanding to fulfill instructions by an international body is simply opportunistic.
1.1.4.3.5.3. Con: Settlements are merely a [return](http://observer.com/2017/01/united-nations-jewish-settlements-arent-illegal-and-have-nothing-to-do-with-peace/) of Jewish settlers that were expelled by Arabs before 1947.
1.1.4.3.5.3.1. Pro: Settlements like [Gush Etzion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion) or [Naharayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naharayim) were destroyed by Arab legions prior to 1948. Israel is merely rebuilding these settlements currently.
1.1.4.3.5.3.2. Con: This claim is at least partially not true, as the Jewish population in the whole of Historic Palestine in [1946 was 602,586](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248723811_Justin_Mccarthy_The_population_of_Palestine_population_statistics_of_the_late_Ottoman_period_and_the_Mandate_Institute_for_Palestine_Studies_Series_xxvii_242_pp) \(31%\). As of December 2015, [altogether over 800,000](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/18210#.VpK885scTIU) Israeli Jews resided over the 1949 Armistice Lines \(including east-Jerusalem neighborhoods\).
1.1.4.3.5.4. Pro: The UN Security Council [declared](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm) that Israel’s establishment of settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation of international law and a major obstacle to the vision of two states.
1.1.4.3.5.5. Pro: Israeli settlements are often built on [private](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100482.html) Palestinian [land](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-settlements-vote-idUSKBN15L2F3) which is illegally acquired, often by evicting Palestinians from their homes. This reduces the land owned by Palestinians, narrowing the potential space that could be allotted to a future Palestinian state.
1.1.4.3.5.5.1. Pro: 70 per cent of \(Israel-administered\) [Area C land](http://www.btselem.org/area_c/what_is_area_c) in the West Bank is [off-limits for Palestinian construction](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/71A1FD027B82B40D852580EA0064468F) and development. This makes Israeli settlements more egregious as the Palestinians cannot likewise expand.
1.1.4.3.5.5.2. Con: In many instances, Palestinians do not have legal title to the land.
1.1.4.3.5.5.2.1. Pro: Land outside cities often don't have [land titles](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/24/401282811/clearing-the-tangled-path-for-land-ownership-in-the-west-bank). This makes Palestinian land outside of cities an easy target for settlement expansions.
1.1.4.3.5.5.2.2. Con: Historically, from Ottoman rule to the British mandate to Jordanian annexation, [registration of land ownership has been rare](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/24/401282811/clearing-the-tangled-path-for-land-ownership-in-the-west-bank); when undertaken, it has been done inefficiently. It is wrong to confiscate land from innocent Palestinians for the administrative failures of their previous rulers.
1.1.4.3.5.5.2.3. Pro: The World Bank noted that in one of their projects, only [7000 out of 22,000](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/24/401282811/clearing-the-tangled-path-for-land-ownership-in-the-west-bank) hectares of Palestine have land deeds.
1.1.4.3.5.5.2.4. Pro: The Jewish settler group Nahalat Shimon was able to evict Palestinian families from their homes in [East Jerusalem](http://www.refworld.org/docid/4a82b72328.html) because they did not own titles to the land.
1.1.4.3.5.5.3. Con: In cases where Palestinians are able to show land ownership, as around [Amona](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/09/israel--palestinian-struggle-against-new-amona-settlement.html), this obstructs further settlements.
1.1.4.3.5.5.3.1. Con: Attempts to remove Israeli settlers from the small settlement of Amona resulted in [violent clashes](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/02/01/israel-evicts-west-bank-outpost-as-new-settlements-approved-day-before.html) and pressure for a [bill to legalize settlements](http://www.timesofisrael.com/facing-backlash-over-amona-jewish-home-leaders-vow-to-pass-legalization-bill/).
1.1.4.3.5.5.3.1.1. Pro: Removal of Israeli settlers from Gaza led to violent clashes with the IDF and an [emotive backlash](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.667736) from the settlers.
1.1.4.3.5.5.3.2. Pro: Eventually, the settlement of Amona was removed because it was found to be [illegal](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/2/1/israel-evacuates-settlers-from-illegal-amona-outpost).
1.1.4.3.5.5.4. Pro: Land taken by Israel through military requisition orders was declared [illegal](http://www.btselem.org/download/201007_by_hook_and_by_crook_eng.pdf)(p. 22) by the Israel High Court of Justice, yet these orders have not been stopped, nor has the land previously been seized returned.
1.1.4.3.5.6. Pro: The International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion on Israel’s Separation Wall in 2004 reaffirmed the illegality of settlements \([p. 196](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf)\).
1.1.4.4. Pro: As of 2009, a majority of Palestinians were willing to accept or even embrace a continuation of the political status quo under the condition that the Palestinian territories would be able to develop economically \([p. 4](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)\).
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Asked about the most serious problems confronting Palestinian society today, slightly more Palestinians name unemployment and poverty than occupation and settlements. The economy is thus of at least as much relevance to Palestinians as the political situation \([pp. 1-2](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(Table P20)\).
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: Economic problems are the [result](http://www.ps.undp.org/content/papp/en/home/countryinfo.html) of occupation and settlements; so in fact, concern about the economy indicates that the political status quo is of great importance to Palestinians.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Economic mobility within the West Bank is hindered substantially by a system of [blockades and checkpoints](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/14/palestine-economy-how-does-it-work). Given that these are maintained for security reasons to prevent terrorist attacks, Israel will never agree to lift them.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Gaza's economic development is crippled by the [Israeli blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip), which is maintained for security reasons; lifting it would result in increased rocket and terrorist attacks so it will never be lifted, forcing economic dependence on Israel.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Gazans are, on average, [worse off than in the 1990s](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20415675).
1.1.4.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [poverty rate in Gaza](https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/poverty/33EF03BB-9722-4AE2-ABC7-AA2972D68AFE/Global_POVEQ_PSE.pdf) is greater than 50% and increasing. In contrast, the poverty rate in West Bank is less than 15% and improving \(p. 1\).
1.1.4.4.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The unemployment rate is significantly [higher in Gaza](https://gisha.org/en/gaza-unemployment-rate-soars-to-50-2-in-months-following-may-escalation/) \(50%\) - particularly among [young Gazans](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675) - than in [West Bank](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/gaza-unemployment-rate-second-quarter-2020-491).
1.1.4.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: The Israeli blockade of Gaza [hampers](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30948#.WPapC1KZORt) UN relief work. Important construction material required for rebuilding houses and roads is not allowed to enter Gaza.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: The attitude of Palestinians has probably changed dramatically since 2009, especially considering major events since then like the [2014 war in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict).
1.1.4.4.3. Con: [More than half](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of Palestinians support the return to an armed intifada.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: "[Israeli-imposed economic restrictions continue to constrain sustainable economic growth](http://www.ps.undp.org/content/papp/en/home/countryinfo.html)" in Palestine. By removing these restrictions, it would be possible to promote economic growth without large-scale political change.
1.1.4.5. Pro: Palestinians have been consistently responsible for the failure of peace processes, forcing Israel to maintain an occupying force in order to protect itself.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: Palestinian militants are a threat to Israel.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: The number of Israelis killed by Palestinian militants is so [small](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/total-casualties-arab-israeli-conflict) - less than 100 Israelis per year - that it could not be considered a legitimate security concern.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Pro: When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was taken over by Hamas, which then used the territory to launch [numerous missile attacks](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32053999) on Israeli civilian targets. The same would happen in the case that Israel ends its presence in Palestinian territory.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Israel already easily defends itself from these missile attacks from Gaza using the [Iron Dome missile defense system](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.604039). The success of this system makes obsolete the need for continued occupation.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Iron Dome is still not a perfect defense. In the 2014 Gaza War, [Israeli civilians were still killed](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/unlawful-and-deadly-palestinian-rocket-attacks-gaza) by rocket fire from Gaza.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: Iron Dome can intercept [approximately 90%](http://aviationweek.com/defense/iron-dome-blunts-90-enemy-rockets) of all projectiles fired from Gaza.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.3. Con: Each interceptor missile [costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome#Cost) $20,000-$50,000 USD. Continually utilizing missile defense would drain the Israeli security budget.
1.1.4.5.1.2.2. Pro: If Israel does not militarily control the West Bank then it would have to take [military actions](https://www.idfblog.com/facts-figures/rocket-attacks-toward-israel/) to curb missile attacks, as was carried out in Gaza in 2008, and 2012. This results in excessive civilian casualties, and the destruction of infrastructure.
1.1.4.5.1.3. Pro: [Every year](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/comprehensive-listing-of-terrorism-victims-in-israel) Israelis die from terror attacks committed by Palestinians or launched from Palestinian territory.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: Palestinians list [preconditions](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/PA-Only-precondition-for-talks-is-that-Israel-announce-commitment-to-two-states-499991) to engage in peace talks. If a party needs to be brought back to the negotiation table, it is Palestine.
1.1.4.5.3. Pro: Israel has offered Palestine sovereignty on multiple occasions, these offers have been consistently rejected.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Con: Abbas has consistently, and [recently](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/03/remember-the-two-state-solution-abbas-does/), accepted the two-state solution. Rejection of individual peace plans because of their flaws is not the same as rejecting the two-state solution itself.
1.1.4.5.3.2. Con: Israel has also rejected peace plans, yet that does not mean it has rejected the two-state solution.
1.1.4.5.3.2.1. Pro: Netanyahu [rejected](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-Netanyahu-rejected-peace-plan-proposed-by-Kerry-at-secret-2016-meeting-481969) a peace plan proposed by former US Secretary of State John Kerry in a secret 2016 meeting.
1.1.4.5.3.2.2. Pro: Israel [rejected](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1547036/Israel-rejects-Arab-peace-initiative.html) an Arab peace initiative in 2007.
1.1.4.5.3.3. Pro: [Almost two thirds](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) of Palestinians support abandoning the Oslo Accords, and thereby the foundations of the American-supported peace talks.
1.1.4.5.3.4. Pro: Abbas rejected a peace proposal made by Olmert in [2008](http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-admits-he-rejected-2008-peace-offer-from-olmert/).
1.1.4.5.3.4.1. Con: Olmert's offer lacked [transparency](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Details-of-Olmerts-peace-offer-to-Palestinians-exposed-314261) as he was unwilling to provide a map of the envisioned partition of Jerusalem. Therefore, the offer was difficult to accept.
1.1.4.5.3.4.2. Con: [Olmert blames](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Details-of-Olmerts-peace-offer-to-Palestinians-exposed-314261) the failure of the peace process on Israeli ministers Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak.
1.1.4.5.3.5. Pro: After disillusionment with Israel's refusal to negotiate and arrive at a peace treaty, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, sought to [bypass the peace process](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-08-19/palestine-goes-un) with Israel, showing that he believed it to be beyond recovery.
1.1.4.5.3.6. Pro: US officials blame Abbas for '[shutting down](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/indyk-netanyahu-and-abbas-loathe-each-other/373922/)' during the 2014 peace negotiations, even though Israel was prepared for an agreement.
1.1.4.5.3.6.1. Con: Abbas had [no choice](https://newrepublic.com/article/118751/how-israel-palestine-peace-deal-died) but to walk away from those negotiations as Israel refused to stop expanding its settlements, a move designed to undermine Abbas and portray him as having made a peace deal by selling off Palestinian land.
1.1.4.5.3.7. Pro: A US-European draft resolution at the UN Security Council that would have extended the Palestinian Authority's authority to the Gaza Strip and stipulated the immediate start of reconstruction was [rejected](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20150227-pa-rejects-draft-resolution-to-extend-its-control-of-the-gaza-strip/) by the Palestinian Authority itself.
1.1.4.5.4. Con: If the occupation had reasons to believe in a serious threat, Israeli civilians would not be allowed to settle there.
1.1.4.5.4.1. Pro: Settlers often [say](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38458884)(Settlers themselves choose to live in these communities for a range of reasons - from economic, encouraged by government subsidies, to religious, based on the belief that God gave the land to the Jewish people.) they live in occupied Palestine because the land was promised to them by God.
1.1.4.5.5. Con: The Oslo Accords were a land-for-peace deal. Israeli settlement expansions and the creation of a security barrier that encroached on Palestinian land were clear indications of Israel's [non-compliance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine) with the peace agreement.
1.1.4.5.6. Con: The failure of the Camp David negotiations in 2000 were the result of Israel's unacceptable demands.
1.1.4.5.6.1. Pro: Barak's offer was not sufficient as it only envisioned a gradual control over only 92% of the West Bank \([p. 16](http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/pressman.pdf)\).
1.1.4.5.6.2. Pro: Israel demanded a demilitarized state \([p. 16](http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/pressman.pdf)\). This would have abrogated Palestine's right to self-determination.
1.1.4.5.6.3. Pro: In an interview, Barak admitted that a "[razor-thin](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/06/13/camp-david-and-after-an-exchange-1-an-interview-wi/)" strip of territory between Jerusalem and the Jordan River would have been transferred to Israeli control. This would have cut the West Bank apart and therefore was not acceptable to the Palestinians.
1.1.5. Con: Previous peace talks have failed due to random, unpredictable, external setbacks, not internal factors. US recognition of Palestine is required to force Israel back to the negotiating table.
1.1.5.1. Pro: The [Taba Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba_Summit#End_of_the_negotiations) in 2001 by Clinton almost reached a final settlement, however upcoming Israeli elections meant that they could not be continued.
1.1.5.2. Pro: [2017 negotiations](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.775258) between Netanyahu and the Israeli leader of the opposition indicated plans for dramatic moves towards territorial compromise and peace, but the Amona Crisis destroyed the negotiations.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: The negotiations failed when Netanyahu [consciously decided](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-offered-israel-secret-peace-deal-in-2016-but-netanyahu-walked-away-a7588526.html) not to allow the opposition party into his coalition.
1.1.5.3. Pro: The Oslo Accords, signed in 1993 and 1995, ultimately failed due to [Yitzhak Rabin's assassination](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/26/shot-in-the-heart).
1.1.5.4. Con: The [decline](https://freedomhouse.org/country/gaza-strip/freedom-world/2020)(In March, the Hamas-led government cracked down on peaceful demonstrations against economic hardship, arresting more than 1,000 and beating a number of participants in what amounted to an escalation in repressive tactics.) in democratic norms within Palestine [limits](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2021/04/23/halting-palestine-s-democratic-decline-pub-84383)(The weakness of the Palestinian leadership has been a fundamental impediment that has further skewed the power dynamic in Israel’s favor.) strong and representative leadership.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Israelis have also indicated a [willingness](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-two-state-solution.html)(Jewish Israelis became much less likely to say that Israel should be “Jewish and democratic,” with growing factions saying that it should be democratic first or, slightly more popular, Jewish first.) to tradeoff democracy in order to preserve the Jewish nature of their state; this is unlikely to be palatable to the Palestinians.
1.1.5.4.2. Con: Though the PA may have abandoned democracy, Palestinians are still willing to take [peaceful, unified action](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/world/middleeast/palestine-strike.html)(But on Tuesday, they came together in a general strike to protest their shared treatment by Israel, in what many Palestinians described as a rare show of political unity.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, an independent politician who attended a rally in central Ramallah on Tuesday morning, said the protests constituted “a very significant day.”\n\n“It reflects how Palestinians now have a unified struggle against the same system of apartheid,” he added.) to defend their rights, and assert their desire for a state.
1.1.5.4.3. Con: As the [de facto](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/opinion/israel-palestine.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(Many diplomats and analysts around the world I have spoken to in recent years understand that the two-state solution is dead. Israel has killed it. When I ask why they don’t call for equal rights for Palestinians to end what is increasingly obviously a de facto apartheid system, they point out the official Palestinian position remains for a separate state. When they ask me what the Palestinian leadership is waiting for, I have no good answer.) position of Palestine is a two state solution, it is unclear why any renewed leadership is necessary.
1.1.5.4.4. Pro: Approximately half of Palestinians have [never voted](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2021/04/23/halting-palestine-s-democratic-decline-pub-84383)(Ninety-three percent of eligible voters across Gaza and the West Bank have registered—of which roughly half \(ages eighteen to thirty-three\) have never voted. For some Palestinians, it is a moment of hope; for the EU, it is a moment of sobriety.) as the last elections were held in 2006.
1.1.5.5. Con: The contested Jerusalem is likely to remain a [hot button issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-two-state-solution.html)(Both sides claim Jerusalem as their capital and consider it a center of religious worship and cultural heritage. The two-state solution typically calls for dividing it into an Israeli West and a Palestinian East, but it is not easy to draw the line — Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites are on top of one another. Israel has declared Jerusalem its “undivided capital,” effectively annexing its eastern half, and has built up construction that entrenches Israeli control of the city.) that waylays peace talks, particularly as Israel has annexed the Eastern half.
1.1.5.5.1. Pro: 2021 evictions from Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem [spurred](https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-gaza-what-we-know.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(The root of the latest violence is an intense dispute over East Jerusalem, which is predominantly Palestinian. Protests had gone on for days ahead of a Supreme Court ruling, originally expected on May 10 but then postponed, on the eviction of several Palestinian families from East Jerusalem. Israeli officials described it as a dispute over real estate. Many Arabs called it part of a wider Israeli campaign to force Palestinians out of the city, describing it as ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe protests sharply intensified after Israeli police prevented Palestinians from gathering near one of the Old City’s ancient gates, as they have customarily done during the holy month of Ramadan. The police responded on May 10 by raiding the Aqsa Mosque compound, one of Islam’s holiest sites, to keep Palestinian protesters from throwing stones, they said. Hundreds of Palestinians and a score of police officers were wounded in the skirmish.) protests from the Palestinians which escalated to 11 days of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas.
1.1.5.6. Con: The US should demand Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state before recognizing Palestine.
1.1.5.6.1. Pro: Recognising Palestine unconditionally gives away a valuable bargaining tool the US has to bring Palestine to the negotiating table.
1.1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Once a Palestinian state is recognised, the Palestinian Authority has little incentive to negotiate with the US or Israel.
1.1.5.6.1.2. Con: With the international community finally on its side, it makes little sense for the Palestinian Authority to act belligerent and uncooperative, laying waste to the diplomatic goodwill shown by the US in recognising it as a state.
1.1.5.6.2. Pro: Palestinians do not recognize Israel as a Jewish state which is an obstacle to the peace process.
1.1.5.6.2.1. Con: Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state could make Arab residents of Israel feel unwelcome and marginalized. This may cause domestic issues.
1.1.5.6.2.1.1. Con: Israel is already accepted as a Jewish state [legally](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44881554)(The "nation state" law says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination there and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language.\n\nArab MPs reacted furiously in parliament, with one waving a black flag and others ripping up the bill.\n\nIsrael's prime minister praised the bill's passage as a "defining moment".\n\n"A hundred and twenty-two years after \[the founder of modern Zionism Theodore\] Herzl made his vision known, with this law we determined the founding principle of our existence," Benjamin Netanyahu said.\n\n"Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, and respects the rights of all of its citizens."). It is not clear that tensions could worsen.
1.1.5.6.2.2. Pro: Once a Jewish state is recognized, the Jewish people will feel less [threatened](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/media/3372) by Palestine; opposition to a Jewish state is seen as continuing opposition to Israel.
1.1.5.6.2.2.1. Con: Israel [threatens](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-no-palestinian-state-under-my-watch/) the [creation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-kerry/israel-seeks-u-s-block-of-palestinian-statehood-drive-idUSKBN0JT1A020141216) of a [Palestinian State](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/1115/p01s01-wome.html/%28page%29/2) encouraging [illegal settlements](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/group-israel-controls-42-of-west-bank/)(Jewish settlements control more than 42 percent of the West Bank.) in the area. Israel should practice what it preaches should it wish for a deescalation of conflict with Palestine.
1.1.5.6.2.2.2. Pro: Israeli ex-PM, [Netanyahu](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5163334), has supported the idea that all that lies between Palestine and a two-state solution is recognition of the Jewish character of Israel.
1.1.5.6.2.2.3. Con: Recognition of Jewish statehood is required only from the Palestinians, not the international community. There is no reason why Palestinian recognition of a Jewish state is what validates the existence of a Jewish homeland.
1.1.5.6.2.3. Con: Not all Israelis demand that Palestine recognises Israel as Jewish.
1.1.5.6.2.3.1. Pro: Haredi Jews, who make up 10% of Israel's population, and are expected to make up 25% of the population within a few decades, are, oftentimes violently, [opposed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/may/12/for-haredi-jews-secular-zionism-remains-a-religious-heresy) to the idea of a Jewish state.
1.1.5.6.2.3.2. Pro: [Shimon Shamir](http://www.haaretz.com/ask-mustafa-khalil-1.282123), former ambassador to Egypt and Jordan, regards the Jewishness of Israel as an internal matter that should not be put in front of the international community.
1.1.5.6.2.3.3. Pro: [Yonatan Touval](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/opinion/13iht-edtouval.html), director of international affairs at Tel Aviv University, criticized the demand as an obstacle to peace and as a danger to Arab-Israelis.
1.1.5.6.2.3.4. Con: For many [Jews in Israel](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-2011-public-opinion-poll-of-jewish-and-arab-citizens-of-israel/), Palestinian recognition of their state as the [Jewish homeland](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-jewish-idUSTRE53F4TS20090416) is far more important than a peace deal.
1.1.5.6.3. Con: Continued annexation has weakened Palestine such that it has [very little](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/opinion/israel-palestinians-two-state-solution.html)(The Trump administration supported efforts of the Israeli government to move toward annexation of land. Had all those efforts come to pass, we would have reached the point of no return. The land would no longer be divisible, and the political future of two states would have been closed to us forever. Further, this policy weakened and delegitimized the Palestinian Authority and included cutting off financial support.) bargaining power; forcing it to recognise the Jewish character of Israel would remove their last bargaining chip.
1.1.5.7. Pro: Peace talks [in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process#Israeli.E2.80.93Palestinian_talks_in_2007_and_2009) failed in part because of Olmert's [resignation on charges of corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert#Stepping_down).
1.1.6. Con: There is political support for the two state solution indicating that it could be a positive end goal for the region.
1.1.6.1. Con: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict possesses an almost uniquely problematic combination of ethnic, religious, ideological and nationalist animosity, making it particularly difficult to solve.
1.1.6.2. Con: Calls for a two-state solution were significantly weakened in 2021, with a shift amongst experts towards believing a one-state solution is [likely](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/opinion/israel-palestine.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(Among scholars and experts on the Middle East, one recent poll found, 66 percent say there is a one-state reality. There is also a growing shift in mainstream organizations that have been hesitant to call for greater change: The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace recently released a report calling for a break from the two-state approach.).
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: As of early 2021, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had begun to indicate a preference for a [prioritisation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/world/middleeast/israel-palestinian-gaza-war.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(In Gaza, where the Israeli blockade has contributed to an unemployment rate of about 50 percent, Hamas’s popularity was dwindling as Palestinians spoke increasingly of the need to prioritize the economy over war.) of their economy over political nationhood.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Amongst Jewish Israelis, the two state solution [dwindled](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22442052/israel-palestine-two-state-solution-gaza-hamas-one)(A 2020 poll found that a scant 10 percent of Jewish Israelis supported a one-state solution in which Palestinians and Jewish Israelis are equal citizens. And only 13 percent of Israel’s Arab citizens supported such an option. By contrast, 42 percent of Jewish Israelis and 59 percent of Arab Israelis supported two states — with much of the opposition among Jews stemming from a sense that two states were not currently achievable rather than a principled unwillingness to compromise.) in support, though this was largely due to a belief that it was not feasible rather than a poor principled stance.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Many world leaders have established support for a two state solution.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: The normalisation of Israeli and Arab economic links has [reduced](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/opinion/jerusalem-rockets-israel.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(The Israeli government, the surrounding Arab nations and the Palestinian Authority all desperately want the answer to be “no” — Israel because it would find little support from a left-leaning White House, let alone the rest of the world, for a big crackdown on Palestinians; the Arab governments because most of them want to do business with Israeli tech-makers, not get mired defending Palestinian rock-throwers; and the Palestinian leadership because it would expose just how little it controls the Palestinian street anymore.) political support for the Palestinian cause.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: As of 2021, the Palestinian conflict had [dropped off](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/opinion/jerusalem-rockets-israel.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(The most obvious and important point is that a dangerously naïve consensus has emerged in Israel in recent years suggesting that Israel basically has the Palestinian conflict suppressed and those Palestinians living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are basically resigned to living under permanent Israeli control. This consensus was so powerful that in all four of Israel’s recent elections, the question of peace with the Palestinians — how to achieve it and what happens if it is ignored — was not on the agenda.\n\nThe Abraham Accords engineered by the Trump administration, normalizing relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco — while valuable in helping to stabilize the region — also reinforced the notion that the Palestinian cause is basically yesterday’s news.) the radar as an important political issue for voting Israelis.
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: US President, Joe Biden \(2021-\), believes that the two state solution is the [only viable outcome](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/biden-says-two-state-solution-only-answer-to-israel-palestine/2250673)("There is no shift in my commitment to the security of Israel. Period. No shift, not at all. But I'll tell you what there is a shift in. The shift is that we still need a two-state solution. It is the only answer. The only answer," Biden said at a news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nHis remarks came after a group of progressive lawmakers and others in the Democratic Party called for a halt to military sales to Israel because of its bombardment of Gaza Strip, Palestine.\n\nBiden said he spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and told him his plans for Palestine that includes providing security in the West Bank.\n\n"And recently we renewed the security commitment, as well as an economic commitment to the people on the West Bank," said Biden. "I also indicated to the Israelis that I thought it was very important that they stop in Jerusalem this inner communal fighting, it has to end.”) for the region. This is likely to maintain pressure on negotiations.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Secretary of State \(2021-\), Joe Blinken, said that he [supported](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20210525-us-pledges-support-for-gaza-truce-but-without-benefit-for-hamas)("Ultimately, there's a possibility of resuming the effort to achieve a two-state solution, which we continue to believe is the only way to truly assure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, and of course to give the Palestinians the state they're entitled to," he said in Jerusalem.\n\nDuring Tuesday's visit, Blinken vowed to rebuild US relations with Palestinians by reopening a consulate in Jerusalem and giving millions in aid to help the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.\n\nThose announcements signalled a clean break with US policy under former president Donald Trump who had shuttered the diplomatic mission for Palestinians in 2019 and slashed aid to the Palestinian Authority.) the two-state solution.
1.1.6.3.3. Pro: King Abdullah of Jordan [confirmed](https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/king-reaffirms-two-state-solution-only-way-forward)(The King said, prior to his meeting as the first leader from the region with US President Joe Biden, he held talks with Palestinian and Israeli leaders aiming to "unify messaging" as part of efforts to bring the two sides back to the negotiation table. \n\n"... I came out of those meetings feeling very encouraged, and I think we have seen in the past couple of weeks, not only a better understanding between Israel and Jordan, but the voices coming out of both Israel and Palestine that we need to move forward and reset that relationship," the King said.) his support for the two state solution in 2021.
1.1.6.3.3.1. Pro: King Abdullah's support for the two state solution came after the Israeli right wing indicated a [desire](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/jordan-cant-be-palestinian-homeland-in-two-state-solution-king-abdullah-674941)(“Jordan is Jordan,” Abdullah said in response to a question about Israeli right-wing proposals to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by transforming Jordan into a Palestinian homeland. It’s a scenario that appears plausible to the Israeli Right, given that a majority of Jordanians are ethnically Palestinian.\n\nAbdullah, however, emphatically nixed the idea, describing his country as one with “a mixed society from different ethnic and religious backgrounds.”\n\n“The Palestinians do not want to be in Jordan,” Abdullah said. “They want their lands, they want their football team. They want their flag to fly above their houses.”\n\nThroughout the interview he underscored the importance of a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Jordan’s vision for that plan is two states based on the pre-1967 lines, in which east Jerusalem and all of the West Bank would be within the final borders of a Palestinian state.) to make Jordan a Palestinian homeland. This indicates that other solutions are not considered viable.
1.1.6.3.4. Con: External support for the two state solution is unlikely to meaningfully alter the willingness of Israel or Palestine to negotiate.
1.1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Palestinians have indicated a desire to [continue violence](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/palestinians-and-two-state-solution-hard-data-hardest-questions)(Instead, the majority advocated regaining all of historic Palestine. Further, 58% in the West Bank and 62% in Gaza said that even if a two-state solution is reached, conflict with Israel should continue until the Palestinians regain all territory.) if a two state solution is agreed upon; this is likely to stymie a willingness from Israel to co-operate.
1.1.6.3.5. Pro: The UAE sees a two state solution as the [best outcome](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/2021/07/29/uae-two-state-solution-is-the-only-answer-to-situation-in-palestinian-territories/) for the region.
1.1.6.3.5.1. Con: The UAE recently forged a peace deal with Israel; it lost the capacity to advocate with and for Palestine at this stage as the PA feels [betrayed](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/28/profits-or-palestine-uae-israel-deals-likely-to-continue-quietly)(“MBZ seems to be looking to demonstrate that his now-tarnished relationship with Israel has some redeeming value beyond the purely commercial. With much of the world outraged over Israeli behaviour, the UAE’s diplomatic concession is looking foolish,” Jim Krane, a research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute and the author of Dubai: The Story of the World’s Fastest City, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Now that Abu Dhabi has formal ties with Israel, it finds itself with less leverage with the Israelis and no credibility among Palestinians,” Krane added.\n\nWhile the UAE is under pressure from other Arab nations to show support for Palestinian rights, it seems unlikely to cancel any deals with Israel to do so, Krane said.).
1.1.6.3.5.2. Pro: The UAE may make this more politically feasible as it has recently forged [stronger political ties](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-54151712) with Israel.
1.1.6.4. Pro: Leaders of Arab parties in the Knesset, as of 2021, [support](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22442052/israel-palestine-two-state-solution-gaza-hamas-one)(Ayman Odeh and Mansour Abbas, the leaders of the major Arab factions in Israel’s Knesset, its parliament, are both two-staters.) a two state solution.
1.2. Pro: Recognition of a Palestinian state may end the [destabilising](https://www.studentisraelity.com/post/the-deterioration-of-quality-of-life-in-the-palestinian-territories) Israeli [occupation](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/israel-palestine-occupation-violence-213957/).
1.2.1. Con: Palestinian territories are not occupied but [disputed territories](http://www.webcitation.org/6Vo9QW33E?url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/FAQ/Pages/FAQ_Peace_process_with_Palestinians_Dec_2009.aspx).
1.2.1.1. Pro: [Occupied territories](http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2003/Pages/DISPUTED%20TERRITORIES-%20Forgotten%20Facts%20About%20the%20We.aspx) are territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign nation. Israeli presence in the West Bank does not meet this criterion.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The argument that the lack of a previous sovereign invalidates the description of the status quo as an occupation is known as the "[missing reversioner thesis](http://www.jurist.org/forum/2010/04/us-israel-standoff-over-settlements.php)." It is neither consistent with legal opinion nor accepted by the international community.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: None of the armistice agreements after the 1948 war created political borders; this task was supposed to be taken care of by later negotiations. As such, the current borders are illegitimate.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The boundaries marked by the [1949 Armistice Agreement](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-egypt-armistice-agreement-1949) signed by Israel and Egypt after the 1948 war were [simply indicative](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-egypt-armistice-agreement-1949)(No provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party hereto in the ultimate peaceful settlement of the Palestine question) of where the Egyptian and Israeli armies were. This left the territories up for negotiation.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: The [Jordanian annexation of the West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank) after the 1948 war was not recognized by the international community. Thus, the West Bank never belonged to a sovereign state and, therefore, cannot be said to be occupied.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: The occupation was the result of Israel's "[war of aggression and conquest](https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/a-50-year-occupation-israels-six-day-war-started-with-a-lie/)" and not, as oftentimes argued, of a preventive and legitimate war for the purpose of self-defense.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Israel [attempted](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.783429) to actively conceal laws that it had passed to effectively take over East Jerusalem; the Israeli Foreign Ministry told its ambassadors to refer to the annexation as "municipal fusion."
1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Israel intended to return land to Jordan, in exchange for peace, as indicated by [Resolution 242](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242). This demonstrates that the objective of the Six-Day War was not territorial acquisition.
1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: If Israel wanted to only attack Egypt and not capture any territory in Palestine, it could have given the captured territories back to Jordan after the war. By keeping these territories, Israel showed that capturing them was a desired end.
1.2.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Israel has since made peace with [Egypt](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/israel-egyptian-peace-agreement-signed) and [Jordan](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/10/23/25-years-on-remembering-the-path-to-peace-for-jordan-and-israel/) but has still not given back the territory of Palestine.
1.2.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Jordan, Egypt, and Syria refused to meet with Israel after the war, making peace impossible. This stopped negotiation during the [Khartoum Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum_Resolution).
1.2.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: The government of Israel attempted by all means necessary to avoid any war with Jordan.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: In 1966, after a Palestinian land mine attack inside its territory, Israel conducted [military reprisal operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samu_incident) on a large scale on Jordan-controlled territory.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: UN Security Council [Resolution 228](https://undocs.org/S/RES/228\(1966\)) classified Israel's actions as a violation of the Armistice Agreement between Jordan and Israel.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.1.2. Con: The [Samu incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samu_Incident) was a legitimate reprisal operation against the Arabs planting mines in Jordan, which killed 3 Israeli soldiers.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.1.3. Pro: The King of Jordan had previously [told](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samu_incident#Background) high-ranking Israeli government officials that he could not "absorb a serious retaliatory raid" by Israel. That Israeli raid, the Samu incident, is considered to be one of the aggravating factors that led to the Six-Day War.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Israel had issued a [strict order](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-six-day-war-and-its-enduring-legacy) that there was to be no shooting at the Jordanians. Israel did not want to open up a second front along its longest border.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: [Levi Eshkol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Eshkol#Six-Day_War) the Prime Minister at the time attempted, by all means, to avoid attacking Jordan.
1.2.1.1.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: Shortly after dealing with the Egyptian forces, the Israeli PM requested King Hussein not to enter the war through their shared [UN contact](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39960461) to protect Jordan. However, a couple of hours later, Jordan began shelling civilian infrastructure in Jerusalem. Following extensive attacks from Jordan, [Israel](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-israel-palestinians-1967-factbox/factbox-israel-swept-to-victory-in-6-days-40-years-ago-idUKL3030253620070606) [decided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War#West_Bank) to [retaliate](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2009/7/13/1967-arab-israeli-war-timeline).
1.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: Israel [refused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force#UNEF_I) to have UN peacekeeping forces stationed on its side of the border with Egypt to deescalate the conflict; Egypt had similar UN regiments stationed on its border from 1948 to 1967. Thus, Israel had the means to deescalate the conflict but actively decided against it.
1.2.1.1.3.4. Con: Many believe that Israel acted in self-defense in the Six-Day War.
1.2.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Before Israel struck the Arab forces, it was surrounded by approximately 250,000 troops, more than two thousand tanks, and seven hundred aircraft \([p. 51](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=43)\). The Israeli army could not indefinitely remain fully mobilised; it had [no choice](https://www.e-ir.info/2014/03/16/pre-emption-and-israeli-decision-making-in-1967-and-1973/) but to attack.
1.2.1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Israel would not have had [time](http://www.e-ir.info/2014/03/16/pre-emption-and-israeli-decision-making-in-1967-and-1973/) to mobilise its reserve troops in case of a surprise attack, reducing its ability to defend itself against a first strike by the Arab nations.
1.2.1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: The CIA assessed that Mossad's claim about being outgunned by the Arab nations was a deliberate attempt to influence the US into providing support for Israel and placing more pressure on the Egyptian President Nasser \([p. 5](https://www.cia.gov/static/d5a4d18e0fecdc17091a38eaea78e8e2/Analysis-Arab-Israeli-War.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: There was a significant amount of Arab aggression in the region from [Syria](http://www.sixdaywar.co.uk/timeline.htm)(Feb 22nd 1967\n\nPresident Attassi of Syria: “it is the duty of all of us now to move from defensive positions to offensive positions and enter the battle to liberate the usurped land…Everyone must face the test and enter the battle to the end.”), [Iraq](http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/threats.asp)("The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear – to wipe Israel off the map. We shall, God willing, meet in Tel Aviv and Haifa."), and [Palestinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_against_Israeli_civilians_before_1967) [fedayeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen), forcing Israel's hand prior to the Six-Day War.
1.2.1.1.3.4.2. Con: While a defensive war to destroy enemy military capabilities might have been necessary, there was no need to continue occupying the land after the war.
1.2.1.1.3.4.3. Pro: The only nation to be pre-emptively struck was [Egypt](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2009/7/13/1967-arab-israeli-war-timeline), which had moved their most threatening army to the Israeli border. Nations that controlled Palestine were not targeted.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4. Pro: The government of Israel believed that the Six Day War was one of [self-defense](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/FAQ/Pages/FAQ_Peace_process_with_Palestinians_Dec_2009.aspx#Settlements1).
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.1. Pro: It was only after [Jordan had blocked off Jerusalem's roads](https://thejewishnews.com/2017/05/31/jordan-not-attacked-israel-1967/) and cut off their access to water that Israel responded and captured the city.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: Israel tried to [keep Jordan out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Six-Day_War#Jordan_joins_Egypt) of the war with Egypt to avoid fighting a two-front war.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Fighting a two-front war would have split Israeli forces, weakening them.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.1.2. Con: Jordan was bound by a [mutual defense treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Six-Day_War#Jordan_joins_Egypt) with Egypt and as such was obliged to act when Israel attacked Egypt. The war over the West Bank was, therefore, not a defensive one for Israel.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.2. Con: Both Israeli and US intelligence believed that the chances of Nasser striking first were [slim](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/opinion/how-the-kgb-started-the-war-that-changed-the-middle-east.html).
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.2.1. Con: Nasser [sent](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/arab-israeli-war-1967) large numbers of troops to the Sinai Peninsula, threatened to destroy Israel, and called for preparations for the "[final battle in Palestine](http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/threats.asp)." These acts clearly indicated that he was about to wage war with Israel.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.2.2. Con: Egypt had [closed](https://israeled.org/nasser-closes-straits-of-tiran/) the Straits of Tiran, blocking Israel's only supply route with Asia and stopping its main supply of oil from Iran, placing incredible pressure on Israel.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.2.3. Pro: Michael B Oren, the former ambassador of Israel to the US, has [stated](http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people5/Oren/oren-con4.html) that Nasser did not want bloodshed in 1967.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.2.4. Pro: Yitzhak Rabin, a General at the time of the Six-Day War and the future Prime Minister of Israel, [believed](https://avrammeitner.wordpress.com/general-rabin-does-not-think-that-nasser-wanted-war/) that Nasser did not want war.
1.2.1.1.3.4.4.3. Pro: The Israeli strike was considered, at the time and in the minutes of the Israeli government, as a preemptive strike within the context of a defensive war \([pp. 220-221](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/1547/1/Kurtulus.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Israel has withdrawn from [Sinai](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/26/world/israeli-completes-pullout-leaving-sinai-to-egypt.html) and [South Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon), which were occupied during the Six-Day War, but not from the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank), which it began occupying in 1948, when it was not under any sovereign state.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Similar territories are [recognised](http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp470.htm) as disputed; yet, only the West Bank is designated as an occupation.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Kashmir, just like Palestine, was [disputed](https://www.bbc.com/news/10537286)(Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.) from its [very inception](https://theconversation.com/kashmir-conflict-is-not-just-a-border-dispute-between-india-and-pakistan-112824)(The Kashmir issue has caused tension and conflict in the Indian subcontinent since 1947, when independence from Britain created India and Pakistan as two sovereign states. Jammu and Kashmir – the full name of the princely Himalayan state, then ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh – acceded to India in 1947, seeking military support after tribal raids from Pakistan into the state’s territory. The two countries have fought three wars over the region since.). The conflict's origins overlap conceptually.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: The disputed status of Kashmir does not imply that India or Pakistan is not a state. Likewise, the disputed territories of the West Bank and Gaza are disputed between two states: Israel and Palestine.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: There are particular regions of Jammu and Kashmir that are referred to as "[Pakistan-occupied Kashmir](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/pakistan-occupied-kashmir-pok-history-facts-1580398-2019-08-13)" and "[India-occupied Kashmir](https://www.e-ir.info/2014/05/20/indian-occupied-kashmir/)."
1.2.1.3. Con: Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories has been repeatedly acknowledged by [international](https://www.dfa.ie/travel/travel-advice/a-z-list-of-countries/israel-and-the-occupied-territories/) [institutions](https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/middle-east/israel-and-occupied-territories), such as the UN, and the [international](https://www.oxfam.org/en/what-we-do/countries/occupied-palestinian-territory-and-israel) [community](https://ecfr.eu/special/mapping_palestinian_politics/opt/).
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [UN Security Council Resolution 242](https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7d35e1f729df491c85256ee700686136) following the Six-Day War demanded the "withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict." This implies that the territories were considered as occupied.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Under [UN Security Council Resolution 242](https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7d35e1f729df491c85256ee700686136), Israel is only expected to withdraw "from territories," not from "the territories" or "all the territories" captured during the Six-Day War, as noted by the then-British Foreign Secretary [George Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242#The_negotiating_and_drafting_process)(It does not call for Israeli withdrawal from “the” territories recently occupied, nor does it use the word “all”.).
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: The guiding principle framing the text of the resolution in its preamble emphasizes "[the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/7D35E1F729DF491C85256EE700686136)". This principle is unequivocal and incompatible with the claim that a partial withdrawal by Israel was considered acceptable.
1.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: In response to the deliberate attempt to obfuscate the language of the resolution, the Indian delegate to the UNSC [remarked](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/9F5F09A80BB6878B0525672300565063) that an approved resolution would necessitate total withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the territories occupied by Israel since 5 June 1967. Several other UNSC members concurred emphatically.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Regarding the issue of partial withdrawal, a US State Department [report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242#The_negotiating_and_drafting_process) concluded, "Support for the concept of total withdrawal was widespread in the Security Council, and it was only through intensive American efforts that a resolution was adopted which employed indefinite language in the withdrawal clause."
1.2.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: If the resolution was content with partial Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, they would have likely used phrases such as "some" or "at least some" of the occupied territories.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3. Con: The omission of the word "the" was [intended to be vague](https://yamm.finance/wiki/UNSC_Resolution_242.html)(There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from "the" territories or from "all" territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning "the." We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take a fresh look at the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel as a result of the June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future.); any claim to the contrary, that anything is explicitly specified, cannot be true.
1.2.1.3.1.3.4. Con: Despite several UNSC members proposing that "territories" be revised as "all-territories", the [UN Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242#Interpretations) decided to use the former term.
1.2.1.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: The original authors of the UN Security Council Resolution 242 did not intend for the phrase to mean "all" \([p. 4](http://www.acpr.org.il/pp/pp173-grief-E.pdf)(The notable omissions – which were not accidental – in regard to withdrawal are the words “the” or “all” and “the June 5, 1967 lines”. In other words, there is lacking a declaration requiring Israel to withdraw from “the” or “all the” territories occupied by it on and after June 5, 1967.)\).
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: UN Security Council Resolution 2334 explicitly [names](https://undocs.org/S/RES/2334\(2016\)) Israel as "the occupying power" and refers to "Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem."
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The UN Security Council's established unequivocal principle of acquisition makes inadmissable the [acquisition of territory by war](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/7D35E1F729DF491C85256EE700686136) and leaves no room for dispute. Israel acquired Palestinian territories in 1967 by war and its claim to them is, therefore, illegitimate.
1.2.1.3.4. Con: There are a variety of contexts in which acquisition through war is [permissible](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20180717/108563/HHRG-115-GO06-Wstate-KontorovichE-20180717.pdf)(The U.N. Charter prohibits war for most purposes. When the use of force is illegal, it is natural to \nconclude that any territorial gains from such aggression cannot be recognized as well. Thus the \nillegality of conquest arises from the presumptive illegality of the use of force. But crucially, the \nU.N. Charter does not make all war illegal. Indeed, it expressly reaffirms the legality of a \ndefensive war. Since defensive war is not illegal, it follows that the defender’s territorial gains \nfrom such a war would not be illegal.), according to the UN charter \(p. 2\).
1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: [Scholars](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1685&context=cjil)(Title by conquest remains a valid title in those cases in which the conquering State is not bound by the Charter of the United Nations . . . or when although when so bound, the resort to war on its part is not, in the particular case, unlawful.) have noted that, when engaging in a lawful war, [acquisition is allowed](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1685&context=cjil)(footnote 102).
1.2.1.3.4.2. Con: The [Declaration of Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States \(UNGA resolutions 1970\)](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2625\(XXV\))(The territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force. No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.) includes the unqualified prohibition of the acquisition of territory by threat or use of force.
1.2.1.3.5. Con: International law is not retroactive; thus, the events that occurred in 1967 cannot be interpreted in the light of laws instituted at a later time as is often done when Palestinian territories are designated as occupied \([p. 377](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=GR4xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.2.1.4. Pro: According to the [views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories#Israeli_legal_and_political_views) of most adherents of Religious Zionism and to certain streams of Orthodox Judaism, "occupied territories" do not and cannot exist because all of the Land of Israel belongs to the Jews.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: An extreme [position](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-steves/settlements-in-the-west-b_b_3240616.html) held by many conservative Jews as well as conservative Christians is that the presence of Palestinians in the West Bank impedes God’s will.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: [The Land of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel) concept has been invoked by the founders of the State of Israel. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the West Bank.
1.2.1.4.3. Con: The essence of Zionism is its support for an [independent Jewish state](https://www.annefrank.org/en/topics/antisemitism/are-all-jews-zionists/). As such, arguing that, because Zionists do not recognize Israeli occupation of Palestinine, the area is not occupied, is tautological.
1.2.1.5. Con: Disputed territories can still be under military [occupation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation). As long as Israel uses the military to [control](https://www.britannica.com/topic/military-government) an enemy's territory, Palestine can be considered occupied.
1.2.1.6. Con: In a 2004 ruling, the Supreme Court of Israel noted that Israel had held the West Bank "[in belligerent occupation](https://www.refworld.org/cases,ISR_SC,4374ac594.html)" since 1967.
1.2.2. Pro: Israeli occupation leads to significant harms for Palestinian people.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Severe [human rights violations](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories) occur under Israeli occupation.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Israel has been accused of [institutionalizing statelessness](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/24/2/202/1538062/Institutionalizing-Statelessness-The-Revocation-of) in East Jerusalem. This violates the right to a nationality as enshrined in [Article 15](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_15.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR\).
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The [UDHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) is not legally binding.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Portions of the UDHR have [been incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights)(Although not legally binding, the contents of the UDHR have been elaborated and incorporated into subsequent international treaties, regional human rights instruments, and national constitutions and legal codes.) into international treaties, constitutions, and legal codes.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Israel [offered citizenship](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/24/2/202/1538062/Institutionalizing-Statelessness-The-Revocation-of)(pg.209) to East Jerusalemites in 1967 but Palestinians rejected it.
1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: About [60%](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(pg.10) of Palestinians and about [70%](http://www.peacepolls.org/peacepolls/documents/000571.pdf)(pg.4) of Israelis now oppose the idea of a joint state with equal rights for all citizens.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Israel was founded in order to provide a safe haven to Jews, and its ability to fulfill this function is contingent on political control being maintained by Jews. A one-state solution would now threaten Jewish maintenance of political control.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: If able to choose one among a democratic Israel, peace, a Greater Israel, and Israel with a Jewish majority, the [latter](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(pg.14) is the most popular option among Israeli Jews.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.2. Con: The purpose for which Israel was founded has been fulfilled, and should no longer determine the political state of Israel. Jews no longer need a safe haven in the way they did back when Israel was established.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Jews still need a safe haven. Anti-Semitism is [rising in Europe](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-anti-semitism-european-jewish-congress-moshe-kantor-populism-donald-trump-hitler-a7544886.html) and hate crimes against Jews are [still frequent in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_United_States#Hate_crimes_against_Jews_in_the_U.S.).
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Israel would [never](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-israel-the-demographic-issue-gains-resonance/) agree to granting citizenship to all Palestinians since that would threaten the ability of Israel to remain a politically Jewish state by [massively increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories#Demographics) the number of Arab Israeli citizens.
1.2.2.1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: There are currently more than three million Palestinian refugees registered with the UN in [Jordan](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan), [Lebanon](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon) and [Syria](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/syria). If only a fraction of those return, this will tip the population balance in favor of Arabs.
1.2.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Many key rights could have been delivered to Palestinians if they had taken on Israeli citizenship.
1.2.2.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Many Palestinians are [eligible for Israeli citizenship](http://www.timesofisrael.com/more-east-jerusalem-palestinians-seek-israeli-citizenship/)(Asking for an Israeli passport still carries the stigma of implied acceptance of Israeli control, and only about 15,000 Palestinians have requested one since 2003; of those, fewer than 6,000 were reportedly approved.), yet they remain stateless for [ideological reasons](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2020/05/palestinians-jerusalem-israel-citizenship-pa-hamas-turkey.html).
1.2.2.1.1.2.3.2. Con: Israeli citizenship applies [only](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/01/palestinians-seek-israeli-citizenship-jerusalem) to Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, not the millions living in the rest of the occupied territories.
1.2.2.1.1.2.3.3. Con: Making Israeli citizenship the only means through which Palestinians can access rights coerces them into accepting citizenship in a nation that has repeatedly committed atrocities against them. This is reprehensible.
1.2.2.1.1.2.3.4. Con: There are [discriminatory laws](https://abcnews.go.com/International/uprisings-palestinians-israeli-citizenship/story?id=77741627) in place within Israel that afford particular rights only to Jewish citizens; this means that key rights may not be delivered.
1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The "center of life" policy was introduced to asses the [residency rights](https://oldwebsite.palestine-studies.org/jq/fulltext/78495)(Whether studying or working abroad or simply living in a nearby suburb outside Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries due to the housing squeeze in East Jerusalem, Israel has revoked the permanent residency rights of these Palestinians – 0.5% of the Arab population of the city – on the allegation that their “center of life” is no longer in Jerusalem. The arbitrary standard on which this policy is based exceeds the bounds of Israel’s written law and violates international law. The reality in Jerusalem – a result of the “center of life” policy – is the institutionalization of statelessness and forced displacement of thousands of Palestinian East Jerusalemites.) of individual Palestinians. This policy requires a high burden of proof to continue living in East Jerusalem and is biased such that it disproportionately strips Palestinians of their residency rights.
1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Children born to Palestinians in East Jerusalem do not automatically receive residence rights but must apply for it in a [procedure](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/24/2/202/1538062/Institutionalizing-Statelessness-The-Revocation-of)(pg.217) that is highly uncertain. If rejected, the children are stateless.
1.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: It has been proposed by Israeli leaders that [naturalization](https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article/24/2/202/1538062)(click on "PDF" to download:\np. 220) as a tool to secure permanent residency should require East Jerusalemites to [take an oath](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-jerusalem-insight-idUSKCN0Q81HP20150803) to Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. This is institutionalized racism as Jewish immigrants do not need to take a similar oath.
1.2.2.1.1.5. Pro: The [Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Reduction_of_Statelessness) commits signatory states to reduce the incidence of statelessness. Israel has signed this multilateral treaty.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Israel's policies in the West Bank are analogous to the [crime of apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_apartheid#ICC_definition_of_the_crime_of_apartheid) as defined by the Rome Statute, which includes crimes such as "deportation or forcible transportation of population."
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: A [UN report](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/71A1FD027B82B40D852580EA0064468F) has accused Israel of mass evictions and forced relocation of Palestinians in the Zone C areas of the West Bank.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Israeli authorities have been accused of [acquiring grazing land](https://english.palinfo.com/news/2017/03/15/Permitted-for-Israeli-settlers-prohibited-for-Palestinians) in the Jordan Valley under the pretenses of protecting the wildlife, then distributing it to settlers or using it for military exercises.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Israel's oppressive tactics in the West Bank qualify as an "[institutionalised regime of systematic oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_apartheid#ICC_definition_of_the_crime_of_apartheid) and domination by one racial group \(Jews\) over any other racial group \(Palestinians\) committed with the intention of maintaining that regime."
1.2.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Israeli settlers in the West Bank are subject to civil law, while Palestinians are subject to [harsh military orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Military_Order).
1.2.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Israeli extremists often [do not receive punishment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/amnesty-catalogue-of-violations-by-israeli-police-against-palestinians)(At least 2,150 people – 90% of them Palestinian – have been arrested, most for allegedly insulting or assaulting a police officer or taking part in an illegal gathering rather than for violent offences, while rightwing Jewish extremists have for the most part continued to organise freely.\n\nOn at least two occasions in Haifa and Nazareth, witness accounts and verified videos showed police attacking groups of unarmed protesters without provocation, Amnesty reported.) for violence, whilst their Palestinian counterparts are treated harshly by the police.
1.2.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: [Naftali Bennett](https://apnews.com/article/naftali-bennett-israel-middle-east-religion-technology-20678c93611da0fee71fbccac80759d5), the Israeli Prime Minister \(2021-\), [directly supports](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/7/22/why-it-is-crucial-to-keep-a-spot-light-on-israels-apartheid)(Indeed, Bennett has always been open about his desire to officially annex occupied Palestinian territories and rid Palestinians of any rights they have in Israel. And unlike his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, who maintained that he believed in “two states for two peoples” while pursuing apartheid policies, he has never been interested in even appearing to support the two-state solution. As Yousef Munayyer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Arab Center, recently argued in an op-ed for the Washington Post, “Bennett unabashedly embraces apartheid, while Netanyahu at least understood the value of pretending otherwise before the international community.”) the disempowerment of Palestinians, and the centrality of Jewishness to Israeli law.
1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: Israeli security forces have carried out extra-judicial killings of Palestinians, even when they no longer pose any threat.
1.2.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Israel often initially claims that dead Palestinian civilians were armed/posed a threat, even when [later evidence](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/two-wounded-palestinians-executed-hebron-not-one-witnesses-say/) proves this was not the case.
1.2.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: Amnesty International [has accused Israel](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/israel-opt-pattern-of-unlawful-killings-reveals-shocking-disregard-for-human-life/) of unlawful killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and said that they have a "shocking disregard" for human life.
1.2.2.1.2.3.3. Con: The Palestinian Authority is associated with [extra-judicial killings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/amnesty-catalogue-of-violations-by-israeli-police-against-palestinians)(On Thursday news emerged that Nizar Banat, a well-known critic of the PA, died during an arrest by Palestinian security forces in the city of Hebron. A large demonstration in Ramallah in response to his death, calling for PA officials to resign, was met with teargas and use of metal batons from Palestinian security forces.\n\nBanat, who had planned to run in cancelled parliamentary elections this year, had called on western countries to cut off aid to the PA because of growing human rights violations and endemic corruption.\n\nLast month, gunmen he claimed were loyal to the PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, attacked his house with bullets, stun grenades and teargas while his wife and children were inside.), and policing abuses in reponse to protests.
1.2.2.1.2.4. Pro: Those who have experienced Apartheid in the past have said that Israel's conduct in the West Bank is similar to Apartheid.
1.2.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: [34 South African activists](https://mronline.org/2008/05/19/apartheid190508-html/), including government ministers, published an open letter saying, "We fought apartheid; we see no reason to celebrate it in Israel now!"
1.2.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: [An ANC delegation](http://www.haaretz.com/twilight-zone-worse-than-apartheid-1.249503) of veterans of the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa described the situation in Palestine as "worse than anything we knew under Apartheid."
1.2.2.1.2.5. Con: Unlike the apartheid that occurred in South Africa, the West Bank is nominally self-governed by Palestinians, giving them some degrees of freedom [absent from South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_the_apartheid_analogy)(Opponents of the analogy reject the comparison of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with apartheid South Africa, arguing that as the two territories are not part of sovereign Israel and governed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas government in Gaza, they cannot be compared to the internal policies of apartheid South Africa.) under apartheid.
1.2.2.1.2.6. Con: Israel's mistreatment of Palestinians in the West Bank is predicated on the need for self defence, rather than the domination of one racial group over another.
1.2.2.1.2.6.1. Con: Under international law, claims to self-defense are required to be [proportional](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/society-politics-law/the-use-force-international-law/content-section-1.3.1)(Furthermore, the ICJ held in the Nicaragua Case \(Merits\) that ‘self-defence would warrant only measures which are proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ \(para. 176\). This statement sets out two important principles in international law concerning the use of force: the principle of proportionality and the principle of necessity. In this context, proportionality means that the response to an armed attack must be reflective of the scope, nature and gravity of the attack itself. On the other hand, the principle of necessity guards against the use of measures which are excessive and not necessary in response to an armed attack.), which Israeli retaliations to Palestinian attacks are [not](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44167900).
1.2.2.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: The sophisticated [Iron Dome](https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-gaza-what-we-know.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)(The Iron Dome missile defense system became operational in 2011 and got its biggest first test over eight days in November 2014, when Gaza militants fired some 1,500 rockets aimed at Israel.\n\nWhile Israeli officials claimed a success rate of up to 90 percent during that conflict, outside experts were skeptical. The system’s interceptors — just 6 inches wide and 10 feet long — rely on miniature sensors and onboard computer processors to zero in on short-range rockets.\n\nIsrael has suffered casualties and the psychological terror of incoming rockets, but the system is clearly winnowing out much of the daily rocket fire.) deters the vast majority of Hamas' attacks.
1.2.2.1.2.7. Con: Major geopolitical players, like the USA, [do not recognise](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/7/22/why-it-is-crucial-to-keep-a-spot-light-on-israels-apartheid)(. After the publication of the damning HRW report, for example, a spokesperson for the US State Department simply said: “It is not the view of \[the Biden\] administration that Israel’s actions constitute apartheid.”) that apartheid is ongoing in the region.
1.2.2.1.2.7.1. Con: In 2017, a UN agency accused Israel of enforcing an ["apartheid regime"](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-report-idUSKBN16M2IN) on Palestinians.
1.2.2.1.2.7.1.1. Con: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres [effectively distanced](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-israel-report-apartheid-palestinians-gaza-a7632336.html) himself and the secretariat from the document.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: The [United Nations Relief and Work Agency](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-aid-sb-idUSTRE5153UA20090206) \(UNRWA\) suspended its humanitarian activities in response to Hamas security forces seizing its aids. The occupation does not deprive Palestinians of important resources, but rather Hamas does.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Hamas and Israel can both be responsible for depriving Palestinians of important resources. Just because Hamas steals some resources does not mean Israel does not harm Palestinians as well.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: Israel's human rights violations should not be used as an argument in favor of recognising Palestine as their governments do not have a better track record.
1.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: The compassionate reaction to human rights violations is to stop them, not to adjust the legal status of the territory in which they occur.
1.2.2.1.4.2. Con: To access Palestine, human rights workers must pass through [Israeli military checkpoints](https://www.welcometopalestine.com/getting-in/). Many are declared to be propagandists or spreaders of hate and [are, therefore, denied entry](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/03/israel/palestine-rights-workers-denied-gaza-access). Changing the legal status of Palestine would improve their access to Palestine.
1.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: Hamas routinely sends [rockets](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/24/gaza-palestinian-rockets-unlawfully-targeted-israeli-civilians) from civilian areas and from urban centers and targets civilian areas and urban centers endangering civilians on both sides.
1.2.2.1.4.4. Pro: During the parliamentary elections in 2006, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority [executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_\(2007\)#The_battle) an imam, and members of the opposing factions, by throwing them off of buildings.
1.2.2.1.4.5. Pro: A [Human Rights Watch report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/10/23/two-authorities-one-way-zero-dissent/arbitrary-arrest-and-torture-under) in 2018 showed that [arbitrary arrests](https://www.france24.com/en/20190913-reporters-hamas-fatah-brothers-war-palestinine-west-bank-gaza-israel), intimidation and even torture by Fatah and Hamas are commonplace, both in Gaza and the West Bank.
1.2.2.1.4.5.1. Pro: Hamas has [beaten and arrested](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/03/gaza-hamas-must-end-brutal-crackdown-against-protesters-and-rights-defenders) peaceful protesters and rights defenders.
1.2.2.1.4.5.2. Pro: The military branch of Hamas [tortured and killed](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/) numerous Palestinians during the 2014 outbreak of conflict.
1.2.2.1.4.6. Con: If recognising Palestine leads to fewer Israeli human rights abuses, then that is [good on net](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/consequentialism_1.shtml).
1.2.2.1.4.6.1. Pro: Israeli human rights abuses are [facilitated](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/) by the ongoing occupation of Palestine; if Palestine was seen as a legitimate state, then these would be less likely.
1.2.2.1.4.7. Con: If Palestine is a legitimate state, then it is easier to hold to account as the US can insist on free and fair elections and political accountability.
1.2.2.1.4.7.1. Pro: Palestine would no longer be able to [blame](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2021/04/23/halting-palestine-s-democratic-decline-pub-84383)(There are also many other potential spoilers of the elections, including Israel, which is already trying to deter voting in annexed East Jerusalem by carrying out arrests—thereby providing a good cover for Abbas to postpone the contests, as seems increasingly likely.) a lack of democracy on Israel if it is recognised as a state, and has its borders respected.
1.2.2.1.4.7.2. Pro: Abbas may no longer find it necessary to [cement](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2021/04/23/halting-palestine-s-democratic-decline-pub-84383)(Democratic advances, including elections, would give the Palestinian leadership a more coherent, credible voice. That could be useful in negotiating with Israel and the international community, offering some way out of the political deadlock. The peace process is moribund, primarily due to Israeli policy, particularly settlement expansion in the West Bank and the closure of Gaza. But some responsibility also lies with Abbas, who has deliberately weakened Palestinian national unity to protect his own position, notably by refusing to reconcile with Hamas.) his own political position at the cost of democracy, if Palestine achieves state recognition from the US.
1.2.2.1.4.7.3. Pro: One current [roadblock](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-04/05/c_139860071.htm) to elections is Israel's intervention in East Jerusalem. If the US recognises Palestine, this may be less feasible for Israel to sustain.
1.2.2.1.4.7.4. Con: US involvement in democracy is rarely successful; this can be seen through the loss of democratic norms in [Afghanistan](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/is-democracy-dying-in-afghanistan/).
1.2.2.1.4.7.5. Con: Roadblocks such as [Republican support](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/554120-republican-resolution-supporting-israel-signals-growing-divide-with)(The resolution is led by Sen. Rick Scott \(R-Fla.\), and signed by 19 other GOP lawmakers reinforcing U.S. support for Israel to defend itself by “whatever means necessary.” It also condemns Hamas as an Iranian-backed terrorist organization responsible for the loss of innocent lives. \n\nThe U.S. designated Hamas a terrorist organization in 1997. \n\nThe resolution signals the growing divide between Republicans and Democrats in Congress on the relationship between U.S. and Israel that historically garners bipartisan support, but that has fractured in recent years over Democrats' opposition to the policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu related to the Palestinians and Iranians.) for Israel, and President Biden's new [dovish disposition](https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/11/in-search-of-the-biden-doctrine/)(Since 2003, Biden has been generally skeptical about the use for force. He opposed the surge of troops in Iraq in 2006-2007, the surge in Afghanistan in 2009, and the Libyan War in 2011. He raised doubts about the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden in 2011, as well as the decision to draw a red line against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Biden did back the campaign against ISIS and favored the escalation of drone warfare, but he criticized Trump’s decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nHave we finally found Biden’s true nature? Perhaps—but again, his dovish turn is bound up with the wider “Iraq syndrome” in American society, where even Donald Trump and the Republican Party rail against forever wars. Biden is no kite in the wind, however. As vice president, he was consistently more dovish than Obama—on Afghanistan, on Bin Laden, on Syria, and on Libya \(an intervention that Obama later called his biggest mistake\).) may limit the application of political pressure on Palestine to act democratically.
1.2.2.1.4.7.6. Con: Democracy [may not](https://scholars.org/contribution/why-democracy-does-not-always-improve-human-rights)(In a democracy, ordinary citizens who themselves feel threatened may be less likely to hold the government accountable for human rights violations. For example, preliminary survey research suggests that Americans are more accepting of government torture when it is directed at an individual with an Arabic name.) lead to a reduction in human rights abuses.
1.2.2.1.5. Pro: Freedom of movement is often restricted for Palestinians.
1.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: Israel's numerous [controls, checkpoints and 'closed roads'](https://www.btselem.org/freedom_of_movement/checkpoints_and_forbidden_roads) within the West Bank are [in breach of Article 13](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_13.html#at14) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, which states that individuals ought to have freedom of movement within the borders and a right to leave.
1.2.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: The large wall running through parts of the West Bank, known as the 'separation barrier', has been [claimed by Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/02/22/israel-west-bank-barrier-violates-human-rights) to be an illegal impediment to Palestinians' movement.
1.2.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: Palestinians are denied entry to Israeli settlements and [are violently prohibited](http://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence) from inhabiting these areas, constituting a breach of [Article 13](https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/library/ja/kokusai/humanrights_library/treaty/data/HRC_GC_27e.pdf)(pg.9), which explicitly forbids restrictions predicated on race and religion.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3. Con: These checkpoints are necessary to ensure the safety of civilians living in Israel, and are thus legal under [Article 12](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/freedom_movement_definition.html) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.1. Con: It is unjust to make innocent Palestinians suffer because of the threat a tiny proportion of them pose to Israel. This violates the [proportionality principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(law\)) and is therefore illegal.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: This sort of collective punishment is [illegal](http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/collective-punishment/) under international law.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: In [Hawara](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.740789), the Israeli Defense Force blocked all but one road into the town leading to massive problems because of some 'stone-throwers'.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.1.3. Pro: Of the people who were killed by Israeli military forces or settlers in the West Bank during the past two years, [all were civilians](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/monthly-figures) as defined by the UN.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.1.3.1. Con: The UN definition of a civilian is rather broad: they included [armed attackers](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/135359-170117-west-bank-israeli-forces-kill-palestinian-who-tried-to-stab-soldier) who [tried to kill Israeli policemen](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-idUSKBN13X0O0) as civilians.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.2. Pro: Checkpoints and blockades are necessary because violent attackers blend into civilian crowds. For example, a [bomb](http://www.haaretz.com/bomb-found-in-red-crescent-ambulance-1.49189) was found in an ambulance at the fifth checkpoint.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.3. Con: There are many other means by which Israel can protect its national security and safeguard public order. The most obvious is to withdraw to its recognised borders and protecting the areas they encompass.
1.2.2.1.5.1.3.4. Pro: There were nearly [500](https://www.idfblog.com/2013/05/06/reality-check-the-truth-behind-crossings-in-judea-and-samaria/) attempts to smuggle weapons that checkpoints discovered.
1.2.2.1.5.1.4. Pro: Israel places blockades on [Route 60](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/20/israel) - the main road connecting the northern and southern ends of Palestine. This causes harm to Palestinians \(e.g., [splitting](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/18/world/middleeast/18westbank.html) up their families, restricting access to jobs\) on a daily basis.
1.2.2.1.5.1.5. Con: The [number of checkpoints](http://www.aipac.org/-/media/publications/policy-and-politics/aipac-analyses/issue-memos/2009/10/aipac_memo_israeli_measures_in_west_bank_easing_palestinian_travel_boosting_economy.ashx) have reduced from 41 to 14. Despite terror threats, Israel aims to allow the maximum freedom of movement possible.
1.2.2.1.5.2. Con: Freedom of movement is [not an absolute right](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-freedom-movement#can-the-right-to-freedom-of-movement-be-limited); restrictions can be imposed in national interest, such as to ensure national security. Thus, these restrictions do not ipso facto constitute a human rights violation.
1.2.2.1.5.3. Con: Freedom of movement is restricted in [some countries](https://freedomhouse.org/country/saudi-arabia/freedom-world/2021)(The government punishes activists and critics by limiting their ability to travel outside the country, and reform advocates are routinely stripped of their passports. Family members of activists can also be banned from travel.\n\nGender segregation restricts freedom of movement for both men and women, but male guardianship and other factors have historically imposed especially onerous constraints on women.) with recognized statehood. Thus, recognition does not guarantee that restrictions limiting freedom of movement will be lifted.
1.2.2.1.5.3.1. Pro: Strongly religious Muslim countries fare worse on [freedom indices](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-08/EDB_33_v3.pdf)(p. 1). Given the close association between [Islam and Palestine](https://www.history.com/news/why-jews-and-muslims-both-have-religious-claims-on-jerusalem), it is unlikely that Palestine will afford its citizens greater freedom.
1.2.2.1.5.4. Pro: Israel [denies passports](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-know-about-arab-citizens-israel)(After annexing East Jerusalem following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel offered the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living there Israeli citizenship. Most declined but were given permanent resident status. Today, roughly 90 percent of the 330,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem hold this status, which allows them to live, work, and travel freely within Israel, as well as access its health insurance and social services. However, they do not get Israeli passports \(many have Jordanian ones\) and cannot vote in national elections.) to many Palestinians, including those with Israeli citizenship status; this prevents them from traveling freely. A lifting of the occupation would allow Palestinians to issue their own passports and travel around the world.
1.2.2.1.6. Pro: Palestinians suffered brutal suppression under Israel during the two [Intifadas](http://www.vox.com/cards/israel-palestine/intifadas).
1.2.2.1.6.1. Con: The second Intifada also [led to significant suffering for Israelis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada), especially the civilian population that was frequently targeted by Palestinians.
1.2.2.1.6.2. Pro: Both the [First Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada#General_causes) and [Second Intifada](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/220/378) were direct results of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Recognizing Palestine might be a step toward preventing this from happening again.
1.2.2.1.6.2.1. Con: Support for a Third Intifada is only likely if other less violent mechanisms don't work. [Many Palestinians](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/676) support peaceful ways of resolving the conflict which means future violence is less likely.
1.2.2.1.6.2.2. Pro: The lack of progress in the conflict between Israel and Palestine could [cause](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/fear-of-a-third-intifada) a [Third Intifada](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/third-palestinian-intifada-on-way-or-already-begun) as people are increasingly frustrated with the status quo.
1.2.2.1.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.3.
1.2.2.1.6.3. Pro: While the Intifadas were not peaceful, they were met with overwhelming [force from Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/28/palestinian-intifada-20-years-later-israeli-occupation-continues)(The first days of the uprising were characterised by large non-violent demonstrations that included civil disobedience and some stone-throwing. \[...\] During the first few days of the second Intifada, it is estimated Israeli soldiers fired about 1.3 million rounds of ammunition, as revealed by Amos Malka, then-director of Israeli military intelligence. This occurred despite the fact that violence by Palestinians in the early weeks was minimal.\n\n“The Israeli violence showed that the Israelis were not interested in a quick end to the conflict,” Abu Yusuf said. “The fact that Israel shot over a million bullets, caused great losses to Palestinian lives, and stepped over the Muslim holy places all shows that Israel wanted to militarise the Intifada. The excessive use of force that the Israeli army exercised was intended to drag the Palestinians into a military confrontation.”).
1.2.2.1.6.3.1. Con: Comparative death totals say little about the morality of the various sides in a conflict. For example, the most conservative estimates of WWII deaths place the [ratio](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) of German to American casualties at 16 to 1.
1.2.2.1.6.3.2. Con: Given its vastly superior military, Israel had the means to gain unilateral control over the disputed regions. Thus, Israel demonstrated moral restraint by not exercising this option.
1.2.2.1.6.3.2.1. Con: Israel’s restraint may have been motivated by fear of backlash from the international community to such an action.
1.2.2.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Israel receives [substantial military assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_military_relations) from the US—more than any other country in the world. This military nexus significantly empowers Israel to use military force to achieve the desired outcomes.
1.2.2.1.6.3.3. Pro: The Intifadas led to significantly more [Palestinian](http://www.btselem.org/statistics/first_intifada_tables) than [Israeli](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3694350.stm) deaths, cementing the suppression of the former by the latter.
1.2.2.2. Con: Continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank prevents the authoritarian Islamist group Hamas from taking over the area.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Israeli [security forces](http://www.aipac.org/-/media/publications/policy-and-politics/aipac-analyses/issue-memos/2009/10/aipac_memo_israeli_measures_in_west_bank_easing_palestinian_travel_boosting_economy.ashx) are training their Palestinian peers to be more effective in fighting terror in Palestine.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.1.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: The occupation of the West Bank fuels anti-Israel sentiment and [promotes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/hamas-gaza-abbas-ramallah-israel-b1853025.html)(“In this conflict Hamas projected itself as representing Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank, not just Gaza. And to a large extent they succeeded. Many more people were carrying the green flag in Jerusalem and Ramallah. This hasn’t happened before with such clear expression of support.\n\n“People are saying, look, all these Arab and Muslim regimes and armies do nothing. But a small group with minimal means took the battle to Israel. It sends a message that we are alive, and we will not lose the spirit of resistance.) Hamas.
1.2.2.2.4. Con: Hamas has reclaimed Gazan land several times, [since 2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-ceasefire.html)(On three occasions since Hamas took full control of Gaza in 2007, Israel has launched major offensives aimed at degrading the group’s military capabilities, only to see Hamas rebuild and to achieve little success in actually changing the situation. This time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed, would be different.\n\nArmed with extensive war plans, Israel’s military leaders methodically went down a list of targets, trying to inflict maximum damage on Hamas’s military abilities and its commanders. Yet, even now, the top echelons of the Israeli military acknowledge that their efforts may not prevent another round of fighting, perhaps even in the near future.), despite Israel's intervention. This indicates that efforts to disempower the group are quite ineffective.
1.2.2.3. Con: The security provided by Israeli forces in the West Bank allows for [foreign investment](http://www.aipac.org/-/media/publications/policy-and-politics/aipac-analyses/issue-memos/2009/10/aipac_memo_israeli_measures_in_west_bank_easing_palestinian_travel_boosting_economy.ashx) to pour into the area.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: [Foreign investment](https://pij.org/articles/535/israeli-impediments-to-investment-in-palestine) in businesses in Palestinian territories is limited because of Israeli policies that stifle the Palestinian economy.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: When Israeli forces withdrew in 2005, their withdrawal was quickly followed by [a resurgence of violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza#Aftermath).
1.2.2.4. Con: Israel [continues](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-s-quot-blockade-quot-of-gaza) to supply electricity and water to the Palestinian people, despite the fact that these facilities are often hit by rockets fired by Hamas.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Gaza's only power plant was [destroyed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/gaza-power-plant-destroyed-israeli-airstrike-100-palestinians-dead) in one of Israel's most intense air strikes in the occupied territory.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Israeli occupation has a deleterious impact on the physical and mental health of Palestinians.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: Israeli occupation limits Palestinians' access to health care.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: The occupation has fragmented the West Bank into dozens of ‘islands’ separated by settlements, military zones and controlled roads. This restricts the ability of Palestinians to travel freely, thereby reducing or complicating access to health care \([p. 6](http://www.who.int/hac/crises/international/wbgs/opt_field_assessment_health_conditions_1april2015.pdf)\).
1.2.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Ambulances carrying patients](https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf)(In 2011, only 5% of Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances in the West Bank were allowed to enter Jerusalem, 95% had to drop off patients at the barrier to be transferred to ambulances with Israeli licence plates \(back-to-back\). In 2012, only 9% of Palestinian ambulances were allowed to enter Jerusalem.) requiring care from hospitals in Jerusalem are often not permitted to enter Jerusalem \(p. 14\).
1.2.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Construction of the Israeli West Bank Barrier [isolated](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf) many Palestinian communities from medical clinics \(p. 15\). In 2013, it was estimated that, once completed, more than 1.2 million Palestinians would be directly or indirectly affected.
1.2.2.5.1.2. Con: Palestinians have poor healthcare access because the Palestinian Authority has failed to allocate sufficient [budgets for medicines](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/SForum/SForum2015/MahmoudDaher.pdf) \(p. 7\).
1.2.2.5.1.2.1. Con: The Palestinian Authority can only spend based on its tax income; as this is often [interrupted](http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2013/health-challenges-in-palestine) by Israel, it is hard to plan.
1.2.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: The Ministry of Health is currently in debt to [pharmaceutical suppliers](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/SForum/SForum2015/MahmoudDaher.pdf)(Current debt to pharmaceutical suppliers is NIS 270 million.) \(p. 7\).
1.2.2.5.1.2.3. Pro: In 2013, the [Palestinian Authority](https://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2013/health-challenges-in-palestine) cut its allocation for the Ministry of Health by 30 percent.
1.2.2.5.1.3. Pro: Israeli Defence Forces have deliberately attacked [health workers](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/08/mounting-evidence-deliberate-attacks-gaza-health-workers-israeli-army/), [UNRWA Gaza shelters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israeli_shelling_of_UNRWA_Gaza_shelters) and [hospitals](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/another-gaza-hospital-hit-israeli-strike-four-dead-40-hurt-n161086). These attacks severely impair the ability of the Palestinian healthcare system to operate effectively.
1.2.2.5.1.4. Pro: Palestinians are [unable](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20415675) to leave Gaza to seek health care treatment unavailable in Gaza, and medical supplies are unable to cross the border because of the blockade.
1.2.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: An inability to access healthcare outside of Gaza or to let supplies inside is likely to [overburden](https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf)(pg.19) existing medical facilities.
1.2.2.5.1.5. Con: Projects by Israeli organizations help Palestinians to improve their medical training and business development.
1.2.2.5.1.5.1. Con: Charitable Israeli organizations can continue to improve Palestinian healthcare infrastructure, even in the absence of Israeli occupation.
1.2.2.5.1.5.2. Pro: The [Peres Center](https://www.peres-center.org/en/the-organization/projects/medicine/) has extended life-saving treatments to more than 12,000 Palestinian and Syrian children.
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: Israeli occupation has contributed to high rates of mental health issues amongst Palestinians \([p. 19](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf)\).
1.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: Following [Israel's attacks on Gaza](https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf)(p. 19), there was a significant increase in the prevalence of those treated for "psychological shocks and post-conflict disorders," and almost half of them were children below the age of nine.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: Recognizing Palestine would improve the work of the UN on the ground in the Palestinian territories.
1.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: Currently, UN organisations who work with Palestine can be penalised; this would no longer be the case if the US were to recognise Palestine.
1.2.2.5.3.1.1. Con: US recognition would not improve the work of UNESCO experts whom Israel does not allow to travel to sites in [Jerusalem](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/10/18/unesco-expected-adopt-controversial-jerusalem-resolution/92346718/).
1.2.2.5.3.1.2. Pro: [UNESCO](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/us-unesco-voting-funds-palestine-decision) was penalised when the US withheld 22% of its budget due to the admission of Palestine as a voting member state.
1.2.2.5.3.2. Con: Even though Palestine is not a member of several UN organizations, they can still operate there. UNIDO, for example, runs several projects with regards to [food safety](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2020-09/RAB-12054_SAFE_TE-2019_FINAL_NewNo.pdf)(p. xi) and regulations in the [marble stone](https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media_upgrade/Resources/Evaluation/Palestine_TVET_Evaluation_Final_Report__.pdf) industry \(p. 12\).
1.2.2.5.4. Con: An analysis comparing different possible solutions to the Israel-Palestine conflict predicted that [withdrawal by Israel](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR740-1.html)(Unilateral withdrawal by Israel from the West Bank would impose large economic costs on Israelis unless the international community shoulders a substantial portion of the costs of relocating settlers. Intangible factors, such as each party's security and sovereignty aspirations, are critical considerations in understanding and resolving the impasse. Taking advantage of the economic opportunities of a two-state solution would require substantial investments from the public and private sectors of the international community and from both parties.) would pose significant threats to the socioeconomic welfare of Palestinians. This could further exacerbate the mental health crisis in Palestine.
1.2.2.5.5. Con: The health effects of Israeli occupation are largely attributable to [human rights violations](https://borgenproject.org/mental-health-in-palestine-the-hidden-plague/), not occupation per se. Given that occupation does not legitimize [human rights violations](https://guide-humanitarian-law.org/content/article/3/occupied-territory/)(Several recent decisions by international courts have also confirmed that the occupying power is obliged to comply with its human rights obligations in occupied territories and in respect of people placed under its effective control as a result of occupation or detention. These decisions thus confirm that the application of international humanitarian law is complementary to the conventions on human rights in these situations.), they can be mitigated regardless of the status of Palestinian statehood.
1.2.2.5.6. Pro: Israeli occupation makes it difficult for Palestinians to fulfill their basic needs for food, water, and shelter.
1.2.2.5.6.1. Pro: About one-third of Gaza's arable land and 85 percent of its fishing waters are totally or partially inaccessible due to [Israeli military measures](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-gaza-rights-idUSTRE78C59R20110913). As a result, at least two-thirds of Gazan households lack secure access to food.
1.2.2.5.6.1.1. Pro: Many Palestinians suffer from [malnutrition-related diseases](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA66/A66_INF1-en.pdf)(p. 11) due to a lack of access to food as a result of military barriers and movement restrictions.
1.2.2.5.6.1.2. Con: Food and resource scarcity is likely to have arisen because Hamas uses the [majority of the supplies](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-s-quot-blockade-quot-of-gaza) brought into Gaza.
1.2.2.5.6.1.3. Pro: Blockades have left one million Palestinians in Gaza [without the ability](https://www.oxfam.org/en/timeline-humanitarian-impact-gaza-blockade)(The blockade has devastated Gaza’s economy, caused widespread destruction and left most people largely cut off from the outside world. Today, one million Palestinians in Gaza don't have enough food to feed their families, despite receiving food assistance or other forms of support.) to feed their family; this has a significant impact on the region.
1.2.2.5.6.2. Pro: Thousands of Palestinian homes and shops in East Jerusalem have been [destroyed](http://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/jerusalem-2016-home-demolitions/index.html) by the Israeli government.
1.2.2.5.6.3. Pro: In the West Bank, water resources have been seized allowing the Israeli settler population to consume approximately [three to eight times](https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/18062.html) the amount of water used by the Palestinian population.
1.2.2.6. Pro: The occupation allows Israel to stifle and control the economy of the West Bank and Gaza.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: Israel-Palestine [trade](http://www.boi.org.il/he/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Documents/Israel-Palestinian%20trade.pdf) benefits the Palestinian economy significantly \(pp. 3, 11\).
1.2.2.6.1.1. Con: Since trade and investment are mutually beneficial, they would presumably continue even in the absence of occupation.
1.2.2.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.2.
1.2.2.6.1.3. Pro: [Palestinian purchases](http://www.boi.org.il/he/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Documents/Israel-Palestinian%20trade.pdf) and sales from and to Israel account for two-thirds and 81% of total Palestinian imports and exports, respectively \(p. 1\).
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: The professional and economic security of Palestinians is jeopardized because of Israeli occupation.
1.2.2.6.2.1. Con: There are more universities now than [before](https://unitedwithisrael.org/the-facts-show-israeli-occupation-is-good-for-the-palestinians/) the West Bank occupation.
1.2.2.6.2.1.1. Con: The UN, not Israel, provides the bulk of education in the West Bank and Gaza \([p. 3](http://www.ps.undp.org/content/dam/papp/docs/Publications/UNDP-papp-research-PHDR2015Education.pdf)\).
1.2.2.6.2.1.2. Con: The Palestine Technical-Tulkarem University College and the Al-Ummah Community College were established before 1967 \([p. 32](https://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/The%20Status%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Teaching%20Personnel%20in%20Israel,%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20Gaza.pdf)\).
1.2.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: During the period of the British Mandate, the Peel Commission identified a lack of higher education opportunities for Palestinians as a major source of concern \([p. 31](https://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/The%20Status%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Teaching%20Personnel%20in%20Israel,%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20Gaza.pdf)\).
1.2.2.6.2.1.4. Con: The number of universities in Palestine is not a good indicator of what Israel has done. These universities could have been created in spite of Israel, rather than because of Israel.
1.2.2.6.2.2. Pro: Israel's decision to [withhold taxes](https://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/The%20Status%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Teaching%20Personnel%20in%20Israel,%20the%20West%20Bank%20and%20Gaza.pdf)(\(p. 33\)) from the Palestinian Authority causes a severe lack of funding for schools.
1.2.2.6.3. Pro: Israel's control over Palestinian land use violates international regulations and deprives Palestinians of essential resources.
1.2.2.6.3.1. Con: Israel considers many of the [territories in question](https://theprint.in/theprint-essential/what-israel-palestine-conflict-is-all-about-and-why-both-want-west-bank-gaza-strip/323825/) to be its own. Thus, the distinction between "Israeli" use of "Palestinian" land is meaningless in the eyes of some Israelis.
1.2.2.6.3.2. Pro: 42% of the land in the West Bank has been [requisitioned](http://www.btselem.org/download/201007_by_hook_and_by_crook_eng.pdf)(pg.5) by Israel. This reduces the land available for use by the Palestinians.
1.2.2.6.3.2.1. Pro: Palestinian quarries in the West Bank have been [raided and requisitioned](https://www.btselem.org/planning_and_building/20160421_military_shuts_down_palestinian_quarries) by Israeli military forces.
1.2.2.6.3.2.2. Con: Palestinian quarries are mainly supported by Israeli customers, propping up a [vital industry](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/the-palestinian-quarries-that-build-jerusalem-1.640799) that provides jobs and income for Palestinians.
1.2.2.6.3.2.3. Pro: Palestinians' land is [confiscated](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/palestinians-decry-west-bank-industrial-zone-expansion-170206090749576.html) without compensation in order to allow construction.
1.2.2.6.3.3. Pro: Israel’s confiscation of land, water, and other natural resources for the benefit of settlements and residents of Israel also violate the [Hague Regulations of 1907](http://www.eccpalestine.org/israels-obligations-as-an-occupying-power-under-international-law-its-violations-and-implications-for-eu-policy/), which prohibit an occupying power from expropriating the resources of occupied territory for its own benefit.
1.2.2.6.3.4. Pro: Israel [prohibits](https://www.btselem.org/download/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf)(pg.31) Palestinians from using over three-quarters of the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area. On the remaining land, Israel limits Palestinian building and prevents any possibility of sustainable development of Palestinian communities.
1.2.2.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.6.3.
1.2.2.6.5. Con: For many Palestinians, Israeli jobs are the [only](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-workers-idUSKCN0VV1J6) ones available to them. They provide much needed employment and considerably higher wages than Palestinian jobs.
1.2.2.6.5.1. Pro: Security officials in Israel have advocated for employing more Palestinians in Israel, as increased economic activity [reduces](http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-okay-work-permits-for-30000-more-palestinians/) the appeal of terrorism. As a result, the Israeli government is planning to [increase](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.759885) the number of work permits given to Palestinians.
1.2.2.6.5.1.1. Con: Work permits are [distributed arbitrarily](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/permit-laws-west-bank-workers-israel-150729094809544.html); young, unmarried Palestinian men rarely receive one as they are deemed to be a security threat. This prevents fully employment in Palestine.
1.2.2.6.5.1.2. Pro: Within a span of four years \(2011-2015\), the number of Palestinians working in Israel [doubled](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.645266). This underscores the benefits of increasing Israeli businesses and Palestinian workers for both parties.
1.2.2.6.5.2. Pro: Israeli businesses within settlements [provide tens of thousands of Palestinians with jobs](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-workers-idUSKCN0VV1J6) and a source of income.
1.2.2.6.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.6.5.1.2.
1.2.2.6.5.2.2. Con: Giving someone a job does not equate to them having a high quality of life or even a minimally enjoyable life.
1.2.2.6.5.2.3. Pro: [Working in Palestine](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/palestinian-workers-in-israel-seizing-opportunity-or-being-exploited-675338) makes more economic sense not only for Palestinians but also the West Bank, as the minimum wage in Israel is double of what it is in West Bank.
1.2.2.6.5.2.4. Con: Palestinian laborers who work in Israeli settlements are [exploited](https://www.btselem.org/download/201105_dispossession_and_exploitation_eng.pdf)(pg.37) and paid as little as one-third the minimum wage, while their employers consistently violate safety regulations.
1.2.2.6.5.3. Con: Palestinian workers experience a [lack of oversight](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/19/occupation-inc-how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian) on labour and environmental regulations than their Israeli counterparts, and no additional benefits. One can hardly call them a gift to the Palestinian people.
1.2.2.6.5.4. Con: Israel's preferential treatment towards Israeli businesses forces Palestinians to depend on them, while Palestinian businesses are prevented from growing.
1.2.2.6.5.4.1. Pro: Israel [provides](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/19/occupation-inc-how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian) financial and regulatory incentives and permits to Israeli businesses for the construction and operation of settlement companies while severely restricting such permits and incentives for Palestinian businesses.
1.2.2.6.5.4.1.1. Pro: Only [2%](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/jerusalem-2016-home-demolitions/index.html) of Palestinian construction permit requests are approved.
1.2.2.6.5.4.2. Con: Every country provides preferential treatment for their own businesses; protecting domestic enterprise is a common practice.
1.2.2.6.5.4.3. Pro: Since 1994, the military has been [systematically refusing](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/21/israel-quarry-shutdown-harms-palestinians) to issue permits for Palestinian quarries, while allocating large swaths of land in the West Bank for quarries in Israeli settlements. This costs the Palestinian economy at least US$ 241 million per year.
1.2.2.6.5.5. Con: The World Bank [found](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2010/09/21/the-underpinnings-of-the-future-palestinian-state-sustainable-growth-and-institutions) that Israel preventing access to the majority of the land and water resources in the occupied territories to Palestinians was the cause of underdevelopment in Palestine.
1.2.3. Con: There is little reason to believe that a change in a diplomatic policy would result in a corresponding change in leadership style from anyone involved in the conflict. As such, the conflict has been classified as [intractable](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-mathematics-of-middle_b_887723)(The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an immensely complicated hundred-year-old conflict that today operates and is reinforced across a multitude of issues, time periods, stakeholders and lands. It has become what Stephen Cohen, founder of the Institute for Middle East Peace and Development describes as “the crucible of multiple conflicts in the region and multiple grievances that feed upon one another and that produce reoccurring eruptions of violence.”).
1.2.3.1. Pro: As the Palestinian leadership \(both [Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-assures-critics-israels-destruction-still-a-goal/) and [Fatah](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-assures-critics-israels-destruction-still-a-goal/)\) has been clear that an independent Palestine will not end the conflict, recognition of Palestine would simply reward Palestinian intransigence.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [93% of Palestinians](https://global100.adl.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014) hold anti-Semitic views; an independent Palestine would not alter these so conflict would likely continue.
1.2.3.2. Con: The Palestinian Authority is forced to be undemocratic in order to ensure some semblance of stability. This may change after recognition.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Palestinians are better off independent and undemocratic than undemocratic and subservient to Israel, as many of the [difficulties](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution) faced by Palestinians are imposed by them.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Israel has [halted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/03/israel-tax-payments-withhold-palestine-international-criminal-court) transfers of the tax revenue it collects on behalf of the Palestinians in retaliation for their move to join the International Criminal Court. This has exacerbated economic woes that Fatah cannot abate.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Corruption and patronage politics is [widespread](http://www.thetower.org/3414-new-survey-96-of-palestinians-believe-palestinian-authority-is-corrupt/) and [endemic](https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/corruption-in-palestine/)(As many as 81% of the Palestinians living in the occupied Palestinian territory believe there is corruption in Palestinian Authority institutions according to a recent survey, perceptions reinforced by the recently launched annual report of the Palestinian Coalition for Accountability and Integrity \(AMAN\), the Transparency International chapter in Palestine. These perceptions persist despite former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s much-touted state-building efforts to root out corruption - and are at variance with international reports finding that suggest improvement in good governance.) in the Palestinian Authority; this may be very difficult to remediate regardless of the recognition of Palestine.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: The Palestinian Authority Security Forces \(PASF\) are beset by violent [patronage-based](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/64699/1/The%20evolution%20and%20reform%20of%20Palestinian.pdf)(p. 6) behaviour. This could lead to [infighting and divisions](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/opinion/global/the-bane-of-palestinian-infighting.html) in the security forces, if an independent Palestinian state is created.
1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: In the first Palestinian audit conducted in 1997, nearly 40% of the Palestinian Authority budget had been [misappropriated](http://www.u4.no/publications/overview-of-corruption-and-anti-corruption-in-palestine/). A 2011 report by [Transparency Palestine](https://www.aman-palestine.org/en/reports-and-studies/1387.html) indicated a continuation of this trend.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: President Mahmoud Abbas is serving his 16th year of a supposed four-year term. He has [not called for elections](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/6/mahmoud-abbas-no-champion-of-democracy-for-palesti/) and instead chooses to rule by presidential decree.
1.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: Abbas has not [openly cultivated](http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/15857/abbas-stumhttps://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/2017/02/mahmoud-abbass-appointment-of-a-new-deputy-chairman-wont-prevent-a-violent-succession-struggle/bles-at-home-despite-palestine-recognition-gains-abroad) a successor which may lead to a violent succession struggle and worse governance.
1.2.3.2.3.2. Con: Leaders of [other countries](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1689281) have established themselves as leaders for life, with no threats to the recognition of their states.
1.2.3.2.3.3. Pro: Most Palestinians would like Abbas to [resign](https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-jerusalem-israel-mahmoud-abbas-hamas-5a716da863a603ab5f117548ea85379d).
1.2.3.2.4. Con: The Palestinian Authority [engages in brutal suppression](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/killing-nizar-banat-and-authoritarianism-palestine/) of Palestinians in order to maintain its power. This does not contribute to stability.
1.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: The Palestinian Authority is increasingly moving towards establishing a [police state](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20160524-a-palestinian-police-state-in-waiting/) as has been [violently](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/03/evidence-shows-palestinian-security-forces-violently-suppressed-peaceful-protest-in-ramallah/) and brutally suppressing peaceful protests through use of [excessive force](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde21/006/2013/en/) for many years.
1.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: The PA’s [Preventive Security and General Intelligence](https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/04/06/no-news-good-news/abuses-against-journalists-palestinian-security-forces) security agencies violate the basic rights of journalists and limit their ability to perform their reporting duties. This is aimed at censoring free speech and minimizing reports of their own abuses.
1.2.3.2.5. Pro: Many countries are [undemocratic dictatorships](https://borgenproject.org/top-five-non-democratic-countries/). Non-adherence to democratic values neither warrants nor justifies the denial of recognition of statehood.
1.2.3.3. Pro: US recognition of Palestine does not force Israel to do anything; it is plausible that Israel would maintain the status quo and leadership style, and the harms would persist.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: The American political establishment effectively filters out the candidates that do not conform to certain [attitudes](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/opinion/sunday/roger-cohen-why-americans-see-israel-the-way-they-do.html?_r=0)(In the United States, by contrast, support for Israel remains strong \(although less so among the young, who are most exposed to the warring hashtags of social media\). That support is overwhelming in political circles. Palestinian suffering remains near taboo in Congress. It is not only among American Jews, better organized and more outspoken than their whispering European counterparts, that the story of a nation of immigrants escaping persecution and rising from nowhere in the Holy Land resonates. The Israeli saga — of courage and will — echoes in American mythology, far beyond religious identification, be it Jewish or evangelical Christian.) towards Israel and Palestine.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Israel's [Netanyahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu) served three terms as Prime Minister. The fact that Israelis consistently voted for him shows that they approved of his approach to Palestine.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.
1.2.3.3.2.2. Con: Netanyahu is on [trial for corruption](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/22/former-netanyahu-aide-testifies-corruption-trial-nir-hefetz), in part for giving preferential treatment to a company in exchange for positive reviews in the media. His firm grip over his public image could have convinced people he was doing a better job than he was in reality.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: Respecting and recognizing a people's right to self-determination should not depend upon whether it serves other political goals, such as the resolution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: Recognizing Palestine as a state may lead to the empowerment Hamas, which rules over the Gaza strip and is a US-designated terrorist organization. The right to self-determination of a terrorist organization should not be valued above the safety of Palestinian population and Palestine's regional neighbors.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: The right to self-determination of people is a founding principle of the UN charter \([p. 3](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/ctc/uncharter.pdf)\).
1.2.4. Pro: [Israeli settlements](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38888649) would be tantamount to violating the sovereignty of Palestine if the latter was recognised as a state. This makes settlements less likely to expand, and more likely to be dismantled.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Palestine is currently [too weak](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/this-is-the-imbalance-of-power-between-israel-and-palestine-in-real-terms-46651)(The Israeli Defence Forces \(IDF\) has nearly 170,000 active military personnel while it lists more than three million males and females available for army service. \[...\] On the other hand, without any real state or regular army, different Palestinian resistance groups have much less manpower than the Israeli army, amounting to circa 30,000 to 50,000 in troops.) to prevent settler expansion militarily, and as such the US should intervene to mitigate this on their behalf.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Even if no new settlements are built, it is hard to imagine how the [800,000 Jewish settlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_statistics_for_Israeli_settlements_in_the_West_Bank) already living on Palestinian land could be removed.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Israelis may imagine being rounded up, herded into prisons, and systematically executed.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is evident in their reaction to even the slightest criticism of their government or its policies, which is often fear-based, leading to [accusations of antisemitism](https://www.nif.org/blog/israels-abuse-and-misuse-of-the-word-anti-semitism/).
1.2.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Israelis are [taught about the Holocaust](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43057186).
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Israel recently [authorised](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/israel-authorises-3000-settler-homes-west-bank-170201051854191.html) 3,000 more settler homes in the West Bank. These will likely continue unless the Palestinian state is established.
1.2.4.2. Con: Despite being [illegal](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm) Israeli settlements have not stopped expanding. Even if the US recognises Palestine, the illegality will not be significantly different to the status quo.
1.2.4.3. Pro: According to the [UN Security Council](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm), Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law. Thus, dismantling them is justified.
1.2.5. Con: Recognizing Palestine could put historic monuments and antiquities at risk of destruction from violence.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Jewish temples [existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodium#Synagogue) in the [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamla#Synagogue) [Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada#Yigael_Yadin_expedition) from around 70 AD. Withdrawal from Gaza has lead to the [destruction](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-sep-12-fg-gaza12-story.html) of Jewish temples. If history repeats itself, withdrawal from the West Bank could lead to similar destruction of many Roman Era Jewish temples.
1.2.5.2. Pro: An independent Palestinian authority in the West Bank could put antiquities at risk as they [lack the capacity](https://apnews.com/article/egypt-ap-top-news-international-news-science-militant-groups-03b997d4565b4db799c6d0fe4a1fc263) to care for the sites.
1.2.5.3. Con: The transition from US recognition of Palestine to an independent Palestine would likely be incredibly slow, allowing time for protective infrastructure to be built around important historical sites.
1.2.5.4. Con: It is not clear why Palestinians would destroy historic monuments as they likely have similar attachments to these sites as Israelis.
1.3. Pro: Palestine is a legitimate state and deserves to be recognised as such.
1.3.1. Pro: The legal definition of a state is enshrined in international law via the [Montevideo Convention of Statehood](https://www.ilsa.org/Jessup/Jessup15/Montevideo%20Convention.pdf) \(p. 3\); Palestine fulfills the criteria outlined in the convention.
1.3.1.1. Con: Palestine lacks a single sovereign government which can enforce laws throughout its dominion.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Palestine is [politically divided](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2015/09/21/hamas-or-the-palestinian-authority-who-will-fail-first/) between two factions: Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and Fatah which controls the West Bank.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Even though Abbas's government does not have control over the entire territory, it is already the only sovereign recognized by most world governments, including the United Nations, whose [representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations) is appointed by Abbas. In this respect, it is no different than any other state that does not fully control its territory.
1.3.1.1.3. Con: [Pakistan](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/08/26/militancy-in-pakistan/), [Nigeria](http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2016/06/resurgence-militancy-nigerias-oil-rich-niger-delta-dangers-militarisation-160608065729726.html), [India](http://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/islamic-militancy-in-india-1478730250.html), [Ukraine](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/02/ukraine-map-170205081953296.html), and [Phillippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_Philippines) are just a few of the many states in the world that have militant organisations carrying out violent atrocities within their borders, yet they are all recognised as states.
1.3.1.2. Con: Palestine [does not have contiguous borders](http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2014/7/west-bank-security.html), but is instead made up of an archipelago of areas of control, broken up by Israeli settlements and highways.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: It is unclear why the nature of a state's borders bears on its legitimacy, particularly in a modern context in which physical travel is less important.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: It is circular to deny Palestine the recognition of a state, which would presumably consolidate its territory, because its territory is not consolidated at the moment.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: Other countries, too, have split territories and exclaves. [French Guiana](https://www.britannica.com/place/French-Guiana) is part of France, [Alaska](https://theconversation.com/why-russia-gave-up-alaska-americas-gateway-to-the-arctic-74675) and [Hawaii](https://restoftheiceberg.org/posts/2017/10/24/why-is-hawaii-part-of-the-usa) are part of the United States and the [Kaliningrad Oblast](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/31/kaliningrad-the-russian-enclave-with-a-taste-for-europe) is part of Russia, even though none of them share a border with their country's main territory.
1.3.1.2.4. Pro: Netanyahu proposed a plan to [apply sovereignty](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52756427) on Jewish settlement in the West Bank, effectively annexing 30% of the West Bank and creating a multitude of Palestinian enclaves.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Palestine has the "capacity to enter into relations with the other states" as it has a web of [diplomatic representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_Palestine) around the world.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Palestine clearly fulfills the [territory](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/26/palestine-and-israel-mapping-an-annexation) criteria as it rests upon a strip on the West Bank and in Gaza.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: The territory of the proposed Palestinian state is disputed. More than half of the West Bank, Area C, has a [majority Jewish population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C_\(West_Bank\)) that would rather stay under Israel's sovereignty.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: A significant portion of the Jewish population of Area C lives there due to [illegal settlement](https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/4/3/540/646388)(The real controversy hovering over all the litigation on the security barrier concerns the fate of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Since 1967, Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements established in the territories, motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel. This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 \(where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge\). The international community, for its part, has viewed this policy as patently illegal, based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation. \(pg.548\)).
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Whilst there have been significant settler attempts to [undermine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/how-israel-backs-settlers-to-confiscate-palestinian-lands)(In early May, more than 50 Jewish families packed their bags and moved to a hilltop in the West Bank in the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n...\nThe land is also strategically located. It lies south of Nablus in an area called Jabal Sabih in the villages of Beita and Yatma that is expected to be a part of the future state of Palestine. A settlement here would break Palestinian territorial contiguity.\n\nLast week, the settlers were finally evicted and the Palestinians celebrated it as a victory of their resistance.) Palestinian contiguity, some have recently been overruled.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Con: The Israeli government, under Naftali Bennett, is expected to use an [old Ottoman law](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/how-israel-backs-settlers-to-confiscate-palestinian-lands)(The Israeli media reported Naftali Bennett, Israel’s new prime minister and a staunch supporter of illegal settlements, offered the settlers a deal – the state would ascertain whether the land can be classified as “state land” and if yes – the conclusion the state is expected to arrive at – it would be handed over to the settlers even though it lies in Palestinian villages.\n\nHagit Ofran, executive director of the Settlement Watch programme at the Israeli NGO Peace Now, surmised it for Al Jazeera. “It was published: The settlers leave; the houses remain; the army puts up a military post; the government starts the process of declaring state lands,” Ofran said.\n\nIsrael legalises such outposts or settlements by deploying a draconian interpretation of the Ottoman law that if the land was not cultivated for several years in a row it would become the property of the state.) to claim the land.
1.3.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: If attempts to weaponise old Ottoman land law to legitimise settlements go [unchallenged](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/how-israel-backs-settlers-to-confiscate-palestinian-lands)(Will Biden pull him up and demand a settlement freeze, or will he just give him a slap on the wrist and agree to disagree?\n\nOfran of Peace Now said if left unchallenged by the United States, Bennet would of course want to continue with “the legalisation” of all outposts.\n\n“The question would be to what extent the pressure from within the government and from the world will lead him to refrain from it,” Ofran said.) by Biden, then they are likely to become a mainstay of land claims from Bennett's government.
1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: It seems unlikely that recently attempts to claim land that settlers have been expelled from will be successful, as it was [developed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/how-israel-backs-settlers-to-confiscate-palestinian-lands)(Israel legalises such outposts or settlements by deploying a draconian interpretation of the Ottoman law that if the land was not cultivated for several years in a row it would become the property of the state.\n\nPeace Now, however, asserted the Evyatar outpost was in fact built on “private Palestinian land”, and that an aerial photo from 1980 showed parts of the land were even “cultivated” – implying it cannot hence be deemed state land.) by Palestinians in recent history.
1.3.1.5. Pro: Palestine has a permanent population of around [4.7 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Palestinian_territories). Therefore, Palestine fulfills [criterion 1\(a\)](https://www.ilsa.org/Jessup/Jessup15/Montevideo%20Convention.pdf) of the Montevideo Convention \(p. 3\).
1.3.1.6. Con: Palestine does not have a [monopoly on violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence) over the area it claims.
1.3.1.6.1. Con: Recognition of statehood from the US could increase the ability of Palestinian governments to exert power within their borders and establish a monopoly on violence.
1.3.1.6.2. Pro: Palestine currently has no unitary security force. Fatah [controls](https://themedialine.org/by-region/backgrounder-palestinian-security-services-explained/) the Palestinian Security Services, while Hamas has [de-facto created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Security_Services#The_Executive_Force) its own security force in the Gaza Strip.
1.3.1.6.3. Pro: The cause of Palestine's failure to meet traditional concepts of statehood is Israeli occupation.
1.3.1.6.3.1. Pro: Israeli forces [regularly conduct raids](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/) into Palestinian areas of the West Bank to arrest suspected terrorists.
1.3.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Israeli intrusion should not render a state illegitimate: the US frequently intervenes militarily in countries without their consent, but that does not make their governments illegitimate.
1.3.1.6.3.1.2. Con: The frequency of these raids would presumably diminish drastically if this recognition strengthened the ability of the Palestinian state to maintain control itself.
1.3.1.6.3.2. Pro: Official recognition of statehood by the US could facilitate processes to unify control of Palestine; the granting of statehood could be made contingent on this happening.
1.3.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Fatah and Hamas have [already indicated](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.765719) a willingness to form a unity government. US recognition could enable greater international cooperation in the formation of that government.
1.3.1.6.3.3. Con: Israeli occupation is unlikely to change, should the USA recognise Palestine as a state.
1.3.2. Pro: Recognition by many other nations confirms a state's legitimacy as it [normalises](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/)(As is well known, Weber distinguishes among three main sources of legitimacy—understood as the acceptance both of authority and of the need to obey its commands. People may have faith in a particular political or social order because it has been there for a long time \(tradition\), because they have faith in the rulers \(charisma\), or because they trust its legality—specifically the rationality of the rule of law.) the social order of the state, and brings it into the sphere of international relations and law.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Many other states have recognised, or indicated their willingness to recognise, an independent Palestinian state - this indicates that it has an appropriate status as a nation.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: One-hundred thirty-five members of the UN [recognise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/11/07/map-the-countries-that-recognize-palestine-as-a-state/?utm_term=.75a6e0dbe01e) Palestine as a state. Palestine was therefore recognised by a [higher percentage of nations](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dashanne-stokes/is-this-the-real-reason-why-us-wont-recognize-palestine_b_9777246.html) at the time of its failed application to the U.N. in 2011 \(68 percent\) than Israel was \(64 percent\) when it was successfully admitted in 1949.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Palestine has [more states recognising it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition) than any other partially-recognised state not recognised by the US.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: The European Union has consistently declared its support and readiness for recognising a Palestinian state. This is outlined in both the 1980 Venice Declaration and [Berlin Declaration of March 1999](http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp418.htm) \([p. 1](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/mepp/docs/venice_declaration_1980_en.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The EU has [invested heavily](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_five_reasons_to_recognise_a_palestinian_state360) in the two-state solution; since 2007, EU member states have provided almost 2.5 billion euros worth of support to Palestinian state building efforts, not including annual contributions of more than 200 million euros for the UNRWA, the UN Relief Work Agency that carries out projects in the occupied territories.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The people of Palestine have the right to self-determination - this is far easier to attain when their state is internationally recognised.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Palestinians have a [right to a nationality](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/Nationality.aspx); however, this does not imply a UN right to a state of their own. Their rights to security and a stable life could be equally satisfied by giving them citizenship in another country, either Israel or Jordan.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Jordan has [no interest](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4615/jordan-palestinians) in accepting Palestinians as its own citizens, in part because it fears being transformed into a Palestinian state. It currently refuses entry and citizenship to, or forcibly deports, Palestinian refugees.
1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: [Millions of Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians_in_Jordan) already have, or are eligible to apply for, Jordanian citizenship.
1.3.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Jordan has recently been [arbitrarily withdrawing citizenship](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/02/01/stateless-again/palestinian-origin-jordanians-deprived-their-nationality) from people of Palestinian origin.
1.3.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The [easiest path to citizenship](https://www.unrwa.org/content/jordanian-nationality) is only open to Palestinians that lived in Jordan between December 1949 and February 1954.
1.3.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: Following the loss of the West Bank to Israel, Jordan became actively hostile against Palestinians in the northwest of the country; terminating in a conflict which suppressed Palestinians, expelled militants, and [permanently scarred relations](https://minorityrights.org/minorities/palestinians-2/) between the two nations.
1.3.2.2.1.1.5. Pro: Palestinians living in Jordan but originally from the Gaza Strip, which was under Egyptian authority until 1967, have [no right to Jordanian citizenship](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/12/04/JOR35401-Palestinians-West%20Bank.pdf)(p. 1).
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: As Palestinians were [forcibly expelled](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080030/israel-palestine-nakba) from Israel, their claim to sovereignty was never legitimately extinguished, so they still have a right to control over parts of the region.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: The current nonexistence of a Palestinian state is [due to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine) the rejection of a partition plan by Arab leaders in 1948 and subsequent acts of warfare against the new state of Israel by Arab nations. Given that Palestinians voluntarily forfeited their opportunity to receive a state, they are not entitled to one now.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The U.N. partition [recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) called for more than half of then Palestinian land to be allocated for a “Jewish State”. This was unreasonable as the Arabs were a majority in Palestine at the time, and owned more land than Jews in every single district in the region. The 1948 plan was unfair and deserved to be rejected.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if the agreement was unfair, the [violent reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#Arab_states)(A few weeks after UNSCOP released its report, Azzam Pasha, the General Secretary of the Arab League, told an Egyptian newspaper "Personally I hope the Jews do not force us into this war because it will be a war of elimination and it will be a dangerous massacre which history will record similarly to the Mongol massacre or the wars of the Crusades." \[...\] Azzam told Alec Kirkbride "We will sweep them \[the Jews\] into the sea." Syrian president Shukri al-Quwatli told his people: "We shall eradicate Zionism.") against Israel from surrounding Arab nations was unjustified.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Violent reactions can be justifiable; the [German occupation of Poland](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/germany-s-wwii-occupation-of-poland-when-we-finish-nobody-is-left-alive-a-759095.html) was unfair, and the subsequent violent reaction against Germany was justifiable.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Palestine has [no history](https://theconversation.com/the-history-of-israel-and-palestine-alternative-names-competing-claims-163156)(At that time, the land comprised three administrative regions of the Ottoman empire, none of which was called “Palestine.”\n\nIn 1917, the land came under British rule. In 1923, “Mandatory Palestine,” which also included the current state of Jordan, was created. Its Arab inhabitants saw themselves primarily not as “Palestinians” in the sense of a nation, but instead as Arabs living in Palestine \(or rather, “Greater Syria”\).) as a unified state; it existed as part of other states before the 20th century.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Arab leaders in 1919](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=10)(Prior to partition, Palestinian Arabs did not view themselves as having a separate identity. When the First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations met in Jerusalem in February 1919 to choose Palestinian representatives for the Paris Peace Conference, they adopted the fol-lowing resolution: We consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic, and geo-graphical bonds. Similarly, the King-Crane commission found that Christian and Muslim Arabs opposed any plan to create a country called “Palestine,” because it was viewed as recognition of Zionist claims. In 1937, a local Arab leader, Auni Bey Abdul Hadi, told the Peel Commission, which ultimately suggested the partition of Palestine: “There is no such country as Palestine! ‘Palestine’ is a term the Zionists invented! There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria.” \(pg.3\)) denied that there is a distinct country called Palestine, instead associating it with Syria.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Whilst Palestine was not a state historically, it is considered one today as those living within it [request statehood](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/palestinian-statehood-un), and unified recognition.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: Given that there are no historical roots for the state of Palestine, the US should not recognize them; instead, the US should recognize the Palestinians as a distinct people living within the state of Israel.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Con: Palestinians never had a claim to sovereignty over the area in the first place; [Britain did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine), as Palestine prior to 1948 was part of the British Mandate.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1. Con: The [British Mandate for Palestine](https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/2FCA2C68106F11AB05256BCF007BF3CB) was a piece of legislation produced by a colonial organisation, [the League of Nations](https://brill.com/view/journals/iclr/22/3-4/article-p275_2.xml?language=en#FN000050), with little regard for the rights of Palestinian Arabs. It should not be considered a legitimate cession of Palestinian moral ownership of the area.
1.3.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: The [British Mandate](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/british_mandate_for_palestine) was a legally binding instrument created by the League of Nations and backed by the San Remo declaration and the treaty of Sevres \(1920\) whereby the previous sovereign divested itself of any claim to the area. The mandate recognised the rights of Jews to reconstitute their national home.
1.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: [Historical records](https://www.afsc.org/resource/palestinian-refugees-and-right-return) disprove the theory that Palestinian Arabs fled the state voluntarily or at the behest of Arab leaders. Instead, they were forced to flee because their lives were endangered.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Palestinians previously inhabited an area greater than it currently does - much of their land has been [stolen](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1997/05/selling_land_to_jews.html), actively restricting their right to self-determination.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: The conquest of Palestinian territories by Israel in the [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War) was illegitimate.
1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: As the land taken in the defensive war did not belong to any entity called "Palestine" framing the claim as a "conquest of Palestinian territories" is fallacious. The area in question had been held by Jordan.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: While individual Palestinians may have claims to land because it was stolen from them, this doesn't establish the legitimacy of a Palestinian state that postdates this theft.
1.3.2.2.3.2.1. Con: All Palestinians have suffered from the flow-on consequences of the initial theft of land; they therefore all have a moral claim to the land.
1.3.2.2.3.2.2. Con: At the very least, by indicating that the Israeli claim to the land is based on theft and therefore not legitimate, it strengthens the Palestinian claim to the land and therefore to self-determination.
1.3.2.2.3.2.3. Con: If modern Israel's legitimacy postdates its historical narrative, which is over 2,000 years old, then the 100-year-old Palestinian rights are also valid.
1.3.2.2.3.3. Pro: Expulsions and the illegal occupation of land that had been temporarily vacated during the war of 1948, called [the Palestinian Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus), shaped the land claim of the early Israeli state.
1.3.2.2.3.4. Con: Jews existed in British-mandated Palestine and could have been considered Israeli. A significant portion of modern day Israel was [legally purchased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine) off Arab inhabitants.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1. Con: In 1945, the land owned by Jewish peoples made up merely 7% of the combined area of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Israel), the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank), and [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip), with half owned by [the JNF and PICA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine#Land_purchases). It is hard to imagine how the remainder - nearly 19,000 square km - could have been legally purchased off Arab inhabitants.
1.3.2.2.3.4.2. Pro: The land wasn't considered stolen when it was under Jordanian and Egyptian control.
1.3.2.2.4. Con: If the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination clashes with the same right of the Jewish people, it is not clear how both can be respected.
1.3.2.3. Con: Palestinians seek recognition in order to access the right to self-determination. Yet self-determination is not a tangible element of international law \([p. 3](https://falklandstimeline.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/self-determination-daniel-thurer-thomas-burri.pdf)\). The US therefore makes no difference by refusing to recognise the state.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: It is [not clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination#Defining_"peoples") how to define "peoples" and whether the Palestinians therefore have the right to self-determination.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: In numerous cases the applicability of the right to self-determination is disputed, for example in the case of the [Kurdish people](http://opiniojuris.org/2017/09/28/kurds-right-self-determination-andor-secession/) and the [Basque people](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-basque-self-determination/spains-basque-country-proclaims-right-to-self-determination-idUSKBN0E91R720140529).
1.3.2.3.1.2. Con: [Ethnic groups](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethnic-group), even those spread across different countries, can still be easily defined as a "people."
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Even where there is agreement on the existence of a people, it is not clear what the right to self-determination entails and how precisely it can be exercised \([p. 5](https://falklandstimeline.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/self-determination-daniel-thurer-thomas-burri.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.3. Con: The principle of self-determination has [historical precedent](https://falklandstimeline.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/self-determination-daniel-thurer-thomas-burri.pdf)(The principle of self-determination was invoked on many occasions during World War II. It was also proclaimed in the → Atlantic Charter \(1941\) \(Declaration of Principles of 14 August 1941\), in which President Roosevelt of the United States and Prime Minister Churchill of the United Kingdom declared, inter alia, that they desired to see ‘no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned’ \(Principle 2 Atlantic Charter\), that they respected ‘the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live’ \(Principle 3 Atlantic Charter\) and that they wished to see ‘sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them’ \(Principle 3 Atlantic Charter\)) and has been invoked on many occasions, dating back to WWII.
1.3.2.4. Con: If recognition by many other nations is sufficient, there is no reason why the US should be pressured into recognizing Palestine as a state.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Several other polities are partially recognised, however the US has not historically seen this as a compelling reason to recognise them itself.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Eighty-four UN states recognise the [Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic) \(Western Sahara\), however the US does not.
1.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: The Republic of China \(Taiwan\) is recognised by [19 UN member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Taiwan#Entities_with_full_diplomatic_relations_with_Taiwan), as well as the Vatican, but not by the US.
1.3.2.4.1.3. Con: The US does not recognize the independence of Corsica and Catalonia against the wishes of, respectively, France and Spain.
1.3.2.4.1.3.1. Con: People in Corsica and Catalonia do not suffer to the same degree under the current situation as Palestinians do. That makes the comparison highly flawed.
1.3.2.4.1.4. Con: Kosovo is [recognized by the US](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-countries-does-the-united-states-recognize.html) but not the UN; providing a precedent for recognizing certain countries without depending on the determinations from other countries.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: It may be possible to reduce the number of international law violations if the US recognises Palestine; this move creates political pressure.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Israel has consistently [ignored](http://www.haaretz.com/study-israel-leads-in-ignoring-security-council-resolutions-1.31971) more UN Security Council decisions against it than any other country. It is unlikely to change its behaviour.
1.3.2.4.2.2. Con: The US has not historically conducted its geopolitical strategies according to international law. As such, reducing the number of international law violations through recognition of Palestine is unlikely to be a significant motivator for change.
1.3.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: The US invasion of Iraq was [illegal under international law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq).
1.3.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: The US' continued use of drone strikes in undeclared war zones is illegal as per international law and [may even constitute war crimes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un).
1.3.2.4.2.2.3. Pro: Recognising Palestine could be viewed as a way for the US to divert attention away from more questionable parts of its foreign policy.
1.3.2.4.2.2.4. Con: Just because the US does not base its geopolitical strategy on emphasising international law does not mean it should not do so.
1.3.2.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: It is morally important for the US to do the right thing even if it does not have the best moral track record.
1.3.2.4.2.2.5. Con: International law and American support for it is actively denigrated if the US [openly supports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/us-israeli-settlements-no-longer-considered-illegal-palestinian-land-mike-pompeo) illegal policies for political gain.
1.3.2.4.2.2.5.1. Con: The US supports governments who regularly breach human rights, including [Egypt](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/08/biden-accused-of-u-turn-over-egypts-human-rights-abuses), [Saudi Arabia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-55794286), and [the Philippines](https://www.openglobalrights.org/us-foreign-policy-aggravates-human-rights-abuses-in-the-philippines-during-covid/).
1.3.2.4.2.3. Pro: The [UN Fact Finding Mission](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf)(p. 284) in Gaza found that "some of the actions of the Government of Israel might justify a competent court finding that crimes against humanity have been committed," for example the [naval blockade](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/10/20111030172356990380.html). If Palestine were to be established as a sovereign state, these crimes would receive more attention and condemnation from the international community.
1.3.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: The only way for the Palestinian people to escape their oppression is for them to achieve a semblance of political parity with Israel, which will only be achieved through international recognition.
1.3.2.4.2.3.2. Con: An earlier report by the UN, the [Palmer Report](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-and-comparative-law-quarterly/article/abs/ii-the-palmer-report-and-the-legality-of-israels-naval-blockade-of-gaza/B02264DB75EBEF24B1C38547E5DBBE7C), declared the naval blockade on Gaza legal.
1.3.2.4.2.3.2.1. Con: The Palmer Report was intended to [mend relations](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/09/02/u-n-s-gaza-flotilla-report-adrift-at-sea/) between Turkey and Israel rather than provide a factual assessment of the situation. Not only was the report more political than factual in nature, it also relied exclusively on information provided by Turkey and Israel, hence its conclusions cannot be considered definitive in either fact or law.
1.3.2.4.2.4. Con: America has already taken a stance [against](https://www.timesofisrael.com/despite-relentless-obama-criticism-settlements-grew-as-much-in-his-years-as-in-bushs/) settlements in the West Bank and, therefore, does not need to recognise Palestine as a state.
1.3.2.4.2.4.1. Con: The US has been [unable to stop](https://www.timesofisrael.com/despite-relentless-obama-criticism-settlements-grew-as-much-in-his-years-as-in-bushs/) Israel from expanding settlements. In fact, the rate of construction of such settlements has increased, so America does need to do more.
1.3.2.4.2.4.2. Con: Trump has given [mixed signals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/10/trump-apparent-u-turn-israeli-settlement-growth) about the construction of settlements in the West Bank. Recognising Palestine as a state will be a firm indicator that America does not tolerate further expansion of settlements on Palestinian territory.
1.3.2.4.2.5. Pro: Recognition of a Palestinian state is an important step in preventing Israeli de-facto [annexation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52756427) of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
1.3.2.4.2.5.1. Pro: 75% of Israelis would [not support](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/half-of-israelis-support-annexation-25-percent-even-with-no-us-backing-poll-630129) annexation without USA support, and it is unlikely to support annexation after recognizing Palestine as a state.
1.3.3. Con: Recognising Palestine may jeopardise Israel's place in the region.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Israelis have a strong religious claim to Palestinian land; recognising Palestine would require giving up the land which is illegitimate.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Many holy texts, followed by more than a billion people, delegate Israel to the Jews.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Some Islamic scholars have noted that Palestinian claims to the land are not based on Quranic scriptures but on "popular demonization of the Jewish people." This can be interpreted to mean that, based on scriptural grounds, Israel should be delegated to the Jews.
1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Muslims believe that Moses was Muslim, and therefore one could make an argument that the “Holy Land” mentioned in [Qur'an 5:21](https://quran.com/5/21) should now be under Muslim control.
1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The number of followers a religion has tells us nothing about whether this religion's beliefs are more correct or relevant than any other religion's beliefs.
1.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The claims in a religious text have no moral significance for ownership because the religions espoused within those texts are not true.
1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: The Torah recognizes that the land of Israel was the home for other older tribes before the Israelites arrived \([Pentateuch Shemot 34:11-12](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9895/jewish/Chapter-34.htm)\). Thus, according to the Torah, the Israelites' descendants are not the most ancient inhabitants.
1.3.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Claims in the Torah are not consistent with prevailing academic opinion: the [Israelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites) were predominantly indigenous to Canaan.
1.3.3.1.1.4. Pro: In Judaism, [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem#Oldest_inscriptions) is the holiest city, and the Temple Mount at its center is the [holiest site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_places#Judaism).
1.3.3.1.1.4.1. Con: Jerusalem is of great religious significance to Muslims too, and is considered to be the [third holiest site](http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=646) in Islam.
1.3.3.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Jerusalem was the first [qibla](https://www.al-islam.org/the-message-ayatullah-jafar-subhani/chapter-29-change-qiblah), or direction of prayer, for Muslims, before the qibla became Mecca.
1.3.3.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Jerusalem is the city from where Muhammad [ascended](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml) to Heaven and met Allah. It is an important religious event that is [celebrated](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/lailat-al-miraj-2014_n_5395082.html) by Muslims every year throughout the world.
1.3.3.1.1.4.1.3. Con: Jerusalem and Zion are [mentioned](http://www.danielpipes.org/84/the-muslim-claim-to-jerusalem) almost a 1000 times in the Jewish scriptures but not once in the Quran.
1.3.3.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Even though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem itself, it [refers to](https://quran.com/17/1) the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's old town.
1.3.3.1.1.4.1.3.2. Con: It is questionable whether references in holy scriptures are the appropriate standard to judge religious significance. The Bible does not mention the Vatican, the Pope or cardinals at any point, yet these stand at the center of the Catholic Church.
1.3.3.1.1.4.1.4. Con: Jerusalem has historically been used as a [political tool](http://www.danielpipes.org/84/the-muslim-claim-to-jerusalem) by Islamic empires. There is little religious importance affiliated with the city that outweighs Judaism's three thousand year old connection.
1.3.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: [Psalm 137](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/11981) commands Jews to never forget about Jerusalem.
1.3.3.1.1.4.3. Con: Under the two state solution, Jews could [retain access](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/09/18/two-states-or-one-reappraising-israeli-palestinian-impasse-pub-77269)(Full access to holy sites and freedom of worship will be granted to all religions, and the Old City within the walls will come under a special regime.) to their most important religious sites, such as the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.
1.3.3.1.1.4.4. Pro: The religious significance of Jerusalem for Jews is the greatest of all three Abrahamic religion. Jews prayed toward [Al-Aqsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrah#Jewish_law), Jerusalem before Islam and still pray toward it to this day in every single synagogue. Neither Christians nor Muslims pray toward Jerusalem or Al Aqsa.
1.3.3.1.1.5. Pro: Biblical claims are [very reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_inscription#Translation) in [historical fact](http://blog.dovidgottlieb.com/search/label/Biblical%20archaeology) relevant to land claims.
1.3.3.1.1.5.1. Con: The original covenant that God made with Israel was broken when Israel chose to rebel against God. Consequently, God made [a new covenant](https://www.ucg.org/world-news-and-prophecy/palestine-israel-whose-land-is-it-really) with Israel, which represents all who believe in Him, regardless of ethnicity or heritage.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: In [Genesis 12:7](http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm) and [15:18-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2015:18%E2%80%9321;&version=NIV;), God promised Greater Israel to the descendants of Abraham. Jews are the descendants of Abraham.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Textually, God explicitly limited this promise to the seed of Isaac \([Gen 21:10](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216#v=10) as endorsed by [21:12](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216#v=12) and [25:5](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8220/jewish/Chapter-25.htm#v=5)\). This promise was then given to Jacob and his descendants \([Gen 28:4](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8223#v=4)\).
1.3.3.1.1.5.3. Con: Holy texts [like the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible#Schools_of_archaeological_and_historical_thought) are not a good source to base modern land claims upon as they are notoriously unreliable and usually perceived to be not rooted in historic facts.
1.3.3.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Modern Zionists do not base their claim to the land of Israel on the Abrahamic covenant. Instead, the claim is based in part on [accepted history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Titus) and [proven archeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dan_Stele).
1.3.3.1.1.5.4. Pro: The Old Testament delineates the land of Israel in [Numbers 34:1-35:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2034-35:8) and [Ezekiel 47:13-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2047%3A13-23&version=NIV).
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.1. Con: This extract \([Numbers 34:1-35:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2034-35:8)\) says "Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee," which is not respected nowadays, so what was once, no longer is.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Only [14%](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(pg.14) of Israelis regard the claim to a "Greater Israel" - a [vision of Israel](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/what-is-greater-israel-why-is-the-idea-not-acceptable-to-the-muslim-community-1621507466-1) generated through a biblical and religious lens - as a priority.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: The United States is a [secular democracy](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/secular-countries)(The United States is often considered to be "constitutionally secular." The U.S. Constitution states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Additionally, keeping with the lack of an established state religion, Article Six of the U.S. Constitution states that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." The extent of separation between the U.S. government and religion continues to be debated. While the U.S. is a self-described secular state, there are still references to religion in the pledge of allegiance.) and should not take religious claims into consideration when deciding a matter of foreign policy.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: Religious claims shouldn't determine the rightful rulers of a land. The Amerindian people have a [strong religion](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/315) and [worship](http://indianrockpiles.weetu.com/articles/IndianRockPiles.html) specific places on the land of the United States of America and Canada, yet they are not its rulers. A similar situation exists in many other countries and regions.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Due to their historical and religious claims on the regions in Canada and USA, Canadian Aboriginal have [self-governing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_self-government_in_Canada#Self-government_agreements) territories and are actively promoting more autonomy from the federal government.
1.3.3.1.3.1.2. Con: Religious and historic claims should and do determine rightful ownership of the land. Many [court battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_self-determination#Land_reclamation_and_anti-termination) have been won by natives to reclaim land which were taken by settlers.
1.3.3.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Blue Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos_Pueblo#Blue_Lake) was a sacred religious site for Amerindians and after many legal battles, U.S. has acknowledged the religious claim to the land and given back ownership to the Taos people.
1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: When making a decision that has an impact on a highly religious area of the world, it would be foolish to ignore religion entirely.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: Religious claims should not be seen as legitimate as Israel does enforce Jewish law.
1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: Religious claims played [very little role](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zionism)(A political turn was given to Zionism by Theodor Herzl, an Austrian journalist who regarded assimilation as most desirable but, in view of anti-Semitism, impossible to realize. Thus, he argued, if Jews were forced by external pressure to form a nation, they could lead a normal existence only through concentration in one territory. In 1897 Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress at Basel, Switzerland, which drew up the Basel program of the movement, stating that “Zionism strives to create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by public law.”) in the early history of the Zionist movement and the creation of the state of Israel. Rather, the chief argument was the need to have a Jewish majority nation-state in order to enforce the rights of Jewish people.
1.3.3.1.4.2. Pro: Claims to benefits from adherence to a specific religion without living by the rules of that religion represents a form of cherry-picking. This is ethically problematic.
1.3.3.1.4.3. Con: Many religious sites are recognized as belonging to a specific country without having to prove their adherence to religious rules.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: Strict interpretation of Shariah forbids women from working outside home as it is not their [natural state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia#Employment). Yet, the international community does not question Saudi Arabia's control over Mecca and Medina even though Saudi women work outside their homes.
1.3.3.1.4.3.2. Pro: UNESCO has recognized the Dome of the Rock as Jordan's through a religious foundation \([p. 2](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246215)\). Nonetheless, [Jordanian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jordan) is not religious.
1.3.3.2. Con: Jewish and Palestinian people have a shared strong historical claim to the land. It is illegitimate to prioritise one over the other.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Relying on history to judge the legitimacy of claims to land results in a regress to the original occupants. This would mean that peoples of most nations would have to surrender their land to those who were there before them which is infeasible.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: [A large number of](http://metrocosm.com/mapping-every-disputed-territory-in-the-world/) countries are disputed, and many have [independence](https://businessinsider.com.pl/international/experts-cant-figure-out-why-independence-movements-are-suddenly-sweeping-the-world/nssbjmk) movements. By recognising land claims, people are given more [sovereignty](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100520397) which affords choice - this is more important than feasibility.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: If all people had to return to their native lands then [more than 98%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States) of the American population would have to be sent back to the homelands of their ancestors. Migration on this scale would be highly disruptive.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Jews are the oldest inhabitants of the region, with [ancestry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707613251) dating back 9500 years. Therefore, Palestinians cannot be considered to have an equal land claim.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: The West Bank was part of Israel for a millennia, starting with the [Kingdom of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\(united_monarchy\)) in 1050 BCE, to the [Herodian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_kingdom) 4 BCE. Jews led the first independent polity in the region.
1.3.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Unlike the existence of an ancient Jewish sovereign over this land, there has never been a Palestinian state, nor, until recently, did Palestinians have a separate identity. They saw themselves as part of a larger Arab Syria \([p. 3](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/mf2017.pdf#page=43)\).
1.3.3.2.2.1.2. Con: By the same logic, the Egyptian people have an exclusive claim to much of the territory as they had incorporated it [into their empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt) by the 15th century BC.
1.3.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Even [during the period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine#Independent_Canaanite.2C_Israelite_and_Philistine_period) with an Israelite presence in the region, other independent peoples were present. Thus, they should also have a claim to the land. Among them are the Philistines who [fought Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines) according to the Bible.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Con: Accounts of past Jewish sovereignty on the disputed territories are based on historical accounts not backed up by research and archaeological evidence.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: The story of King David is not entirely supported by the scientific literature.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The [Tel Dan Inscription](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/artifacts-and-the-bible/the-tel-dan-inscription-the-first-historical-evidence-of-the-king-david-bible-story/) is strong enough evidence for modern scholars to take the existence of King David seriously.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1.2. Con: King David’s palace is the best explanation for the discovery of the [Large Stone Structure](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/jerusalem/did-i-find-king-davids-palace/) discovered by Eilat Mazar.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: There is a lack of [archaeological evidence](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-the-naked-truth-about-king-david-1.5324553) for the existence of King David.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1.4. Pro: The stories of who King David was and what he did are conflicting, and they give no [coherent account](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-the-naked-truth-about-king-david-1.5324553) of his life.
1.3.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: The historical evidence for the [Kingdom of Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah#Archaeological_record) and the [Kingdom of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\(united_monarchy\)#Archaeological_record) is sparse and disputed; both were likely much smaller, less unified and less powerful than depicted in biblical accounts.
1.3.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: The biblical accounts of King Solomon and the empire he ruled have been [called into question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Historicity). Little archaeological evidence has been found for the power he is usually ascribed or [for the temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple#Archaeology) in Jerusalem named after him.
1.3.3.2.2.2.4. Con: While aspects of the story by which the Jewish people trace their ancient claim to sovereignty in Israel and Palestine are questionable, others are not. For example, the historical and archeological evidence of the [Hasmonean Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty) which ruled that area just prior to its incorporation into the Roman empire, is clear.
1.3.3.2.2.2.5. Con: Archaeological studies support that Israelites were Canaanites who lived in a community which was called Israel, and [Israelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites) culture and religion derived from Canaanite culture and religion. The name of god El and Yahveh derive from the supreme god Canaanite "El".
1.3.3.2.2.2.6. Con: Distinct Jewish culture is referenced in artifacts from 3000 years ago.
1.3.3.2.2.2.6.1. Pro: The Egyptian [Merneptah Stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merneptah_Stele) confirms that Jews lived in Israel for more than 3000 years \(the stele was created in 1208 BC\).
1.3.3.2.2.2.6.2. Pro: The [Moab stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele) \(from a bronze-age state in modern day Jordan\) confirms Jews lived in Israel 3000 years ago \(840 BC\).
1.3.3.2.2.2.6.3. Pro: The [Gezer calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezer_calendar), discovered 20 miles west of Jerusalem, confirms the Canaanite origin of Jewish people. The tablet dates back to 1000 BC, a time when Hebrew and Canaanite culture had not yet diverged.
1.3.3.2.2.2.6.3.1. Con: There is some academic disagreement over the age of the Gezer calendar, which could disprove the cultural diversion timeline \([pp. 31-35](https://www.academia.edu/9206107)\).
1.3.3.2.2.2.6.4. Con: Artifacts "carrying our memories and traumas" experienced by the Palestinian people belong to the [Neolithic period](https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/palestine-ancient-masks-dispossession)("For Palestinians, these historical objects are evocative. They act as vessels carrying our memories and traumas \(...\) these tactile forms are not merely material objects - they are tools that we identify with and resist with, and with which we exert our disappearing existence.\n\n"For Palestinians, they are emotional companions."). Thus, if artifacts are to serve as the basis for land ownership, Palestinians would have an advantage.
1.3.3.2.2.2.6.5. Con: It is unfair to base land ownership claims on artifacts because [Palestinian artifacts](https://www.972mag.com/archaeology-looting-israel-army/?fbclid=IwAR1l04GHipWrpLpkmqnGoXFP5lWNYm44OJPadUW3OaCjZIwnHKmEFGX6mYY)(Entitled “Finds Gone Astray,” the exhibition essentially glorified the Israeli military’s role in confiscating archaeological artifacts from the West Bank. According to the museum’s director, roughly 40,000 artifacts were “recovered” by the Israeli authorities.\n\nThis stark number of artifacts should raise major warning flags — especially during a time of increased black market activity, after the wars in Iraq and Syria. It is unclear where the artifacts were retrieved from, and not knowing their provenance makes it challenging to date them with credibility and prove their authenticity. This act of displacement gives museums, collectors, and cultural ministries the power to reframe theft as recovery and to loot houses as prestigious institutions.) have been seized or displaced by other countries, including Israel, in an effort to erase their identity.
1.3.3.2.2.3. Pro: Jews and Palestinians do not share a common heritage: Jews show [common ancestry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1274378/#RF34) with other Neolithic Levantine and Iraqi populations, whereas Palestinians are of Arab origin.
1.3.3.2.2.3.1. Con: Genetically, Muslim Arabs in this region are Semitic people and [descend](https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/palestinians-and-jews-share-genetic-roots-1.5411201) from Abraham as much as the Jews; they have similar specific chromosomes and genes.
1.3.3.2.2.3.2. Con: The [HLA-DRB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844529/) cluster [links](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844529/)(Fig. 4) Palestinians with Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, making the three groups closer to each other than any other ethnic groups.
1.3.3.2.2.3.2.1. Con: The Levantine group, based on the HLA*-A and–B* cluster, shows that some Palestinians are equally close to some Ashkenazi, Lebanese, and Jordanian peoples \([Fig.5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844529/)\).
1.3.3.2.2.3.3. Pro: The [DQB1* 02:0X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844529/) allele is found in 20.9% of Palestinians' DNA, along with many Arab populations \(25.7% Bahraini, 35.9% Jordanian, 37.3% Saudi\). The HLA-[DRB1*11:01](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/CDLI.11.4.770-774.2004) allele is also a marker common for Arabs \(20.5% Palestinians, 26.6% Egyptians, 26.9% Lebanese\).
1.3.3.2.2.3.4. Pro: A [study](http://www.haaretz.com/1.5131928) has shown that 90% of Jews are [genetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites#Historical_Israelites) [linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5544389/#!po=62.0000) to the Levantine Canaanites. Canaanites lived in Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon, and were its first inhabitants. Jews are descendents of Canaanites living in Israel.
1.3.3.2.2.3.4.1. Con: Palestinians are [also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844529/) [linked](https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/palestinians-and-jews-share-genetic-roots-1.5411201) to the Levantine Canaanites. Jews, Palestinians, Druze, and Israeli Bedouins are genetically closer to each other than to any other population.
1.3.3.2.2.3.4.2. Pro: The different cultural groups who inhabited the Levant during the Bronze Age each had their own cultural identities, but shared a [common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5544389/#!po=62.0000) genetics with Canaanites.
1.3.3.2.2.4. Pro: Muslims from the Arab Peninsula [invaded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_conquest_of_the_Levant) Israel in 634 AD, and have, therefore, lived in the region for a shorter period of time.
1.3.3.2.2.5. Con: Palestinians have inhabited the region as long as Jews. [Studies](http://sciencemag.org/news/2000/10/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry) [show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12820706) [that](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004390000426) both Jews and Palestinians Arabs share an important common ancestor of paternal descent that inhabited the region.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: Recognition of Palestine would prevent the right of return of Jews to their historic homeland.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Replacing the rulers of territory does not imply that others would have to leave that territory. They would just not be in power anymore.
1.3.3.2.3.2. Con: Displaced Palestinians are [not free to return](https://jewishcurrents.org/teshuvah-a-jewish-case-for-palestinian-refugee-return/)(Opponents of Palestinian return have rejoinders to these documents. They argue that General Assembly Resolutions aren’t legally binding. They claim that since Israel was only created in May 1948, and Palestinian refugees were never its citizens, they would not be returning to “their country.” But these are legalisms devoid of moral content. In the decades since World War II, the international bodies that oversee refugees have developed a clear ethical principle: People who want to return home should be allowed to do so. Although the pace of repatriation has slowed in recent years, since 1990 almost nine times as many refugees have returned to their home countries as have been resettled in new ones. And as a 2019 report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) explains, resettlement is preferred only when a refugee’s home country is so dangerous that it “cannot provide them with appropriate protection and support.”) to Israel.
1.3.3.2.3.3. Pro: It is likely that recognition of Palestine would prevent Jews from visiting their holy sites in Palestine. This has [historical precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount_entry_restrictions).
1.3.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: [Ongoing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34547523) [violence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13179865) against Jews, as well as [statements](http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/09/18/abbas-filthy-jews-feet-not-allowed-on-temple-mount/) by the Palestinian authorities indicate that Palestinians would severely restrict or prevent Jews from accessing their holy sites
1.3.3.2.3.3.2. Pro: For centuries, since the [Muslim conquest](https://archive.org/details/cityofstonehidde00benvrich/page/76) of Jerusalem \(638 A.D.\), Muslims [banned](https://archive.org/details/cityofstonehidde00benvrich/page/77) Jews from entering their holy places such as the Temple Mount.
1.3.3.2.3.3.3. Pro: The Cave of the Patriarchs is the [second holiest site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs) for Jewish people; Muslims [banned Jewish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs#Mamluk_period) from the Cave for [700 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs#Israeli_control).
1.3.3.2.3.3.4. Con: Israeli authorities often [block](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/jerusalem-sacred-sites-combustible-mix-religion-politics) Palestinians from accessing important cultural sites.
1.3.3.2.3.3.4.1. Pro: Following violence on Temple Mount in 2019, [some commented](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Police-prohibits-entrance-of-Jews-to-Temple-Mount-as-thousands-protest-598295)(“Israel bears full responsibility for storming al-Aqsa and fueling religious tensions in Jerusalem,” said PLO official Hanan Ashrawi. She attacked Israeli politicians, claiming that: “To score points in election season, Israeli politicians are competing as to who can exhibit higher levels of aggression and hostility against the Palestinian people during this important religious holiday.” She threatened that events could “plunge the region in sectarian war.”\nMK Ofer Cassif, a member of the Hadash-Ta’al list, accused Jewish visitors of “not seeking holiness, but rather incitement.\n“This incitement is not the result of a religious conflict, but a planned continuation of the rampage of occupation forces in east Jerusalem, which kidnap children, beat protesters, steal evidence and destroy homes,” he said.) that actions taken by Israeli officials could be constructed as incitement of violence.
1.3.3.3. Pro: In the past, Jews have been killed and expelled from the territory now known as Palestine. Recognizing Palestine could legitimize the atrocities carried out previously and jeopardise Israel.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: [Spoliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_Arab_world#Nineteenth_century) [and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebi_Musa_riots) [massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) of Jews in Israel-Palestine can be [traced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1834_looting_of_Safed) to the 19th century Ottoman Empire and culminated to the complete Jordanian ethnic cleansing of half of Palestine.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Due to the prevention of any Jewish return to the region, Jewish people experienced gross atrocities with little capacity to escape.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 1943, the leader of the Palestinian movement [stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini#The_Holocaust)("It is the duty of Muhammadans... to drive all Jews from Arab and Muhammadan countries. Germany is also struggling against the common foe who oppressed Arabs and Muhammadans in their different countries. It has very clearly recognized the Jews for what they are and resolved to find a definitive solution for the Jewish danger that will eliminate the scourge that Jews represent in the world.") his support for the eradication of Jews.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the traditional [Dhimmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_under_Muslim_rule#During_the_Caliphates) status of Jews and sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, they were not considered second class citizens.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Relative equality for Jews in Granada ended in 1066 when Muslims [massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre) the Jewish community.
1.3.3.3.1.1.3. Pro: In the Arab World, [ethnic cleansing](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-treatment-of-jews-in-arab-islamic-countries) often happened to the Jewish Diaspora as Muslims stifled any right of return to Israel.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: It is not clear how recognising self-determination for Palestinians would legitimise historical violence and anti-Semitism.
1.3.3.4. Con: Violence against Israel is often motivated by continued occupation, rather than a lack of it. A condition of [ceasefires](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28654229) is often the removal of Israeli troops.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: In 2006, Israel [withdrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza#Aftermath) from Gaza and part of West Bank, yet the government of Gaza began firing rockets the day after. Recognizing Palestine and withdrawing from the territory might spark similar violence.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: Previous post-withdrawal violence came from Palestinian frustration that Israel's withdrawal [didn't allow them control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza#Aftermath) over their borders, air space, or waters.
1.3.3.4.3. Con: An independent Palestine would likely [force the displacement](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Abbas-wants-not-a-single-Israeli-in-future-Palestinian-state-321470) of [760,000 Jews](https://www.timesofisrael.com/west-bank-settlements-report-rapid-growth-in-2019/) currently living in the territory in order to secure their land.
1.3.3.4.3.1. Pro: Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court considers the forced deportation of an entire population as a [crime against humanity](https://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm). Enabling Palestine to commit a crime against humanity is neither the right nor the moral thing to do.
1.3.3.4.3.2. Con: No one would be forcibly displaced unless the government were to specifically allow for that to happen.
1.3.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: All the Jewish people currently living on what would become Palestinian land would be able to chose whether to continue living in Palestine or not.
1.3.3.5. Con: The legitimacy of one state \(here: Palestine\) does not depend on whether its recognition might have collateral effects for its neighbors \(such as Israel\).
1.3.3.5.1. Pro: The widely accepted criteria for statehood are "a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to conduct international relations", as laid out in [the Montevideo Convention of 1933](https://www.britannica.com/topic/international-law/States-in-international-law#ref233506).
1.3.3.5.1.1. Con: The Montevideo Convention criteria define the minimum standards that have to be met for an entity to be considered a state, but they say little about the legitimacy of that status and are not necessarily sufficient to provide legitimacy.
1.4. Pro: The US has an obligation to recognise Palestine as a state.
1.4.1. Pro: Given that recognizing Palestine as a state will benefit the US, they have an obligation to act in the best interests of their citizens.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The negative perception of Israel's defiance of international law, occupation of Palestinian territories and military engagements with surrounding countries, reflects poorly on the US as the "[principal enabler](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/americas-misadventures-in-the-middle-east/)" of this behavior.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Surveys from countries like Britain show Israel's unpopularity. Among non-European countries, British people feel more unfavorable only towards North Korea; even Iran is perceived as more favorably than Israel \([pp. 10-11](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/field/field_document/20150129YouGovRaines.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: About as many Germans hold a negative opinion about Israel as a positive one. The [most common attributes](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/226525/umfrage/umfrage-zum-bild-der-deutschen-von-israel/) associated with Israel by the majority of Germans are ruthlessness and aggressiveness \([p. 31](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/Studie_LW_Germany_and_Israel_today_2015.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1.3. Con: National interests often override potential public relations damage, otherwise the US would not have supported [regimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_authoritarian_regimes_supported_by_the_United_States) that are far worse and more unpopular than Israel.
1.4.1.1.4. Pro: Recognizing Palestine, and thus taking a more moderate stance on the conflict, would serve to dissociate the US from Israel's actions.
1.4.1.1.5. Con: Given the long history of the US providing unwavering support for Israel, one largely symbolic move by a single administration wouldn't substantially affect the international perception of the country.
1.4.1.1.6. Con: Negative perceptions of Israel do not exist in a vacuum, so they should be taken with a grain of salt.
1.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Negative views of Israel don't stem solely from their defiance of international law, but also from widespread anti-Semitism. Due to the link between anti-Semitism and negative perceptions of Israel, the U.S should not be guided by the latter.
1.4.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Given their history of [allyship and common interests](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080080/israel-palestine-us-alliance), the US will continue to maintain close ties with Israel regardless of whether it recognizes Palestine. Therefore, recognizing Palestine as a state is unlikely to change any reputational damage that the US suffers from its association with Israel.
1.4.1.1.6.1.2. Con: US recognition of Palestine will be perceived not just as a dissociation from Israel's actions towards their neighbour, but also as a general repudiation of Israel as an actor. Even if negative perceptions of Israel are based on anti-Semitism, the US's image will improve.
1.4.1.1.6.2. Pro: [Some believe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/) that, as the international media tends to assign blame for the region's conflict primarily to Israel, it has become "an amplifier for the propaganda" of radical Palestinian forces.
1.4.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Reporting by Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera often casts Palestinians as victims and Israelis as aggressors. Palestinian perspectives and suffering are emphasized over the Israeli experience \([p. 16](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270634159_Al-Jazeera_and_Al-Arabiya_framing_of_the_Israel-Palestine_conflict_during_war_and_calm_periods)\).
1.4.1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Some evidence demonstrates that American television stations and newspapers are biased in their reporting on the Israel-Palestine conflict by casting Israel as the sole aggressor \([pp. 113-114](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/covering-intifada-how-media-reported-palestinian-uprising)\).
1.4.1.1.6.2.3. Con: Previous research that decries media coverage of Israel and Palestine was conducted by a group [connected with](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/09/robert-satloff-doth-protest-too-much/) American Israel Public Affairs Committee \(AIPAC\) - the country's largest pro-Israel lobbying group \([p. 12-13](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/media/3544)\). Its publications should be seen as agenda-driven.
1.4.1.1.6.3. Con: An [analysis](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/mind-your-language-how-anti-palestinian-bias-is-framed-in-us-media-47049) of 33,000 New York Times articles featuring Israel found that the newspaper often cast Israel in a favorable light.
1.4.1.1.6.4. Con: Palestinian voices are [actively silenced](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/5/13/social-media-companies-are-trying-to-silence-palestinian-voices) across a variety of social media sites and communication platforms.
1.4.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: Zoom [cancelled](https://www.thefire.org/zoom-cancels-another-academic-event-with-leila-khaled-again-raising-questions-about-companys-role-in-the-classroom/) an academic webinar to be held by a Palestinian activist.
1.4.1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: The Palestinian activist in question is a known [terrorist](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9k99k7/leila-khaled-first-female-hijacker-profile) and could have been planning to propagate certain ideas or behaviors that run contrary to Zoom's terms and conditions.
1.4.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: Research has shown that YouTube, Google, and Facebook have all [systematically blocked](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/paper-alleges-systematic-efforts-to-silence-palestinian-content-on-social-media/) Palestinian content on their sites.
1.4.1.1.7. Pro: Recognition of Palestine would undermine the belief that the US only respects international rules and UN institutions when it can take advantage of them.
1.4.1.1.7.1. Con: In light of other actions taken by the US, recognising Palestine will not convince anyone that the US respects international law when it does not benefit itself.
1.4.1.1.7.1.1. Con: That the US has not recognized the legitimacy of other national or international courts does not mean that it should not. Indeed, the treaties and conventions that have established International Law are in principle [binding](https://www.hg.org/international-law.html) on the US.
1.4.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: The US has [prevented](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47912140) an investigation of alleged war crimes by the US Army in Afghanistan.
1.4.1.1.7.1.3. Pro: Former US President Donald Trump [declared](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-says-israelis-should-be-immune-from-international-criminal-court/) that Israel and other allies should be immune to the ICC, and [threatened](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45474864) the ICC with sanctions should they go ahead with investigations.
1.4.1.2. Con: Israel's withdrawal from occupied areas following US recognition of Palestine will create a political and military vacuum that could open the doors for militant groups to take control of the state.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The Palestinian economy has seen a trajectory of "[strong growth](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/137111468329419171/West-Bank-and-Gaza-Area-C-and-the-future-of-the-Palestinian-economy)" in the past despite massive challenges. This demonstrates an economic dynamism that would make it unlikely to collapse into a failed state.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Economic growth alone is by no means a predictor of whether a state can descend into domestic turmoil. All major states of the Arab Spring - [Tunisia](https://tradingeconomics.com/tunisia/gdp-growth-annual), [Egypt](https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/gdp-growth-annual), [Libya](https://tradingeconomics.com/libya/gdp-growth-annual), [Yemen](https://tradingeconomics.com/yemen/gdp-growth-annual), [Syria](https://tradingeconomics.com/syria/gdp-growth-annual) and [Bahrain](https://tradingeconomics.com/bahrain/gdp-growth-annual) - experienced steady and moderate economic growth of around 4% prior to the events of 2011.
1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: GDP growth in Palestine is expected to [return to 3.5%](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/westbankandgaza/publication/economic-update-april-2021) in 2021.
1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Growth tends to be cyclical and dynamic; a [2017 report](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/02/13/pr1746-IMF-Staff-Concludes-Visit-to-West-Bank-and-Gaza) from the IMF spoke of "increasingly difficult conditions" for the Palestinian economy and mentioned that the "outlook for the economy is daunting." This is hardly an optimistic evaluation of Palestine's prospects.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Naftali Bennett, the current PM of Israel, has argued that this a resurgence in violence is exactly what would happen should Israel withdraw. He cited [historical precedent](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/naftali-bennett-for-israel-two-state-is-no-solution.html), as proof.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.
1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: The violence cited by Bennett could have been caused by the respective Israeli occupations causing a surge in support for radical parties, not subsequent withdrawal.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: The current conditions of the Palestinian territories are what provides radical groups a foothold. By providing Palestinians with the right to live in their own state, they will have little need to turn to radical Islamists.
1.4.1.2.4. Pro: Hamas and Fatah, the two dominant groups in control of Gaza and the West Bank respectively, will never be able to work with each other. This could increase conflict in the region.
1.4.1.2.4.1. Pro: Hamas is often considered an [extremist](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm) group, and would would never accept a power-sharing agreement.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1. Con: Many radical groups have accepted power-sharing agreements and joined the political systems of recognized governments.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: The post-Apartheid government of South Africa is led by the ANC \(African National Congress\), an organization the [US had formerly labeled](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/us-government-considered-nelson-mandela-terrorist-until-2008-f2D11708787) as a terrorist group.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Kosovo Liberation Army \(KLA\) was [described as a terrorist group by US officials](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/terrorist-groups-and-political-legitimacy) before eventually forming part of the government and armed forces of the \(partially recognized\) country.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.3. Con: 71% of attempted power-sharing agreements in Asia between 1989 and 2006 [failed due to a resumption of fighting](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/05/study-half-of-government-rebel-power-sharing-agreements-fail/).
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.4. Pro: Maoist rebels in Nepal [now successfully share power](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/117620/Nepal%20Policy%20Brief.pdf) in the country's government, through an agreement that ended a long-running civil war.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Though the party formed by the former Maoist rebels is now the most popular one in the country, some remnants of their foundation as rebels has permeated modern society, with leadership [unwilling to make changes](https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-33259820080427)(But the Maoists still command a rebel army, have refused to renounce violence and speak of a “people revolt” if they are stopped from taking power, posturing that has unnerved opposition parties about their commitment to democratic ideals.). This has caused strife among opposition parties and it will be difficult to form a coalition and strike a balance.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.5. Con: These groups were largely not opposed to US foreign policy when they were legitimized by the US. Hamas, on the other hand, [has threatened attacks](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15617830/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/hamas-calls-muslims-attack-us-targets/#.WSdBL2iGNeU) against the US.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.5.1. Con: Hamas has not yet targeted US citizens, proving that their threats are little more than rhetoric \([p. 194](https://books.google.de/books?id=IOoBZvdNrIkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=%22Thus%20far%2C%20Hamas%22&f=false)\).
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.6. Pro: Northern Ireland managed to form a government in 2007 between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein - [both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party)(On 10 November 1986, a rally was held in which DUP politicians Paisley, Robinson and Ivan Foster announced the formation of the Ulster Resistance Movement \(URM\). This was a loyalist paramilitary group whose purpose was to "take direct action as and when required" to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism. Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, the Ulster Volunteer Force \(UVF\) and the Ulster Defence Association \(UDA\). Most, but not all, of the weaponry was seized by police in 1988. In 1989, URM members attempted to trade Shorts' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime. Following these revelations, the DUP said that it had cut its links with the URM in 1987.) of which have historic [paramilitary](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/16/sinn-fein-election-success-tainted-past) links. This suggests that former terrorist organizations can be integrated into government more easily after peace has been established.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.6.1. Con: Sinn Féin and the DUP were deadlocked in negotiations over the formation of a power sharing government for [approximately three years](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/11/northern-ireland-assembly-reopens-three-years-after-collapse). This suggests that the ability of factions to find common ground does not necessarily last.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.7. Pro: A similar solution was implemented in Lebanon, where the conflicting parties entered an [inter-religious power sharing agreement](https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/08/27/things-to-know-about-lebanons-government/). This has allowed the various religious and ethnic groups within Lebanon to live peacefully together.
1.4.1.2.4.1.1.7.1. Con: Because of its sectarian divisions, Lebanon is a country that is notorious for its [political instability](https://www.europeanforum.net/headlines/lebanon-economic-crisis-rooted-in-political-divisions). If anything, it is an example of the problems that states with long-standing ethnic and religious divisions suffer.
1.4.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Keeping hostilities going and even going to war periodically with Israel ensures the survival of Hamas. In order to go to war, Hamas needs to be in control of territory within Palestine, for which purpose it will [hold on to Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13331522)(Under its charter, it is committed to the destruction of Israel. \[...\] Hamas originally had a dual purpose of carrying out an armed struggle against Israel - led by its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - and delivering social welfare programmes. \[...\] But since 2005, when Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, Hamas has also engaged in the Palestinian political process. \[...\] Since then, militants in Gaza have fought four major conflicts with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and to pressure it to stop attacks.).
1.4.1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Hamas [fears](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4707/what-does-hamas-want) that Palestinians will eventually tire of a military approach to the conflict. A war with Israel leads to countless deaths of innocent Palestinians; this fuels Palestinian hatred for Israel and paints Hamas as soldiers fighting for the Palestinians.
1.4.1.2.4.1.2.2. Con: If Palestinians were to have a stable state of their own, going to war would become far less attractive. This suggests that Hamas would very likely either have to moderate itself, or cease to have popular support.
1.4.1.2.4.1.3. Con: The designation of "[terrorist organization](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm)" is an arbitrary distinction that does not necessarily reflect the manner of violence, the scale of violence, or the threat to the United States. The designation is based only on political concerns.
1.4.1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: Hamas is a terrorist organisation in part because it is not a government. No democratically elected government is seen as a terrorist organisation and Hamas would be no different.
1.4.1.2.4.1.3.2. Con: Hamas, or at the very least their military wing, is responsible for [suicide bombings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/06/israelandthepalestinians.international) as well as [rocket and mortar attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32053999) [and kidnappings](https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/15/world/meast/west-bank-jewish-teens-missing) against the state of Israel. This is more than political.
1.4.1.2.4.1.3.3. Pro: The US government has [yet to declare](https://historianandrew.medium.com/why-isnt-the-kkk-designated-a-terrorist-organization-73732ad40bc7) the KKK a terrorist organization. Their rules for acknowledging terrorist groups seem to be arbitrary at best, and knowingly deceitful at worst.
1.4.1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Hamas decided to [contest](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4844196,00.html) the upcoming municipal elections in the West Bank, indicating a clear interest in ruling the area long term.
1.4.1.2.4.1.4.1. Pro: In 2015, 39% of Palestinians in Gaza said they would [vote for Hamas](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20150610-poll-hamas-popularity-up-in-gaza-west-bank/), more than any other political group. This would make it a strong political actor in the region.
1.4.1.2.4.1.4.2. Pro: In 2021, 53% of Palestinians [supported](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/15/gaza-protests-against-israeli-right-wing-march-through-jerusalem)(The poll found that 53 percent of Palestinians believe Hamas is “most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people”, while only 14 percent prefer Abbas’s Fatah party.) the group.
1.4.1.2.4.1.5. Pro: Hamas was [founded](https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/880818a.htm) with the explicit purpose of destroying the state of Israel - ruling Gaza gives Hamas the foothold in Palestine it needs to be able to launch attacks against Israel.
1.4.1.2.4.2. Pro: Hamas and Fatah have [fundamentally different approaches](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/a-brief-history-of-the-fraught-relationship-between-fatah-and-hamas/361178/) to the state of Israel. Hamas believes the state does not have the right to exist, and Fatah believes it does, choosing to attempt political solutions instead.
1.4.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Past behavior and prioritisation may be indicative of what Hamas and Fatah are likely to do; however, future co-operation cannot be ruled out entirely.
1.4.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Hamas and Fatah's multiple past attempts to work together have resulted in failure. Even when deals are brokered by Egypt, the groups [struggle](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/19/palestinian-political-crisis-deepens-with-collapse-of-unity-government.html) to put their differences aside.
1.4.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: While President Mahmoud Abbas has declared security cooperation with Israel as [sacred](http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-vows-to-uphold-sacred-security-coordination-with-israel/), Hamas has [vowed](http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-vows-to-stop-west-bank-security-cooperation-with-israel/) to end that cooperation.
1.4.1.2.4.3. Con: Both Hamas and Fatah realise that they need to work together, and have agreed to form a new [National Council](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/fatah-and-hamas-agree-to-form-unity-palestinian-government-to-end-election-gridlock-moscow-russia-a7533696.html) in order to hold elections.
1.4.1.2.4.4. Con: Hamas is taking measures to become a [more moderate and open political group](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-1967-borders-170501114309725.html) - this indicates that Hamas could work together with Fatah and the Palestinian Authority.
1.4.1.2.4.4.1. Con: In the past, Hamas has [violently clashed with Fatah](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011549435141647.html) to establish control over key areas. Clearly, the group has little intention to share power.
1.4.1.2.4.4.2. Con: In 2007, [Hamas expelled Fatah from Gaza](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/10/12/hamas-and-fatah-how-are-the-two-groups-different)(Hamas has been the de facto ruler in the Gaza Strip since 2007, after defeating President Mahmoud Abbas’ long dominant Fatah party in parliamentary elections.\n\nHamas then pushed Fatah out of Gaza when the latter refused to recognise the result of the vote.\n\nHamas and Fatah have ruled the occupied Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank respectively ever since.) after refusing to accept the election results. Since then, the two governments have been operating separately in Gaza and the West Bank, respectively.
1.4.1.2.5. Pro: Although ISIS is a relatively new presence in Palestine, [7% of Palestinians](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/636) and 13% in the Gaza Strip perceive ISIS as representing true Islam. This could enable ISIS to gain a foothold in Palestine.
1.4.1.2.6. Con: The risk of conflict resulting from Israel's withdrawal from Palestine is anticipated; therefore, preemptive steps to mitigate adversity can be planned and taken prior to withdrawal.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Given that unwavering support for Israel is primarily the [result of strong, organized lobbying](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=2iUdyQs_NhYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Israel+Lobby+and+American+Foreign+Policy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP6LCW2c_TAhUMbrwKHfvZBH0Q6AEIJTAA)(p. 335f) on US politicians, such a decision would show the ability of US decision makers to remain independent.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: In terms of funding provided to members of Congress, the Pro-Israel lobby ranks [among the top 30](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.php), far above any other country-specific lobby group in the US.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Funding provided by the Pro-Israel lobby was steadily increasing from 2002-2018; but, in 2020 it exploded, more than [doubling contributions from 2018](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2020&ind=Q05).
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: The Pro-Israel lobby ranks among [the top five most influential lobby groups](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/18/AR2005051802143.html) in American politics, alongside national organizations such as the NRA and the American Association of Retired Persons \(AARP\).
1.4.1.3.3. Con: The pro-Palestinian lobby is poorly organized, making the pro-Israel lobby seem stronger than it is in reality.
1.4.1.3.3.1. Pro: [Cursory Google searches](https://www.google.com/search?q=pro+palestinian+lobby+in+US&client=firefox-b-d&ei=qskHYYTNBIzgkgXVwoeQAg&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwiEyp2nkZLyAhUMsKQKHVXhASI4ChDy0wN6BAgBEDY&biw=1368&bih=663) about the pro-Palestinian lobby provide very little information and are dominated by the pro-Israel lobby; [websites are down](http://www.aaper.org/)(The American Association for Palestinian Equal Rights website), and [Wikipedia articles are unfinished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_Palestinian_Equal_Rights).
1.4.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Google's own employees have [formally requested](https://mashable.com/article/google-employee-letter-palestine) the search engine to be more forthcoming in recognizing the Palestinian struggle.
1.4.1.3.3.2. Con: The two are not mutually exclusive; the pro-Israel lobby can be considered strong regardless of the relative power, or lack thereof, of the pro-Palestine lobby.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Recognition of Palestine could improve the image of the US in the Arab world.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The Palestinian conflict colors public perception of the US in the Arab world.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: US recognition would be unlikely to actually alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people, so anger at the US for perpetuating the conflict up to the present day would persist.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: The citizens of major US allies including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, see the occupation of Palestinian territories as a [highly problematic issue.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/05/16/a-separate-peace-what-the-gaza-crisis-means-for-arab-regimes/)(“Once official statements signaled that the Saudi government was weighing in firmly on the side of Palestinians, I started to see considerably more pro-Palestinian statements on Saudi Twitter,” he told me.\n\nPalestine arouses passions. It always has, and it always will. It is one of the last remaining issues that can rally broad and genuine support across Arab borders. This is why messaging must be carefully managed by regimes. Transnational solidarity — whether in the form of pan-Arabism or Islamism — is a threat. It can’t easily be controlled. And so the goal is to limit and constrain it. For various regimes, then, the reemergence of fellow feeling toward the Palestinians is a problem. The timing isn’t great either. Just last year, Emirati and Saudi columnists like Abdelrahman Al-Rashed were\ncalling the Abraham Accords “a great step that serves the Palestinian people first, and the UAE and the Arabs second,” although he\nhad trouble sustaining this position for long.)
1.4.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Given that the majority of the Arab world, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, [aren't democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index), the beliefs of private citizens are largely irrelevant compared to government priorities in regional security and economic interests.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Even dictatorships are receptive to popular will to some extent. Complete disregard for popular opinion always leads to instability.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: Israel [opened](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-ramani/why-israel-is-strengthening_b_11946660.html) its first diplomatic mission in the United Arab Emirates \(UAE\) three months after it stopped bombing Gaza in 2015. The Gulf states have signed covert deals with the Israeli defence contractors to gain access to the IDF’s prized military technology. This is used to secure oil wells. Economic interests trump the demand for a Palestinian state.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.3. Con: While it might be that popular perception is not as important for state actors to the extent that they are non-democratic, it still influences many other aspects of national relations, since a nation is far more than simply its state.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.4. Con: The fact that these countries have backdoor relations with Israel indicates that these relations are important for their regional security and economic interests. Being able to establish a more open relationship is in their interests; these countries will therefore care about whether public opinion permits an open relationship.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Pressuring Israel for a peace deal will likely alienate it as Israel does not want to recognise an independent Palestine. This risks destroying whatever gains have been made through backdoor and covert diplomacy.
1.4.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Recognizing Palestine could garner support for the US in these countries.
1.4.1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Egyptians in particular believe that "normalization with Palestine’s enemy is a [betrayal of the Palestinian cause](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2019/01/egypt-israel-peace-cultural-normalization.html)(“The Egyptian intelligentsia deter any attempts of public normalization with Israel. Egyptian citizens believe normalization with Palestine’s enemy is a betrayal of the Palestinian cause, which is central in Egyptians’ interests.”), which is central in Egyptians’ interests.”
1.4.1.4.1.2.4. Con: A study found that people in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq ascribe [little importance](https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8a1be-2018SBYFINALWEB.pdf)(Table 2, p. 7) to the Palestinian issue.
1.4.1.4.1.3. Pro: In the Arab world, the Palestinian issue is [predominantly responsible for the prevailing attitudes](http://www.pewresearch.org/2005/11/10/arab-and-muslim-perceptions-of-the-united-states/) towards America.
1.4.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: All Arab countries [recognise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine) Palestine as a state.
1.4.1.4.1.4. Con: The [roots of anti-Americanism](https://www.pewresearch.org/2005/11/10/arab-and-muslim-perceptions-of-the-united-states/) in the Arab world are far deeper than just the recognition of Palestine.
1.4.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Anti-Americanism is [unlikely to immediately disappear](https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Rubin-article.htm) from the Arab world, following formal recognition of Palestine.
1.4.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: US policies are [largely responsible](https://www.pewresearch.org/2005/11/10/arab-and-muslim-perceptions-of-the-united-states/)(Anti-Americanism in the region is driven largely by aversion to U.S. policies, such as the war in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and U.S. support for Israel, in addition to the general perception that the U.S. fails to consider the interests of countries in the region when it acts in the international arena.) for anti-Americanism.
1.4.1.4.1.4.3. Con: Though recognition of Palestine is a key issue and would improve the standing of the United States in the eyes of the Arab world.
1.4.1.4.1.5. Con: The recognition of Palestine is not as crucial of a factor as some believe with regards to the public perception of the United States.
1.4.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Perception of the United States has [improved slightly](https://www.pewresearch.org/2005/11/10/arab-and-muslim-perceptions-of-the-united-states/)(America’s favorability rating has increased significantly in Lebanon, Jordan, and Morocco. Indeed, more Moroccans now hold a positive view of the U.S. \(49%\) than a negative one \(44%\).) in the Arab world; yet the official US government stance on Palestine has remained the same.
1.4.1.4.1.6. Pro: Given the US's history of [intense opposition](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/28/politics/ben-rhodes-veto-un-resolution-palestinian-state-obama/) to recognising Palestinian statehood, a decision this unprecedented and of this magnitude would have a massive impact on Arab perceptions of the US.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: As recognition of Palestine would be perceived as a step in opposition to Israel's stated interests, this is likely to be perceived positively throughout the Middle East.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Few people in major Middle Eastern countries have positive opinions on Israel; they do not see the country as a contributor to peace and stability in the region, or view relations with Israel as important \([pp. 5, 7, 8](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: A favourable image of the US allows for a better relationship between the US and Arab countries to form, which could lead to better trade agreements and intelligence sharing.
1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: If there are pragmatic benefits to be gained through cooperation, Middle Eastern states will cooperate with the US regardless of "perception" of the US' morality as an actor.
1.4.1.4.3.2. Pro: The US conducts operations in several countries in the Middle East, which they could do more easily if Arab countries had a more positive image of the US. Willingness to help and cooperate would likely be higher if the attitude towards the US were more positive.
1.4.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: In their operations in Iraq, the US military [relied heavily](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-31/iraqi-translators-who-served-us-military-are-desperate-exemption-trumps-travel) on assistance from local translators. The willingness of translators to cooperate, and of the local population to tolerate people who cooperate with the US military, was dependent on public perception of the US.
1.4.1.4.4. Con: Any improvement of America's reputation in the region will be limited as the Israel-Palestine question is only one of many issues that determine how America is seen.
1.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: Negative [stereotypes](http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/07/21/chapter-2-how-muslims-and-westerners-view-each-other/) about Westerners as 'selfish', 'violent' or 'greedy' help to perpetuate Anti-Americanism.
1.4.1.4.4.2. Pro: The US supports corrupt autocracies in the region and thus [fuels](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-koppman/endless-us-support-for-di_b_6821136.html) anti-Americanism.
1.4.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: In non-democratic countries supported by and allied with the US, such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, the lack of representative government is seen as the primary obstacle to peace and stability in the region \([p. 11](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.4.1.4.4.3. Pro: The US has a track record of military interventions in the Middle East which have negatively shaped perceptions.
1.4.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: The presence of US soldiers alienates the local population.
1.4.1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: The [habits](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/saudi-arabia-withdrawl-us-forces) of US soldiers radicalize some locals as they drink alcohol and behave outside social norms, as was observed in Saudi Arabia.
1.4.1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: US military bases and soldiers are a magnet for [terrorist attacks](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/saudi-arabia-withdrawl-us-forces), risking the lives of those nearby. In the 1990s, the base in Saudi Arabia was moved because of this.
1.4.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: A military presence is interpreted by some as an all out [war against Islam](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/11/us-military-operations-are-biggest-motivation-for-homegrown-terrorists-fbi-study-finds/). For individuals that link their identity to Islam, this can be seen as an attack on themselves.
1.4.1.4.4.3.3. Pro: The violence and death caused as a result of these military interventions leads to resentment towards the US.
1.4.1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: [News coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike) of massacres or collateral murder, such as the Baghdad airstrikes in 2007, antagonizes bystanders and supports radical thinking against the US.
1.4.1.4.4.3.3.2. Con: American interference in the region is generally not seen by public opinion as one of the most severe obstacles to peace and stability in the region - not even in countries directly affected by it like Iraq \([p. 11](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/12021/attachments/original/1481751962/SBY2016_FINAL.pdf?1481751962)\).
1.4.1.4.4.3.4. Con: By now, the United States has withdrawn from the countries where it intervened with ground troops in the recent past: [Iraq](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/9/iraq-official-says-us-combat-mission-in-the-country-has-ended) and [Afghanistan](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/30/politics/us-military-withdraws-afghanistan/index.html). It, therefore, stands to reason that this factor will become less relevant in the near future.
1.4.1.4.4.4. Con: Surveys show that American culture and political values are generally seen as positive, whereas American policies in the Middle East evoke opposition - with the policies towards Palestine being among the prime sources \([p. 15](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/4737/chiozza_f04.pdf)\).
1.4.1.4.5. Pro: Recognizing Palestine would improve America's standing among the people of Palestine.
1.4.1.4.5.1. Con: The Palestinians know their side of the conflict is legitimate. Unless the US de-recognises Israel at the same time as recognising Palestine, it won't gain any particular credit from the Palestinians for recognising what is perceived by Palestinians as reality.
1.4.1.4.5.2. Con: Palestine has barely 4.5 million citizens and [an economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) the size of Burkina Faso's. It is hardly relevant for the United States as a partner or market.
1.4.1.4.5.3. Con: America should not recognise Palestine, as even if their standing improves, it is less important than other outcomes.
1.4.1.4.5.4. Pro: Internal and external accords, laws, and policies require the US to [intervene and improve](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-palestinian-territories/)(Since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the United States has been the largest provider of assistance to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, providing more than $7.6 billion in economic development and security funding—in addition to humanitarian assistance. U.S. foreign assistance for the Palestinian people serves important U.S. interests, including providing critical relief to those in great need, fostering economic development, and supporting Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation. Economic and humanitarian assistance programs improve the lives of millions of Palestinians by providing immediate relief and advancing development across sectors such as health, infrastructure, economic growth, private sector development, and civil society. In administering assistance for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the United States complies with applicable requirements under U.S. law, including the Taylor Force Act.) the lives of Palestinians. Negative perceptions of the US among Palestinians can make this delivery of assistance and support more challenging.
1.4.1.4.5.5. Pro: Palestine has many natural resources, which are currently being [exploited by Israelis](https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24349&LangID=E). Improving perceptions of the US among Palestinians could facilitate the establishment of businesses that benefit the local people \(e.g., job creation\) as well as the US economy.
1.4.1.4.6. Con: Any benefit to US-Arab relations would be negligible at best and at worst it would be seen as a betrayal of one of their key regional allies, Israel.
1.4.1.4.6.1. Pro: US allies in the Middle East are more concerned about their own socio-economic conditions and security than about Israel.
1.4.1.4.6.2. Pro: Israel's enemies around the world \(including Hamas and the PA\) will not be pacified by recognition, or even the creation of a Palestinian state - only by the destruction of the Jewish one.
1.4.1.4.6.2.1. Pro: Hamas and other vocal enemies of Israel could hardly sell more amicable relations to their domestic audiences and supporters after decades of hateful rhetoric towards Israel and threats of destruction.
1.4.1.4.6.3. Con: America shouldn't be concerned about the reaction in Israel.
1.4.1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Israel does not behave as an ally to the United States.
1.4.1.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: Israel has a history of spying on the US, the most notable example being espionage by the ex-intelligence analyst [Jonathan Pollard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Pollard).
1.4.1.4.6.3.1.2. Pro: The Israeli Prime Minister [went to the US congress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-spat-in-our-face-white-house-officials-say/) to undermine the President of the United States.
1.4.1.4.6.3.1.3. Pro: Israel's [diplomatic efforts against the most important multilateral deal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel/israels-netanyahu-draws-rebuke-from-obama-over-iran-speech-to-congress-idUSKBN0LZ0BS20150303) led by Obama were not consistent with an alliance.
1.4.1.4.6.3.2. Pro: While one might expect one of America's closest allies to play a supportive role in times of conflict, Israel has been a strategic burden in the past.
1.4.1.4.6.3.2.1. Con: This singular instance from a quarter of a century ago is hardly representative of the United States' relationship with Israel as a whole.
1.4.1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro: During the Gulf War in 1990-1991, the US government had to [intentionally prevent](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ssfc0005/Israel%20and%20the%20Conflict.html) Israel from joining the coalition against Iraq because its participation might have led to more Arab support for Iraq or possibly even have caused some Arab countries to leave the coalition altogether.
1.4.1.4.7. Con: Some nations in the Arab League have diplomatic ties with both the US and Israel.
1.4.1.4.7.1. Pro: Egypt's relations with Israel are the [best they have been in history](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-israel-relations-highest-level-history-161107083926863.html).
1.4.1.4.7.1.1. Pro: Israel and Egypt cooperate on regional security concerns such as Hamas and terrorist groups in the Sinai peninsula.
1.4.1.4.7.1.1.1. Con: While that may have been true in the past, more recently Egypt has actually sought to [improve relations with Hamas](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-egypt-sinai-idUSKBN16010C) in order to secure the Sinai peninsula.
1.4.1.4.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hamas officials are [regularly invited to Egypt](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-egypt-sinai-idUSKBN16010C) and the two keep communication channels open.
1.4.1.4.7.1.1.2. Pro: Since al-Sisi came to power in 2013, security cooperation between Egypt and Israel has [reached unprecedented levels](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/lessons-from-israel-and-egypts-lukewarm-peace/).
1.4.1.4.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: Increased [ISIS attacks in the Sinai peninsula](https://www.haaretz.com/at-least-50-egyptian-soldiers-killed-in-sinai-terror-attacks-1.5374819) have forced Israel and Egypt to cooperate more closely.
1.4.1.4.7.1.2. Pro: Egypt's calls for peace between Israel and Palestine is widely considered one of the most likely solutions to resolve the conflict.
1.4.1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: [Egypt was largely responsible for brokering peace](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210520-israel-confirms-unconditional-gaza-ceasefire-agreed-with-hamas) in the ["Sword of Jerusalem" vs. "Guardian of the Walls"](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/sword-jerusalem-vs-guardian-walls-gaza-and-next-lebanon-war) conflict in 2021.
1.4.1.4.7.1.2.2. Pro: Egypt is putting pressure on both sides to [broker a long-term peace deal](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/105932/Egypt-calls-for-urgent-move-to-resume-Palestine-Israel-peace).
1.4.1.4.7.1.3. Pro: Egypt is Israel's [closest regional partner](http://www.mesi.shisu.edu.cn/_upload/article/71/cf/e7e731dc4b948dad8285d988bbd7/09601a46-3756-4fc6-8638-a8b0efa1d51c.pdf)(Since recognizing Israel as a state, Egypt has had the closest relationship with Israel in the region. Under the presidency of Mubarak, the relationship between the two countries evolved and broadened. Egypt as one of the important Arab countries of the Middle East and Islamic world plays a crucial role in international scene and relationship among nations) \(p. 93\).
1.4.1.4.7.1.3.1. Pro: Egyptian officials held a number of [meetings with Israeli businessmen](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/lessons-from-israel-and-egypts-lukewarm-peace/) in 2021, showing their relationship is growing even stronger.
1.4.1.4.7.1.4. Pro: Historically, Egypt permitted flights to Tel Aviv under a one-plane airline called Air Sinai, which did not bear the Egyptian flag. In March 2021, they announced that EgyptAir would absorb Air Sinai and that Tel Aviv-Cairo [flights would be tripled](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/lessons-from-israel-and-egypts-lukewarm-peace/)(There are other examples of improving Israeli-Egyptian relations. For years, the route between Tel Aviv and Cairo was flown by Air Sinai—a one-plane airline that did not even bear the Egyptian flag—and not EgyptAir. However, in March 2021, it was announced that EgyptAir would fly the route under its name and triple the number of daily flights.).
1.4.1.4.7.1.5. Con: Despite the close government relationship with Israel, the Egyptian people are wholly [against normalizing ties with Israel](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2019/01/egypt-israel-peace-cultural-normalization.html).
1.4.1.4.7.2. Pro: There exists a '[moderate axis](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140723-israeli-general-the-moderate-axis-is-helping-us-fight-hamas/)' of [Middle Eastern nations](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/egypt-israel-relations-highest-level-history-161107083926863.html), including Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and several of the Gulf states, as well as Jordan, that have offered Israel a wide margin of flexibility to pursue the war on Hamas. Public calls for peace are accompanied by backdoor diplomacy.
1.4.1.4.7.2.1. Pro: These nations [perceive](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/world/middleeast/fighting-political-islam-arab-states-find-themselves-allied-with-israel.html?_r=0) Hamas to be an Islamist threat that could destabilise their own countries. Iran's support and funding of Hamas has effectively made these nations prioritise the destruction of the group over the recognition of a Palestinian state.
1.4.1.4.7.2.2. Pro: The Gulf states [fear](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-ramani/why-israel-is-strengthening_b_11946660.html) Hamas' link with the Muslim Brotherhood, which they believe is backed by Iran.
1.4.1.4.7.3. Pro: In 2020, [four Arab League nations](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/arab-ties-israel-diplomacy-normalization-middle-east/), the United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Bahrain, and Morocco, signed agreements to normalize ties with Israel.
1.4.1.4.7.3.1. Con: The 2020 agreements between Arab nations and Israel were less about the latter, or peace in the region, and more regarding the [benefits](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/arab-ties-israel-diplomacy-normalization-middle-east/)(The decision by four Arab countries to forge ties with Israel in 2020 was not about peace, love, or understanding. The United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Morocco, and \(to a lesser extent\) Bahrain were all motivated by narrow interests—including the promise of either advanced weapons or diplomatic favors from the United States.), and political and militaristic favors offered by the United States.
1.4.1.5. Con: If the United States were to distance itself from Israel, this could be interpreted as abandoning a close ally. In turn, it could have severe repercussions for other close allies causing the interlinked system of alliances to suffer.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Although the US and Israel share several close allies, it is possible for the US to denounce Israel for its actions while also reaffirming its relationships with other common allies.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: When the United States recognized China in the 1970s, this was perceived as a de-facto abandonment of Taiwan. Even though the US reaffirmed its commitment to other allies, several of them were shocked and opted for less reliance on America in their security affairs \([p. 710](http://www.theoverholtgroup.com/media/Articles-China/PresidentNixons-Trip-to-China-and-Its-Consequences-Asian-Survey-jstor.pdf)\).
1.4.1.5.1.2. Con: The US has consistently [reaffirmed](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/212617-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-israel) its [support](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-speech-to-aipac-donald-trump-affirms-support-for-israel-1458605471) for Israel. A move like this would indicate that public US affirmations of support are worth little, and do not necessarily indicate underlying US policy.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: [Trump's actions to undermine NATO](http://www.npr.org/2016/07/23/487151465/casting-doubt-on-u-s-commitment-to-mutual-defense-donald-trump-unsettles-nato-al) cast doubt on US loyalty and commitment to longstanding alliances. Betraying Israel by recognising Palestine would reinforce and deepen this distrust.
1.4.1.5.3. Pro: President Obama [doubled down](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91150432) on an "unshakeable commitment to Israel's security." Recognizing Palestine could be interpreted as a weakening of this commitment to American allies.
1.4.1.5.3.1. Con: The US can recognise Palestine without compromising its commitment to Israel's security - defence pledges and aid deals will still remain.
1.4.2. Pro: Public opinion in the US supports this step: [more Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) support an independent Palestinian state than oppose it.
1.4.2.1. Con: [Two thirds of Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) sympathize more with Israel than with Palestine; only 15% think the other way around. This makes the recognition of Palestine against Israel's explicit preference hard to sell.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The public attitude towards Israel gives American politicians little incentive to support positions that run counter to Israeli interests. In fact, support for Israel has been labeled as "cheap talk," giving politicians large benefits with minimal risk \([p. 20](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.2979/israelstudies.19.3.1.pdf)\).
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: The [vast majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/23/5-facts-about-how-americans-view-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) of Republican voters sympathize more with Israel than with Palestine and do not consider a peaceful two-state solution viable. Politicians in Republican-dominated US politics have little to gain from defying this.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: Surveys indicate that the American public would be in support of less amicable and supportive relations with Israel.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: Six out of ten Americans believe that the United States gives too much or even far too much foreign aid to Israel \([p. 6](https://www.irmep.org/09302014_USFATI.pdf)\).
1.4.2.1.3.2. Con: However, less amicable and supportive relations are not the same thing as unilaterally recognising Palestine at the expense of American-Israeli relations.
1.4.2.1.3.3. Pro: Almost half of all Americans support the unprecedented step of imposing sanctions on Israel in reaction to new settlements in Palestine \([p. 21](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmep_20161202_public_opinion_poll.pdf)\).
1.4.2.1.4. Con: Sympathising with Israel is not mutually exclusive to establishing a Palestinian state. The American public can blame Hamas for its aggressive actions but still believe that the Palestinian people deserve a state.
1.4.2.1.5. Pro: In the same vein, only a very small minority [of 6%](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) would like to see the Trump government lean towards the Palestinian side in this conflict.
1.4.2.1.5.1. Con: This is only because the majority of voters want the Trump administration to lean towards [neither side](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/), so this does not indicate a general attitude of support for Israel.
1.4.2.1.6. Pro: Almost half of all Americans - and a majority of Republican voters - believe that the Jewish people are God's chosen people. This makes policies perceived as going against Israeli interests hard to sell \([p. 9](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015-Poll-Key-Findings-Final-1.pdf)\).
1.4.2.2. Con: While this is currently the case, [public support](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) for Israel has been increasing, while support for a Palestinian state is decreasing; given that the current margin in favor of a Palestinian state is small, it is likely to disappear in the future.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Policies are not based upon expected future voter preferences, but current voter preferences. Given that, the US should recognise Palestine as a state since a majority of the population supports it.
1.4.2.3. Pro: The US is one of the world's most influential actors. If it were to officially recognize Palestine, it could serve as a powerful source of inspiration for other allies and nations to push harder for an independent Palestinian state.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: By being the first major Western country to [recognize](http://www.theperspective.se/?p=882) Palestine, Sweden led the way for a number of others, including France, the United Kingdom, and Spain to do the same. US recognition could have an even more significant impact, given its international reputation.
1.4.2.3.2. Con: The United States is too late to serve as an international role-model, given that [70.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine) of nations already recognize Palestine.
1.4.2.3.3. Pro: American influence in Palestine is expanding; in 2021, President Biden moved to [restore relations with Palestinians](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-world-news-israel-united-nations-a5f546bf188f808ba29f381d76d44729) by reestablishing economic development and humanitarian aid programs.
1.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: The Biden administration made it clear that it supports a "[mutually agreed two-state solution](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-world-news-israel-united-nations-a5f546bf188f808ba29f381d76d44729)(“Under the new administration, the policy of the United States will be to support a mutually agreed two-state solution, one in which Israel lives in peace and security alongside a viable Palestinian state,” he said.\n\nMills said peace can’t be imposed on either side and stressed that progress and an ultimate solution require the participation and agreement of Israelis and Palestinians.)."
1.4.2.4. Con: The ignorance of the American people could cause them to support unethical policies that could do more harm than good.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Studies from the 1990s indicate that Americans are [less informed](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1081180X96001002003) about foreign policy issues and world affairs than citizens of major European countries and Canada.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: Many Americans lack basic geographic knowledge about the world and especially the Middle East.
1.4.2.4.2.1. Con: Poor geographic knowledge does not necessarily translate into a lack of knowledge about the pertinent issues required to form informed opinions.
1.4.2.4.2.1.1. Con: The Israel-Palestine conflict is a battle over geographic territory. Thus, it is unlikely that the average American with limited geographic knowledge about the Middle East can form an informed opinion over the territory dispute.
1.4.2.4.2.2. Con: Most Americans cannot properly identify [US states](https://www.rferl.org/a/1068259.html) on a map. This does not mean that they should not have or share their opinions on current affairs happening in their own country.
1.4.2.4.2.3. Pro: Americans are bad at geography in general, not just when it comes to the Middle East, because their school [curricula](https://www.rferl.org/a/1068259.html)("Geography is not consistently taught in the United States, that's one of the problems," Garcia said. "Pretty much after the 7th grade here in the United States, geography isn't taught.") do not give this subject much importance.
1.4.2.4.2.4. Pro: In a [2016 survey of American college students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2AUpoucQL4jQXhzOWt4QjBfMFk/view?resourcekey=0-uRyVrcvDjlY_IaOwzEc6rg)(p. 11), seven out of ten were unable to properly identify Israel, despite the fact that it was highlighted on a map along with three other Middle Eastern countries.
1.4.2.4.2.4.1. Pro: These numbers are persistent and represent not only students. As of 2006, three out of four Americans [couldn't locate Israel or Iran on a map](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/roper2006/pdf/FINALReport2006GeogLitsurvey.pdf)(p. 25) of the region. Two thirds couldn't find major theaters of US engagement like Iraq or major allies like Saudi Arabia.
1.4.2.4.2.4.2. Pro: Only half of the students were able to [pinpoint countries of major relevance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2AUpoucQL4jQXhzOWt4QjBfMFk/view?resourcekey=0-uRyVrcvDjlY_IaOwzEc6rg)(p. 11) for US foreign policy like Iraq and Iran.
1.4.2.4.2.4.3. Pro: The map used in the survey had actually redrawn the border, removing the West Bank; the missing chunk should have been a strong clue as to which country was Israel.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: Nearly all Americans believe [foreign policy is important](https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/americans-lack-knowledge-international-issues-yet-consider-them-important-finds-new)(“More than 80 percent agree it is important to teach foreign policy in high school and nearly 90 percent agree it is important to do so in college.” \n \n“In addition, 70 percent of those polled agree that international issues affect their daily lives.” \n \n“Majorities of Americans think it is extremely or very important to teach geography in elementary and middle school, high school, and college.”) enough to be taught in high school or college.
1.4.2.4.4. Pro: Americans are particularly uninformed about the international aid provided by the US government.
1.4.2.4.4.1. Pro: [Only a third](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dtingley/publications/public-opinion-and-foreign-aid-review-essay)(p. 392) of Americans have ever heard of USAid, their country's own organization for international development. Even among college graduates this number only increases to 54%.
1.4.2.4.4.2. Pro: Only one in twenty Americans knows that the United States spends about [1% of its GDP on foreign aid](http://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/data-note-americans-views-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/); the average estimate is 26%.
1.4.2.4.5. Con: Greater knowledge about foreign policy issues is unlikely to change public opinion, which is often rooted in [sentiments](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_is_it_so_hard_to_change_peoples_minds)(Our opinions are often based in emotion and group affiliation, not facts.) rather than facts.
1.4.2.5. Pro: [Two thirds](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) of all Americans - and even almost half of all Republican voters - believe America should either support or at least not block a UN resolution that recognizes Palestine as a state.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: The US historical pattern of [vetoing nearly every UN Security Council resolution unfavorable to Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/19/a-history-of-the-us-blocking-un-resolutions-against-israel) demonstrates that even an abstention would be a de facto endorsement of the resolution.
1.4.2.6. Con: Even if citizens desire an action to be taken, it may not be ethical for a government to deliver it.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: This is particularly true when the desired action entails interference in the affairs of other countries.
1.4.2.6.1.1. Con: Ironic, considering the United States is the [country that most interferes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/04/u-s-interferes-more-elections-than-russia-meddling-author-says/5700657002/) with the internal affairs of other sovereign nations.
1.4.2.6.2. Con: Some governments are not motivated by ethical decision making; they are more concerned with optics and protecting their domestic priorities.
1.4.2.7. Pro: History makes it abundantly clear that [citizens](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfj8xyc/revision/2) make social change possible by spurring the government to take action.
1.4.2.7.1. Pro: In 2019, citizens across [185 countries](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/21/across-the-globe-millions-join-biggest-climate-protest-ever)(In the estimated 185 countries where demonstrations took place, the protests often had their individual targets; from rising sea levels in the Solomon Islands, toxic waste in South Africa, to air pollution and plastic waste in India and coal expansion in Australia.\n\nBut the overall message was unified – a powerful demand for an urgent step-change in action to cut emissions and stabilise the climate.\n\nThe demonstrations took place on the eve of a UN climate summit, called by the secretary general, António Guterres, to inject urgency into government action to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement.) came together to raise their voices and call for governmental action against climate change.
1.4.2.7.2. Pro: In the United States, changes in [public opinion](https://socialistworker.org/2017/06/14/how-our-protests-won-marriage-equality)(This sea change in popular consciousness put pressure on politicians and judges, altering altered the landscape in which legal campaigns were taking place.\n\nCourt battles were important to winning marriage equality, but it was the pressure from below, created by masses of ordinary people participating in a grassroots movement, that drove the struggle forward to victory.) toward the LGBTQ community preceded legislation that protected marriage equality.
1.4.2.7.3. Pro: In Ireland, abortion rights were secured largely as a result of [campaigns](https://medium.com/\@twmerrigan/ireland-abortion-rights-activism-referendum-constitution-c6cf02ed1b81) championed by women.
1.4.2.7.4. Con: Even if the desired changes are unequivocally desirable, ethical, and justified, the public may lack the depth and breadth of knowledge that the government possesses to foresee and mitigate the unanticipated adverse consequences that could result from hastily implementing the required changes.
1.4.2.7.4.1. Con: The government possessing knowledge does not always mean that they will act on it; sometimes public pressure is necessary for change to occur.
1.4.2.7.5. Con: Governments have taken admirable steps toward positive social change even when public opinion was unfavorable.
1.4.2.7.5.1. Pro: The racial [desegregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_desegregation_busing_crisis) of schools was undertaken by the government despite brisk opposition from the public.
1.4.2.7.5.1.1. Pro: According to Howard Zinn, "[a radical historian](https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3583&context=jssw)(We now have enough actual experience of social change in the South to say confidently that you first change the way people behave by legal or extralegal pressures of various kinds, in order to transform the environment which is the ultimate determinate of the way people think.)," by implementing changes that facilitate social progress, such as racial desegregation, governments can create positive changes in public attitudes \(pp. 44-45\).
1.4.2.7.5.1.2. Con: Desegregation amid [unfavorable public opinion](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/violence-in-boston-over-racial-busing)(In Boston, Massachusetts, opposition to court-ordered school “busing” turns violent on the opening day of classes. School buses carrying African American children were pelted with eggs, bricks, and bottles, and police in combat gear fought to control angry white protesters besieging the schools.) posed safety threats to Black children.
1.4.2.7.5.2. Pro: To help resolve the Mexican peso crisis, [President Clinton](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/31/this-day-in-politics-jan-31-1995-1129932)(Mexico repaid the loan three years ahead of schedule, along with $500 million in interest. This event was marked by a celebration at the White House on Jan. 16, 1997, presided over by Clinton and Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary. The return of the funds also released Mexico from the tight economic controls that had been imposed by Washington.\n\n“Two years ago, helping our friend and neighbor in a time of need was quite controversial,” Clinton noted. “Some said that we should not get involved, that the money would never be repaid, that Mexico should fend for itself,” he added. “'They were wrong. Today, the American people can be proud that we did the right thing by Mexico and the right thing for the United States, and the right thing to protect global prosperity.”) loaned their neighbor country 20 billion USD. Although this move was met with sharp [criticism and disapproval](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-baycollege-americangovernment/chapter/the-effects-of-public-opinion/)(In 1995, despite public opposition, Clinton guaranteed loans for the Mexican government to help the country out of financial insolvency. He followed this decision with many speeches to help the American public understand the importance of stabilizing Mexico’s economy.), the outcomes were positive for both the parties involved.
1.4.2.7.5.3. Con: In democracies, governments and representatives are elected based on the [majority vote](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-baycollege-americangovernment/chapter/the-effects-of-public-opinion/)(Congress is likely to be aware of public opinion on issues. Representatives must continually raise campaign donations for bi-yearly elections. For this reason, they must keep their constituents and donors happy. Representatives are also likely to change their voting behavior if public opinion changes. Senators have a longer span between elections, which gives them time to make decisions independent of opinion and then make amends with their constituents. Changes in public opinion do not affect senators’ votes, but they do cause senators to lose reelection.). Therefore, it is unlikely that elected governments will make decisions that are diametrically opposed to those of the public.
1.4.2.7.5.4. Con: Resistance and backlash from dissenters can cause governments to backtrack their decisions. Such a move can be detrimental to the concerned parties, which is what happened with the [recriminalization of homosexuality](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-makes-homosexuality-a-crime-again/articleshow/27230690.cms) in India.
1.4.2.7.6. Pro: Informed citizens are able to [improve policy-making](https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/insights/citizen-views-better-policymaking); politicians enact policies that reflect public pressure and actually improve lives and society at large.
1.4.2.7.7. Con: The [government](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-baycollege-americangovernment/chapter/the-effects-of-public-opinion/), especially the judicial branch, should be neutral and objective, rather than giving in to public opinion.
1.4.2.7.7.1. Pro: In [2020](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/democracy-governance/us-supreme-court-v-american-public-opinion), all major SCOTUS decisions were in line with public opinion, indicating that it is in some way adherent to social expectations.
1.4.3. Con: Recognition may improve Palestinian perceptions of the US, but it will alienate Israel - a US ally.
1.4.3.1. Con: Israel is far too [dependent](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential) on the US to destroy relations.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Israel's trade is [highly dependent](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/isr/#Destinations) on the United States: 37% of its exports go to America, 14% of its imports come from there. No other country plays an equivalent role for Israel's trade.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: In fact, Israel exports [more](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/isr/show/all/2015/) to the United States than to its eleven next largest trade partners combined.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: No other country sends as many tourists to Israel as the United States; American tourists make up [one quarter](https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0615/061543.html)(''Tourism is the primary source of foreign currency for Israel,'' explains Geoffrey Weill, director of public relations at the Israel Ministry of Tourism office in New York. And he adds, ''While Americans make up a quarter of our tourist traffic, they contribute one-third of the dollars.'') of all tourism arrivals in Israel and contribute to one-third of tourism revenue.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: [Twenty-eight UN member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel#Present_situation) do not recognize Israel and do not permit their citizens to enter the country, limiting the number of people that can actually visit Israel.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Con: The US is [one of the most populous countries](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) in the world; the number of arriving tourists is bound to be high in any country visited by Americans.
1.4.3.1.2.3. Pro: In the past, American tourists have [shunned](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tourism-to-france-perks-up/) countries they perceived to act in opposition to US interests.
1.4.3.1.2.3.1. Con: A variety of [religious and cultural sites](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/12/06/questions-about-jerusalem-you-were-afraid-to-ask/) in Israel are important to Christians, Jews, and Muslims; many Americans will have [reasons](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/22/753493910/tourism-to-israel-is-on-the-rise-with-more-u-s-evangelical-christians-visiting?t=1638883243770) to visit Israel regardless of U.S. official policies.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: [Israel's status as a nuclear power](http://www.rense.com/general26/historw.htm) allows the country to be independent of the whims of major powers like the United States.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: Nuclear weapon use is [strictly regulated, if not prohibited](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/tpnw/), under most circumstances. At best, they are effective deterrents against states, not terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, which are Israel's main threats.
1.4.3.1.4. Con: Israel has a [large conventional arms industry](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/defense-industry-the-business-of-war-in-israel-a-988245.html). As a result, Israel's security is not dependent on good relations with the US.
1.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: Israel's defense industry is actually [undermined by US aid](http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/350424/israel-arms-industry-sees-big-hit-from-buy-american-provisions-in-38b-aid-d/) which forces it to "buy American". By restricting the amount that can be spent domestically, Israel's defence industry faces layoffs and closures.
1.4.3.1.4.2. Pro: Dependence on US aid has [institutionalized](https://townhall.com/columnists/jeffjacoby/2016/09/05/israel-doesnt-need-american-foreign-aid-n2213875) Israeli reliance on air power and ever-more-advanced technology, at the expense of focusing more intensively on ground maneuvers and the unique threat posed by enemies waging asymmetric warfare. Israel would be better off without this aid.
1.4.3.1.5. Pro: Israel receives a significant portion of its GDP in [foreign aid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/57170576) from the United States.
1.4.3.1.5.1. Con: Israel can hardly be said to be militarily dependent on the US. Even excluding America's military aid, it spends [one and a half times](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) as much on its military than all of its neighbors combined; the share of its GDP that it spends on the military is [the highest](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Trends-world-military-expenditure-2016.pdf) among all the world's major armies \(p. 2\).
1.4.3.1.5.2. Con: Israel's dependency is shrinking. Whereas the size of its economy [has tripled](http://data.worldbank.org/country/israel) over the last two decades, the size of aid payments has stayed the same. The [share](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33476.pdf)(pg.23) of US aid among Israel's GDP thus sunk from about 3% to 1%.
1.4.3.1.5.3. Pro: U.S. military aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s “[qualitative military edge](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)(pg.1)” \(QME\) over neighbouring militaries. This is vital to its regional security.
1.4.3.1.5.4. Pro: US aid accounts for [20% of Israel's defence budget and 40% of the IDF budget](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential). Israel is therefore heavily dependent on the US to maintain its defences.
1.4.3.1.6. Pro: The US supports Israel diplomatically, allowing it more freedom than unsupported states.
1.4.3.1.6.1. Pro: The US has repeatedly voted against all other members of the UN Security Council, vetoing resolutions that would have criticized Israel, including those on [settlement](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/F97C162F6A30647205256531005B4E15) [expansions](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/document/IP%20S2011%2024.php), [assassinations](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/document/IP%202004%20240.php), violating the [Geneva Convention](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/b35c281bef2fa8f00525651b003675d3?OpenDocument), attacking UN supplies, [and killing UN workers](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/87CD207B928B40D885256C950067EF41).
1.4.3.1.6.2. Pro: Damaging its relationship with the US would isolate Israel in the international community. This isolation could set in motion a [diplomatic avalanche](http://www.timesofisrael.com/left-alone-at-un-israel-can-ignore-but-not-avoid-diplomatic-fallout/) that will ultimately weaken Israel’s position in negotiations with the Palestinians.
1.4.3.1.6.2.1. Con: Israel's diplomatic position is quite strong following the [Abraham Accords](https://www.state.gov/the-abraham-accords/); these opened up trade with previously hostile neighbours and cemented Israel as a regional power player.
1.4.3.1.6.3. Pro: The United States has adopted a "[don't ask, don't tell](http://www.80bola.com.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/proliferation/israel/Israel%20crosses%20the%20threshold.pdf)" attitude towards Israel's nuclear program - a privilege which no other officially non-nuclear state enjoys.
1.4.3.1.6.3.1. Pro: Without tacit American acquiescence, the international community might call into question Israel's nuclear program and attempt to pressure the country into signing the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
1.4.3.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: There has been [international pressure](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-Under-Pressure-To-Give-Up-Chemical-Nuclear-Weapons-326452) on Israel to give up its nuclear weapons - without the support of the US, this international pressure may increase and force Israel to give up its nuclear weapons.
1.4.3.1.6.3.1.2. Con: The outsized [power](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/international-politics/impact-of-nuclear-weapons-on-international-relations/48526/) that any nuclear power has in international relations would likely continue to insulate Israel from any pressures to end their nuclear weapons program.
1.4.3.1.6.4. Con: American diplomatic support for Israel has [never been unequivocal](https://sethfrantzman.com/2016/12/24/abstaining-from-history-heres-all-the-un-resolutions-on-israel-the-us-abstained-on/). The US has supported, abstained from and vetoed UN resolutions criticizing Israel in the past.
1.4.3.1.6.4.1. Con: Until December 2016, out of 226 UN Security Council resolutions related to Israel since 1948, the US has [abstained](https://sethfrantzman.com/2016/12/24/abstaining-from-history-heres-all-the-un-resolutions-on-israel-the-us-abstained-on/) from less than two dozen of them. It has only voted against Israel a handful of times.
1.4.3.1.6.4.2. Con: Even when the US was supposed to play a neutral role - for example during the negotiations of the Oslo Accords in 1993 and in Camp David in 2000 - it de-facto [sided with Israel](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/john-mearsheimer/the-israel-lobby).
1.4.3.1.7. Con: It would be politically unviable for the US to completely cut off its aid to Israel, as [most US voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx) are staunchly pro-Israel, or would oppose cutting off aid. Given this, Israel still has plenty of room to be intransigent and aggressive in reaction to the recognition of Israel.
1.4.3.1.7.1. Con: Israel could be made to feel its dependence on the United States even without a complete cut-off of relations. In 2004, the American government [threatened](http://www.meforum.org/926/at-what-cost-israel-china-ties) to exclude Israel from the F-35 jet program, reducing its capacity to update its jets.
1.4.3.1.7.2. Con: [46%](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) of Americans support imposing sanctions on Israel in response to settlement-building.
1.4.3.1.7.3. Pro: American citizens' views of Israel have remained steadily positive since [2001](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189626/americans-views-toward-israel-remain-firmly-positive.aspx), despite occasional Israel aggression against Palestine. While many might think some sanctions are acceptable, cutting off aid completely would likely be a step too far in the eyes of pro-Israel Americans.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Israel tends to [respond harshly](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-security-council-vote-resolution-settlements-west-bank-east-jerusalem-israel-netanyahu-a7493996.html) when the international community moves against it, which could cause problems for the US.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Recognising a Palestine which does not accept Israel as a Jewish state could cause Israel to lash out and accuse the United States of tacit support for anti-Semitism.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: If the United States were to recognize Palestine, it is unlikely that Israel would position itself against not only the majority of the international community but also its most important ally by becoming more aggressive towards Palestine.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: If America were to recognize Palestine, it would defy its close ally's interests whilst also refusing to act against the interests of other countries it is less invested in economically and diplomatically. This would seem unfair.
1.4.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: The USA [publically supports](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2831586/We-not-favor-independence-President-Barack-Obama-reiterates-U-S-position-Tibet-China.html) the Chinese annexation of Tibet.
1.4.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: Out of respect to India, the US [does not recognize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict#United_States_positions_on_the_Kashmir_conflict) the independence of Kashmir even though it is far less invested in diplomatic ties with them than with Israel.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Recognition of a Palestinian state prior to an agreement undermines existing negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. This will likely alienate Israel from any discussions of a two-state solution.
1.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: If the US recognises the Palestinian state, Israel could be provoked to act aggressively against Palestine, which could result in worsened conditions for Palestinians.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Palestine does not pose a [military threat](https://imeu.org/article/comparison-of-millitary-strength-of-israel-and-the-palestinians) to Israel, so the need for aggressive action is minimal, if not non-existent.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: While Palestine does not possess the military capacity to destroy Israel, the threat of terrorist attacks and mortar fire from groups such as Hamas still exists.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.1.3.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: In one study, more than one-third of Israelis reported [prior exposure to terrorism](https://www.iirp.edu/images/conf_downloads/sXYpZw_Mally_-_Shechory_Bitton_and_Esther_Friedman_final.pdf)(Table 1.3), and about half had a relative who had previously been exposed to terrorist attacks. Such experiences may account for self-reported fear of terrorism among Israeli participants, particularly when compared to Swedish participants.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: In the cited study, the [correlation](https://www.iirp.edu/images/conf_downloads/sXYpZw_Mally_-_Shechory_Bitton_and_Esther_Friedman_final.pdf)(p. 10) between prior exposure to terrorist attacks and fear of terrorism was statistically non-significant.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Though Palestine may not currently pose a military threat to Israel, they still [consider](http://www.mintpressnews.com/palestinian-statehood-poses-threat-israel/200249/) Palestine to be an inherent threat to their own existence. Because Israel fears Palestine, they could feel it vital to strike against Palestine before they become strong enough to pose an actual military threat.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Unlike Israel, [Palestine](https://imeu.org/article/comparison-of-millitary-strength-of-israel-and-the-palestinians) has no air force, navy, tanks, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, ballistic missiles, or space technology.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Recognition would constitute a big step towards increasing Palestine's chances to become an independent state. Israel does not want this to happen and would want to prevent this while it's still possible.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Recognition of Palestine has prompted retaliation from Israel in the past.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Israel suspended a payment of [$127 million](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/retaliation-against-palestines-welcome-accession-to-icc-must-stop/) due to the Palestinian authorities, as a response to Palestine's accession to the ICC a day after the statute was signed.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: In response to the UN's recognition of Palestine, Israel confiscated [£75 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/9717397/Israel-exacts-retaliation-for-Palestinian-statehood-vote-as-it-confiscates-75m-in-revenue.html) that it was supposed to pay Palestine and announced that it would build 3000 new settlers' home in areas that the Palestinians had earmarked as part of a future state.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: By many accounts, the current PM, Bennett has an [even stronger](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/17/will-bennett-be-worse-than-bibi) anti-Palestine rhetoric than his predecessor. US recognition of Palestine would increase their threat to Israel, which would be followed by harsher sanctions against Palestine, thereby gaining Bennett more support from voters.
1.4.3.2.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: The [rally-round-the-flag](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.mah.se/stable/3649343?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=anatomy&searchText=of&searchText=a&searchText=rally&searchText=effect:&searchText=George&searchText=W&searchText=Bush&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fwc%3Don%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bprq%3Danatomy%2Bof%2Bthe%2Brally%2Beffect%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3BQuery%3Danatomy%2Bof%2Ba%2Brally%2Beffect%253A%2BGeorge%2BW%2BBush%26amp%3Bso%3Drel%26amp%3Bhp%3D25&refreqid=search%3Af88037627ed90e32fb48fe293779dc21&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) effect is a sudden increase in approval ratings following periods of international crisis or war. Though often applied to [US presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect), a leader of Israel could gain support from more patriotic voters, should they attack Palestine.
1.4.3.2.3.1.3. Con: Israel has fought at least three wars in Palestine in the last decade and regularly conducts air and artillery [strikes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-57138996) against Gaza. It is difficult to see how they could act more aggressively.
1.4.3.2.3.2. Pro: The Israeli government has [emphasized in the past](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/11/7/israel-rejects-french-peace-initiative-again), and the Israeli public has stated in [surveys](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(pg.7), that the preferred method of engaging with the Palestinians is through bilateral talks. Thus, the involvement of and pressure from third actors will likely be received negatively.
1.4.3.2.3.2.1. Con: Recognition does not constitute involvement in the talks. Thus, it is fully compatible with bilateral talks between Israel and Palestine.
1.4.3.2.3.3. Pro: The right wing establishment in Israel is thoroughly [opposed](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/137396-170211-minister-says-israel-faces-historic-opportunity-to-nix-two-state-solution) to the creation of a Palestinian state. Unilateral action by the US will likely push it further away.
1.4.3.2.3.4. Con: US recognition of Palestine might get Israel back to the negotiation table by [signaling disapproval](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/06/11/america-must-rethink-its-unique-and-contradictory-advocacy-of-israels-jewishness/) of current Israeli policies on the peace process. This can encourage the Israeli public to [question its government's stance](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5929705/us-israel-friends), as that is leading to increasing [international isolation](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1223731.shtml).
1.4.3.2.4. Con: Israel is already largely isolated in international public opinion, but so far has not seen this as a reason to change its policies.
1.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: Israel has few other allies and is generally not seen favourably abroad. In the [BBC's 2013 popularity ranking](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22624104), it is on one of the last ranks, just ahead of North Korea.
1.4.3.2.5. Pro: Israel [previously](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-security-council-vote-resolution-settlements-west-bank-east-jerusalem-israel-netanyahu-retaliatory-measures-new-zealand-senegal-a7493996.html) reacted poorly when the UN condemned settlements; ambassadors were withdrawn from every country that voted in favour of the resolution.
1.4.3.3. Pro: US recognition of Palestine would require [800,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_statistics_for_Israeli_settlements_in_the_West_Bank) Israelis to withdraw from the West Bank and cost Israel a vast some of money, given that the evacuation of 8,000 settlers from Gaza cost Israel [$9 billion](https://www.haaretz.com/1.4916471). This expense would have major ramifications for diplomacy between the two nations.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Elsewhere, the cost of resettlement of 100,000 settlers in Israel has been estimated to be [around $10 billion](https://www.timesofisrael.com/billions-spent-on-settlements-since-israel-captured-west-bank/). Since the total number of settlers is multiple times of that, resettling all of them would cost enormous amounts of money.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: The problem could be mitigated by land swaps through which Israel keeps territory with major settlements.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: Independent proposals based on the situation in 2011 estimate that swaps involving merely 5% of Palestinian territory and no dislocation of Palestinians could bring about 80% of settlers onto Israeli territory \([p. 11](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-2011-Imagining-the-Border-options-for-resolving-the-Israeli-Palestinian-Territorial-Issue-David-Makovsky-3-11.pdf)\).
1.4.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: In order to reduce the amount of territory annexed by Israel, other options would exchange a mere [3.7% of Palestinian territory](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-2011-Imagining-the-Border-options-for-resolving-the-Israeli-Palestinian-Territorial-Issue-David-Makovsky-3-11.pdf)(p. 11) and still be able to bring almost 70% of settlers onto Israeli territory.
1.4.3.3.2.1.2. Con: There has been considerable expansion of settlements since 2011, and more [constructions of settlements](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/24/israel-announces-2500-more-west-bank-settlement-homes) promised by the current government. This renders plans based on the situation in 2011 irrelevant.
1.4.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: [Almost 80%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/12/22/map-the-spread-of-israeli-settlements-in-the-west-bank/?utm_term=.e3d69a333cee) of settlers live within the Israeli [West Bank barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier), which could be used as a line to mark areas for land swaps.
1.4.3.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The Israeli West Bank Barrier is [illegal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-barrier-idUSL0714340920080707) under international law, built on Palestinian territory, and an arbitrarily defined border. There is no reason why this barrier should be used as the border to decide land swaps.
1.4.3.3.2.1.3.2. Con: It is unlikely that Palestinians would be willing to accept this barrier - which they oftentimes refer to as an "[apartheid wall](https://web.archive.org/web/20080307023217/http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_6040000/newsid_6044000/6044090.stm)" - as a permanent border.
1.4.3.3.2.1.4. Con: Land swaps will mean some Palestinians will either end up living in Israel, where they are likely to face [discrimination](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf)(p. 13), or they will be forced to relocate, which is unfair towards them.
1.4.3.3.2.1.4.1. Con: A number of [independent plans](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-2011-Imagining-the-Border-options-for-resolving-the-Israeli-Palestinian-Territorial-Issue-David-Makovsky-3-11.pdf)(pp. 7-9) for land swaps have been proposed under which no Palestinian villages would be annexed and no Palestinians displaced.
1.4.3.3.2.1.4.2. Pro: Even if land swaps were fair and would put an end to all settlements, a [solid majority](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Table%20of%20Findings_English%20Joint%20Poll%20Dec%202016_12Feb2017.pdf)(p. 3) \(65.4%\) of Palestinians oppose the idea.
1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: [About half](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) of all Israelis support in principle the idea of land swaps to retain Israeli control over territory with major settlements.
1.4.3.3.2.3. Con: The sheer number of settlements, as well as the distribution throughout almost the [entirety of the West Bank](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/12/22/map-the-spread-of-israeli-settlements-in-the-west-bank/?utm_term=.4c135f3b8781), would make this an incredibly difficult task.
1.4.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: In Gaza, only about 8,500 Jewish settlers had to be relocated. In contrast, the number of settlers in West Bank who would need to be relocated is about [50 times greater](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-gaza-disengagement-insight-idUSKCN0QF1QQ20150810).
1.4.3.3.2.3.2. Con: In 2013, the Arab League [endorsed](https://www.dawn.com/news/1025928/arab-league-moderates-stance-supports-land-swaps) the idea of mutually agreed-upon land swaps indicating that, though difficult, land swaps are possible.
1.4.3.3.2.4. Con: Land swaps are simply a negotiating tactic used by Israelis to [legitimise](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/israel-false-narrative-land-swaps-170312095110936.html) the ongoing expansion of settlements.
1.4.3.3.2.5. Con: The only land swap map put forward by Israel so far [prejudices](http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011122114239940577.html) Palestinian contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine. Mutually agreeable land swaps are likely to be impossible.
1.4.3.3.2.5.1. Pro: Israeli Arabs have [previously](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/israeli-arabs-reject-proposed-land-swap-2014112142628945331.html) [refused](https://www.jns.org/israeli-arabs-reject-becoming-citizens-of-palestinian-state-as-suggested-in-mideast-peace-plan/) land swaps as they oppose being transferred under Palestinian authority.
1.4.3.3.2.5.2. Pro: Palestinian authorities and communities have rejected land swaps on numerous occasions in the past.
1.4.3.3.2.5.2.1. Pro: Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority has [stated](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-2011-Imagining-the-Border-options-for-resolving-the-Israeli-Palestinian-Territorial-Issue-David-Makovsky-3-11.pdf)(p. 6) that land swaps must be based on land of equal size and value, yet Israel still hasn't committed to this principle. This alone dooms the possibility of agreeing on land swaps.
1.4.3.3.2.5.2.2. Pro: Hamas has declared its [opposition](http://jfjfp.com/?p=42804) to land swaps.
1.4.3.3.2.5.3. Con: In the 2000 Camp David peace talks, both sides [agreed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit#Territory) to a solution: adjusting pre-1967 borders so that the largest settlements are under Israel's control in exchange for more land for Palestine elsewhere. Withdrawal from other, much smaller settlements was considered to, consequently, be easy.
1.4.3.4. Con: The United States would not lose much by alienating Israel.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Israel is a [prolific](https://www.sipri.org/research/armament-and-disarmament/arms-transfers-and-military-spending/arms-production) exporters of arms. In the past, the US was able to influence the targets of these exports, for example by blocking sales [to China](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/27/AR2005062700351.html). If this leverage was lost, the US could be vulnerable.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: Even if the US were to alienate Israel, they may spend less on aid, freeing up funds that the US could spend elsewhere.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: The US has spent almost $100 billion on Foreign Military Financing \(FMF\) since 1985 \([p. 22](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33476.pdf)\).
1.4.3.4.2.1.1. Con: [FMF payments](https://www.dsca.mil/foreign-military-financing-fmf) are meant to enable foreign governments to purchase American military products and services. The money therefore comes back home and supports the US economy.
1.4.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: Israel is allowed to convert about a quarter of FMF military aid into shekels to spend at home \([p. 2](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)\). Such expenditure therefore does not wholly benefit the US.
1.4.3.4.2.1.2.1. Con: The FMF provision that allows Israel to spend 26% of military aid domestically is being [phased out](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/big-us-military-aid-package-to-israel-has-strings-attached.html), requiring Israel to spend all military aid within the US by 2021.
1.4.3.4.3. Pro: Israel is not a top partner for the US.
1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: Israel is not even among the [top-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_United_States) of America's trade partners measured in trade volume.
1.4.3.4.3.2. Pro: Israel is not even among the [top 20](http://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2016-I-001/index.asp) in terms of the national origins of tourists visiting the United States. Countries of comparable size, like Sweden and Switzerland, outrank it.
1.4.3.4.3.3. Pro: 37% of Americans believe that Israel has too much influence on their politics; a portion significant enough to influence geopolitical decision-making \([p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015-Poll-Key-Findings-Final-1.pdf)\).
1.4.3.4.3.4. Con: In a [Republican-dominated](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/15/gerrymandering-republicans-map-charts-states) era of US politics, the opinions of Republican voters are most influential. The majority of them believe that Israel has the right amount of influence \([p. 4](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015-Poll-Key-Findings-Final-1.pdf)\).
1.4.3.5. Pro: A deterioration in Israel-US relations will jeopardize America's operations and presence in the region.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: The US [relies](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-israel-intelligence-collaboration) on Israel for crucial intelligence about Hamas, Hezbollah, and al-Qaeda and its affiliate groups in the region \([p. 11](https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2011/10/Israel_strategic_US_assest_report.pdf)\). Deterioration of relations could put this intelligence cooperation at risk.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Con: Al-Qaeda is [no longer](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/al-qaeda-irrelevant-since-bin-laden-s-death-1.1165060) a relevant threat to the US.
1.4.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Even if al-Qaeda as an organization may have become irrelevant, the ideology, attitudes, and recruiting tactics that underlie it persist in [other organizations](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/comparing-al-qaeda-and-isis-different-goals-different-targets/), such as ISIS.
1.4.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: Jihadist terrorist attacks against US targets \(abroad and domestic\) by ISIS and al-Qaeda have [drastically declined](https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/terrorism-america-18-years-after-911/what-is-the-threat-to-the-united-states/) since their peak in 2015.
1.4.3.5.1.1.3. Pro: By many accounts, the biggest security threat to the United States is [white supremacy](https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/terrorism-america-18-years-after-911/what-is-the-threat-to-the-united-states/)(The most likely threat to the United States comes from terrorists inspired by a mixture of ideologies including jihadist, far-right, and idiosyncratic strains, radicalized on or via the internet, and taking advantage of the availability of weapons, particularly semi-automatic firearms, in the United States. While ISIS’ inspirational power has lessened in recent years, white supremacist extremism is increasingly inspiring deadly violence.).
1.4.3.5.1.1.4. Con: While ISIS is a bigger threat to US interests overseas, al-Qaeda is [still a relevant threat](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/comparing-al-qaeda-and-isis-different-goals-different-targets/)(Al Qaeda and its affiliates remain a threat to the U.S. homeland, while the Islamic State’s danger is more to the stability of the Middle East and U.S. interests overseas. Much of their rivalry involves a competition for affiliates, with both trying to spread their model and in Al Qaeda’s case to ensure its operational relevance. For now the Islamic State’s focus is primarily on Iraq and Syria and to a lesser degree on other states in the Muslim world, particularly Libya. In the United States and in Europe it may inspire “lone wolves,” but it is not directing its resources to attack in these areas, and security services are prepared for the threat. Al Qaeda is weaker and less dynamic than the Islamic State, but the former remains more focused on attacking the United States and its Western allies.) to the US homeland.
1.4.3.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: Al-Qaeda's hatred of the US and their demonstrated willingness to commit terror attacks makes them inherently dangerous, regardless of its current state. As long as al-Qaeda exists, it could return to relevancy and threaten the US again.
1.4.3.5.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Al-Qaeda has begun to build affiliate networks and [branches in Arab Africa](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48056433), carrying out attacks across the continent and demonstrating that they are still a very relevant threat to the world.
1.4.3.5.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Since the 9/11 attack, the US has developed adequate [capabilities to predict and ensure](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/us/politics/afghanistan-terrorism-threat.html)(No one can predict whether Al Qaeda will bounce back or how quickly. But some officials believe that the United States is unlikely to be caught unaware of a renewed Qaeda threat, pointing to U.S. counterterrorism capabilities and intelligence collection built up over the past two decades.) national security, regardless of the level of threat al-Qaeda poses.
1.4.3.5.1.2. Con: Intelligence about Hamas and Hezbollah is of relevance for the US only insofar as it helps to protect Israel. Neither organization targets America.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: Countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait or the UAE find it difficult to [side with the US](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116433750279531793) publicly on Iran unless "Washington pressures Israel on a peace initiative". If anything, recognition increases regional cooperation with the US.
1.4.3.5.2.1. Con: The US is [seeking](http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-looks-to-form-arab-alliance-against-iran-report/) to form an anti-Iran coalition with Arab states that would share intelligence with Israel as well. A peace deal is not required for Arab nations to cooperate with the US when their interests align.
1.4.3.5.2.2. Con: The US already [shares intelligence](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-yemen-exclusive-idUSKBN0N129W20150411) and [sells weapons](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-defense-congress-idUSKCN11R2LU) to Saudi Arabia, independent of the situation in Palestine. Regional cooperation and a Palestinian peace deal are not linked.
1.4.3.5.2.3. Con: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE have a strong anti-Iran position [due to sectarian tensions](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/saudia-arabia-iran-and-the-new-middle-eastern-cold-war-a-1090725.html). The US does not need to pressure them for support.
1.4.3.5.3. Con: Israel has [no US military bases](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321), whereas other regional players with poor historic relations with Israel do. A deterioration in the Israeli-US relationship would not affect US' capacity to project power regionally.
1.4.3.5.3.1. Con: Israel might not have any US military bases but they certainly have [US civilians joining their military](https://www.thedailybeast.com/1000-americans-are-serving-in-the-israeli-army-and-they-arent-alone). Alienating Israel could force those citizens to have to choose a side.
1.4.3.5.4. Pro: Israel is [strongly opposed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/israels-master-plan-crush-irans-nuclear-program-13392) to the Iran nuclear deal. If Israeli-US relations deteriorate as a result of US recognition of Palestine, Israel may launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran, raising the possibility of a regional war.
1.4.3.5.4.1. Pro: The threat of Iran acquiring a 'break-out' weapon after ten years, when the Iran Nuclear deal expires, may lead Israel to [strike](http://www.ocregister.com/2015/07/26/why-israel-will-hit-iran-after-obamas-gone/) Iran, especially if it feels it is losing US support and must protect itself.
1.4.3.5.4.2. Con: Amos Yadlin, the former head of IDF Intelligence, [claimed](http://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-idf-intel-chief-strike-on-iran-likely-wont-spark-regional-war/) that it was highly unlikely that a missile strike by Israel would lead to a regional war, primarily because Iran was aware of Israel's ability to destroy it in an all out war. This in turn would threaten the survival of the Iranian regime.
1.4.3.5.4.3. Con: The Israeli military and intelligence community supports the Iran nuclear deal.
1.4.3.5.4.3.1. Con: The Israeli political and security establishments are [split](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/netanyahu-idf-are-split-the-iran-nuclear-deal-15368?page=2) on their attitude towards the Iran deal. Despite the security establishment's acceptance of the Iran nuclear deal, Netanyahu could still order an attack on Iran.
1.4.3.5.4.3.2. Pro: Official Israeli statements on Iran are nothing but political rhetoric. Multiple Israeli security officials, including Israeli Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot, have [stated](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/iran-nuclear-deal-israel/472767/) that Iran's nuclear threat has been pushed back by at least 10-15 years, if not eliminated.
1.4.3.5.4.3.3. Pro: The Israeli security establishment has [warned](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/01/israel-netanyahu-trump-security-iran-deal-nuke-agreement.html) Netanyahu to not touch the Iran nuclear deal. They assessed that destroying the nuclear deal will unite the Iranian people behind the regime, and possibly even push it to pursue an all out nuclear option.
1.4.3.5.4.4. Pro: Israel [was close to](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Peres-bombshell-I-stopped-an-Israeli-strike-on-Iran-469112) preemptively striking Iran in the past. A falling out with the United States might embolden Israel to do so next time - and thereby torpedoing America's politics in the region, for example the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
1.4.3.5.5. Pro: Israel could sell sensitive military technology that either the US shares with it or it creates itself in retaliation for US recognition \([p. 12](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)\).
1.4.3.5.5.1. Pro: Washington insisted that Israel agree to stop selling problematic weapons and military technology to China and deprive itself of both a major market for its world-class military exports and a source of influence with Beijing. Without this pressure, Israel would resume selling weapons to China \([p. 9](https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2011/10/Israel_strategic_US_assest_report.pdf)\).
1.4.3.5.5.2. Pro: Israel is a world leader in the development of unmanned aerial systems, for both intelligence collection and combat, and it has shared with the U.S. military the technology, the doctrine, and its experience regarding these systems \([p. 10](https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2011/10/Israel_strategic_US_assest_report.pdf)\). America's ability to gather intelligence could be restricted if Israel decided to cut of trade in military technology.
1.4.3.5.5.3. Con: Presumably, the US would stop sharing sensitive technology with Israel if the latter started selling it as a form of retaliation for the recognition of Palestine.
1.4.3.5.5.4. Con: Due to Israel's reliance on American support for equipping its military, it is unlikely that Israel would endanger this support by going against its supplier's interests.
1.4.3.5.5.4.1. Pro: All airplanes and nearly all helicopters of the [Israeli Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force#Aircraft) were bought from the US. With an eye on its international position, it is unlikely that Israel would be able to procure military technology on this level from elsewhere.
1.4.3.5.5.4.2. Pro: The US also provides [vital defense technologies](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential) that Israel would not have access to otherwise.
1.4.3.5.5.5. Con: Israel did not retaliate against the other [138 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine) that recognized Palestine as a state, hence it is unlikely that it would retaliate against its closest ally and greatest source of [foreign aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations).
1.4.3.5.5.5.1. Pro: A few of these countries, like [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations#Increasing_tensions_\(1989%E2%80%93present\)) and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Syria_relations), are open enemies of Israel. Nonetheless, Israel did not retaliate against them when they recognized Palestine. It seems unlikely that Israel would then retaliate against its greatest ally and foreign aid source.
1.4.3.5.5.6. Pro: Israel has not been above using blackmail against the US to get what it wants. In 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, its cabinet reportedly engaged in "nuclear blackmail", by demanding an emergency airlift of arms and supplies from the US, depicting self-defense with nuclear weapons as the likely alternative \([pp. 225-240](https://archive.org/details/Sampson_Option/page/n233)\).
1.4.3.5.5.6.1. Con: Although often-repeated, this narrative of "nuclear blackmail" [has been called into question](https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/206909/israel-nuclear-weapons-and-the-1973-yom-kippur-war/#_ftn5) as it was never confirmed by named sources in public.
1.4.3.5.5.7. Pro: Israel has a track record of selling US arms to third countries without authorization. This was the case when Israel transferred arms to [Sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/134521/SIPRIBP1110.pdf)(pp. 8-10), [China, and Taiwan](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233197238_Israel%27s_Military_Transfers_to_China_and_Taiwan)(pp. 80-83).
1.4.3.5.5.7.1. Con: If Israel already has an established track record of selling arms to third parties without authorisation, then it seems unlikely that the recognition of Palestine will meaningfully change the state of affairs.
1.4.3.5.5.8. Con: Selling sensitive military technology would hurt Israel as much as the US, as Israel shares many of the same enemies. This would make intentional leaking of technology unlikely.
1.4.3.5.5.8.1. Con: While US relations with Russia are at their [lowest point](http://nationalpost.com/news/world/putin-says-u-s-russia-relations-at-lowest-point-since-cold-war-asks-american-business-leaders-to-help-trump/wcm/06d1cab2-109e-4677-88e3-ed3b7a21fc8d) since the Cold War, Israeli relations with Russia are the [warmest](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Despite-Syria-Israel-Russia-relations-are-the-warmest-in-history-485062) they have ever been, despite conflicting goals in Syria.
1.4.3.5.5.8.2. Con: While relations between the US and China are growing [worse](http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2017/04/06/6_reasons_us-china_relations_are_headed_for_trouble_112279.html) over conflicting priorities of trade and security, Israel and China have [vowed](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2080572/china-and-israel-vow-deepen-relations) to deepen relations.
1.4.3.6. Con: Close association with Israel is a burden so it may serve the US well to weaken ties.
1.4.3.6.1. Con: The [majority of Americans](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-attitudes-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/) do not perceive Israel as a burden to the United States.
1.4.3.6.1.1. Con: The public is not always aware of the intricacies of international politics, and is thus unlikely to be aware of the cost to their country of such a close association with Israel.
1.4.3.6.1.2. Pro: Even if the actual benefits are hard to quantify, three out of four Americans believe that Israel provides "essential military and intelligence cooperation" for the United States in the region \([p. 38](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cmep_20161202_public_opinion_poll.pdf)\).
1.4.3.6.1.2.1. Con: [Geo-strategic security](https://dbpedia.org/page/Geostrategy)(Geostrategy can function prescriptively, advocating foreign policy based on geographic and historical factors, analytically, describing how foreign policy is shaped by geography and history, or predictively, projecting a country's future foreign policy decisions and outcomes.) policies are not made with public opinion in mind, given they often do not reflect reality.
1.4.3.6.1.2.2. Pro: For decades, the US has been almost entirely dependent on Israel for intelligence regarding [the Middle East](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/u-s-israel-intelligence-collaboration).
1.4.3.6.2. Con: Israel hosts a large-scale American [war reserve stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_reserve_stock#War_Reserves_Stock_Allies-Israel) with some $1.8 billion worth of equipment for use in case of armed conflict in the region.
1.4.3.6.3. Pro: The extent and unconditionality of American [support for Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/18/short-answer-why-is-the-united-states-so-pro-israel) has been described as going against America's [strategic and moral interests](https://ctmirror.org/category/ct-viewpoints/time-to-reconsider-u-s-s-unconditional-support-for-israel-john/).
1.5. Con: Recognizing Palestine while it is partially ruled by [Hamas](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/middleeast/palestinians-gaza-cabinet-hamas.html) is equivalent to legitimizing a [terrorist organization](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/)(10/8/1997 HAMAS).
1.5.1. Con: It is possible to recognize Palestine as a state and simultaneously condemn Hamas as terrorists and illegitimate rulers of the area they control in Gaza.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Hamas is not entirely a terrorist organisation, it's mostly [a political party](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546553.2013.733273). Only its armed branch, called [Izz ad Din al Qassam Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades), may be considered as a terrorist organisation.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: In [January 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election), Hamas' political party won a plurality in the Palestinian Parliament. Being political in nature and as long as the political arm plays within the democratic and constitutional rules they should be given a chance to be considered.
1.5.1.2. Pro: India [recognizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine#:~:text=Among%20members%20of%20the%20G20,the%20United%20States\)%20have%20not.)(Among members of the G20 major countries, 9 \(being Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey\) have recognized Palestine as a state) Palestine's statehood, but simultaneously [condemns](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-opposes-hamas-rocket-action-against-israel-supports-palestine-101621224892489.html) attacks carried out by Hamas.
1.5.1.3. Pro: China [supports](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/6/7/chinas-ties-with-israel-are-tested-by-gaza-but-not-sorely)(While it has invested large sums of money in Israel, China has sought to maintain its historic image as a strong supporter of Palestine by taking symbolic stances on certain issues.\n\nIn 2017, China banned its nationals from taking part in illegal settlement building in the occupied West Bank, even as Chinese contractors were busy working on infrastructure projects in Israel.) Palestine whilst maintaining economic links with Israel. This would likely be infeasible if the nation supported Hamas.
1.5.1.4. Con: A [2021 survey](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-middle-east-science-32095d8e1323fc1cad819c34da08fd87) found strong Palestinian support for Hamas \(75%\), which was also voted as the most worthy leader of the Palestinian people. Thus, it is impossible to recognize Palestine and simultaneously invalidate the popular vote.
1.5.1.5. Con: Hamas has been working to establish [an independent Palestinian state](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hamas). As such, recognition of such a state would inevitably be regarded as an achievement of their expressed objectives.
1.5.1.6. Con: Just because certain countries regard Hamas as a terrorist organization does not mean that this is indeed the case. Instead, such a designation has been regarded as a means to [silence pro-Palestine activism](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/11/25/the-uk-government-is-on-the-wrong-side-of-history-again).
1.5.2. Pro: Recognizing Palestine whilst Hamas is control could [send a problematic signal](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/5141-legitimacy-and-complexity-in-terrorist-conflicts--)(One of the main arguments put forward by scholars against engaging with terrorists is that such a course of action would legitimize the terrorists, their goals and, most of all, their means.) to other groups by showing that terrorism can garner US recognition more effectively than diplomatic action \(p. 410\).
1.5.2.1. Con: The US both recognizes a number of entities associated with terrorist organizations and has previously [supported terrorist groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism) to overthrow established governments.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Hezbollah [exerts massive amounts of control](http://www.newsweek.com/hezbollahs-latest-conquest-lebanons-cabinet-541487) over Lebanon, however, the US still recognizes Lebanon's statehood.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: US recognition of Lebanon predates the founding of Hezbollah, which occurred in [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah).
1.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: Hezbollah is designated a [Foreign Terror Organisation](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm) by the US.
1.5.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The US has [enacted sanctions](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/9/8/us-sanctions-former-lebanese-ministers-over-ties-to-hezbollah)(The United States on Tuesday expanded its sanctions on Lebanon, blacklisting the former transport and finance ministers and accusing them of providing material and financial help to the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, following a powerful blast last month in Beirut that left the country reeling.\n\n“Corruption has run rampant in Lebanon, and Hizballah has exploited the political system to spread its malign influence,” US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement, announcing the blacklisting of former Lebanese government ministers Yusuf Finyanus and Ali Hassan Khalil.) against Lebanese officials with connections to Hezbollah.
1.5.2.1.1.3. Con: Whereas Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, the influence of Hezbollah in Lebanon is smaller, and concerns mainly day-to-day affairs. It holds [merely 9%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_general_election,_2017) of the seats in parliament, provides only [two out of 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_government_of_December_2016) ministers and neither the Prime Minister nor President.
1.5.2.1.1.4. Pro: Hezbollah is by far the [most influential political organization](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/06/how-hezbollah-holds-sway-over-lebanese-state/02-influence-through-state-institutions) in Lebanon.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.4.1.3.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: The United States recognizes governments which it has classified as [state sponsors of terrorism](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm): Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba. These states pose a very real threat to the US, and therefore should be designated as such.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: The USA has also been involved in [state-sponsored terrorism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism), regime change and war since its inception, yet that didn't lead other states to call into question American statehood. The same should be the case for Palestine.
1.5.2.1.3.2. Con: It wouldn’t benefit Palestine to be recognized as a [state sponsor of terrorism](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm) by the United States.
1.5.2.1.3.3. Pro: Not only would the designation of a state sponsor of terrorism probably be not particularly problematic, it is also unlikely. Even if organizations like Hamas are categorized as sponsors of terrorism, it is hard to imagine that this label would be applied to Palestine as a whole.
1.5.2.1.3.4. Con: America should not accept the establishment of a new state that would be de-facto controlled \(if only in part\) by a terrorist group.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Leaders have previously claimed not to [negotiate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16366413)("I think that they are revelatory and of genuine historical importance because they give lie to all sorts of assumptions that were made incorrectly about the Hunger Strikes and the relationship between the government and the IRA.\n\n"These documents spell it out large that Mrs Thatcher was involved in negotiations with the IRA."\n\nThe documents contain details of eight phone calls between the MI6 officer and Mr Duddy during the weekend from 4 July to 6 July 1981.) with terrorists to signal the strength of their ideological position, even if that is counter to reality.
1.5.3. Pro: Hamas, which governs part of the current Palestinian territory, [does not recognize](https://www.dw.com/en/hamas-recognizes-1967-borders-rejects-israel/a-38656798) Israel as a state, let alone its Jewish statehood.
1.5.3.1. Pro: In 2017, Ismail Haniyeh was [elected](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/hamas-says-ismail-haniyeh-chosen-as-islamic-groups-leader-4643691/) as the new leader of the Hamas Political Bureau. This illustrates that his view is in line with the official policy of Hamas as an organisation and, therefore, the people who vote for it.
1.5.3.2. Con: Hamas [outlined](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/01/29/hamas.interview/) conditions for a truce with Israel before the 2006 elections in Gaza, indicating that it is willing to be pragmatic when it comes to electoral pressures, even if it does not ideologically accept Israel's right to exist.
1.5.4. Con: US recognition of Palestine will improve Israel's security by changing the balance of power in the region. This change is more important than any fear of legitimising Hamas.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Reducing the potential for conflict between Israel and Palestine could weaken regional adversaries of the US and Israel.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Better relations between Israel and the Palestinians would weaken Iran, one of the principal adversaries of the United States and Israel, which has long used Hezbollah and Hamas [as proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_proxy_conflict).
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: By supporting terrorist groups, Iran [can](https://www.lawfareblog.com/irans-support-terrorist-groups) undermine and intimidate rivals, influence the Israel-Palestine conflict, and project power in regional crises. Weakening Iran's proxies would lessen their ability to carry out these disruptive actions.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: According to ex-Prime Minister Netanyahu, defense analysts in Israel [estimate that](http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-80-of-security-threats-against-israel-emanate-from-iran/) more than 80% of the country's security problems emanate from Iran.
1.5.4.1.1.3. Con: Recent events involving the US and Iran, such as US withdrawal from the nuclear deal under the [Trump administration](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-iran-nuclear-deal) and the killing of [Soleimani](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/01/world/us-iran-conflict-timeline-trnd/), have further compounded conflicts between the two countries. These events have caused direct enmity between the US and Iran; therefore, indirectly weakening Iran by resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict is unlikely to be effective.
1.5.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Iran is one of the handful of countries without a US embassy; the lack of diplomatic relations between the US and Bhutan, North Korea, and Iran leaves each of the [latter countries](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/09/politics/btn-diplomatic-presence/index.html) without an official US government presence.
1.5.4.1.1.4. Pro: Solving the Palestinian conflict is cited as a [precondition](http://world.time.com/2014/02/04/iranian-foreign-minister-lays-out-condition-for-iranian-recognition-of-israel/) by Iran for recognizing Israel. Should America's recognition of Palestine lead to this, one of Israel's biggest foes would possibly take a more conciliatory stance.
1.5.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: It is not clear that Israel requires Iran's recognition - they have shown [superior military capabilities](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-scientist-idUSKBN2AA2RC) in their assassination of Iran's top nuclear scientist.
1.5.4.1.1.5. Con: Iran does not depend on the Israeli oppression of Palestinians in order to [exert its influence](https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/sc14668.doc.htm)(Turning to Iran, he expressed concern that it is aiming to become a “nuclear threshold State”, which obstructs the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\) and violates international agreements. The country is a centre of Shiite hegemony that exports terror around the world. If the Council does not take strong action, that country will command forces such as Hamas and Hezbollah and, protected by its nuclear umbrella, turn its “reign of terror into a hurricane of violence”.) in the region.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: Recognition of statehood does not automatically eliminate the US' security concerns. If Hamas posed a legitimate security threat, the US could get involved in some capacity regardless of Palestinian sovereignty, as it does in other nations around the world.
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Recognizing Palestine may take away from the factors that motivate terrorism against Israel, reducing pressure on regional security forces.
1.5.4.1.3.1. Con: Going by the declarations of [past Israeli leaders](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/temple-mount-tensions-al-aqsa-mosque-rumors-behind-palestinian-unrest-n440811), Israel would prefer to maintain control over the Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa Mosque. This has been a [major motivation](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/temple-mount-tensions-al-aqsa-mosque-rumors-behind-palestinian-unrest-n440811) for past Palestinian terrorist attacks.
1.5.4.1.3.2. Con: Even among Palestinian terrorists attacking Israel, there is no uniform or common pattern of motivations. Nationalist and economic grievances alone are seen as insufficient factors for explaining their terrorism \([p. 87](http://www.aldeilis.net/terror/1188.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.2.1. Con: Palestinian liberation features [prominently](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/teaching-terror-how-hamas-radicalizes-palestinian-society) in Hamas propaganda used for radicalizing Palestinian youth.
1.5.4.1.3.3. Pro: [Coercing](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=SOlnH3f_dXwC&lpg=PA3&dq=islamic%20terrorism%20motivations&lr&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false)(Table 6, pg. 43) a foreign military force to withdraw from the terrorist groups' homeland was a strong motivator of most suicide terrorism campaigns between 1980 and 2003. Recognising Palestine might be perceived as a step in this direction.
1.5.4.1.3.4. Pro: Palestinian terrorism against Israel is linked to their [loss of identity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236707150_Catastrophe_Memory_and_Identity_Al-Nakbah_as_a_Component_of_Palestinian_Identity)(p. 194) through foreign domination, and the lack of progress in creating a nation. Recognizing Palestine might help to overcome these feelings and signify political progress.
1.5.4.1.3.4.1. Con: Intractable conflicts can result in a sense of [collective victimhood](https://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r23447.pdf)(p. 235) among those affected, and these shared meanings can be the basis for a newly reformulated identity.
1.5.4.1.3.5. Pro: In 2016, more than half of all Palestinians supported armed attacks on Israeli citizens \([p. 5](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/poll%2062%20English%20full%20text.pdf)\). Ending the occupation of Palestine might help change these attitudes.
1.5.4.1.3.6. Pro: Decreased pressure on regional security forces may more effectively shield the US from terrorism.
1.5.4.1.3.6.1. Con: The threat that terrorism poses to the US is negligible. Since 2001, only [6 people per year](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1?r=US&IR=T) were killed by terrorism - a figure more than 10 times smaller than those killed by choking on food.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2. Con: The terrorist organisations that have declared war on the US would continue to fight against it independent of the situation in Palestine.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.1. Pro: [US presence](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6137678) in Iraq stokes a [threat](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/13/politics/dni-avril-haines-terrorist-threat-somalia-yemen-syria-iraq/index.html) of terrorism. This is independent of the Palestinian conflict.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.2. Pro: Certain [interpretations](http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/023-violence.htm) of Islam encourage killing non-Muslims. These interpretations exist and will be wielded by extremists regardless of US actions.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.2.1. Pro: [ISIS](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/) and [al-Qaeda](http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html) both want to establish a global caliphate. This goal will remain regardless of how friendly the US is to Palestine.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3. Con: The plight of the Palestinians vis-à-vis Israel is a contributing factor towards extremism far beyond these two countries. An American recognition of Palestine would undermine this as the fate of the nation would seem more secure.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1. Pro: Former senior CIA officials and military commanders believe that the Palestine issue helps al-Qaeda recruit more soldiers \([p. 293](https://hegghammer.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hegghammer-wagemakers-the-palestine-effect-the-role-of-palestinians-in-the-transnational-jihad-movement.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: Osama bin Laden identified the Israel-Palestine conflict and the oppression of Palestinians as one of the central drivers behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks \([p. 73](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00396330903168865)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: US support for Israel and perceived animosity toward Islam were repeatedly cited as motivating factors for terror attacks by bin Laden, beginning with his call for [boycott of US goods](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/03/osamabinladenstruepriorities) in the '80s to his [fatwa and jihad declaration](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2010/MVZ203/OBL___AQ__Fatwa_1996.pdf)(p. 2) against the US in the '90s.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Bin Laden only developed contacts with Palestinian organizations in the late 1990s, resulting from new connections to Lebanon and Usbat al-Ansar \([p. 192](https://books.google.de/books?id=IOoBZvdNrIkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=%22Thus%20far%2C%20Hamas%22&f=false)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.1.3. Con: When US Special Forces raided the Osama bin Laden compound in Pakistan in 2011, they absconded with documents revealing internal debates about how the organisation should continue to [exploit](https://consortiumnews.com/2012/05/27/how-al-qaeda-exploits-palestine-cause/) the Palestinian cause in order to increase recruitment.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.1.4. Pro: In an interview, Osama bin-Laden's mother described her son as being "concerned, sad, and frustrated about the situation in Palestine" during his teenage years \([p. 76](https://burocraufabc.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/aula-7-wright-2007-em-inglc3aas.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.1.5. Pro: Upon seeing Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount in 2000, bin Laden hurried Mohamed Atta, the pilot of the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, to accelerate their preparations for the 9/11 attacks \([p. 18](http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/staff_statement_16.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.2. Pro: In arguably its most important ideological statement, the “Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders” \(February 1998\), al-Qaeda listed Palestine [third](https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm)(Third, if the Americans' aims behind these wars are religious and economic, the aim is also to serve the Jews' petty state and divert attention from its occupation of Jerusalem and murder of Muslims there. The best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the strongest neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee Israel's survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the Peninsula.) on a list of reasons why jihad against America is justified \(after the US military presence in Saudi Arabia and the sanctions regime against Iraq\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.5.1.1.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.2. Pro: Statelessness has led some Palestinians to take part in transnational jihad, and act as ideologues for the jihadi movement \([p. 294](https://hegghammer.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hegghammer-wagemakers-the-palestine-effect-the-role-of-palestinians-in-the-transnational-jihad-movement.pdf)\). If a Palestinian state were to be established, they would have a home, reducing their incentive to act aggressively.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.2.1. Con: The available evidence does not suggest that Palestinians are overrepresented amongst transnational jihadi networks \([p. 296](https://hegghammer.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hegghammer-wagemakers-the-palestine-effect-the-role-of-palestinians-in-the-transnational-jihad-movement.pdf)(A recent study found that only 7 of 280 individuals hailed as fallen martyrs on jihādī websites were Palestinian. There are all kinds of problems with the above-mentioned data, but what exists suggests that Palestinians are not strongly overrepresented in trans-\nnational jihādī networks.)\). This suggests that Israeli occupation is not a decisive factor in motivating Palestinians to turn to militancy.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.2.2. Pro: [Abdallāh ʿAzzām](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Yusuf_Azzam), known as the 'Godfather of Jihad', was responsible for spearheading the effort to bring Muslim foreign fighters to Afghanistan in the 1980s. He was radicalised in Palestine and participated in paramilitary operations against Israel.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.3. Con: Regardless of whether the US recognises Palestine, it is unlikely to change their general support for Israel. This motivation would thus still exist.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.4. Pro: Studies on Muslim terrorists in Western countries indicate that a motive for terrorism is the belief that Islam is oppressed by the West. Recognizing Palestine might be a step towards changing this perception \([p. 7](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/SR236Venhaus.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.4.1. Con: Despite anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist motivations, ISIS has not directed any [attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/25/world/map-isis-attacks-around-the-world.html) towards Israel. This shows that Israel is not a primary target nor is the Palestinian cause a serious ideological motivation for Islamic terrorist groups.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS, has [invoked](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/palestine-still-key-to-stability-in-the-middle-east/) the Palestinian cause in his crusade against the Jews and Americans.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: The US and the UK have a world-class intelligence and security apparatus, yet still have been unable to prevent ISIS attacks in their countries. It is unlikely that Israel deters ISIS, rather that ISIS itself is not interested in attacking Israel.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.4.2. Pro: The 1993 World Trade Center attack was targeted at the Jewish population of New York and aimed to compel the US to cut all ties with Israel \([p. 289](https://hegghammer.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hegghammer-wagemakers-the-palestine-effect-the-role-of-palestinians-in-the-transnational-jihad-movement.pdf)(Yousef later said he chose New York City because of its large Jewish population, and in letters sent to newspapers before the attack he stated three demands, the first two of which were an end to all US aid to Israel and an end to US diplomatic relations with Israel.)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.4.3. Pro: US administration officials have admitted that the Palestinian conflict [increases](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/12/to-defeat-isil-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-must-be-resolved.html) the appeal of ISIS recruiting tools.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.5. Con: Contemporary Islamic terrorism in the West is not committed by the victims of the Palestinian conflict nor people who show sympathy to the victims. Terrorists use the plight of fellow Muslims and religion [as a guise](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/apr/13/who-are-the-new-jihadis) for already existing radicalization and nihilism.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.5.1. Con: Terrorist recruiters highlight the oppression and deprivation experienced by the groups they supposedly represent \([p. 3](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208552.pdf)(Perceived injustice, need for identity and need for belonging are common vulnerabilities among\npotential terrorists. \[...\] Recruitment efforts do appear concentrated in areas where people feel most deprived and dissatisfied.\nRelationships are critical. Effective recruiters create and exploit a sense of urgency and imminence. \[...\] Effective leaders of terrorist organizations must be able to: \[...\] manipulate incentives \(and purposive goals\) for followers; deflect conflict to external targets.)\). Therefore, regardless of their true motives, [terrorist organizations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6109790/)(The main finding of the research was that there was an indirect effect of perceived oppression on violent disinhibition through radical intentions in the Muslim sample, \[...\] the conjunction of the loss of significance and radical intentions seems to strongly exacerbate the likelihood of a process of violent disinhibition for those who are considered to be in marginal contexts.) may use the plight of Palestinians to recruit or gain popularity among civilians.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.3.5.2. Pro: Empirical findings suggest that there is [no correlation](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-56-update.pdf)(\[W\]e find no empirical evidence to suggest that increases in the share of immigrants from abroad is significantly correlated with higher rates of terrorism. These results hold for immigrants from both Muslim majority and conflict-torn countries of origin.\n\n\(p. 12\)) between immigration, including from conflict-torn Muslim countries, and terrorism.
1.5.4.1.3.6.2.4. Con: Reducing the threat of Palestinian terror in the US, however minor, makes the world safer.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3. Con: It is unlikely that Palestinian organizations commit acts of terror in the US; therefore, they should not be a focus of US diplomatic relations and foreign policy.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.1. Con: Palestinians have been linked to groups that directly oppose and threaten US interests and allies \(e.g., [ISIS](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2015-005120_EN.html)(Whilst Palestinian forces have arrested ISIS supporters, the Hamas-controlled Palestinian government is not openly fighting the Islamic State. Furthermore, Palestinian terrorists are adopting some of the methods employed by ISIS. The similarities relate not only to propaganda but also to the methods of terrorist attacks. This was the case in the attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem on 18 November 2014, when knives were used in accordance with the calls of ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al Adnani.)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2. Pro: There is little evidence that international terrorist organisations willing and capable of striking the US, like al-Qaeda, are linked to Palestinian groups \([p. 63](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=bQHXJ4JzxV4C&pg=PT3&lpg=PT3&dq=0-374-17772-4&source=bl&ots=APimckevjw&sig=iq9yYeg467Yc6VnXh-YNhuozdSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG7tjIobfUAhWCgbwKHeWAAcUQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&q=0-374-17772-4&f=false)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.1. Con: [Ma’sadat al-Mujahideen](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-fires-haifa-jerusalem-terror-palestinian-militant-group-ma-sadat-al-mujahideen-mount-carmel-a7439271.html) is a Palestinian Salafist group with links to al-Qaeda. It claims to have started a number of fires in Israel, including the 2016 Haifa blaze that led to the evacuation of 60,000 people.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.2. Con: [Army of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Islam_\(Gaza_Strip\)) is a militant group that operates in the Gaza Strip. It draws inspiration from and is likely linked to al-Qaeda.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.3. Con: Hamas has [loose ties](http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-hamas-al-qaeda-alliance/article/558605) with al-Qaeda: Hamas members receive training from their camps and often try to recruit fighters for their cause from there.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.4. Pro: Despite threatening to, Hamas has not joined al-Qaeda's global jihad. Hamas sees itself as a [local resistance organization](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/could-hamas-target-the-west) and has limited its operations to targeting Israelis in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.4.1. Con: Al-Qaeda has a [history](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Al-Qaida-and-Palestinian-jihadists-The-Hamas-connection-339782) of conducting attacks in Israel by recruiting and sending in foreign fighters. After al-Qaeda started losing ground in Afghanistan, Bin Laden marked Palestine as a top priority. Al-Qaeda does not need to be linked to Palestinian organisations to operate there.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: The shoe bomber, Richard Reid, trained by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, traveled to Israel in 2001 to [scout out](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,203478-1,00.html) locations for potential bombings.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.4.2. Pro: Hamas and al-Qaeda's interactions were negligible during the '90s and '00s \([pp. 285-286](https://hegghammer.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hegghammer-wagemakers-the-palestine-effect-the-role-of-palestinians-in-the-transnational-jihad-movement.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: Al-Qaeda has [consistently](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-war-of-words-between-hamas-and-al-qaeda) condemned the Hamas leadership whenever they have run for elections or tried to work with Fatah in a unity government; their support for Hamas exists only when the latter adopts a military approach to the Palestinian conflict.
1.5.4.1.3.6.3.2.4.3. Pro: There is little to no evidence connecting the central leadership of al-Qaeda with attacks in Israel or on other Jewish targets. These attacks, therefore, demonstrate that Israel is not a priority for al-Qaeda \([p. 291](https://hegghammer.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hegghammer-wagemakers-the-palestine-effect-the-role-of-palestinians-in-the-transnational-jihad-movement.pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.3.6.4. Pro: Currently, the Palestinian conflict allows secularists and Islamists \([pp. 107-114](https://www.cmi.no/publications/file/4875-questioning-the-secularreligious-cleavage-in.pdf)(\[I\]nstead of keeping its secularism as an alternative to the religious Hamas, Fatah aligned its rhetoric and policies with the increasingly religious Palestinian electorate \[...\] while Hamas was established as a religious-nationalistic liberation movement with absolutist territorial claims, it has since developed into a more pragmatic political party with a less pronounced focus on religion.)\) to converge and form a common picture of the [US as a foe](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/anti-americanism-due-what-us-or-what-us-does)(An analysis of such trends reveals the central role that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has played in shaping Arab and Muslim attitudes toward the United States. When citizens of Arab and Muslim countries look at U.S. policy on issues such as democracy or Iraq, they often see it through the painful prism of America's traditional support for Israel. The centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Arab public opinion does not mean that Arabs care about Palestine more than about their own pocketbooks or their own countries. Nevertheless, they do place great importance on supporting Palestinians, just as many American Jews passionately support Israel.). By stymieing the conflict, the US is safer.
1.5.4.1.3.7. Con: Palestinian terrorism persists because [non-violent activism is unacknowledged](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/05/18/dont-take-the-narrow-view-of-whats-happening-in-gaza/) by the international community. Thus, Palestinians have learned that only violence will draw international attention to their plight.
1.5.4.1.4. Con: If Israel believed that getting along with the Palestinians would pay dividends in terms of weakening their other adversaries, they'd already do so.
1.5.4.1.5. Con: Even if the US recognizes Palestine, there is no guarantee that Israel will. This limits progress in ameliorating the conflict and stabilising the region.
1.5.4.1.6. Pro: Recognising Palestine might bring more co-operation between the [PNSF](https://ecfr.eu/special/mapping_palestinian_politics/national_security_forces_nsf/) and the [IDF](https://www.idf.il/en/who-we-are/).
1.5.4.1.6.1. Pro: The Palestinian Authority [withdrew](https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_12_Israel_and_Palestine.pdf)(Shortly before this, Palestinian Authority \(PA\) President Mahmoud Abbas threatened to end Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation in response to a new Knesset law which retroactively legalised some 4,000 Israeli settler houses built on private Palestinian land. Consequently, one of the cornerstones of the Oslo Accords now appears to be under real threat.) their co-operation with Israeli security forces in 2017, after the Knesset legalised Israeli settler homes on Palestinian land. If Palestine was recognised as a state by the US, this may make them feel more secure in their regional status \(p. 1\).
1.5.4.1.6.1.1. Pro: Before the withdrawal, the USA [funded](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/3/9/what-palestinian-israeli-security-cooperation)(With the help of security assistance over the past eight years, the United States has helped the Palestinians build effective and professional forces that have resulted in a more stable, less violent West Bank.) the Palestinian security forces heavily, reducing crime.
1.5.4.1.6.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that US recognition would effectively ameliorate tensions between the two security forces due to the history of [lone wolf attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/3/9/what-palestinian-israeli-security-cooperation)(Recently though, with the rise of lone-wolf attacks and skirmishes between the Israeli military and Palestinians, security is becoming more fragile, but not due to a lack of effort from PA security forces.) from Palestinian members against Israelis.
1.5.4.1.6.2. Con: Palestinians often [do not trust](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/3/9/what-palestinian-israeli-security-cooperation)(But it’s not all good news. More than 80 percent of Palestinians see the PA as corrupt. In addition, despite improvements, the PA security forces have continued to violate human rights including cases of torture and infringements on free speech \(PDF\).\n\nIn one recent example, the PA arrested journalist Salim Sweidan on questionable charges like “the publication of articles harmful to Palestinian national unity”. He was released four days later on $1,400 bail and an online apology, but still faces a court date on March 12 according to a conversation with Sweidan.\n\nAs Yezid Sayigh, a senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Centre noted, “enhanced technical capability and growing professionalism do not guarantee the rule of law,” and in fact has only led to further authoritarianism.) their security forces meaning that there is little capacity to reduce high tensions in the community.
1.5.4.1.7. Pro: Recognizing Palestine could reduce political collateral damage in neighboring countries.
1.5.4.1.7.1. Pro: Algeria broke diplomatic ties with Morocco, citing Morocco's [normalization of relations with Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/25/morocco-algeria-diplomatic-ties-wildfires-hostile-actions)(Other criticism ranged from reported remarks by Morocco’s UN ambassador in mid-July to recent comments by Israel’s foreign minister on an historic visit to Morocco as part of both countries’ normalisation of ties.) as one of the "hostile actions" causing the fallout.
1.5.4.1.7.1.1. Con: Blaming Israel is the convenient route; their spat is largely regarding the [Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara](https://www.theafricareport.com/69335/morocco-algeria-western-sahara-conflict-shows-signs-of-escalation/).
1.5.4.1.7.2. Pro: A number of countries in the Middle East and North Africa [do not accept Israeli passports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passport#Countries_that_do_not_accept_Israeli_passports); US recognition of Palestine could help normalize Israeli diplomacy with some of those countries.
1.5.4.1.7.3. Con: Some of the [most powerful countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine)(Among the G20, 9 countries \(Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey\) have recognized Palestine as a state while 10 countries \(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States\) have not.) in the world - many of which are allies of the US - do not recognize Palestine. The US cannot prioritize collateral damage in other countries over their immediate relationships with old allies.
1.5.4.2. Con: US recognition may lead to Israel recognising a Palestinian state and withdrawing from the occupied territories. This would heavily endanger Israeli security.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: US recognition does not entail unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territories would help to reduce tensions in the region and thus contribute to Israel's security.
1.5.4.2.3. Pro: A key Israeli Labor leader, Yigal Allon, author of the Allon plan, has [argued](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-jewish-settlement-in-israel) that "military bases were necessary in the West Bank hill country and along the Jordan River for purposes of defense." Supporting an independent Palestine would mean Israel would have to relinquish those bases.
1.5.4.2.4. Pro: The occupied Golan Heights [provide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268274252_Israeli_Control_of_the_Golan_Heights_High_Strategic_and_Moral_Ground_for_Israel)(p. 9) Israel with "important intelligence gathering capabilities" and are of vital strategic importance.
1.5.4.2.4.1. Pro: The current border along the watershed line – the hills in the Eastern part of the plateau – is the best defense line against a conventional military attack from the east \([p. 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268274252_Israeli_Control_of_the_Golan_Heights_High_Strategic_and_Moral_Ground_for_Israel)\).
1.5.4.2.4.2. Pro: Occupation of the Golan Heights protects the civilians in Haifa from Syrian, Hezbollah and Iranian rocket fire. The Golan Heights also make protection of civilians in the "Finger of the Galilee" possible \([p. 8](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268274252_Israeli_Control_of_the_Golan_Heights_High_Strategic_and_Moral_Ground_for_Israel)\).
1.5.4.2.5. Pro: Israel fears that a military withdrawal from the West Bank could lead to an [Islamist takeover of the area](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/What-would-happen-if-Israel-withdrew-from-the-West-Bank-and-ended-the-siege-of-Gaza-442855), similar to what happened in the Gaza Strip.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Recognition might help Palestine make progress in establishing its own security apparatus that can help to curtail terrorism and other attacks against Israel.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: It has been the consistent opinion of the [government of Israel](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/israel-%20the%20conflict%20and%20peace-%20answers%20to%20frequen.aspx#palestinianstate) that "a truly democratic Palestinian state fully at peace with Israel will promote the long-term security and well-being of Israel as a Jewish state."
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.6.2.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: An organised Palestinian security apparatus may still be antagonistic to Israel, given their history \([p. 40](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/media/csis/pubs/060209_palestforces.pdf)(The short-term prognosis is clearer. Whatever happens, relations\nbetween the Palestinians and Israel will now be more troubled than before. Creating effective Palestinian security forces capable of supporting the peace process will be more difficult, and both sides will show even less trust in the other.)\).
1.5.4.4. Con: Recognizing Palestine will jeopardize the security of Jewish settlers, as Palestine may wish to expel them and the protection offered by the IDF could be restricted.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: Israel [removed](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/18/world/middleeast/tearfully-but-forcefully-israel-removes-gaza-settlers.html?_r=0) Israeli settlers from Gaza when it withdrew in 2005. It can simply do the same now.
1.5.4.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.5.5.3.1.
1.5.4.4.1.2. Pro: Withdrawal of Israeli settlers from occupied territories was regarded as a [strategic decision](https://reliefweb.int/report/israel/why-israel-pulling-out-settlers-gaza-west-bank) that best served Israel's national security. Given that this also aligns with Palestinian interests, such a move can be regarded as a win-win.
1.5.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.
1.5.4.4.3. Con: Settlers are a minor contributor to Israeli opposition to a two-state solution. Surveys indicate that [only 20%](http://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/678) would change their opinion if settlers' security was guaranteed.
1.5.4.4.3.1. Con: That is still a significant portion of the population. Such a rise in support of a two-state solution has the potential of changing the calculus of domestic Israeli politicians.
1.5.4.4.4. Pro: Jewish settlements in the West Bank are [protected](http://www.haaretz.com/idf-soldiers-problem-in-west-bank-isn-t-palestinains-it-s-jews-1.401683) by the Israeli Defense Forces \(IDF\). US recognition could contribute to a partial withdrawal of this defense, thereby endangering these settlements.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Palestinian statehood lies at the center of Hamas' interests. Progress in this direction could lead to a more conciliatory attitude on their behalf.
1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Hamas [was founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#Aims) as a resistance movement against Israel. Less-hostile relations between Israel and Palestine would undermine the raison d'être of Hamas.
1.5.4.5.1.1. Pro: Hamas' ability to militarily resist Israel is dependent on its ability to [operate amongst civilians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/gaza-hamas-fighters-military-bases-guerrilla-war-civilians-israel-idf) in the Gaza Strip. A peace deal may reduce public support for them, as there would no longer be a reason to advocate for militancy.
1.5.4.5.1.2. Con: Israel does not [consider](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170223-hezbollah-and-hamas-are-too-weak-to-fight-says-israel-army-chief/) Hamas capable of putting up a fight at this time; therefore, the significance of reducing their raison d'être is limited.
1.5.4.5.1.3. Con: Without hostilities, both groups would cease to exist unless they pivot to another focal area or purpose.
1.5.4.5.1.4. Pro: Like Hamas, Hezbollah [was founded](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-10814698) as an Islamic resistance movement against Israel and the United States. Improved Israel-Palestine relations would force them to revisit their objectives and demands.
1.5.4.5.1.4.1. Con: Hezbollah does little to threaten Israel or project Iranian power anymore. Its participation in the Syrian civil war has gotten it [stuck in a quagmire](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/04/01/how-has-the-syrian-civil-war-affected-hezbollah-and-what-should-the-u-s-do/).
1.5.4.5.1.4.2. Pro: Hezbollah gained years of active [war experience](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/hezbollah-may-come-out-of-the-syrian-civil-war-stronger-than-ever-d1a72a05f3c4) while fighting the Syrian Civil War and has stockpiled a [huge number of weapons](https://jinsa.org/hezbollahs-missiles/), putting it in a strong position to fight Israel. It would be useful for Israel to placate the group.
1.5.4.5.1.4.3. Con: Hezbollah has stated their [disinterest](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/hezbollah-is-not-interested-in-a-war-with-israel/) in engaging in warfare with Israel.
1.5.4.5.2. Pro: Hamas attacks Israel in order to achieve an independent, sovereign Palestine state. If this is achieved, attacks from Hamas will likely no longer be a concern.
1.5.4.5.2.1. Pro: Hamas [strategically](https://warontherocks.com/2014/07/going-at-it-in-gaza-new-realities-in-an-old-conflict/) attacks Israel when it runs out of money, in an attempt to force an agreement to relax its borders to allow finances to flow in. Recognition would mean lifting the blockade, eliminating the need for Hamas to attack Israel.
1.5.4.5.2.2. Con: Hamas may continue attacks against Israel as [its covenant](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp) calls for the "obliteration" of Israel.
1.5.4.5.3. Con: Meeting Hamas' demands would likely make them less conciliatory. It's equally likely that they would claim their intransigence has paid dividends so far, and demand even more.
1.5.4.5.4. Pro: In the past, Hamas has been willing to negotiate and uphold agreements; the temporary [2008 ceasefire agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_ceasefire) with Israel ended up breaking down after six months due to violations and disagreements on both sides.
1.5.4.5.5. Pro: In 2017, Hamas changed its core doctrine and [recognized](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/hamas-new-charter-palestine-israel-1967-borders) Israel's right to exist by accepting a Palestinian state with 1967 borders.
1.5.4.5.5.1. Con: Hamas recently appointed [Yahya Sinwar](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/middleeast/yehya-sinwar-hamas-gaza.html), a militant hard-liner, as its leader in Gaza. The new announcement by Hamas is not indicative of any moderation in its policies.
1.5.4.5.5.2. Con: The new Hamas announcement stated that "[We shall not waive an inch of the Palestinian home soil](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/2/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders)." This suggests that, although, on paper, Hamas is willing to accept a two-state solution, in reality, it supports something entirely different.
1.5.4.5.5.3. Pro: The document outlining Hamas' revised stance was prepared with [goodwill](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/hamas-new-charter-palestine-israel-1967-borders)(The new document states the Islamist movement it is not seeking war with the Jewish people – only with Zionism that drives the occupation of Palestine.) and a desire to end the ongoing conflict with Israel and within the Palestinian movement.
1.5.4.5.5.3.1. Con: Revisions to Hamas' stance aimed to [de-link](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-05-01/hamas-to-soften-stance-on-israel-muslim-brotherhood-in-policy-document-sources) them from the Muslim Brotherhood to improve ties with Egypt and other Arab states, rather than to demonstrate genuine acceptance of Israel.
1.5.4.5.5.3.2. Pro: The document revising Hamas' stance was instrumental in demonstrating that the [objectives](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/hamas-new-charter-palestine-israel-1967-borders)(Hamas, which wrested control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 from the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority – controlled by Fatah. Since then, all efforts since to reconcile the two Palestinian factions have faltered.\n\nThe new Hamas document essentially brings the two sides closer to the same negotiating objective.) of [Hamas and Fatah](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/10/12/hamas-and-fatah-how-are-the-two-groups-different)(With the release of Hamas’ political document in 2017, the objectives of the two parties are effectively the same – creating a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967.), previously viewed as polarised, can be bridged.
1.5.4.5.5.3.2.1. Con: Hamas' [moderated stance](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/world/middleeast/hamas-fatah-palestinians-document.html?_r=0)(But the Hamas document, which has been leaking for weeks, is less a change in Hamas’s fundamental beliefs than a challenge for the credibility of Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank, as well as internationally.\n\n“Whether it’s a coincidence or it’s connected, I have one thing to say: The Palestinian leadership is afraid of this Hamas moderation,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Al-Azhar University-Gaza. “Because the P.A. and Fatah are afraid that by this moderation, Hamas presents itself as the true representation of the Palestinian people,” he said, referring to the Palestinian Authority.) was an attempt to challenge Fatah over the leadership of the Palestinian people, rather than an acceptance of the two state solution.
1.5.4.5.5.3.2.2. Pro: In the months following the [publication of the charter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/hamas-new-charter-palestine-israel-1967-borders), demonstrating a softer stance from Hamas, former rivals Hamas and Fatah signed a [reconciliation agreement](https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/comments/2017C44_ass.pdf) \(p. 1\).
1.5.5. Pro: Hamas has [stated](https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/10/08/hamas-envisions-west-bank-takeover-destruction-of-israel/) that if Israel were to withdraw, it would takeover the West Bank in order to establish an Islamic state in Palestine. Hamas aggression will likely increase significantly if this were to take place.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.5.2.1.
1.5.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.5.5.3. Pro: When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was taken over by Hamas, which then used the territory to launch [numerous missile attacks](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32053999) on Israeli civilian targets. The same would happen in the case that Israel ends it presence in Palestinian territory.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: From June 2004 to July 2014, 26 Israeli civilians \(four of them minors\) and two foreign nationals were killed in Israel as a [result of rocket and mortar fire](http://www.btselem.org/israeli_civilians/qassam_missiles) by Hamas. This will continue, and may increase, if Israel withdraws.
1.5.5.3.2. Con: Hamas was [forced](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/11/hamas_in_gaza_how_the_organization_beat_fatah_and_took_control_of_the_gaza.html) to take over control of Gaza when President Mahmoud Abbas initially refused to surrender control of the government despite losing elections. This does not have to happen in the West Bank.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Hamas leaders have been outspoken about their objective of establishing a Palestinian state from [the river to the sea](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-2017-document-full)(Palestine, which extends from the River Jordan in the east to the Mediterranean in the west and from Ras al-Naqurah in the north to Umm al-Rashrash in the south, is an integral territorial unit. It is the land and the home of the Palestinian people. The expulsion and banishment of the Palestinian people from their land and the establishment of the Zionist entity therein do not annul the right of the Palestinian people to their entire land and do not entrench any rights therein for the usurping Zionist entity.) as opposed to the Palestinian Authority's support for an agreement based on the 1967 lines.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: Hamas could take over the West Bank and East Jerusalem, preventing access to Jews, as [retaliation](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/israel-limits-access-al-aqsa-compound-attacks-151009043215083.html) for recent Israeli restrictions on Palestinians visiting Al-Aqsa.
1.5.5.4.2. Con: Hamas clearly states [in the charter](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-charter-1637794876) that it opposes the Israeli state as it occupies land that they consider theirs, but do not support discrimination or harm coming to Jewish people. This undermines the assumption that Hamas seeks a harm beyond the removal of Israel.
1.5.5.4.2.1. Con: Most of the world's Jewish Population lives in [Israel](http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/religions/jews)(Jews were largely concentrated in North America \(44%\) and the Middle East-North Africa region \(41%\) in 2010. Most of the remainder of the global Jewish population was found in Europe \(10%\) and the Latin America-Caribbean region \(3%\). In 2050, a majority of the world’s Jews \(51%\) are expected to live in the Middle East and North Africa \(mostly Israel\), while more than a third \(37%\) will live in North America. The share of the global Jewish population living in Europe is projected to decline to less than 8% by 2050.). If violence is used to remove Jews from the state in order to make it something other than a Jewish state, it is not unreasonable to think that this would constitute a Jewish genocide, regardless of the intent.
1.5.5.4.3. Pro: Many believe the slogan ["from the river to the sea"](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/dutch-university-removes-from-the-river-to-the-sea-banner-after-protests-669847) to be a call for genocide.
1.5.5.4.4. Con: Whilst Hamas may have intended the chant in one manner, that is not how it is [interpreted](https://jewishcurrents.org/what-does-from-the-river-to-the-sea-really-mean/)(When Palestinians proclaim “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” many Zionists argue that this is a Palestinian call for genocide. But as historian Maha Nassar has noted, there has never been an “official Palestinian position calling for the forced removal of Jews from Palestine.” The links between this phrase and eliminationism might be the product of “an Israeli media campaign following the 1967 war that claimed Palestinians wished to ‘throw Jews into the sea.'” Jewish groups such as the American Jewish Committee also claim that the slogan is antisemitic because it has been taken up by militant groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Hamas. But as Nassar writes, the phrase predates these uses, and has its origins as “part of a larger call to see a secular democratic state established in all of historic Palestine.”) today by those who sing it.
1.5.5.5. Con: While Hamas makes [aggressive claims](http://www.timesofisrael.com/open-up-gaza-or-it-will-explode-hamas-threatens-israel/) about destroying Israel, this is little more than political rhetoric intended as part of a negotiation strategy known as the ['Madman Theory'](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb517-Nixon-Kissinger-and-the-Madman-Strategy-during-Vietnam-War/). This entails making your opponent believe you are willing to take unrealistic measures \(such as a war of annihilation\) in order to win, despite this being a bluff.
1.5.5.6. Pro: Iran has [pledged](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4676/hamas-west-bank) to turn the West Bank into a launching pad for attacks on Israel, and arm Palestinians in the West Bank.
1.6. Con: Palestinians refuse to recognise Israel as a Jewish state; it is, therefore, hypocritical of them to demand that other actors recognise them as a legitimate state.
1.6.1. Con: Palestinians may not want to recognise Israel as Jewish in order to protect the legitimacy of their claims of religious access to Jerusalem.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Recognition that Israel is Jewish could legitimise Jewish demands for access to the [Temple Mount](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-10-22/long-running-jerusalem-dispute-heats-again), which would violate Islamic religious instruction.
1.6.1.2. Pro: If Israel is recognised as Jewish, then all religious sites within Israel are likely to be recognised as primarily Jewish. This provides a justification for restricting the ability of Muslims to access these sites.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: UNESCO has [criticised](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/10/unesco-controversy-over-jerusalems-holy-sites/504149/) current Israeli policy of restricting access to religious sites for Muslims in Jerusalem. It will only likely further decrease access after recognition of Israel as Jewish.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Many [countries disagreed](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/10/unesco-controversy-over-jerusalems-holy-sites/504149/) with UNESCO's criticism. UNESCO's draft resolution, the source of UNESCO's criticism, received only 24 votes. 26 countries abstained from the vote and an additional six countries, including the United States, voted against it.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: Jews are forbidden from praying at the [Temple Mount](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/furor-temple-mount), even though it is located in Jerusalem.
1.6.1.3. Con: Recognition of a Jewish state doesn't necessarily imply that religious sites within Israel are primarily Jewish.
1.6.2. Con: Accepting the Jewishness of Israel would mean giving up the '[right of return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return)' for the Palestinian refugees who left during the 1948 exodus.
1.6.2.1. Con: The "official" refugee community number is in the millions only because the surrounding [Arab states](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/no-way-home-the-tragedy-of-the-palestinian-diaspora-1806790.html) refuse to grant citizenship to the millions of children and grandchildren born within their borders.
1.6.2.2. Con: The notion of a Palestinian 'right to return' is problematic.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Various groups of people would be entitled to a 'right to return' similar to that requested by Palestinians. Yet, they either don't claim it or don't have it recognized. It would be illegitimate to acknowledge Palestinian claims because of this.
1.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Millions of Germans in Eastern Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_\(1944–1950\)) were expelled to Germany after World War II, but their explusion does not entitle them to a right of return.
1.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: [Hundreds of thousands of Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries) were [expelled](http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-refugees-from-arab-lands-seek-justice-at-united-nations/) from Arab nations and many found a new home in Israel. These refugees have not been given a right of return to their homelands by Arab states, so it is hypocritical to demand that for Palestinian refugees.
1.6.2.2.1.3. Pro: Many [ethnic Greeks and Turkish peoples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey) could demand a right to return similar to the Palestinians. Yet, they do not.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: The 'right to return' [does not exist](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-68161-8_7) in contemporary international law as Palestinians would wish it to be recognised.
1.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: Being a victim of the injustice of expulsion does not necessarily grant the right to resettle in native lands.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Up to [8 million](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4184/palestinian-refugees-return) Palestinian refugees wish to return to Israel, and strongly condemned Mahmoud Abbas's suggestion of giving up their right to return.
1.6.2.4. Pro: If this right to return is given up, up to 450,000 Palestinian refugees would be [forced](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3770/lebanon-apartheid-laws) to continue to live in inhumane conditions in Lebanese refugee camps.
1.6.2.5. Con: Palestinian refugees do not have a clear right of return to Israel \([p. 1](http://arizonajournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Kramernote.pdf)(Meanwhile, the Israelis assert that Palestinians do not have a right of return under international law, or if there is a right, it does not apply to the case of the Palestinian refugees. Moreover, the various international law sources that purport to embody a Palestinian right of return are often ambiguous and open to different interpretations.)\).
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: [Jewish leadership](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2011/11/israel_and_1948_did_israel_plan_to_expel_its_arabs_in_1948_or_not_.html) did not plan to expel Arabs from the state-to-be of Israel; rather, that was the consequence of outbreak of violence between Arabs and Jews. As a result, the state of Israel bears no responsibility for Palestinians refugees.
1.6.2.5.1.1. Con: Some believe that the 1948 Palestinian exodus was the result of a planned ethnic cleansing implemented by Zionist leaders through systematic expulsions of villages and terrorist attacks against civilians \([p. 15-16](https://yplus.ps/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Pappe-Ilan-The-Ethnic-Cleansing-of-Palestine.pdf)(‘The military campaign against the Arabs, including the “conquest and destruction of the rural areas” was set forth in the Hagana’s Plan Dalet’.5 The aim of the plan was in fact the destruction of both the\nrural and urban areas of Palestine.\nAs the first chapters of this book will attempt to show, this plan was both the inevitable product of the Zionist ideological impulse to have an exclusively Jewish presence in Palestine, and a response to developments on the ground once the British cabinet had decided to end the mandate. Clashes with local Palestinian militias provided the perfect context and pretext for implementing the ideological vision of an ethnically cleansed Palestine. The Zionist policy was first based on retaliation against Palestinian attacks in February 1947, and it transformed into an initiative to ethnically cleanse the country as a whole in March 1948.)\).
1.6.2.5.1.2. Pro: The refugee crisis was caused by the Arab [invasion of Israel](https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/palestinian-refugees) in 1948. Therefore, the respective Arab states are responsible for solving the crisis.
1.6.2.5.1.3. Pro: Many of the Palestinian Arabs who fled during the Arab invasion in 1948 did so [voluntarily](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/glossary-terms/palestinian-refugees) to avoid the ongoing war or at the urging of Arab leaders who promised that all who left would return after a quick Arab victory over the new Jewish state.
1.6.2.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.3.
1.6.2.5.2. Con: In 1978, the UN ruled that Palestinians have a [right to return](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/805C731452035912852569D1005C1201) and enshrined this concept in [Resolution 149](https://www.unrwa.org/content/resolution-194).
1.6.2.6. Con: Even if a right to return for Palestinian refugees did exist, granting it would threaten Jewish culture within Israel and their national security because Palestinian refugees \([7 million](https://www.afsc.org/resource/palestinian-refugees-and-right-return)\) outnumber the number of Jews in Israel \([6.7 million](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/number-of-jews-in-israel-and-worldwide-on-the-rise-reports-603033)\).
1.6.3. Con: The recognition of the Jewish character of a state and the recognition of the legitimacy of a state are not equivalent.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Recognizing a state as solely belonging to a religious or ethnic group is exclusionary and unnecessary.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The Palestinian Authority [fears](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/arab-league-rejects-israel-as-jewish-state-201439161231209704.html) calling Israel a Jewish State will both increase and legitimise discrimination of Israel's Arab population.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Not recognizing Israel as a Jewish state is meant to protect the rights of [the quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel) of Israel's population that is not Jewish.
1.6.3.1.1.2. Con: Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state does not compromise the rights of Arab citizens in Israel \([p. 1](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus108.pdf)\).
1.6.3.1.2. Con: It is possible to be a Jewish state and still protect non-Jewish minorities.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Zeev Jabotinsky, one of the early Zionist leaders, was outspoken on minority protection \([p. 16](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/media/3372)\).
1.6.3.1.2.2. Pro: Israeli law, including the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.knesset.gov.il/docs/eng/megilat_eng.htm), highlights that the state will "ensure complete equality \[...\] to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion".
1.6.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Supreme Court of Israel in CA 6698/95 made it clear that discrimination against non-Jews is illegal \([p. 27](https://supremedecisions.court.gov.il/Home/Download?path=EnglishVerdicts%5C95%5C980%5C066%5Ca14&fileName=95066980_a14.txt&type=4)\).
1.6.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Just because discrimination is illegal does not mean it does not exist.
1.6.3.1.2.3. Con: Israel was created by uprooting and re-settling more than [half a million](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/why-jewish-state-demand-non-star-20144814244225761.html) Palestinians. This weakens the argument that minority protection is part of Israel's foundation.
1.6.3.1.3. Con: Israel is a Jewish state in that it is designed to be a safe homeland for Jews throughout the world, not in that it is a state exclusively for Jews.
1.6.3.1.4. Pro: Other countries do not require other states to recognize their affiliation with a certain religion.
1.6.3.1.4.1. Con: Israel is unique because it was founded as [a Jewish state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) in response to thousands of years of global anti-Semitism that culminated in the Holocaust.
1.6.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: To [fulfill its founding purpose](https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Anti-Semitism-in-medieval-Europe), Israel must remain a Jewish state. Therefore, Israel can legitimately demand of other nations that they recognise its right to remain a Jewish state.
1.6.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: Israelis highly value state recognition as they saw themselves opposed by a coalition of states that had previously attacked them with the [explicit goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#The_Arab_League_as_a_whole) of erasing them from the map.
1.6.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: Anti-Semitism is widespread and increasing in [Europe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46439194), [US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/10/27/american-anti-semitism-its-getting-worse/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.638e4d607cce), [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/01/antisemitic-incidents-in-uk-at-all-time-high), and [Canada](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/anti-semitism-becoming-mainstream-in-canada-jewish-advocacy-group-1.3880593) and [around the world](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5074067,00.html), all of which make having a safe haven for Jews necessary.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4. Con: The demand for recognition as a Jewish state is new and surfaced only recently at the Annapolis Conference of [2007](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/05/25/should-the-palestinians-recognize-israel-as-a-jewish-state/).
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The demand to recognize Israel as a Jewish state is a [delaying tactic](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/05/25/should-the-palestinians-recognize-israel-as-a-jewish-state/) used by Israel.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: Most countries [delay their recognition](https://academic.oup.com/fpa/article/14/3/367/2625552)(A large number of states, including many located in the global south, can be found in the middle ground, seeking to balance and mantle their positions and often delaying the decision to recognize Kosovo.) of other fledgling states in order to balance their arguments and come up with a decision.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: There is [evidence](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.569459) that it was invented by Netanyahu to stymie peace processes with the Palestinians.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.2. Con: The Zionist program, adopted at the [First Zionist Congress in Basel in 1897](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/first-zionist-congress-and-basel-program-1897), specified that the “aim of Zionism is to create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine, secured by public law.” This indicates that it is not feasible to separate Israel from its Jewish nature.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: [The Jewish State](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-jewish-state-quot-theodor-herzl), written by Theodor Herzl, is considered to be the foundational text of the Zionist movement and the creation of Israel. Thus, from the beginning, Israel was conceptualised as a Jewish state and should, therefore, be recognised as such.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.3. Con: Historically, [external](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-balfour-declaration) [actors](http://www.mythsandfacts.org/conflict/mandate_for_palestine/mandate_for_palestine.htm) have [recognised](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/text-of-the-peel-commission-report) the [need](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/7F0AF2BD897689B785256C330061D253) for a Jewish state. This later became Israel.
1.6.3.1.4.1.4.4. Con: [Israel's Declaration of Independence](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx) states that Israel is a Jewish state, making it clear that this is a key aspect of the state's foundational identity.
1.6.3.1.4.2. Pro: In countries like [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Yemen), majority of the citizens are Muslim; yet, they do not call for international recognition as an Islamic state.
1.6.3.1.4.3. Con: Iran is generally referred to as the "Islamic Republic of Iran", even in the list of [UN member states](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states#gotoI).
1.6.3.1.4.4. Pro: A [variety of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_references_to_God) associate themselves with a certain religion through their constitution; yet, they usually do not call for international recognition of this association.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Palestinians are asking only for recognition of Palestine as a state, not as a Muslim state. Therefore, their refusal to recognise Israel as a Jewish state is not hypocritical.
1.6.4. Pro: Recognizing Israel would directly confer strategic benefits on Palestine while also indirectly dispelling any accusations of hypocrisy from the internal community.
1.6.4.1. Con: Israel uses its claim as a Jewish state to [block](https://www.thenational.ae/the-loaded-terms-israel-uses-to-justify-its-inflexible-stance-1.334411) a peace deal with Palestinians.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Israel is a [de jure state](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/united-states-grants-de-jure-recognition-to-israel), and [Palestine depends](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/palestinian-economic-dependence-israel) on Israel at the moment; it would, therefore, be counterintuitive for them to not recognize Israel.
1.6.4.3. Pro: By refusing to recognize Israel's right to exist, Palestine positions itself in opposition to many of its \(potential\) international supporters. This is likely to harm the Palestinian economy and society, as they are [highly dependent](http://www.themedialine.org/featured/international-aid-lifeline-palestinian-economy/) on other nations.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Palestine opposing Israel's right to exist puts Germany in a problematic position vis-à-vis its support for Palestine. In the words of [Angela Merkel](https://knesset.gov.il/description/eng/doc/speech_merkel_2008_eng.pdf), her country has a "special historical responsibility for Israel's security" which "will never be open to negotiation" \(p. 6\).
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: Opposing Israel's right to exist complicates relations with the US, whose presidents, such as [Barack Obama](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/obama-stresses-safety-israelis-self-determination-palestinians-flna1c9000752)(And the president used a Hebrew phrased to express the overwhelming theme of the speech: “Ah-tem lo lah-vahd.” This means, “You \[Israel\] are not alone.”), have extended their support to Israel.
1.6.4.3.3. Con: The right to exist is a concept alien to [international law](https://theconversation.com/israel-has-no-right-to-exist-and-neither-does-any-other-state-1668)(The problem with such a demand is that no such abstract “right to exist” can be found in international law or in any serious theory of international relations.\n\nTo put it succinctly, a “right to exist” does not exist for states. Nor does such a right exist in practice.), therefore Palestine cannot be punished through legal means.
1.6.4.4. Con: Asking Palestinians to accept Israel's right to exist equals asking Palestinians [to accept as justified](https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html) what has been done to them over the course of the past decades.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: Accepting Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state does not constitute accepting that all Israeli actions are acceptable.
1.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: Accepting Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state could be seen as a way to acknowledge the reality and legitimacy of Israel's existence and as desire for a future where both nations can exist in peace.
1.6.4.4.1.2. Con: Israel [uses](https://www.thenational.ae/the-loaded-terms-israel-uses-to-justify-its-inflexible-stance-1.334411) its claim to the land of Palestine to normalise settlements on Palestinian territory and legitimise unjust actions. Acknowledging Israel as a Jewish state would [entail](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2011/9/30/why-israel-cant-be-a-jewish-state/) accepting this.
1.6.4.4.2. Pro: For many Palestinians, the existence of Israel is necessarily predicated on the [1948 expulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus) of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
1.6.4.4.2.1. Con: Palestinians would have had no reason to flee Israel, where they were a protected minority, had Israel not been simultaneously [invaded](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/arab-israeli-war) by every one of its Arab neighbours in 1948.
1.6.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.
1.6.4.4.4. Con: Much of the harmful actions that the Israeli state has taken against Palestinians have been justified by citing [general security concerns](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/04/israel-50-years-occupation-abuses), not by citing its claims to the land.
1.6.4.4.4.1. Pro: If recognizing the Jewish state acknowledges or affirms Israeli atrocities or injustices committed against Palestinians, then recognizing the Palestinian state would affirm Palestinian atrocities and injustices committed against Israel.
1.6.4.4.4.1.1. Con: Israel can be charged for state-sponsored crimes. However, this is not the case with Palestine, which is currently not recognized as a state.
1.6.4.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: The Palestinian Authority has [control only over a part of the land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority#/media/File:Zones_A_and_B_in_the_occupied_palestinian_territories.svg), and [Israel already punishes](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/israel-collective-punishment-jerusalem-attack-170110084017716.html) those even suspected of violence and their families in Israel, in the West Bank, and Gaza.
1.6.4.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: No external authority has ever held Israel accountable for its state-sponsored crimes.
1.6.4.4.4.2. Con: Resistance to military occupation is a [humanitarian right](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/b0d5f4c1f4b8102041256739003e6366/6c86520d7efad527c12563cd0051d63c), not a crime.
1.6.4.4.4.2.1. Con: The Geneva convention does not grant anybody the right to attack civilians or put civilians in danger through illegal actions. A war crime is a war crime.
1.6.4.4.4.2.2. Con: This claim falsely assumes that resistance to military occupation is all that Palestians are guilty of in relation to atrocities committed against Israel.
1.6.4.4.4.2.2.1. Pro: In the war of 1948, Palestinian Arabs openly and proudly sought the [total annihilation](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/background-and-overview-israel-war-of-independence) of the Jews.
1.6.4.4.4.3. Con: Violence as a means of alleviating personally-perceived fear is not a legitimate argument.
1.6.4.4.5. Pro: Recognition by many other nations is a sufficient condition for a state to be legitimate. Therefore, Palestinian recognition of Israel has no positive effects on Israel, but strengthens Israel's position in relation to already occupied land, its general approach to the Palestinian people, and potential war crimes.
1.6.5. Con: Other states have not recognised Israel as a Jewish state, or been asked to, yet the US does not refuse to recognise those states.
1.6.5.1. Con: Most other states are not proximate to Israel or heavily involved with Israel geopolitically, so whether they recognise Israel or not is mostly irrelevant. The same is not true for Palestine.
1.6.5.2. Con: It would be difficult for the US to withdraw its recognition of established states. In contrast to that, it is easy to reject the recognition of a disputed state.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Several major American allies, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as states that receive large amounts of US support, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, [do not recognize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel) Israel either.
1.6.5.4. Pro: The demand for recognition as a Jewish state was not included in the treaties with [Jordan](http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/peacetreaty.html) or [Egypt](http://www.mfa.gov.eg/Lists/Treaties%20DB/Attachments/645/Peace%20Treaty_en.pdf), though - like Palestine - they exist in close proximity to Israel and have histories of antagonism.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: Jordan and Israel have [some strong economic incentives](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4364003,00.html)(First-of-its-kind cooperation\n\nA similar way is made by goods imported from Turkey and neighboring countries to Jordan and Iraq, which arrive at the port on ships. The vessels unload their cargo there, and the merchandise is taken by trucks to the Jordan River Crossing on its way to Jordan and Iraq.\n\nAccording to estimates, the goods transported through Israel are worth tens of millions of dollars a month.) to put aside their differences; international recognition of a Jewish state is not a priority for Israel.
1.6.5.4.2. Pro: The Egypt-Israel peace accord was [signed in 1979](https://web.archive.org/web/20110903011255/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Camp%20David%20Accords); recognition of a Jewish state is a demand that came much later.
1.6.5.4.3. Con: Jordan and Egypt are [more powerful](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/egypt-iraq-jordan-alliance-tries-to-change-middle-east-dynamics/) regional players than Palestine. Israel likely opted against demanding the pair to recognize Israel as a Jewish state in order to remain on good terms with them.
1.6.5.5. Pro: The Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state is backed by the [Arab League](http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.578785).
1.6.5.6. Con: All nations have rivals, and some may choose not to recognize another over a political spat; one country refusing to recognize Palestine does not justify others following suit.
1.6.5.6.1. Pro: [Armenia and Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Azerbaijan_relations) do not recognize each other due to border conflicts; [Morocco and Algeria](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20210826-explainer-why-did-algeria-cut-diplomatic-ties-with-morocco) have had political spats leading them to cut diplomatic ties with one another. Neither case is cause for the rest of the world to stop recognizing any of the countries involved.
1.6.5.7. Con: Most other states have not rejected the right of Israel to exist, even if they do not recognise it as Jewish. The context of their relationship with Israel is thus different.
1.6.5.7.1. Con: Iranian leaders have rejected Israel's right to exist [on numerous occasions](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/Iranian-View-of-Israel/387085/), going so far as to describe it as Iran's mission to erase Israel from the map.
1.6.6. Pro: PLO chief Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly pledged that he will [not recognize Israel](http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-fiery-speech-abbas-rejects-jerusalem-concessions/)(“I say, listen, listen, the Palestinian people won’t kneel, and we tell the world, listen, listen the Palestinian people won’t kneel,” he said at one point, drawing chants of “Abu Mazen, Abu Mazen.”\n\n“Without east Jerusalem as a capital of the state of Palestine, there will be no peace between us and Israel,” Abbas said.\n\nAbbas also reiterated that he will not recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people. Netanyahu has raised such a demand, and there is growing expectation that it will be included in Kerry’s proposal.\n\n“We will not recognize it,” Abbas said. “We will not accept and it’s our right not to recognize the Jewish state.”) as a Jewish state, meaning he will never recognize Israel in full.
1.6.6.1. Pro: The [PLO's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Palestine) [true aim](https://www.ajc.org/translatehate/From-the-River-to-the-Sea) is to subsume all of mandatory Palestine into a Palestinian state.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: PLO's [emblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization) suggests that the desired state is the entirety of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Palestine).
1.6.7. Pro: One of the two former Prime Ministers of the Palestinian National Authority, Ismail Haniyeh, [pledged](http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-official-denies-group-could-recognize-israel/) that he will not recognise Israel.
