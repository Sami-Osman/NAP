Discussion Name: The United States of America would be better off with a parliamentary system of government

1. The United States of America would be better off with a parliamentary system of government
1.1. Pro: The current system of government stimulates lobby formation.
1.1.1. Pro: There is a [heavy influence of lobbying](https://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Lobbying-the-political-influence-in-USA_a3505.html) prior to the Presidential elections in the US.
1.1.2. Pro: These lobbies have a [direct influence](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/the-u-s-political-system/) on future legislation against the support they promise to potential candidates.
1.2. Con: In a parliamentary system, the voters have no control over who is going to be their chief executive.
1.2.1. Con: The public still vote for politicians who decide the chief executive. Therefore, the people have a great degree of say in it.
1.2.2. Con: While it’s true that in a parliamentary system citizens don’t elect their head of state directly, this is not a valid Con and doesn’t negate the premise because it fails to demonstrate that systems of government without direct elections of heads of state are inherently bad.
1.2.3. Pro: Despite voters being unable to directly choose their chief executive, a [prime minister](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpolcon/writev/842/m2.htm) \(or equivalent\) has a number of additional powers and responsibilities, making them a particularly important political figure for the country.
1.2.3.1. Pro: It is concerning for voters to have so many powers and responsibilities lying with a representative that they may have had no say \(vote\) in electing.
1.2.3.2. Con: Voters arguably have more opportunities to voice their opinions on the choice of prime minister in a parliamentary system than its alternatives.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: In a parliamentary system, voters can give their opinions on the candidates during leadership races of major political parties. A candidate's popularity in society is an important consideration given the possibility to affect the party's electoral results.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: While voters outside the party leaders' constituencies do not directly vote on the election of the prime minister, their votes determine the makeup of the parliament which determines the government formation and choice of prime minister.
1.2.4. Con: Technically, the USA does not have a [directly elected chief executive](https://www.usa.gov/election#:~:text=In%20the%20Electoral%20College%20system,\(270\)%20wins%20the%20election.).
1.3. Con: The US system of government, grounded in the Constitution of 1787, works very well. It incorporates a carefully designed system of checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government, and federalism among the national government and the states
1.4. Con: The federal system allows greater freedom than a parliamentary system for individual states to differ in their policy and legislation.
1.4.1. Pro: There is wide consensus that the USA contains a [divided](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/11/the-dangerously-unified-states-of-america/) set of states. Under a federal system, a unified state of divided opinions has been better facilitated than it would under a more centralized parliamentary system.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Many parliamentary states have had to contend with [separatist movements](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/oct/27/beyond-catalonia-pro-independence-movements-in-europe-map) from regions that feel divided from the views of the majority \(and thus un-represented\).
1.4.2. Con: It would be possible to build a parliamentary system that still allows for regional differences in law and policy.
1.4.2.1. Pro: In the UK, the individual regions \(e.g. [Scotland](http://50shadesoffederalism.com/case-studies/how-autonomous-is-scotland-today-the-economic-and-fiscal-perspective/)\) have increasingly accessed independent power on local law and policy.
1.5. Con: The separation of powers\(one of the founding principles of modern republics\) does not exist in a parliamentary system, since the chief executive is a creation of the legislative power.
1.5.1. Con: The separation of powers is not a fundamental prerequisite for a functioning democracy.
1.5.2. Pro: This system was carefully designed to limit the power of any one [branch of power](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_powers_0) within the USA.
1.5.2.1. Con: While the separation of powers may have been designed to fulfil a role of 'checks and balances', in the modern context, it is not fulfilling that duty.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Under the Trump presidency, many fear that the separation of powers and the checks and balances designed within the branches of power have been consistently [eroded](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/checks-and-balances-trump-has-swept-away/606013/).
1.6. Pro: In a Parliamentary system, the leader stays in charge only as long as he or she can keep the support of the majority of the Parliament. So, if members realise that they have made a ghastly mistake; or if a leader starts showing undesirable characteristics, an impeachment process doesn't need to happen. They just turf them out, on a vote of “No Confidence”.
1.6.1. Pro: In this system, the ability to hold motions of no confidence allows a much greater level of accountability. Without accountability, the choice voters have during an election is rendered less meaningful: they are unable to retract their vote at a later date, but they should still have a voice in their government.
1.6.2. Con: An alternative to changing entirely to a new system of government would be creating an easier route to impeachment, or strengthening other forms of accountability within the current system of government.
1.7. Pro: The democrats and republicans turned the american political system into something entirely different from its original purpose.
