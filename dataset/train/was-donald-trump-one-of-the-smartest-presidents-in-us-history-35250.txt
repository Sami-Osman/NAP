Discussion Name: Was Donald Trump one of the smartest presidents in US history?

1. Donald Trump was one of the most intelligent presidents in [US history](https://www.rd.com/culture/presidents-with-the-highest-iq-scores/).
1.1. Pro: Trump's legislative and policy accomplishments outweigh those of most other presidents.
1.1.1. Pro: Trump made the US energy [independent](https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2020/09/under-president-trump-america-is-energy-independent-opinion.html).
1.1.1.1. Con: Something happening while a particular individual is president does not necessarily mean that individual did something to achieve that result.
1.1.2. Con: Anyone with that amount of power, by virtue of being the President, is capable of achieving a lot.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Over time, the powers of the US President have been [increased](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/a-broken-office/556883/) by Congress.
1.1.2.2. Con: In most cases, presidents [do not invariably have the power](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_american-government-and-politics-in-the-information-age/s17-02-how-presidents-get-things-done.html) to achieve a lot.
1.1.3. Con: Trump had no regard for diplomacy, thus limiting his foreign policy achievements.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Trump has alienated and insulted many traditional allies, such as Germany, Britain, and South Korea. [Confidence in American leadership has measurably declined](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-world-more-confident-in-china-leadership-than-us-2019-6?r=US&IR=T) as a result of his leadership.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Trump was unable to achieve the same diplomatic achievements as presidents like Obama, Clinton, or even Nixon.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Trump's attempt to open relations with North Korea [failed](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/insights/27952/why-trump-s-north-korea-missile-and-nuclear-diplomacy-failed).
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: By contrast, Obama was able to [open relations with Iran](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/smart-facts/what-iran-nuclear-deal-n868346), a country similarly antagonistic towards the US.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: By "open relations" he just gave them [money](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/477666-obama-should-apologize-for-shameful-cash-payment-to-iran).
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger began [diplomatic discussions with China](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-39342190) during both the Cold War and the peak of the Vietnam War.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Con: Trump was the [first sitting US president to meet his North Korean counterpart](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/trumps-foreign-policy-moments) in a 2018 summit.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Trump scuttled Obama's engagement with Cuba on the basis of spurious allegations of Cuba "[supporting terrorism](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/11/cuba-us-sponsor-terrorism-blacklist-sanctions-trump)".
1.1.3.2.3. Con: Trump did not start any wars during his term.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: Even though Trump did not start any wars, he also did not [end any](https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/how-many-wars-did-trump-start-and-end).
1.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Starting wars is [costly](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic), therefore Trump's decision to not start one was a smart move.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: In 2020, just the wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq cost the United States federal government around [$6.4 trillion](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic).
1.1.3.2.3.2.2. Con: Military spending on wars creates a lot of [jobs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/how-military-spending-affects-economy.asp), which would solve the [problem of unemployment](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-09-12/U-S-falling-unemployment-rate-hides-a-deeper-problem--TIBq1neX96/index.html) in the United States.
1.1.3.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Health care and energy conservation create [50% more jobs](https://www.facingsouth.org/2011/12/is-military-spending-good-for-creating-jobs.html) than military spending.
1.1.3.3. Con: The Trump administration successfully negotiated a set of peace agreements between Israel and several of its neighbors.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: These agreements lead Egypt, the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco to [normalize relations with Israel](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55266089).
1.1.3.3.2. Con: These peace agreements are, at best, meaningless political theater and, at worse, likely to destabilize the regions they purport to protect.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: These agreements are seen as betrayals by many within [Palestine](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/palestinians-israel-biden-abbas-netanyahu-trump-peace/).
1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: These agreements may make Iran feel more surrounded and thus [more likely to retaliate](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/trumps-israel-arab-peace-deal.html).
1.1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Trump's agreement with Morocco may [reignite the conflict](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/world/middleeast/western-sahara-morocco-polisario.html) between Morocco and Algeria.
1.1.3.3.2.4. Con: Many of the countries Trump negotiated with refused to even [recognize the existence of Israel](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54124996). These deals open up the room for other Arab states to recognize and start negotiating with Israel.
1.1.4. Pro: Trump was the first US president to establish the [United States Space Force \(USSF\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force), a force to protect the US military's assets in space.
1.1.4.1. Con: Before the creation of USSF, the idea of a military in space was [an idea for a comedy show](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/06/09/challenged-netflix-show-us-space-force-rushes-trademark-name.html) making fun of the idea based on how militant America is.
1.1.4.2. Con: The projected cost of the United States Space Force \(USSF\) for the first five years is [$2 billion](https://www.defensenews.com/space/2019/03/01/space-force-to-cost-2-billion-include-15000-personnel-in-first-five-years/). With an economy [under debt](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/charting-america-united-states-debt/), this expenditure is not a smart move.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Outer space is quickly becoming a theater for [geopolitical conflict](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/09/05/review-war-in-space/). Trump's decision gives the US an advantage.
1.1.5. Pro: Trump [signed the First Step Act into law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), which seeks to reform the criminal justice system by addressing mass incarcerations at the federal level.
1.1.5.1. Con: There is no major sentencing reform, further causing overcrowding and leading to inadequate and over strained prisons.
1.1.5.2. Con: It does nothing about mass incarceration and even [helps private prisons](https://theintercept.com/2018/12/22/first-step-act-corecivic-private-prisons/), meaning that this reform bill does little to ameliorate the situation.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: It [fails to reduce the number of people going to prison](https://equaljusticeunderlaw.org/thejusticereport/2018/8/21/the-first-step-act-a-pros-and-cons-list#:~:text=The%20FIRST%20STEP%20Act%20ignores,directly%20contributes%20to%20overcrowded%20prisons.) and, as a result, acts only as a stopgap measure.
1.1.5.3. Pro: In comparison, all other presidents only made [promises for reforming the criminal justice system](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/criminal-justice-reform).
1.1.6. Con: A smart president would not waste resources, yet Trump often did.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Trump [removed the U.S. pandemic supply program](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-cuts-programs-responsible-for-fighting-coronavirus-2020-2?r=US&IR=T) to ["save money" even though those funds could have been used for the Covid-19 crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus).
1.1.6.2. Pro: Building a wall on the border between Mexico and the US is a [waste](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/01/08/analysis-economists-say-border-wall-is-a-waste-of-money/) because we should allow [free movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law).
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Freedom of Movement under the Privileges and Immunities clause only applies to interstate travel. It cannot apply to international travel or immigration because the U.S. Constitutition does not have authority in other countries and because the Privileges and Immunities clause, by which Freedom of movement is governed, explicitly only applies to the States: "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."
1.1.6.2.2. Con: Violent gang members and [human traffickers](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218462.pdf) cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico, stealing Mexican children from their parents and putting U.S. citizens in danger. The border is too long to effectively guard or police. The wall is a matter of safety.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: The US-Mexico border wall is estimated to cost [over $11 billion](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/19/797319968/-11-billion-and-counting-trumps-border-wall-would-be-the-world-s-most-costly), which is expensive.
1.1.6.2.4. Pro: A border wall would fail to stop any significant amount of illegal immigration and would thus be a large waste of federal money.
1.1.6.2.4.1. Pro: Most 'illegal' immigrants [overstay their visas](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/real-immigration-crisis-people-overstaying-their-visas/587485/) rather than illicitly crossing the southern border.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Large scale mismanagement of resources is foolish because it [harms](https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/mismanagement-natural-resources-gives-us-no-margin-error-handle-increasingly-unpredictable-climate) the economy.
1.1.6.4. Con: If people back wasteful projects because they support the principle behind them, then it is politically smart for Trump to advance them regardless.
1.1.6.5. Con: All Presidents have wasted resources to varying degrees. Therefore, Trump can be one of the most intelligent presidents while wasting resources.
1.1.6.5.1. Pro: Obama has wasted quite a significant proportion of resources in unsuccessful military interventions \[[1](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/16/11244980/obama-syria-policy)\] \[[2](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2019-02-18/obamas-libya-debacle)\].
1.1.6.6. Con: Trump used resources cleverly to fulfill his objectives.
1.1.6.6.1. Pro: Donald Trump has [reduced the efficiency of the mailing system \(USPS\) to help prevent the election](https://www.nj.com/news/2020/08/yes-your-mail-is-being-delayed-heres-whats-happening-inside-us-post-offices-in-nj.html), thus indicating his ability to use resources effectively.
1.1.6.6.1.1. Con: Doing this also can harm other important legal services too, even if Trump wishes to stay in office.
1.1.7. Pro: Trump achieved great economic successes in the first three years of his presidency.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Trump stopped China's [unfair trade policies](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/the-us-china-trade-war-a-timeline/).
1.1.7.2. Con: Much of Trump's economic policies failed to spread benefits to many Americans.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Most of the business relief checks that Trump has been providing [have been going towards Fortune-500 companies, which can survive off of their current funds](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/20/how-shake-shack-potbelly-and-ruths-chris-got-small-business-loans.html), rather than weaker, local companies which are worst hit by the pandemic.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: Trump has made efforts to boost investments within the US economy by [reducing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%](https://www.businessinsider.com/tax-foundation-report-says-gop-tax-bill-will-boost-economy-but-still-fall-short-2017-12?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=msn-slideshow&utm_campaign=bodyurl), the [lowest in the past 50 years](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/corporate-tax-rate).
1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Reducing the corporate tax rate benefits corporations at the expense of ordinary, tax-paying Americans.
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.1.7.3. Pro: In each of his first three years, the [US GDP grew by about 2.5%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430).
1.1.7.4. Pro: [56%](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-30/trump-s-economy-really-was-better-than-obama-s) of US voters said their families were better off after three years of Trump.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: The basis of any rational argument or opinion must be within the opinion itself, and not how many people support it/approve of it.
1.1.7.5. Con: Trump largely [inherited](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/data-show-trump-didn-t-build-great-economy-he-inherited-n1237793) the strong economy built by Obama.
1.2. Con: Donald Trump has not been a smart businessman.
1.2.1. Con: Trump had a good eye for real estate business opportunities.
1.2.1.1. Pro: In 1976, Trump negotiated a lucrative real estate deal when he invested in the [Commodore Hotel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35836623) in New York City.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Trump's apparent success developing the Commodore Hotel - subsequently renamed Grand Hyatt New York - is largely [attributable to his father](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/why-donald-trump-isn-t-the-successful-businessman-he-claims-to-be-us-elections-republican-politics-7173666.html) who called in financial favours from the bank.
1.2.1.2. Con: Trump established his casino empire by borrowing money at such [high interest rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html) that they had almost no chance to succeed.
1.2.1.3. Con: Donald Trump's resorts have consistently experienced losses.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Since 2000, Mr. Trump has reported losses of [$315.6 million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html) at the golf courses that are his prized possessions.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: For all of its Trump world allure, his Washington hotel, which opened in 2016, has not been a success: its tax records show losses through 2018 of [$55.5 million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html).
1.2.2. Pro: Prior to his inauguration, Trump had been involved in [3,500 lawsuits](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/), mostly in a business capacity.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Compared to [five similar real-estate business executives](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/), this was more legal skirmishes than all five combined.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Trump's [numerous lawsuits](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/) have proven to be extremely costly for his businesses.
1.2.2.3. Con: In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump [won in 451](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/282008-trump-brags-about-winning-record-in-lawsuits) and lost in just 38. This shows that his legal position was usually justified.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: There are still [hundreds of cases](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/) involving Trump where there is no clear resolution in the public record. Therefore, Trump's 'win' rate may be appreciably lower than this.
1.2.3. Con: Donald Trump's impressive net worth is evidence of his business skill.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Between May 31, 2018, and July 16, 2018, Trump was able to raise his net worth [from $2.48 billion to $3.8 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump#FEC_filings_and_debt).
1.2.3.2. Pro: Donald Trump's show, [The Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_\(American_TV_series\)), was extremely successful.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Being a successful actor is not proof of someone's business skill.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Trump made around [$214 million](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/donald-trump-rich/) from the show.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Trump was initially very skeptical about the show and [doubted it would be successful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-fierce-will-to-win-pushed-donald-trump-to-the-top/2017/01/17/6b36c2ce-c628-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html). His failure to predict his own success may represent a lack of business acumen.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: A significant part of the show's success had nothing to do with Trump.
1.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: The concept, production and promotion of The Apprentice was primarily the work of [Mark Burnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Burnett), and thus he deserves most of the credit.
1.2.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Mark Burnett is credited with turning Trump into an "[icon of American success](https://qz.com/1509496/donald-trump-was-probably-duped-in-his-first-meeting-with-mark-burnett/)" whereas, before, his poor business acumen was a local punch line.
1.2.3.3. Con: Much of Trump's wealth was [inherited from his father](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/trump-family-wealth.html), Fred Trump.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Inherited wealth meant Trump could easily begin investing and buying property from a young age.
1.2.4. Pro: Many of Donald Trump's businesses have failed.
1.2.4.1. Con: [Trump has about 500 businesses open](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/a-look-at-donald-trump-s-worldwide-business-ties-500-companies-in-about-20-countries-1.3236357?). Thus, saying that many have failed is an overstatement.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Many of these 500 businesses are [not in operation and are just shells](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/a-look-at-donald-trump-s-worldwide-business-ties-500-companies-in-about-20-countries-1.3236357?) set up to provide Trump with legal and tax protection.
1.2.4.2. Pro: By 1990, Trump's businesses had accumulated a [debt of $3.4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html). As a result, regulators warned that the Trump Organization could suffer complete financial collapse.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Trump's debt has decreased since the [1990s](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-financial-troubles-taxes-1990s). This shows that he has become more business smart compared to the past.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: As of [May 2016](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/guide-donald-trump-debt/), Trump's debt stood at $2.7 billion.
1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: Trump was only able to decrease his debt by [taking loans from his family](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-financial-troubles-taxes-1990s).
1.2.4.2.1.3. Con: Trump's debt decreased when offered the [Atlantic City casino stock publicly](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-financial-troubles-taxes-1990s). Since this meant a loss of control over the organization, it was hardly a smart business decision.
1.2.4.3. Con: Even if Trump's individual ventures have failed, he has undoubtedly created an enormously successful [brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization) through his great marketing skills.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Trump's brand, through [licensing fees](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/a-look-at-donald-trump-s-worldwide-business-ties-500-companies-in-about-20-countries-1.3236357?), has been able to make money globally.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Trump's brand is [no longer](https://theconversation.com/how-the-trump-brand-is-faring-two-years-after-the-presidents-inauguration-109682) as successful as it once was.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: Trump's presidency has harmed his businesses.
1.2.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Many business partners have started to [sever their ties](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/after-capitol-violence-trump-brand-partners-eye-dumping-toxic-asset-n1253780) to Trump, particularly after the January 6th riots.
1.2.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: Several buildings with Trump's name on them have begun [removing the names](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/trump-branded-new-york-building-looks-to-remove-president-s-name).
1.2.4.3.2.1.3. Con: By building a passionate and loyal constituency, Trump has also built a [loyal set of consumers](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/848179276/trump-campaign-capitalizes-on-rapid-response-merchandise) happy to buy his merchandise and support his political endeavors.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Pro: Even before his presidency, many of Trump's hotels and resorts had become significantly [less profitable](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-15/it-s-trump-s-money-not-his-brand-that-should-worry-him).
1.2.4.3.2.3. Con: Throughout his career, Trump has frequently [changed his business focuses](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35318432) to remain profitable. The fact that his brand has become weaker is, therefore, no indication of failure.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Donald Trump has declared [six business bankruptcies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/).
1.2.4.4.1. Con: Trump has suffered few bankruptcies compared to other [comparable businesspeople](https://www.incomediary.com/went-bankrupt-now-worth-millions/).
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Trump has driven several casinos to bankruptcy.
1.2.4.4.2.1. Pro: Trump bankrupted the [Trump Taj Mahal casino](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-trump-bankrupted-the-taj-mahal-2017-5?r=US&IR=T) twice, ultimately losing his stake in the business.
1.2.4.4.2.2. Pro: Trump was responsible for [bankrupting](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html) his Atlantis City Casinos as a result of [debts, rival venues and negative press around suspicious transactions](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/08/atlantic-city-trump-ghost-town-gambling-brian-rose-photographer).
1.2.4.5. Pro: [Trump's university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University#cite_note-launch-11) was sued for [fraudulent](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/31/522199535/judge-approves-25-million-settlement-of-trump-university-lawsuit) [conduct](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-university-professor-stephen-gilpin-2018-4) and [misleading](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-university-settlement-approved-gonzalo-curiel-236756) "customers." The suit was [settled](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-253a-d4bd-a5df-bffb2c450001) with the approval of the 9th Circuit, and the University has closed.
1.2.4.6. Con: Trump's business failures allowed him to avoid paying any federal income taxes for [up to 18 years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/as-a-businessman-trump-was-the-biggest-loser-of-all).
1.3. Pro: Trump became president against all the odds, indicating that he possesses profound political acumen.
1.3.1. Con: Trump’s opponent \(Clinton\) was perceived as [untrustworthy](https://time.com/4554576/donald-trump-trustworthy-hillary-clinton/).
1.3.2. Con: Showmanship does not equate to intelligence; television skills and a proclivity for making controversial remarks won him popularity. This won him the presidency, not his book-smarts.
1.3.2.1. Con: Book smarts do not equate to intelligence either.
1.3.3. Con: All other presidents in US history have also become president, and depending on the context, have done so "against all odds".
1.3.3.1. Pro: Richard Nixon was able to win the 1968 election in a [landslide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_United_States_elections) despite not being able to win majorities in the House or Senate, indicating a greater uphill battle.
1.3.3.2. Con: No other president has faced hostility from their own party. Trump did and overcame it.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Many other presidents and presidential candidates have faced strong internal opposition, this claim is simply untrue.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: It is very common for Democratic candidates to face strong opposition from the left end of the party and for Republican candidates to face opposition from the right leaning/conservative parts of their party.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [In 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries), in the buildup to his re-election President George H.W. faced [an internal challenge](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/02/17/the-iron-fist-of-pat-buchanan/832ad9b5-783d-425c-a792-b5fc5bc8e70a/) from more conservative Pat Buchanan.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Republican and former president Teddy Roosevelt [unsuccessfully tried to unseat the incumbent Republican president William Taft by forming the Progressive Party](https://millercenter.org/president/taft/campaigns-and-elections).
1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The formation of an entirely new party, something that has happened a number of times in US history, is far stronger than any opposition Donald Trump has had to face.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: [Almost every Republican leader](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-widely-condemned-republican-leaders-legislators-n662446) insulted or refused to support Trump during his campaign.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: Most Republicans stepped into line and [supported him](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-trump-wonand-how-the-gop-let-him-1462390833) once he won the primary.
1.3.4. Pro: Trump is the only president in US history who [lacks experience](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13587532/donald-trump-no-experience) in both political and military service.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Donald Trump does not have a [family background in politics](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13587532/donald-trump-no-experience). Therefore, it was more difficult for him to become President.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The previous US presidents \(1789 to 2016\) came into the White House with an [average](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13587532/donald-trump-no-experience) of 13 years in public office and 5.6 years of military service.
1.3.4.3. Con: Trump’s lack of public service is part of the “outsider” appeal that may have contributed to his success.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Even if much of Trump's election success stems from his "outsider" appeal, this is an external factor beyond his control. It therefore has no bearing on his political intelligence.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: [Polls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/05/the-outlandish-conspiracy-theories-many-of-donald-trumps-supporters-believe/) have shown that most Americans, especially Trump supporters, distrust the government.
1.3.4.4. Con: The fact that he lacks political and military service is not a testament to his intelligence, but instead to the fact that he is not qualified to serve.
1.3.4.5. Con: Trump lost the popular vote and only won because of the [electoral college](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/upshot/why-trump-had-an-edge-in-the-electoral-college.html), meaning that he should not even be president.
1.3.5. Con: Donald Trump is one of the wealthiest people in the nation, indicating the odds were not against him.
1.3.5.1. Con: As of 2020, Trump is the [275th-richest person in America](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2019/10/02/donald-trump-falls-another-16-spots-on-the-forbes-400-list/?sh=755e65ed291b). On the list of wealthy people, he comparatively falls quite low.
1.3.6. Pro: Trump ran an impressive and counterintuitive campaign successfully.
1.3.6.1. Con: Trump winning the presidency could have been largely a result of luck, rather than his smarts.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: The odds of someone with similar characteristics to Trump winning at least one US election is [very high](https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/130).
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: The odds of an individual winning the lottery are extremely tiny, but most lotteries end up with at least one winner. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that Trump could have just gotten lucky.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Pro: Winning a lottery is evidently no indication of an individual's skill or intelligence, thus winning the presidency against the odds may also be the same.
1.3.6.1.2.2. Pro: The odds of successfully matching '5 balls + the bonus' in the UK's [Lotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lottery_\(United_Kingdom\)#Lotto) draw are [1 in 7,509,579](https://www.lottery.co.uk/lotto/odds), however [a large proportion](https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/results/lotto/draw-history) of draws end up with at least one winner of this type.
1.3.6.1.2.3. Con: Winning a presidential election is not analogous to winning the lottery for a number of reasons.
1.3.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: Other than by entering, lottery winners have no influence over their chance of winning. By contrast, presidential candidates can give speeches, interviews, and invest in political campaigning.
1.3.6.1.2.3.2. Pro: Whereas one need only buy a lottery ticket, presidential candidates must pass a series of hurdles, such as winning the party's primaries.
1.3.6.1.3. Pro: Donald Trump's success was circumstantial. He largely benefited from [the protest vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_vote) against Hillary Clinton, as Trump happened to be just a little less unpopular than the other candidates.
1.3.6.1.4. Con: Polls gave Trump about a [30% chance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/) of winning the 2016 election, which not a small probability. That indicates that, far from luck, Trump had a sustainable campaign and real support.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Trump was able to work or associate with key individuals who helped deliver him the election victory in 2016.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: It is likely that Steve Bannon was the architect of Trump's rather miraculous victory in 2016. Bannon discusses his contributions to the campaign in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm5xxlajTW0).
1.3.6.3. Pro: Trump was able to tap into fears and anger that no other politicians were aware of.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Trump was able to cater to a new constituency of economically frustrated [working-class individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-ohio-youngstown-voters), who were being ignored by both major parties.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Con: Working-class support for Trump in 2016 was largely constant with that of [Mitt Romney in 2012](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/11/16/economic-marginalization-reality-check/).
1.3.6.3.1.2. Pro: Trump stood against policy consensuses held by both parties, like support for [free trade](https://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/article/21148512/free-trade-is-killing-american-manufacturing), which harmed the livelihoods of Americans.
1.3.6.3.2. Con: Trump's ability to distinguish himself from the main political parties was not a result of intelligence, but rather his offering unrealistic and racist solutions to social problems.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: Rather than dealing with the real sources of dissipating manual labor, Trump [blamed those job losses on immigrants](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-putting-american-workers-first-restore-economy-greatness/).
1.3.6.3.2.2. Pro: A large part of Trump's appeal was his willingness to say things that other politicians refused to say. That simply reflects Trump's racism.
1.3.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: A [demagogue](https://www.etymonline.com/word/demagogue#etymonline_v_5553) is able to use pre-existing prejudices to manipulate people to gain power. Being a demagogue is not political acumen, rather a cynical manipulation to gain power.
1.3.6.3.2.3. Con: Populism is a political strategy that requires a great amount of skill, even it devolves into demagoguery. That Trump was able to successfully use such a strategy indicates his intelligence.
1.3.6.3.2.3.1. Con: Trump is not the first American president to be elected on the basis of a creative and passionate mass movement.
1.3.6.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Barack Obama's 2008 campaign [massively increased voter turnout](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2009/04/30/dissecting-the-2008-electorate-most-diverse-in-us-history/), unlike Trump's, particularly among people of color.
1.3.6.3.2.3.2. Pro: Trump effectively ran against the powerful Republican Party and [did not even take PAC money](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/04/super-pacs-donald-trump-republican-fundraisers).
1.3.6.4. Con: Trump's campaign received assistance from several anti-democratic forces, giving him an unfair advantage.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: Although there is no proven collusion, [Russia actively interfered in the 2016 US election](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf) through the use of sophisticated information warfare, which aided Trump's election.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: The Trump campaign used [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595338116/what-did-cambridge-analytica-do-during-the-2016-election)'s service, which enabled them to breach privacy laws to advertise and learn about a large number of potential voters.
1.3.6.4.3. Con: The Clinton campaign also used dirty tricks in the 2016 campaign.
1.3.6.4.3.1. Pro: The ['Steele Dossier'](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-russiagate-steele-dossier/) was paid for by Democratic campaign operatives and made a large number of unproven, outlandish claims about Donald Trump.
1.3.6.4.3.2. Pro: Large corporations and ultra-rich individuals helped the Clinton campaign raise [an unprecedented amount of money](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-mega-donors-helped-raise-1-billion-for-hillary-clinton/2016/10/22/a92a0ee2-9603-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html), allowing them to pay for more campaign resources and ads.
1.3.6.4.3.3. Con: While the Clinton campaign may have used immoral means, they were all fairly common methods that would be expected. Trump's methods were far from ordinary.
1.4. Con: Trump has exhibited behavior that raises doubt about his intellect.
1.4.1. Pro: It is often clear, from Trump's public statements and actions, that he is unable to use reason at a high level.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Often times when Trump talks, he displays all the common signs of being under the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740).
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: 'The combination of poor self-awareness and low cognitive ability' leads Trump to be overconfident when he speaks.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: "[The incompetent are often blessed with an inappropriate confidence, buoyed by something that feels to them like knowledge](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-fry-donald-trump-lies-belief-confidence-interview-a7737131.html)" would explain Trump's natural level of confidence.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: If Trump were under the Dunning-Kruger effect, it would prove that he is not as smart as he claims to be.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Trump frequently jumps to unsubstantiated conclusions.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Trump claimed that the [fertilizer explosion in Lebanon was actually due to man-made explosives](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/lebanon-says-no-indication-of-attack-after-trump-claims-beirut-explosion-was-bomb/ar-BB17zdlg).
1.4.1.3. Pro: Trump [tried to view an eclipse](https://youtu.be/-0I4f8PasIU) without eye protection, which is [dangerous](https://preventblindness.org/solar-eclipse-and-your-eyes/).
1.4.1.4. Con: All people make stupid mistakes. Trump's have just been the subject of intense media scrutiny and ridicule.
1.4.2. Pro: His refusal to reveal his college transcripts produces reasonable skepticism regarding his intellect.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Michael Cohen [testified](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/02/28/michael-cohen-testifies-trump-threatened-colleges-over-any-release-his-grades) that Trump had directed him to threaten his own high school and colleges against ever releasing his academic grades or SAT scores, otherwise the institution could be legally liable.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: In a 2015 letter that Cohen wrote on behalf of Trump, he requested confirmation that the “[records have been permanently sealed.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/02/27/cohen-says-he-threatened-schools-to-keep-trumps-grades-secret/)"
1.4.2.2. Con: The [FERPA law](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) protects the confidentiality of student transcripts, which cannot be accessed without their consent. It is Trump's right to refuse to reveal his transcripts and not a matter of intelligence.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Although Trump has a right to privacy regarding his transcripts, the [ferocity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrim/2019/02/28/heres-why-donald-trump-doesnt-want-anyone-to-know-his-grades-or-sat-scores/)(Yesterday, as part of his testimony to Congress, Michael Cohen revealed that, under the direction of President Trump, he had sent letters to Trump’s high schools, colleges and the College Board \(creator of the SAT\), threatening them with legal action and jail time if they ever released Trump’s academic records.) with which he defended this right suggests he is motivated by more than just protecting his privacy.
1.4.2.3. Con: School performance shows how [good you are at memorization and taking tests](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-ss-152-1/chapter/learning-and-intelligence/), but not necessarily your level of intelligence.
1.4.2.4. Pro: In her book, "[Too Much and Never Enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Much_and_Never_Enough)", [Mary Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_L._Trump) claims that Trump paid someone to take his SATs so that he could transfer to the prestigious Wharton School.
1.4.3. Con: Trump's [estimated IQ](http://archive.is/TbyVO) is [higher than](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/SimontonPresIQ2006.pdf) that of several other US presidents.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Political scientists [claim](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41573846) that Trump has "superb" public communication and political skills, two [qualities that bear on presidential performance](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/leadership/greenstein.html) and help assess their IQ.
1.4.3.2. Con: This is a popular misconception based on Trump's own bragging. He began to show early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases during press interviews and rallies, prompting his doctors to give him basic cognitive tests to assess severity of the impairments. [The test the president boasted about passing does not measure IQ but is typically used to check for early signs of dementia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/21/donald-trump-cognitive-test-closer-look).
1.4.3.3. Pro: Experts [agree](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/08/05/how-smart-donald-trump/hHGm2NU3cbeOgCQ9A92ehM/story.html) that he likely has an above average IQ.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Keeping the usual admission requirements of the [Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) in mind, Trump's IQ is estimated to be a [156 at the minimum](http://archive.is/TbyVO#selection-721.31-737.33).
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Trump's IQ is unmeasurable.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Con: Trump's IQ is measurable. He just needs to take and publicly disclose his IQ test \(not happening\).
1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Trump didn't show proof of his IQ level.
1.4.3.3.2.3. Pro: [Justin O'Brien](https://www.quora.com/profile/Justin-OBrien-14), a confirmed expert on Psychology that took part in the questioning believes "I can confidently state that Donald Trump's IQ is quite literally unmeasurable."
1.4.3.3.3. Con: Even according to the link in the parent claim, the IQ upon which the alleged experts agree is not as high as even that of the typical genius.
1.4.3.3.4. Con: Donald Trump has no substantiated or confirmed IQ. He has either never been tested or has never released any official results.
1.4.3.3.5. Con: Trump exhibited several traits, such as being [lazy](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/08/05/how-smart-donald-trump/hHGm2NU3cbeOgCQ9A92ehM/story.html), that are typical of a lower IQ individual.
1.4.3.3.6. Con: The article in the parent claim is intentionally misleading as a number of the 'experts' in the original study did not think Trump was significantly above average IQ.
1.4.3.4. Con: How his IQ ranks vs other US presidents is ultimately impossible to know since there isn’t a standardized IQ test administered for the presidential office/role.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Even though there are no standardized IQ tests administered for the presidential office, studies have estimated the IQ of US presidents based on several measures \([p. 516](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/SimontonPresIQ2006.pdf)\).
1.4.3.5. Con: The source in the parent claim notes that [John Quincy Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams) is estimated to have an IQ higher than Donald Trump.
1.4.3.6. Con: IQ scores are [not a reliable indicator](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iq-scores-not-accurate-marker-of-intelligence-study-shows/) of overall intelligence because they only focus on a narrow definition of intelligence.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: Trump appears to lack [emotional intelligence \(EQ\)](https://www.diffen.com/difference/EQ_vs_IQ#What.27s_More_Important_.E2.80.94_IQ_or_EQ.3F), which is an important aspect of intelligence.
1.4.3.6.1.1. Pro: Emotional intelligence accounts for [58%](https://www.workforce.com/uk/news/the-business-case-for-emotional-intelligence) of overall job performance.
1.4.3.6.1.2. Pro: [75%](https://www.naturalhr.com/2017/10/10/emotional-intelligence-important/) of careers are derailed due to a lack of emotional competency and adaptability.
1.4.3.6.1.3. Pro: One indicator of high emotional intelligence is being able to [form and maintain successful relationships](https://www.diffen.com/difference/EQ_vs_IQ#What.27s_More_Important_.E2.80.94_IQ_or_EQ.3F). Trump is not good at this.
1.4.3.6.1.3.1. Pro: As of 13 April 2020, the [turnover rate](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/) of Trump's top advisers is 85%, which is higher than any other US president.
1.4.3.6.1.4. Con: Trump scores highly on EQ metrics of [self-p​erception and self-expression](https://www.hrzone.com/lead/future/donald-trumps-emotional-intelligence-lets-take-a-look).
1.4.3.6.1.5. Pro: Trump is prone to large emotional outbursts, another sign of low IQ.
1.4.4. Pro: Trump is a deeply immoral man.
1.4.4.1. Pro: President Trump has frequently sexually harassed his employees, both male and female.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Not only that, he even spoke of [grabbing a woman by their frontal genetalia 5 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape).
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Trump has been [sued by his employees](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/02/trump-employees-have-sued-over-sexual-harassment/87969188/) over sexual harassment.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Morality is linked to intelligence insofar as it requires being aware of the feelings and sentiments of others and able to take those into consideration when acting.
1.4.4.3. Con: Trump is not more immoral than prior American presidents.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Most recent American presidents have committed several [war crimes](https://chomsky.info/1990____-2/).
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: US intervention in Latin American during the Cold War involved [international crimes](https://www.trtworld.com/americas/the-secret-history-of-us-interventions-in-latin-america-23586).
1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: Trump [pardoned Blackwater guards](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1081152) who committed war crimes, indicating he is clearly not opposed to those crimes.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: It is difficult to call Trump more racist than previous presidents.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: [12 American presidents](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-faq) have owned slaves.
1.4.4.3.2.2. Pro: Reagan and Nixon both help [deeply racist beliefs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/ronald-reagan-richard-nixon-racist.html) and actively sought to [disadvantage](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/24/war-on-drugs-40-years) and [vilify](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/21/she-was-stereotyped-welfare-queen-truth-was-more-disturbing-new-book-says/) the African-American community.
1.4.4.3.2.3. Con: Racism has become increasingly unacceptable in the US. Even if Trump's racism has historical parallels, in his context he represents a more regressive moral deviation.
1.4.4.3.2.4. Con: Even if Trump is not more racist than previous presidents, race relations in the US have [worsened under his administration](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/04/09/race-in-america-2019/).
1.4.4.4. Pro: Trump has lied [more in public](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/podcast-glenn-kessler-david-corn-lies-washington-post-fact-checker/) than previous presidents of the United States.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: Presidents often lie for the [good of the public](https://theconversation.com/from-washington-to-trump-all-presidents-have-told-lies-but-only-some-have-told-them-for-the-right-reasons-145995).
1.4.4.5. Con: Even if Trump is immoral, the American electorate [does not care about it](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-30/donald-trump-voters-morality-values). This indicates Trump's smartness that the same will not impact his political career.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: Evangelical Americans, who are expected to care more about [morality and ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism_in_the_United_States), are [more focused on Trump's performance in office](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-30/donald-trump-voters-morality-values) than on his personal morals and ethics.
1.4.5. Pro: He has an inarticulate speaking style.
1.4.5.1. Pro: He frequently [oversimplified](https://medium.com/\@bfalke/oversimplification-for-the-win-how-donald-j-trump-is-winning-over-millions-6b278baee4f) points.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Simplifying points is done to help the unintelligent understand.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Trump voters tend to be less intelligent](https://medium.com/\@tgof137/whats-the-average-iq-of-trump-voters-b46603548b35) than Democrat voters. Thus, it would be smart for Trump to use language that is more accessible to his voter base.
1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Con: This calculation involved a number of assumptions, which could compromise the reliability of the conclusions.
1.4.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It assumes that 8th grade math grades [can be converted into IQ scores](https://medium.com/\@tgof137/whats-the-average-iq-of-trump-voters-b46603548b35).
1.4.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: It assumes that a child's IQ is roughly [representative of their parents' intelligence](https://medium.com/\@tgof137/whats-the-average-iq-of-trump-voters-b46603548b35), the voters.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Trump's prolific use of [superlatives](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a15335203/trump-superlatives/) suggests that he was unable to eloquently articulate nuanced points.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Trump frequently reverts to ad hominem replies to questions, suggesting that he is unable to think of a substantive reply.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Trump has used ad hominem attacks against each of his opponents, both within and beyond his party.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Trump has made sexist remarks about [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton), using [vulgar language and insulting her bathroom habits](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-takes-aim-hillary-clinton-vulgar-language-article-1.2473593).
1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: Trump has publicly insulted [Marco Rubio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio) for being sweaty [at least eight times](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-marco-rubio-sweat-215471).
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/upshot/the-week-in-donald-trumps-twitter-insults.html) is tracking Trump’s ad hominems on Twitter: the list contains [hundreds](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html) of ad hominem examples.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: Trump's ad hominem attacks earned him a reputation for being authentic and a breathe of fresh air in US politics, which many of his supporters are attracted to and endorse. Therefore, this apparently ineloquent approach is, in practice, a smart move.
1.4.5.2.3.1. Pro: People are [more likely to assume](https://qz.com/754055/psychology-shows-we-shouldnt-elect-authentic-candidates-like-donald-trump/) that another's behaviour is a true reflection of their beliefs, attitudes, and personality when they behave in socially undesirable ways or violate social norms.
1.4.5.3. Con: Trump had a [talent for persuasion](https://www.scottadamssays.com/2016/02/18/the-trump-master-persuader-index-and-reading-list/), and this is related to intelligence.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: He gained credibility through being [authentic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/06/opinion/trump-speech-mental-capacity.html) and outspoken.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: It was a sign of intelligence that Trump identified what type of communication his target audience preferred.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: Trump was a master of [crowd manipulation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/15/this-video-of-donald-trump-repeating-himself-is-pretty-great-video/).
1.4.5.3.2.1. Pro: Trump’s use of repetition [helped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/15/this-video-of-donald-trump-repeating-himself-is-pretty-great-video/) drive his talking points home.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: A president may be smart enough to talk in a way which lets most voters understand him, instead of trying to nuance and search for details and precision.
1.4.5.3.4. Con: Trump did not intelligently broaden his [appeal](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/22/us/politics/trump-voters-demographics.html) to voters.
1.4.5.3.5. Con: Trump has faced a lot of [pushback](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-tools-of-persuasion--from-tough-talk-to-polite-cajoling/2017/06/07/786cdc86-4bba-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html) against his talent for persuasion.
1.4.5.4. Con: Trump spoke very deliberately against his rivals.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: Trump [deliberately singled out China](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/03/18/trump-coronavirus-china-john-king-sot-vpx.cnn) and used stigmatizing terms against the nation.
1.4.5.5. Pro: Trump averaged [significantly fewer syllables per word](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-language-level-speaking-skills-age-eight-year-old-vocabulary-analysis-a8149926.html) than the last 14 Presidents and used significantly fewer unique words.
1.4.5.5.1. Pro: An analysis of Trump's [first 30,000 words uttered in office found](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-language-level-speaking-skills-age-eight-year-old-vocabulary-analysis-a8149926.html) that he speaks at a third- to seventh-grade reading level – lower than any other President since 1929.
1.4.5.5.2. Con: We don’t have enough evidence indicating that speech style and diction reflects intelligence.
1.4.5.5.2.1. Con: [Linguistic Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_intelligence) takes into account an individual's ability to speak, including their verbal fluency and choice of words.
1.4.5.5.2.2. Con: Many studies [indicate that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207434/) there is a direct relationship between fluency of language outputs and individual intelligence.
1.4.5.5.2.2.1. Con: These studies show that "fluency of language equals intelligence", but not that "no fluency of language equals no intelligence" \([contraposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition)\).
1.4.5.5.2.3. Pro: Speech style may be impacted by the speaker feeling nervous. Being a nervous public speaker has nothing to do with intelligence.
1.4.5.5.2.3.1. Pro: Many highly intelligent people have problems with speaking, especially publicly.
1.4.5.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Rowan Atkinson](https://unbelievable-facts.com/2017/05/facts-rowan-atkinson-mr-bean.html) - who holds a masters degree in electrical engineering from Oxford - has a stammer.
1.4.5.5.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Despite having a stammer, overall Rowan Atkinson is still very articulate.
1.4.5.5.3. Pro: He repeated himself a lot.
1.4.5.5.3.1. Pro: Trump attacked the New York Times by [saying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/15/this-video-of-donald-trump-repeating-himself-is-pretty-great-video/) “That’s wrong. They were wrong. It’s The New York Times, they’re always wrong. They were wrong.”
1.4.5.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.2.1.
1.5. Con: Trump lacked key leadership qualities that make a smart president.
1.5.1. Pro: Trump consistently shared misinformation about important topics.
1.5.1.1. Con: It is likely that Trump might be sharing such misinformation on purpose to serve his objectives. This does not make him any less smart.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Even smart people may share misinformation if they think that it serves their objectives.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Trump has [shared misinformation frequently](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/business/media/trump-fake-news.html) to attack his political opponents, and ensure that the political outcome/view is in his favour.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Trump falsely claims that the 2020 presidential elections are ["rigged" against him](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-53898142?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt/donald-trump&link_location=live-reporting-story), the objective being to explain away why he is likely to lose.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: It is not politically smart to deliberately share harmful misinformation because the electorate, who suffers as a result, will likely turn against him.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: [7 in 10](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/americans-trust-governors-more-trump-coronavirus-new-poll-finds-n1233031) Americans trust governors more than Trump in regards to the coronavirus.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: An intelligent president would want their voters and fellow colleagues to view them as credible.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Spreading misinformation about important topics could have a knock-on effect on their approval ratings.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Con: Since [80% of Republicans trust Trump more](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41028733) than the media, there is little risk that Trump's credibility will be affected by accusations of misinformation.
1.5.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: In 2018, [91% of self-identified “strong Trump supporters”](https://globalnews.ca/news/4362603/jackson-proskow-donald-trump-supporters/) said they trusted Trump for accurate information, compared to 11% who trusted mainstream media.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Trump is frequently misinformed indicating that he does not understand or care about the true facts.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Trump doesn’t believe in basic science.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: [He says](https://globalnews.ca/news/4548449/donald-trump-climate-change-hoax-60-minutes/) [climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/climate/trump-climate-change-fact-check.html) [is a hoax](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940).
1.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: He actually planned on [launching nuclear explosives in tornadoes/hurricanes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/26/donald-trump-suggests-nuking-hurricanes-to-stop-them-hitting-america-report) to "stop them".
1.5.1.2.1.3. Con: The Trump administration [increased federal funding](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/trump-has-shown-little-respect-us-science-so-why-are-some-parts-thriving) for various scientific fields, indicating that Trump cares about and believes in science.
1.5.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The [National Institutes of Health \(NIH\)](https://www.nih.gov/), the biggest federal supporter of academic research, saw its budget [rise by 39%](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/trump-has-shown-little-respect-us-science-so-why-are-some-parts-thriving) under Trump.
1.5.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The Trump administration showed widespread [support](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/trump-has-shown-little-respect-us-science-so-why-are-some-parts-thriving) for artificial intelligence \(AI\), referring to it as an industry “of the future.”
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Trump has demonstrated ignorance about extremely basic strategic information, for example [being unaware that the United Kingdom is a nuclear power.](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-asked-chinas-xi-jinping-to-help-him-win-2020-election-bolton-claims-12009225)
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: Trump appeared to be consistently misinformed about the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic).
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: In an interview, Trump stated that he thought the 3.4% death rate estimated by the WHO for Covid-19 was wrong and in fact closer to 1%. This [coincided with scientists' best estimate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51818627).
1.5.1.2.3.2. Pro: Donald Trump claimed that the increasing Covid cases were not an urgent matter and that it only seemed significant because of [increased testing](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-testing-not-responsible-for-rising-us-case-counts-2020-7).
1.5.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Trump's advisers said Trump was [clearly kidding](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/21/politics/trump-coronavirus-testing/index.html) when he attributed rising cases to increased testing.
1.5.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Even if Trump was kidding, it was [negligent](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/22/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-testing-tulsa-rally/index.html) and hence unintelligent to do so.
1.5.1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Trump has contradicted his advisers by saying that he [was not kidding](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/06/23/i-dont-kid-trump-says-he-wasnt-joking-about-slowing-testing/#76c2b2975b69).
1.5.1.2.3.2.2. Con: He was talking about the recorded rate of positive Covid cases. The more testing that is done, the more positive cases they will find. That statement is technically correct, just poorly worded.
1.5.1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: The fact that it was poorly worded is evidence in itself that Trump is not smart.
1.5.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Trump said, ["if we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases."](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-stop-coronavirus-testing-right-now-have-very-few-cases-2020-6)
1.5.1.2.3.3. Pro: After Trump survived [Covid-19, he believes he now is immune to the virus](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-tries-prove-hes-back-161930038.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20vc2VhcmNoP3E9dHJ1bXArY2xhaW1zK3RoYXQraGUraXMraW1tdW5lK3RvK2NvdmlkJkZPUk09QVdSRQ&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEImQp4ZU1QT6-FANLTSZCmdsUMcUeRecEIBnL_Ck7J1yV-xcxxJx0ELobxaChUOoUa3ibYGyKL9FRDamLw2sC_XMpO4G15Zn3PETJHK-urYKVqHFWMeXcePzZDts2WV9u_wKsanoOXDbNqgQrgLMbjCAO9_6pX2-u2a0LxgH6kv).
1.5.1.2.3.4. Pro: Trump suggested bizarre ideas to treat the Coronavirus.
1.5.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: His comment that ['the virus could be cured by UV rays'](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trumps-remarks-disinfectants-left-even-close-aides-shocked-n1192031) is clearly nonsense to anyone with an ounce of medical knowledge.
1.5.1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Donald Trump has suggested that ["people should be drinking disinfectant](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177\]) to treat Coronavirus".
1.5.1.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Injecting](https://www.livescience.com/disinfectant-injections-coronavirus-dangerous.html) large volumes of chemicals used to disinfect surfaces is evidently not a good idea.
1.5.1.2.3.5. Con: Since there is a lot of [misinformation regarding Coronavirus](https://www.dawn.com/news/1582678), it is possible that Trump fell prey to the same.
1.5.1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Globally, there are about [522,472 news articles](https://www.dawn.com/news/1582678) that reproduce misinformation related to the Coronavirus pandemic.
1.5.1.2.3.5.2. Con: Trump would have access to the best information from the CDC. If he is trusting news sources over these experts, that is an indication of a lack of intelligence.
1.5.1.2.4. Con: Much of what is reported as Trump not understanding basic facts is often exaggerated by the media.
1.5.1.2.4.1. Pro: When making his more outrageous claims, Trump is often being purposefully hyperbolic or making jokes.
1.5.1.2.4.2. Con: Even if Trump does not mean to be taken literally, he often is by his supporters, leading to i[ncreased misinformation among the public](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/trump-tweets-legacy-of-lies-misinformation-distrust.html).
1.5.1.3. Pro: Trump frequently lied as president.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Donald Trump's political statements rank [very poorly for accuracy](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/). This indicates that he is uninformed and uneducated about many of the matters in which he speaks of.
1.5.1.3.2. Pro: During the presidential debate, Trump stated that cars over the age of 10 years should be removed from the roads as part of the Green New Deal's proposal to combat climate change, when [in fact it was not one](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/29/us/debate-fact-check/im-ok-with-electric-cars-too-im-all-for-electric-cars-i-have-given-big-incentives-for-electric-cars).
1.5.1.3.3. Con: All politicians must engage in some misinformation. There has just been increased scrutiny of Trump.
1.5.1.3.3.1. Pro: Most American politicians, including George W. Bush and past presidents, [lied](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/20/18274228/ari-fleischer-iraq-lies-george-w-bush-wmds) about Iraq possessing 'weapons of mass destruction'.
1.5.1.3.3.2. Pro: President Obama frequently lied about his [use of drones](https://www.cio.com/article/2370550/no-surprise--docs-show-obama-administration-lying-about-drones.html).
1.5.1.3.3.3. Con: Most presidential lies tend to be about restricting information to the public, often about foreign policy. Trump's lies denied facts that are well-known and largely agreed upon.
1.5.1.3.4. Pro: Frequently repeating lies is an unwise political strategy, suggesting that Trump is not a particularly smart president.
1.5.1.3.4.1. Pro: Without being firmly tethered to the truth, Trump created a [misinformation ecosystem](https://en.ejo.ch/research/network-propaganda-how-a-right-wing-media-ecosystem-helped-to-radicalise-america) that could grow out of his control, leading to violence and, ultimately, the Capitol Hill riots.
1.5.1.3.4.2. Con: Creating a web of misinformation places Trump at the center, making him the exclusive figurehead of the movement he had created. This is why Trump had such great loyalty among supporters.
1.5.2. Pro: Trump had no regard for the inner workings of the government.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Many former aides have suggested that [Trump does not bother to read](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/americas-first-post-text-president/549794/) information put in front of him.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Trump made it very difficult for others, whether in or outside his administration, to work with him.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Trump has been [sued over 130 times](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/politics/a9962852/lawsuits-against-donald-trump/) since taking office. This shows he commands very little political good will.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: It is not uncommon for presidents to be sued multiple times while in office. Therefore, this should not discount Trump's political acumen relative to other US presidents.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: By the same time in their presidencies, [Obama and George W Bush](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/politics/a9962852/lawsuits-against-donald-trump/) had only accrued 26 and 7 lawsuits respectively.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.6.1.3.1.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: Trump was able to make a bipartisan [criminal justice bill in 2020](https://www.vox.com/2020-presidential-election/21418911/donald-trump-crime-criminal-justice-policy-record), indicating his ability to work well with other politicians on the more nuanced parts of politics.
1.5.2.2.3.1. Con: Trump did not "make" the bill; he merely, after some [convincing, expressed some support and signed it](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18140973/state-of-the-union-trump-first-step-act-criminal-justice-reform). He didn't draft it, propose it, or advocate for it. The bill itself was [created through and passed by bipartisan cooperation](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-first-step-act-became-law-and-what-happens-next).
1.5.2.3. Pro: Trump had glaring gaps in his knowledge regarding how the American government functions.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: When asked, Trump [did not know the top three functions](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/articles/2016-03-31/donald-trump-doesnt-understand-the-us-political-system-or-government) of the federal government: defense, state, and treasury.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Trump [believes he has "ultimate authority"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/14/trump-power-constitution-coronavirus/) over the running of the country, which legal scholars say has no basis in reality.
1.5.2.3.3. Con: Given that Trump had no prior experience in politics, it is reasonable for him to have some knowledge gaps.
1.5.2.3.3.1. Con: Since he was seeking the highest office in the country, we should expect him to learn the bare minimum of how the job works.
1.5.2.3.3.2. Pro: Trump surrounded himself with many [people with Washington experience](https://apnews.com/article/7f2605f079334fddb0dfb341010b68ea) to compensate for these shortcomings.
1.5.2.4. Con: A large part of Trump's campaign was that the standard norms of the [American government were broken](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/15/politics/donald-trump-broken-disaster/index.html). It is reasonable, then, that he would show little care for abiding by them when in office.
1.5.3. Con: Trump was a very effective president, despite almost everyone in Congress [being out to get him](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/politics/mcconnell-backs-trump-impeachment.html). This shows a great ability to strategize.
1.5.3.1. Con: Legitimate criticism and attempts to hold someone accountable or belief in doing so does make one "out to get him."
1.5.3.2. Pro: Trump successfully [filled top posts with officials who did not have the support of senators](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/10/just-presidency-trump-changing-congress/112125424/) by limiting their ability to advise and consent on nominees.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: After the posts were filled, there were a large number of firings and resignations. This indicates that Trump showed poor leadership in the appointments in that the shortened tenure of appointees reduced the effectiveness of the leadership team. [Tracking turnover in the Trump administration](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/).
1.5.3.2.2. Con: The revolving door of Trump appointees created a major distraction and delays for pressing matters of state.
1.5.3.3. Con: Trump had a majority in the House of Representatives for his [first two years](https://ballotpedia.org/115th_United_States_Congress) and a majority in the Senate for his [entire term](https://ballotpedia.org/116th_United_States_Congress). This is hardly an immense opposition.
1.5.4. Pro: Trump did not keep any of his [promises](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-38663043) to the electorate.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Trump's promise to "build a wall on the southern border" and make "Mexico pay" for it has not [materialized](https://globalnews.ca/news/7419043/trump-campaign-promises-unkept/).
1.5.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.5.4.2. Con: Trump has kept his financial promises, such as [lowering the corporate tax rate](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000).
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.2.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: Trump's corporate tax cuts [did not yield promised results](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2019/09/26/475083/trumps-corporate-tax-cut-not-trickling/).
1.5.4.3. Pro: A smart president would fulfill what they promised to [earn the trust of their voters](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323863602_Trust_and_Citizens%27_Evaluations_of_Promise_Keeping_by_Governing_Parties).
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Earning the trust of [communities who make up a significant proportion of the electorate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/broken-promises-of-the-past-weigh-on-black-voters-as-they-consider-the-2020-presidential-campaign/2019/05/20/97f543f8-7710-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html) is smart because it can help sway election results.
1.5.4.3.2. Con: Trump's support among his [voters has not declined](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-fraud-insight/why-republican-voters-say-theres-no-way-in-hell-trump-lost-idUSKBN2801D4) even though he has not kept most of his promises.
1.5.4.4. Con: Trump [moved the Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/14/17340798/jerusalem-embassy-israel-palestinians-us-trump) as [pledged during his campaign](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000).
1.5.4.5. Pro: Trump's trade wars [hurt the economy](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/08/07/more-pain-than-gain-how-the-us-china-trade-war-hurt-america/), rather than bringing back jobs, as he promised.
1.5.4.5.1. Pro: [Tariffs hurt farmers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/27/trump-trade-wars-farmers/), the very group Trump claimed to be protecting.
1.5.4.5.1.1. Con: Many farmers [remained loyal](https://theconversation.com/most-us-farmers-remain-loyal-to-trump-despite-pain-from-trade-wars-and-covid-19-146535) to Trump, indicating that they did not see any losses from trade as a betrayal.
1.5.4.5.2. Con: Trump gained concessions through those trade wars, which will be beneficial in the long-run.
1.5.4.5.2.1. Con: Much of China's concessions were relatively [minor in scope](https://www.ft.com/content/6a30ed00-ecd1-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195).
1.5.4.5.2.2. Pro: Trump got China to reform their practices regarding its use of the [intellectual property](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-details-factbox-idUSKBN1ZE2IF) of American firms.
1.5.4.5.2.3. Pro: China pledged to buy a [greater number](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-details-factbox-idUSKBN1ZE2IF) of American goods.
1.5.5. Pro: Trump [incited nationwide riots within the US](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/04/trump-courts-riots-inciting-people-ex-defense-sec-hagel-says/4128690001/).
1.5.5.1. Pro: These riots resulted in a significant loss to the Capitol.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Of these riots, the [Capitol Building was decimated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/06/capitol-hill-riot-heres-everything-we-know/6573033002/), with many important items vandalized or stolen.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: A historic part of the US was also ruined [when a man carried the confederate flag into the Capitol](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-seefried-confederate-flag-capitol-riots-arrested/).

1.5.5.1.3. Pro: Washington D.C. has a [3:00 PM curfew due to the insurrectionists](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/01/06/dc-curfew-trump-protesters-police-clash-national-guard-request-denied/), which is negatively affecting the economy.
1.5.5.1.3.1. Pro: Businesses being forced to close early means that they lose out on essential revenue.
1.5.5.2. Con: Donald Trump did not incite violence, instead, doing the opposite, he told protesters to "[stay peaceful](https://fox2now.com/news/politics/stay-peaceful-president-trump-tells-supporters-to-support-police-as-capitol-is-overrun/)".
