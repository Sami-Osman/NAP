Discussion Name: Who should qualify for Asylum?

1. Who should qualify for Asylum?
1.1. Those fleeing state persecution which is based on flimsy or non-existent legal backing.
1.1.1. Pro: By refusing to deport those subject to arbitrary state persecution, you force the offending state to justify their reasoning publically.
1.2. Those who live in an area with a serious disease pandemic.
1.3. Those who live in a war zone.
1.3.1. Pro: Refusing to allow asylum to those who are in an active war zone is akin to actively sending them back into a volatile situation where they may be maimed or killed. This is morally unacceptable.
1.3.2. Pro: People living in war zones are directly affected by the aftermath of the war, including the risk of death.
1.3.2.1. Pro: There are more than [357 million children](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/15/number-children-living-war-zones-surprise-you/340317002/) living in war and conflict zones.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Around half of these affected, [165 million children](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/15/number-children-living-war-zones-surprise-you/340317002/), live in "high-intensity" conflicts.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: The condition of children impacted by wars are worse than ever. There has been a marked increase in the killing and maiming of children. Since 2010, the number of [U.N verified cases](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/15/number-children-living-war-zones-surprise-you/340317002/) of has gone up by almost 300%.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Conflicts](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/15/number-children-living-war-zones-surprise-you/340317002/) today tend to be protracted and are often fought in densely populated areas, with attacks on safe places, such as schools and hospitals.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: [Children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775132/) \(and families\) living in war regions have a high probability of suffering from mental health problems.
1.3.2.2. Pro: These individuals usually lose their basis of existence.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Considering conflicts and wars in the following regions \(p. [iv/v](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/globalreport.pdf)\), 33% of homes were seriously damaged and 26% were looted, according to the surveyed civilians \([p. vii](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/globalreport.pdf)\).
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: More than one-third of respondents were forced to leave home \([p. viii](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/globalreport.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3. Pro: People in war zones are traumatized and/or injured and thus need help.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: In a study civilians from war zones \(20th and 21st century\) were asked if any of their immediate family had died in the war, and 31% answered yes \([p.viii](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/globalreport.pdf)\)
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: According to data from the [World Health Organization](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/11/war-zones-mental-health-issues-world-health-organization-data), one in five people living in areas beset by conflict have mental health conditions.
1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: Up to [one third](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775132/) of the people directly exposed to traumatic war experiences suffer from post‚Äêtraumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) or depression.
1.3.2.4. Con: Governments can deploy armed forces to stop a war and help civilians on site.
1.4. Those fleeing state persecution based on legitimate, although possibly unjust legal backing.
1.4.1. Con: Offering asylum to criminals under another country's legal code infringes on that country's sovereignty.
1.4.2. Pro: Deporting someone to suffer under an unjust legal regime is essentially collaboration with that regime, which makes a very significant moral statement.
1.4.3. Pro: Accepting that justice means one thing for your own people, and another for others is an unconscionable act of cultural relativism.
1.5. Those who have been specifically targeted by criminal elements.
1.5.1. Pro: Those targeted by criminal elements often face fates far worse than those targeted by state actors.
1.5.2. Pro: Those targeted by criminal elements are usually those who threaten to negatively impact criminal elements. By offering asylum, we can indirectly support the fight against crime.
1.5.3. Con: Often criminals target other criminals in order to gain power, influence and money.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Many US American [mobsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Murdered_American_mobsters) were targeted and gunned down by other criminals.
1.5.3.2. Con: Criminals also don't tend to flee for asylum as a result of such targeting.
1.6. Those who live in areas with generally high levels of crime.
1.6.1. Pro: If we accept that the severe danger of violence is grounds for asylum in a warzone, we should accept the same criteria for criminal "warzones".
1.6.2. Con: Encouraging people to flee areas with high crime simply allows criminals to quickly take over areas without resistance, establishing criminal fiefdoms.
1.6.2.1. Con: The solution for this should be to have better security and greater regulation in these areas instead of forcing people to continue to live in insecure circumstances and put up resistance.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Better security and greater regulation are associated with high costs. Costs that not all states are able to afford.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: Oftentimes, [organized crime is associated with corruption and bribery](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266078495_Links_between_Corruption_and_Organised_Crime_and_Research_Gaps) making it incredibly difficult for law enforcement to work effectively.
1.6.2.1.3. Pro: Citizens can not be expected to take on \(dangerous\) police and law enforcement duties.
1.7. Those who live in areas with severe poverty and the government cannot be relied on.
1.7.1. Con: [736 million people](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview) live on or below the world bank's extreme poverty income. Rich countries could not handle that intake of people.
1.7.1.1. Con: It is very unlikely that many \(let alone all\) of these people would want to leave. But where someone does leave and applies for asylum, their poverty from living in a dysfunctional state should qualify them for asylum status.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Rich countries would only become overwhelmed if a large majority of people did migrate. But physical, familial and cultural obstacles can make migration unattractive to all but the most desperate citizens.
1.7.2. Pro: Severe poverty can be a threat to someone's life.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Severe poverty can very often result in high rates of [homelessness](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2019/05/SPEAK_Suzanne_Paper.pdf).
1.7.2.2. Pro: Poverty results in people not being able to access the most basic needs like food and water.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: The [vast majority](http://www.foodaidfoundation.org/world-hunger-statistics.html) of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished. For such people, sometimes the only way out of poverty is to escape their country.
1.8. Those whose religion, race, sexuality, or other protected characteristic excluding political activities subject them to state persecution.
1.8.1. Pro: According to the [Universal Decleration of Human Rights,](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) religious freedom is a human right. Asylum provision should be given to those unable to realise these rights.
1.8.2. Pro: The global community has a responsibility to condemn oppression around the world and open its door to those suffering around the world.
1.8.2.1. Con: Given many states have their own history of persecuting minority groups, it can be quite difficult for states to take hard stances on issues of minority rights without drawing unwanted attention on their own human rights records and treatment of minority groups within their state.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: Although homosexuality was [decriminalised](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/23/fifty-years-gay-liberation-uk-barely-four-1967-act) in the UK in 1967, this is still within living memory, and other laws continued to criminalise people for their sexuality beyond 1967.
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: In the USA, the [legacy of slavery](https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2013/01/when-did-slavery-really-end-in-the-united-states/) and its [lasting effects](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/15/400-years-since-slavery-timeline) for people of colour in America, mean that there are ongoing ethnic tensions domestically that attract political spotlight.
1.8.2.1.3. Pro: Religion countries, like [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_in_Pakistan) and [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_Saudi_Arabia) are oppressive laws where people can be executed for speaking negatively about religion.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Under the [responsibility to protect](https://www.unric.org/en/responsibility-to-protect?layout=default), individual states and then the international community are obligated to protect populations around the world from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
1.8.3. Pro: People of different religions are being persecuted around the world.
1.8.3.1. Con: Religion is not an innate characteristic, it is possible to convert. In many cases, conversion can be used to avoid persecution.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: Given the importance of religion to people in their sense of self, values and morality, as well as their beliefs, derived from that specific religions' perspectives, about the world, a higher power and the afterlife, it could be extremely difficult, if not hugely upsetting, to meaningfully convert away from the religion a person believes in, as a means to avoid persecution.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Muslims across the world are persecuted, abused and murdered by various states. These people deserve to have a way out of this persecution.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: [China](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/muslim-cleansing-global-pandemic-181220084045168.html) is accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Muslims without trial in its western region of Xinjiang.
1.8.3.2.2. Pro: Since 2016, [Muslim-majority Rohingya](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/muslim-cleansing-global-pandemic-181220084045168.html) in Rakhine State have been the targets of Myanmar armed forces and police, which have been accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide by the United Nations.
1.8.3.3. Pro: [Christians](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48146305) have been persecuted 'at genocidal level' and 'wiped out' from parts of the Middle East.
1.8.3.4. Pro: [A report](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-30001063) concluded that religious freedom was at risk from 2012 to 2014 in 116 states where religious minorities were subjected to persecution, violence and systematic discrimination.
1.9. Those whose religion, race, sexuality, or other protected characteristic excluding political activities subject them to general persecution from the population.
1.9.1. Pro: In countries where a person's identity is under threat \(e.g. homosexuality is illegal\) it is physically unsafe for the person to remain in that country and their only hope for safety is to be able to move to another country and be protected from their country of origin's laws.
1.10. Victims of human trafficking.
1.10.1. Pro: Victims of human trafficking tend to be vulnerable people, [likely having experienced trauma.](https://humantraffickingsearch.org/the-role-of-trauma-in-human-trafficking/) Asylum would bring some stability into their lives and provide opportunity for this trauma to be addressed.
1.10.2. Con: Allowing these victims to stay actually supports human traffickers, since their victims may be more willing to be trafficked knowing that if caught, they will be allowed to stay in a country liable to have higher living standards than their home.
1.10.2.1. Con: If anything that makes trafficking far more dangerous, since victims might be more willing to raise the alarm with border agents and other law enforcement knowing that they will have amnesty from the consequences, while the traffickers will be arrested.
1.10.3. Con: Technically, trafficked individuals entered a country illegally and thus should be sent back.
1.10.4. Pro: Worldwide, almost [20% of all people](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/global-report-on-trafficking-in-persons.html) being trafficked are children. These helpless victims deserve a better chance.
1.10.4.1. Pro: In some parts of [Africa and the Mekong region](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/global-report-on-trafficking-in-persons.html), children make up the majority of people being trafficked.
1.11. Victims of domestic violence.
1.11.1. Pro: Women running from [domestic violence](https://www.juancole.com/2019/02/reasons-running-country.html) often have no other options in their home country.
1.11.1.1. Con: Many countries have legal protections and charities that directly engage with victims of domestic violence in order to help them transition out of their abusive situation.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: Using the services available within their own country is a better option for these victims. Uprooting their whole lives to another country makes it even harder for them to leave an abusive environment.
1.11.1.2. Con: In domestic violence situations, some of the biggest barriers to leaving the violent relationship are not physical, but psychological. An asylum process does not offer any additional help to this psychological process \(that the victim must go through in order to leave their abusive relationship\).
1.11.1.2.1. Con: Even if this is not the most effective option \(i.e. not a good 'first line option', asylum should still be granted on this basis so that some victims can be helped through asylum.
