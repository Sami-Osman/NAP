Discussion Name: Should The Date of Australia Day Be Changed?

1. The date of Australia Day should be changed.
1.1. Pro: Australia Day has no long standing history, so there should be less resistance to change.
1.1.1. Con: Australia Day shouldn't need history as a holiday as the date is directly linked to a significant event \(arrival of the first fleet\). It's not like Mothers Day, which is an arbitrary date.
1.1.2. Con: Australia is one of the worlds oldest liberal democracies. This is a long standing history.
1.1.2.1. Con: British ships didn't arrive in Australia until [1788](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Australia_\(1788â€“1850\)), around the late modern era. It's recent in history.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) may have started as early as 28 years prior.
1.1.2.2. Con: However, Australia was not created until 1 January 1901
1.1.2.3. Con: Australia did not become a democracy until after the ratifying of the state's constitutions in the 1890s and agreed upon by parliament [in 1901.](https://questions.peo.gov.au/questions/how-did-australia-become-a-democracy/22#:~:text=Many%20would%20say%20that%20the,democracy%20was%20federation%20in%201901.&text=The%20Constitution%20was%20approved%20by,to%20by%20the%20British%20Parliament.)
1.1.2.4. Pro: Australia's democratic government was established [before most other democracies.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/countries-are-the-worlds-oldest-democracies)
1.1.3. Pro: 56% of Australians [don't care](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/most-dont-care-when-australia-day-is-held-poll-finds-20180116-h0j0w9.html) when the national day is held.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Most Australians celebrate Australia Day only because [they want some patriotic holiday](https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/australia-day-invasion-day). As such, they have little allegiance to this specific date.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Many groups and corporations are already not abiding by the current date, opting instead to [change the date themselves](https://www.australianethical.com.au/blog/australia-day-need-change-date/).
1.1.3.2.1. Con: At best, this gives employees the chance to take a different day off if they want to. Most people will still feel pressured to take Australia Day off.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Since not all [corporations](https://mumbrella.com.au/why-brands-should-think-twice-about-celebrating-australia-day-495561) allow workers to work on Australia Day, if people want to spend time with friends and family, they will still have to take that day off.
1.1.3.3. Con: The polling on the matter differs widely, with some polling finding support for the date of January 26th at [70%](https://ipa.org.au/publications-ipa/media-releases/majority-australians-support-australia-day-26-january).
1.1.3.4. Con: The Australian Government has thus far been [reluctant](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-42798864) to change the date of Australia Day.
1.1.3.5. Pro: If most do not care, then moving it to a more agreeable date for those that are offended should not be a problem.
1.1.4. Pro: The date of Australia Day has changed [many times before](https://www.marieclaire.com.au/abolish-australia-day-change-the-date) it was settled on the 26th of January.
1.1.4.1. Pro: [Australia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day) has only been observed as a public holiday on January 26th since 1994.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: January 26 has been celebrated for [much longer than since 1994](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12863098). The first public holiday on the date was in 1838 and there are records which suggest celebrations were held on this date as early as 1808.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: "By 1935, all states of Australia were celebrating the 26th of January as [Australia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day#Centenary_celebration:_1839_to_1935)."
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: It was never meant to be directly January 16th as well. Originally it was intended to be "The [closest Monday](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-26/australia-day-history/11901780?nw=0) to January 26th" and change yearly.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: The [Australia Natives Association](https://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/A/Australian%20Natives%20Association.htm#:~:text=In%201952%20the%20ANA%20overcame,on%20paying%20benefits%20to%20members.), a white nationalist lobby group, was a key player in advocating for a January 26th date.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: The ANA is widely considered to be [a hate group](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-26/australia-day-history/11901780?nw=0) that advocated, amongst other racist policies, a "White Australia."
1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The ANA even opposed intermarriage between Germans and Australians on the basis of ["racial purity"](https://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/A/Australian%20Natives%20Association.htm#:~:text=In%201952%20the%20ANA%20overcame,on%20paying%20benefits%20to%20members.)
1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: The ANA was a [whites-only society.](https://nativistherald.com.au/2018/01/19/the-racial-nationalist-origin-of-australia-day/)
1.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: The ANA was so influential in the eventual choice of January 16th that Australia Day was often referred to as ["ANA Day."](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/why-australia-day-survives-despite-revealing-a-nations-wounds/9344230)
1.1.4.2. Pro: Prior to the establishment of Australia day as January 26th, the individual states and territories celebrated Australia day on [individual, different days.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-26/australia-day-history/11901780?nw=0)
1.1.4.3. Con: It is best not to disrupt the average Australian, [77% of which](https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/australia-day-invasion-day) believe Australia Day has always been held on the 26th.
1.2. Pro: The current date reflects a day of great tragedy for the Aboriginal people of Australia.
1.2.1. Pro: According to the leader of the Aboriginal community, [Simon Japandgari Fisher](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-26/what-do-remote-aboriginal-communities-think-of-australia-day/9363470), his people do not celebrate Australia Day because it is the beginning of tragedy for them.
1.2.1.1. Pro: January 26th marks the [start of the decline](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-17/brooke-boney-weighs-in-on-debate-around-australia-day-date/10723276) of Aboriginal self-governance and the beginning of their oppression by white settlers.
1.2.1.2. Con: Several examples of [long-lasting friendship and cooperation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-06/living-with-the-locals-stories-of-first-contact-survival/9613098) exist between the original settlers and the aboriginal people of Australia.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: This was the [exception](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/18/forced-to-build-their-own-pyres-dozens-more-aboriginal-massacres-revealed-in-killing-times-research), rather than the rule.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Ins several of these examples, the settlers [looked down upon the aboriginals](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-06/living-with-the-locals-stories-of-first-contact-survival/9613098) they come across and often imagined themselves as "captives" living among them.
1.2.1.3. Pro: The Aboriginal's first started declaring a ["day of mourning"](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-26/australia-day-history/11901780?nw=0) in 1938 to protest their treatment at the hands of white settlers.
1.2.2. Con: The sins of the parent cannot be blamed on the children. Current Australians are blameless for their ancestors' actions.
1.2.2.1. Con: We can, however, benefit from their actions to the detriment of indigenous Australians, so this is not a good argument.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Passing the sins of the father on the son sets an extremely bad precedent, while being aware of the sins is good, actively punishing the child, regardless of whether or not they benefited from it is incredibly dangerous.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: As beneficiaries of their ancestors, Australians and especially the Australian government hold responsibility to repair the damage they have done, just like the families of Nazis that owed the proceeds of those atrocities to the surviving Jewish families of the holocaust.
1.2.2.2. Pro: At some point finger pointing and blaming must stop if a fully realised future is to be actualised.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: This claim rests on a reaction to a misunderstanding. The point of the date change is a request for decency and truthful acknowledgement of a whole and inclusive history, which provides for a fully realised future for all. Blame is not a factor.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: A date change is not about finger pointing, but about acknowledgement.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Acknowledgment can come without a date change.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: Asking for a change in what day Australia as a nation celebrates their identity is not blaming or finger pointing.
1.2.2.3. Con: Symbolism is a deep part of the psychology of mankind. While current Australians may not be personally responsible, and should not be held personally responsible, gestures to pull people together can be helpful.
1.2.2.4. Pro: In 2008, The Australian Prime Minister made a [formal apology](https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/national-apology#:~:text=On%2013%20February%202008%20Prime,child%20removal%20and%20Indigenous%20assimilation.) to Australia's Indigenous peoples.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: The "Sorry", while essential, has allowed people to dismiss the issue rather than engage with it more. There has been minimal meaningful change to back it up.
1.2.2.5. Con: Changing the date is not a means to blame individuals but to acknowledge history.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Changing the date seems more like whitewashing history than acknowledging it.
1.2.2.6. Con: The actions that disadvantaged aboriginals did not occur in the far past, and many [still have effects](https://newmatilda.com/2016/01/26/change-the-date-read-this-if-you-want-to-know-why-australia-day-is-so-offensive-to-aboriginal-people/) to this day.
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: The famous Mabo High Court decision that formally recognized that Aboorignals had owned the land prior to the invasion of White settlers, was only decided [in 1992.](https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/mabo-case)
1.2.3. Pro: The original Australians have suffered because of white settlement.
1.2.3.1. Con: The original Australians are not being harmed today. Today, the descendants of the original Australians can choose to play victims of something that is not happening, or participate as equals.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: The original Australians are being harmed today. Rates of [incarceration](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs\@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4517.0~2016~Main%20Features~Imprisonment%20rates~12) and [suicide](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-natsisps-strat-toc~mental-natsisps-strat-1~mental-natsisps-strat-1-ab) rates are way too high. [Life expectancy](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/deaths/contents/life-expectancy) is lower. Especially the ratios at the bottom.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: It is important for societies to look forward and forgive the past.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: There is clear evidence of continuing disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous Australia - so there is harm. \[[Close The Gap campaign](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-social-justice/projects/close-gap-indigenous-health)
1.2.3.2. Pro: [Aboriginals](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/aboriginal-people-driven-their-land) are forced off their own land.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The white settlers tricked many aboriginals into signing [leases for the land](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/forgotten-struggle-australias-aboriginal-people) that they did not understand.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: These leases later became [a justification](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/forgotten-struggle-australias-aboriginal-people) for the forcible relocation of the aboriginals from the land.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Many Aboriginal children suffer [intergenerational trauma](https://www.kidsmatter.edu.au/health-and-community/enewsletter/trauma-and-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-children).
1.2.3.3.1. Con: The scientific evidence for intergenerational trauma is [circumstantial at best.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/mind-epigenetics-genes.html)
1.2.3.4. Con: A date change does not change the atrocities that took place on January 26th.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Many consider the treatment of Indigenous Australians by white settlers to be [genocide.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront)
1.2.3.5.1. Con: A date change does not erase any atrocities.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Con: Keeping the current date is perceived as a systemic erasure of the atrocities that deepens the hurt and division.
1.2.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: Australia Day is currently treated as a celebration by the majority of Australians. The current date seems to do little to remind the majority of the the past atrocities and ongoing inter-generational trauma and marginalisation affecting Aboriginal peoples.
1.2.3.5.1.2. Pro: It will not change the under lining problems and there would still be protests on the new day because people will still go on about it promoting the invasion of Australia.
1.2.3.5.1.2.1. Con: Fremantle were able to change the date and nature of their own celebrations by [talking](https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/aboriginal-elders-break-silence-on-fremantle-australia-day-saga-20161129-gt012e.html) to local indigenous groups and do not have any issues with protests.
1.2.3.5.1.3. Pro: The first fleet may have arrived on this date but the crimes did not. So the date is a moot point .
1.2.3.5.1.4. Con: The purpose of a date change is not to erase past atrocities, but to show respect to the Aboriginal people
1.2.3.5.1.5. Pro: Recognition of the past and the mistakes which had been committed helps to forge a national identity inclusive of the indigenous as well as those who call Australia home. It is a day of resounding pride, sorrow, and regret.
1.2.3.5.1.5.1. Con: Australia Day cannot both be a day of sorrow and regret as well as one of pride and celebration. This notion quite accurately explains why there is so much division over the day, many are filled with sorrow and others are filled with joy.
1.2.3.5.1.6. Pro: There is [nothing to be gained](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/asia/australia-day-2018-date-debate-intl/index.html) by agonizing over the date of Australia's national day.
1.2.3.5.1.7. Con: A date change, particularly if supported by the majority of Australians, is a powerful acknowledgement of past trauma and an important step towards reconciliation
1.2.3.5.2. Con: Australia Day's celebration has never traditionally been about celebrating the tragedies that surrounded white settlement.
1.2.3.5.2.1. Con: "When Parkes \(the then Premier of NSW\) was planning the upcoming celebrations of the 100 year anniversary, he was asked what â€”- if anything â€” was being planned for Aboriginal people in the Centenary events." \([source](https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/01/18/10-things-you-should-know-about-january-26)\)
1.2.3.5.2.2. Con: In [1938](https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/01/18/10-things-you-should-know-about-january-26), protests wanted to rename it "The day of mourning." but instead, aboriginals Aboriginals were forced to reenact the landing of the fist first fleet.
1.2.3.5.3. Pro: Many Australians refer to it as '[Invasion Day](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/australia/australia-day-morrison-citizenship-intl/index.html)'.
1.2.3.5.3.1. Pro: The date was chosen to mark the arrival of the First Fleet, the direct consequences of which were the attempted elimination of a people and their culture.
1.2.3.5.3.2. Pro: Since that date, Aboriginals have underwent [armed conflict, massacres, forced relocation, and the stealing of reasources.](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-26-january-is-the-most-controversial-date-on-the-australian-calendar)
1.2.3.5.3.3. Con: Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has [previously decried](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-26-january-is-the-most-controversial-date-on-the-australian-calendar) attempts to label Australia Day as "Invasion Day" as attacks on Australian patriotism.
1.2.3.5.3.3.1. Pro: Some city councils have been [stripped of their rights](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/darebin-and-yarra-councils-start-the-australia-day-conversation-20170822-gy1ybe.html) to hold citizenship ceremonies due to labelling Australia day as Invasion Day.
1.2.3.5.4. Pro: There is a [historical record](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/04/massacre-map-australia-the-killing-times-frontier-wars) of the mass killings of Aboriginal people from 1788 to 1928.
1.2.4. Pro: If it offends people, the date should be changed.
1.2.4.1. Con: People will be offended with any other date because people are offended by change.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: People are too easily offended by things these days creating the phrase [generation snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Snowflake).
1.2.4.2. Con: Offence alone is not meaningful reason to change the date. The underlying reason for that offence needs to be understood, and meaningful action to address that specifically applied.
1.2.4.3. Pro: [In 2018](https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/26/australia-day-also-called-invasion-day-protests-7262356/), over 60,000 people gathered in Melbourne opposing Australia Day, calling for its dismissal.
1.2.5. Con: There will be no end if Australia continues to make concessions to Aboriginals.
1.2.5.1. Con: There is little equality and many ongoing disparities between Aboriginals and non-indigenous communities. A date change is about the smallest concession deserved.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: This economic inequality has led to a [significant gap in the health](https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/the-wound/indigenous-disadvantage-in-australia/) of non-indigenous and Aboriginal people.
1.2.5.2. Con: This is an example of a [slippery slope fallacy](https://www.logicalfallacies.info/presumption/slippery-slope/), it is possible to change the date of Australia day without making endless concessions to Aboriginals.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: In 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered a [national apology](https://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/our-people/apology-to-australias-indigenous-peoples) for wrong doings to Indiginous Australians. That did not start an endless cycle of concessions for Aboriginals.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: One request does not equate to progressive requests.
1.2.5.3. Con: By this logic, nobody should ever apologise or try to help anyone less they be expected to apologise ever again or help anyone ever again.
1.2.6. Pro: It was the commencement of hostile actions against a relatively peaceful peoples.
1.2.7. Pro: It was one of the [largest human trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet) events in history with three quarters of the Europeans who arrived being forcibly trafficked 24,000 km.
1.2.8. Pro: The landing was [celebrated](https://historycollection.com/australia-day-secrets-12-incredible-things-never-knew-first-fleet/6/) with a massive rape orgy.
1.3. Con: Changing the date of Australia Day would lessen the impact and visibility of Invasion Day protests. The uglier aspects of Australia's origin belong as part of the National Holiday.
1.3.1. Con: The indigenous communities, with a resounding voice, disagree with the notion that the national holiday should commemorate their suffering.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Indigenous communities should be listened to, they have lost so much and are still largely disenfranchised.
1.3.2. Pro: Invasion day protests are protesting the decision to celebrate Australian identity with the day that the English invaded and implemented a government body that committed countless atrocities that still dramatically affect the aboriginal community to this day.
1.3.2.1. Con: There exist no shortage of [historical myths](https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/australian-history/get-over-it/) that exclude indigenous people that can be protested against.
1.3.2.2. Pro: These protests are important because they portray the problems faced by indigenous people are [structural](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095771817301044), rather than relating to individual political and economic issues.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Protesting over specific economic issues, for example, may convey the message that solving anti-Indigenous prejudice is a matter of making small policy changes.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Continuing to fight over the way history is remembered, maintains the message that white supremacy is enshrined in the very history and culture of Australia.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: If this is the case, the only reasonable response must be to challenge these cultural institutions.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: It is unlikely that people will forget how ingrained anti-Indigenous discrimination is in their country.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Many of the worst crimes committed against Indigenous people happened very recently, like the [Stolen Generations](https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/australian-history/stolen-generations).
1.3.3. Con: The uglier aspects of Australia's origin are acknowledged on other days [\(National Sorry Day\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sorry_Day). Australia Day should be reserved as a day of unity.
1.3.3.1. Con: Australia is a national public holiday. National Sorry Day is not.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: People get days off of work on Australia Day and [national events](https://www.australia.com/en/events/arts-culture-and-music/australia-day.html) are planned.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: [Intricate events](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/australia-marks-sixth-anniversary-national-sorry-day) are planned for National Sorry Day which all people can engage with.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: National Sorry Day often has [more political goals](https://www.reconciliation.org.au/national-sorry-day-2020/) and is not seen as a day of unity.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: National Sorry Day has [increased acceptance](https://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/bn/0708/bringingthemhomereport) of the discrimination faced by the indigenous community and created real political change.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: This a [widespread movement](https://www.change.org/p/make-sorry-day-on-february-13th-a-public-holiday) advocating for Sorry Day's establishment as a national public holiday.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Having separate days would allow greater recognition for the problems faced by indigenous people without incurring backlash from those skeptical of the date change.
1.3.4. Pro: These protests provide great visibility to Indigenous people by constantly forcing non-indigenous people to reconsider the colonial and violent past of Australia.
1.3.4.1. Con: Giving a victory to indigenous people's movements by changing the date would give more confidence to those fighting for change in these communities, enabling them to demand change on more fronts.
1.3.4.2. Con: If these passionate protests fail to result in some kind of change, those who join them may simply tire or see their efforts as pointless. This will diminish the protests.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: For example, part of why Occupy Wall Street failed was because many participants [felt their movement was simply being ignored](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/why-are-our-protests-failing-and-how-can-we-achieve-social-change-today). They felt it, therefore, was not worth protesting.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Even when individual protest movements fail, they can often succeed in changing the way the public thinks about an issue. These protests may make people more understanding of future indigenous demands.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Changing the date of the holiday will do little to change people's minds. What is needed is a persistent movement to demonstrate the impact of colonialism on indigenous people.
1.4. Con: The indigenous people have many greater problems to solve that are more important than symbolism.
1.4.1. Con: Symbolism is important as it sends a message of support and encouragement to the minority from the majority. Changing the date sends a message of respect to aboriginal people that we value their culture and we regret the negative impacts of invasion.
1.4.1.1. Con: Engaging in symbolic debate takes up political capital that could otherwise be used to make real change.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: There may be a backlash if the date is changed and yet the discussion about Aboriginal genocide persists. Therefore, it is better to expend these resources fighting for policy change.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: People often fear wide-ranging, rapid change. It tends to foster [reactionary populist movements](https://www.international.gc.ca/country_news-pays_nouvelles/2019-10-08-germany-allemagne.aspx?lang=eng). Therefore, the movement for Aboriginal rights should focus on the most important issues.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The goal is not to make non-indigenous Australians feel threatened, but to help them learn the [traumatic history](https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/australian-history/get-over-it/) of indigenous people. Greater awareness of that may make them more amenable to later changes.
1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The most important way to teach these is to challenge the dominant historical narratives about Australia. Changing the date of Australia Day is a key way of doing that.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Non-indigenous people do not yet have enough political capital to make widespread structural reforms.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Successful symbolic measures, like this, can increase a group's political capital.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many indigenous performers and musicians were given a national platform from [the first Survival Day](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/blogs/images-survival-day) protest concerts in 1992.
1.4.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Aboriginal Yabun festivals, held on the current Australia Day date as a protest, have allowed more Australians to familiarize themselves with Aboriginal culture.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The symbols we use to define our countries are meant to make us feel comfortable. Symbols which alienate the very people they are meant to represent makes those people feel unwelcome in their home.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Such a symbolic gesture may build cultural pride and respect both within Aboriginal culture and throughout broader Australian cultural groups that may help alleviate some of the other problems in both aboriginal and wider Australian society.
1.4.2. Con: The indigenous people are the authority on what problems are of the greatest importance to them. If they believe the day should be changed, this should not be undermined by what others feel is more important to them.
1.4.2.1. Pro: This is a day of grief for many, and not mere symbolism. It is a on a day that celebrates the start of the many, many injustices and harm done to the indigenous people.
1.4.2.2. Con: The separation of Australians into [two categories](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/indigenous-treaty-would-divide-australia-into-two-nations-according-to-race-20170530-gwgcjm.html), either settlers or aboriginals, promotes the division of Australia.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Any separation, on the [basis of race](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/equal-protection-and-race), is unjust.
1.4.3. Pro: Opposing the date may sideline some of the severe issues of discrimination face by indigenous people.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Indigenous Australians have shorter life spans than non-indigenous Australians [aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/indigenous-australians/mortality-life-expectancy-2008-2012/contents/summary)
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Shorter lifespan is attributable to genetic and cultural differences, as well as poor lifestyle choices. Shorter life span is not something that New Australians do to Aboriginals.
1.4.3.2. Pro: There is a higher rate of domestic violence in indigineous communities. [www.ntnews.com.au](https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/joe-hildebrands-take-on-the-australia-day-date-debate/news-story/1bd2fce2810645eadb263e2c1f37314c?fbclid=IwAR2LxMIc6z71gPxrf4r16YZQvQ4_G6BPw_al-topwlSFx3l_Fk840ezLK9o&nk=03d5a28ee36cb58d69411cc86f6a71bc-1548851047)
1.4.3.3. Con: The problems experienced by the indigenous people and the date of Australia Day can be resolved simultaneously.
1.4.3.4. Pro: [Many](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/09/indigenous-people-are-being-displaced-again-by-gentrification-aboriginal-redfern-west-end-fitzroy) indigenous Australians are being displaced due to gentrification. Changing a date is not as important as losing one's home.
1.4.3.5. Con: It is not only the responsibility of the Indigenous people to solve such problems.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: Most of the problems that need to be solved are those inflicted upon them by English rule. If the Australians who represent the crown won't even change the day in which we celebrate our identity, that may be why the problems the indigenous community faces are so great.
1.5. Con: It is the way Australia Day is acknowledged, rather than the date itself, that should be changed.
1.5.1. Pro: Including more about the atrocities against its native people would help acknowledge them as part of the national Australian culture.
1.5.1.1. Con: Indigenous history is often whitewashed when elites attempt to incorporate their history into the national culture.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Stories of violence are [often sanitized](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-09/white-washed-stories-of-frontier-massacres-told-in-exhibition/9134816) to ensure they do not offend white Australians.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Stories of unity often focus on [similarities](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2018/08/12/we-can-no-longer-afford-to-whitewash-our-history.html) between non-indigenous and indigenous people, rather than celebrating their cultural differences.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: Cultural change is a slow process: sometimes it is necessary to not offend people's identities to ensure they are more receptive to the inclusion of other people.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Unity is fostered through national myths. Building new ones that include indigenous people would change the way Australians think of themselves.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: No national myth stands alone. We can use a variety of celebrations to shine lights on multiple attrocities.
1.5.1.3. Con: It is not necessary to ["pull Australia Day down"](https://www.newsweek.com/australia-day-change-date-1304158) to give recognition to the sufferings and achievements of the Aboriginal communities.
1.5.2. Con: If the very meaning of the holiday is being changed, changing the date is a relatively minor change.
1.5.2.1. Con: Keeping the date may have more signficance if the meaning of the holiday is changed.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The current date can remind us of our complicated history \(to accept our guilt and grief\), but also allow us to recognise and continue our growth as a nation.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: It doesn't though, Australia day is considered a celebration not a sombre reflection.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: The reclamation of the date would itself be a major symbolic advancement in the recognition of indigenous people.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: The day may become associated with a break from the colonial history of the country.
1.5.2.1.2.2. Pro: [Marginalized groups frequently reclaim words and symbols](https://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2013-03-08/editorials/reclaiming-words/) which have previously oppressed them as a means of cultivating identity and reorienting their public discussion.
1.5.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Reclamation diminishes the impact of previously oppressive symbols by allowing marginalized people to 'take control' of those symbols.
1.5.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Reclamation allows harmful symbols to continue to exist. Australians would still be celebrating the day colonization began, which will preserve its traumatic memory.
1.5.2.1.2.3. Con: Reclamation is given meaning through the struggle required to change the meaning of symbols. However, opposition to changing Australia Day is not institutional. It emanates from a conservative minority.
1.5.2.1.2.3.1. Con: [71% of people](https://ipa.org.au/publications-ipa/media-releases/new-poll-71-of-australians-support-australia-day-on-26-january) do not think Indigenous people can celebrate being Australian on Australia Day. Reclamation is needed to expose how that belief is inconsistent.
1.5.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: Opposition to changing the date is largely spurred on by [political parties](https://www.liberal.org.au/celebrating-australia-day) and commentators seeking to demonize their political competitors.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: Keeping the date would continually provide reactionary groups the ability to drum up controversy about the new meaning of the celebrations.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: Cultural divisions, like these, [often take violent and regressive dimensions](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/09/tories-culture-war-right-fearless-boris-johnson-war-on-woke) when voters are angry at politics in general.
1.5.2.1.3.2. Con: After the date is changed, those continuing to support it will be delegitimized as people will eventually care less about this cultural battle.
1.5.3. Con: National Days are meant to inspire patriotism and pride in one's nation.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Historian Eugene Webern described this process like turning ["peasants into Frenchmen."](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-22/why-australia-day-survives-despite-revealing-a-nations-wounds/9344230)
1.5.4. Pro: Australia Day should focus more on [national unity and respect,](https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/australia-day-invasion-day) rather than BBQ's drunkenness, and celebration.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Including more Aboriginal traditions, events, and recognitions would make Australia Day and an event everyone could take pride in.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Many [aboriginal traditions](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-26/australia-day-celebrations/10753058) have been included in Australia Day festivities to great success.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: This may lead to non-indigenous Australians appropriating Aboriginal culture and traditions.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: It can often lead to indigenous people losing out on the profits from things like cultural celebrations as [non-indigenous groups attempt to cash in](https://theconversation.com/indigenous-cultural-appropriation-what-not-to-do-86679) on their popularity.
1.5.4.1.2.2. Pro: White Australians have [already appropriated](https://theconversation.com/indigenous-cultural-appropriation-what-not-to-do-86679) many aspects of Aboriginal culture.
1.5.4.1.2.3. Con: More [cultural exchange](http://www.thelongwalk.com.au/Programs/Indigenous-Cultral-Exchange) between settler and aboriginal Australians could help decrease ethnic tensions.
1.5.4.1.2.3.1. Con: Cultural exchange is not the same as appropriation, and most forms of settler Australians engaging in Aboriginal culture has been for [profit making purposes.](https://www.lutzker.com/cultural-appropriation-the-lack-of-legal-protection-for-indigenous-australian-art/)
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Including Aboriginal cultural festivities could help aboriginal communities [grow culturally](https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/arts/aboriginal-cultural-festivals) and revitalize their cultural expression.
1.5.4.1.4. Con: Aboriginals are [already able](https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/australia-day-invasion-day) to celebrate or demonstrate on Australia Day without official incorporation of these activities into the National Day.
1.5.5. Con: Australia Day should be canceled altogether, rather than have the date changed.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Localities have already moved in some parts of Australia to [cancel Australia Day celebrations.](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/sydney-council-to-cancel-australia-day-celebrations/video/4f436e599fb36b89fe5875dea0819ce7)
1.5.5.2. Pro: Until Australia is able to treat its Aboriginal people with [equal respect and rights](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/25/celebrating-nationhood-on-26-january-has-become-a-gratuitous-act-of-hostility) under the law, "there will be no appropriate date upon which to celebrate \[Australia Day\]."
1.6. Pro: The 26th of January commemorates the establishment of the first settlement in the colony of [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_South_Wales). This is not the same as Australia.
1.6.1. Pro: There are other dates, which are equally important in founding modern Australia, that could instead be celebrated.
1.6.1.1. Con: There can only be one day where the creators of the current Australia first arrived.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The people who created Australia on 1 January 1901 did not arrive in 1788. The vast majority were born in one of the colonies which became states.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: The current Australia is largely an immigrant nation. The creators of the current Australia continue to arrive every day.
1.6.1.1.3. Con: Present-day New Zealand was part of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, but it in no way follows that the national day of New Zealand should be 26 January
1.6.1.1.4. Pro: Australia should celebrate its colonisation as its national day as it recognises how Britain brought modern civilisation, medicine and technology to this continent.
1.6.1.1.4.1. Con: The privileges Western colonizers were able to accrue largely came from the [theft, plunder and violence](https://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-plunder-that-was-colonialism-115031201281_1.html) they inflicted on indigenous people. It is untrue to claim Britain 'brought' modern civilization.
1.6.1.1.4.2. Con: The [massacres carried out by British soldiers](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/the-killing-times-the-massacres-of-aboriginal-people-australia-must-confront) can be described as precisely 'uncivilized'.
1.6.1.2. Pro: [December 17th](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-06/indigenous-recognition-timeline-of-australian-history/6586176) marks the date in which all indigenous people of Australia were given the right to vote.
1.6.1.3. Pro: [May 27th 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Australian_referendum_\(Aboriginals\)), the Australian referendum resulted in amendments to the Constitution including indigenous Australians in the population. This date can be celebrated as Australia Day.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: May 27 is already observed as part of National Reconciliation Week. It would be wrong to appropriate this day. [reconciliation.org.au](https://www.reconciliation.org.au/national-reconciliation-week/)
1.6.1.3.2. Con: While this is a significant moment, it is not a date celebrating all Australians but the inclusion of a minority group within the nation, which, while important, is not about all Australians becoming a nation.
1.6.1.4. Pro: Most [national days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_day) celebrate [independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_independence_days), nationhood or [liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Day) rather than colonisation.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: This is an example of an [appeal to popularity](https://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/appeals/appeal-to-popularity/), the day on which other countries celebrate should not necessarily have bearing on Australia.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: By celebrating nationhood rather than colonization, leaders of oppressed minorities can be given a platform that their followers feel comfortable supporting.
1.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: Often times those minorities played large roles in the struggles which are being celebrated.
1.6.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Indigenous Australian soldiers played [significant roles](https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/indigenous) in Australia's forces in both World Wars.
1.6.1.4.3. Con: National holidays are almost always [politically turbulent.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-24/australia-day-and-national-days-politics-around-world/11886420)
1.6.1.4.3.1. Pro: The U.S.' Independence Day is often seen as [non-inclusive](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-24/australia-day-and-national-days-politics-around-world/11886420), as very few people were truly granted "independence" on that day.
1.6.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: At the time of the writing of the Declaration of Independence, [slavery](https://www.wbur.org/artery/2019/07/03/black-american-fourth-of-july) was still prominent throughout the American Colonies and would continue to be present for many years to come.
1.6.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The main writer of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, was a [prominent slave-owner.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-dark-side-of-thomas-jefferson-35976004/#:~:text=In%20his%20lifetime%20Jefferson%20owned,%2C%20in%201817%2C%20was%20140.)
1.6.1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Over the course of Jefferson's lifetime, he owned over [600 slaves.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-dark-side-of-thomas-jefferson-35976004/#:~:text=In%20his%20lifetime%20Jefferson%20owned,%2C%20in%201817%2C%20was%20140.)
1.6.1.4.3.2. Pro: The United Kingdom's [St. George's Day](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-24/australia-day-and-national-days-politics-around-world/11886420) is often a point of contention for parts of the commonwealth who have felt subjected to English dominance over their cultures such as Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.
1.6.1.4.3.3. Con: Many holidays are unambiguously celebrated because they represent the country coming together as a whole.
1.6.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Greece celebrates '[Oxi Day](https://www.officeholidays.com/holidays/greece/greece-national-day)', the day the Greek government refused to capitulate to the Axis Powers, leading to mass mobilization against the subsequent Italian invasion.
1.6.1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Australia [also fought against the Axis Powers](https://www.awmlondon.gov.au/australians-in-wwii) who mounted attacks on the mainland. Celebrating the fight against these powers is a far better affirmation of national history.
1.6.1.4.3.4. Con: National holidays should always be questioned.
1.6.1.4.3.4.1. Pro: National holidays are a way of defining the [values, history and culture of a country](https://www.franksonnenbergonline.com/blog/tradition-the-true-meaning-of-holidays/). If they are used to perpetuate harmful power relations, they should be opposed.
1.6.1.4.3.4.2. Pro: Most often, national holidays are decided by people in power, who tend to be highly privileged.
1.6.1.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: These people do not represent the average people in their countries. Therefore, they should not have a monopoly on defining their country's culture and values.
1.6.1.4.3.4.3. Con: National holidays should be opportunities for unity.
1.6.1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: There exist many other theaters to dispute the values and culture of one's country. A national holiday lets people take a break from those battles and celebrate what they share.
1.6.1.4.4. Pro: On [May 9th, 1901](https://independentaustralia.net/australia/australia-display/australias-future-republic-day--the-9th-of-may,6459) various colonies in Australia joined together to form a federation. This can be celebrated instead.
1.6.1.4.4.1. Con: Major public holidays should not be too close together. May 9 is usually within a week of May Day, which is a public holiday in the Northern Territory. .[onlydarwin.com.au](https://www.onlydarwin.com.au/53419/may-day-northern-territory)
1.6.1.4.5. Pro: Unlike Australia, few if any other countries have a national day which marks the anniversary of when they became a colony. National days should celebrate independence or self-determination in some way.
1.6.1.4.5.1. Con: Such days are not entirely unknown. South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands has a national day that is literally called ["Possession Day"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands) which celebrates the day the islands were claimed for Britain by Captain Cook.
1.6.1.4.5.1.1. Con: South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands is a British Overseas Territory. It is not an independent nation like Australia.
1.6.1.4.5.1.2. Con: The Falklands Islands had such a day but moved away from it in recent years [\[Falklands Day\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_Day)
1.6.1.4.5.2. Pro: One [January 1st, 1901](https://www.australia.gov.au/about-government/how-government-works/federation), Australia became an independent nation. This can be celebrated instead.
1.6.1.4.5.2.1. Con: New Year's Day is an inconvenient date for a national day. It is already a public holiday and lots of people stay up late the night before.
1.6.1.4.5.3. Pro: March 3, 1986 is the date that Australia officially became an independent nation. This would be a good date to celebrate Australia Day. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Act_1986)
1.6.1.4.5.3.1. Pro: It will still be warm enough to enjoy Australia Day festivities at the beach, where they are usually held, on the 3rd of March since it is barely after summer.
1.6.1.4.5.3.2. Pro: It will be further away from New Years.
1.6.1.5. Con: The 26th of January is an extremely convenient date for a national day in the Southern Hemisphere, as it almost perfectly matches the end of Summer holidays. There are no other nationally meaningful dates which fall around then.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: Australians love the beach and late January is around central summer where it's still hot, but far enough from the soloists that it isn't too hot for the beach.
1.6.1.5.2. Pro: It's towards the end of school holidays so kids can enjoy it before they go back.
1.6.1.5.3. Con: The weather and convenience of the date should not be a consideration for the date of Australia Day.
1.6.2. Pro: Aboriginals were already living in Australia for nearly [60,000 years](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-26-january-is-the-most-controversial-date-on-the-australian-calendar) prior to this date.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Claiming that the history of Australia begins on January 26, 1788, ignores this immense history.
1.6.2.2. Pro: This feeds into the narrative that all 'Australian' history is just that which occurred after colonization, thereby erasing the culture and achievements of the Aboriginal people living there before.
1.6.2.3. Con: The mythology we build around nations must be centered around histories that all citizens have access to. Enshrining a culture and history that is so old does little to make current citizens proud.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Mythology can be linked to people far in the past, if the justification for that link is made clear enough to the people.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: Greeks still see themselves as [linked to the Ancient Greeks](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5153/sro.44).
1.6.3. Con: It is often prudent to choose the earliest possible date to celebrate one's nation, as that allows the society to take a holistic look at their history.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Placing Australia Day on the day of the first English colonizers not only forces us to contend with the actions of the English but also identify with them, that is, to show our responsibility for them.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: This reckoning rarely happens as the day is coded as a festive one, meaning people celebrate the actions of the English rather than scrutinizing them.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The scrutiny that happens in the media and in schools is given force because of its festivities, since people care about the day enough in the first place.
1.6.3.2. Con: If that be the case, then choose the earlier date that white settlers [arrived in Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-26/australia-day-history/11901780?nw=0) in April of 1770.
1.6.4. Pro: The beginning of colonisation is an English achievement. Australia day is for celebrating Australian identity.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The harm done by the way colonisation happened is not the Australian identity that should be celebrated.
1.6.4.2. Con: Insofar as this was the first colony of what now makes up Australia, it is reasonable for this date to be seen as the first step to establishing the country we know today.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: While American Independence Day [may not refer to the establishment of the other 37 states](https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/july-4th), it is seen as a foundational day in the creation of the contemporary United States.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The colony of New South Wales does not represent, in character or in scope, the modern state of Australia.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: The American 13 colonies are not a representation of contemporary America, but they were a key stage in the development of the current state.
