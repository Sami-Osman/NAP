They could be used to prevent the US federal government from committing such crimes as well.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: The [United Nations Security Council](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/information) has the authority to impose sanctions. Since the United States has [veto power](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/un-security-council) in the Security Council, it can strike down a resolution that aims to impose sanctions on it.
