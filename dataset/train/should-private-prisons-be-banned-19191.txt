Discussion Name: Should private prisons be banned?

1. Private prisons should be banned.
1.1. Pro: Private prisons being payed daily/monthly per prisoner incentivizes prisons to keep prisoners in jail for as long as possible.
1.1.1. Pro: The private prison industry seeks, and has secured in some cases, contractual terms with governments that require prison [populations](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/private-prison-quotas_n_3953483.html) be kept at certain levels, or governments can be [sued](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-prisons-securities-idUSKCN10Z2JU) and the public made to pay. The profit motive can be at odds with the goals of reducing incarceration and recidivism.
1.1.2. Pro: On average, prisons in Missouri lengthen the sentence of inmates by [2-3 months](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2015/06/private-prisons-profit/).
1.2. Con: The public prison system is paid for by taxpayers, therefore it is in the best interest of the government to privatize prisons.
1.2.1. Pro: Private prisons may be more cost-effective for the government thus saving money in taxes.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Research suggests that "private companies can cut costs by negotiating item costs and purchasing in bulk, by eliminating overtime and employee benefits, and by reducing the red tape" in buying equipment or hiring or firing staff \([Perrone, p. 302](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jmaahs/Correctional%20Continuum/Online%20Readings/PerroneandPratt_privatization.pdf)\).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Scholars also suggest that the government could implement the same [measures](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jmaahs/Correctional%20Continuum/Online%20Readings/PerroneandPratt_privatization.pdf).
1.2.1.1.2. Con: [Researchers](http://www.d.umn.edu/~jmaahs/Correctional%20Continuum/Online%20Readings/PerroneandPratt_privatization.pdf), however, point out that privatization's cost savings may be short term only, and that long-term costs may exceed those of public prisons due to "the need to keep a stable or growing inmate population to ensure profits".
1.2.2. Con: Private prisons are employed by the government and thus its budget also comes from taxpayers' money.
1.3. Pro: Justice should be doled out by government, not by private citizens. Privatization removes an aspect of government authority from the justice process.
1.3.1. Pro: Only the government can be neutral in judging prisoners.
1.3.1.1. Con: No judge can be totally neutral, since human actions will always be influenced by personal values and opinions.
1.3.2. Con: Justice, understood as establishing by due process if someone is guilty of a crime and what is the appropriate penalty for that crime, is still carried out by the [judicial branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) of the government even when prisons are private.
1.3.3. Pro: [Private prisons](http://www.justicepolicy.org/news/12006) have a tendency of cutting corners in order to maintain low operating costs, showing that it's difficult for the government to effectively regulate private prisons and ensure that standards are met.
1.3.4. Pro: Making the prison system private removes power from the people to legislate how we want our prisons to be run, and instead hands that responsibility to private companies.
1.3.4.1. Con: The state still has the power to legislate prison standards and procedure.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Even if the state can legislate procedures and standards, if the state does not run prisons, it does lose the capacity to monitor and control them closely.
1.4. Con: The competition of the privatized prison systems leads to a fairer system. The prisons that perform better are rewarded with profits.
1.4.1. Con: Since prisons deal with people and with an integral part of law enforcement, determining what success means, unrelated to profit, may be difficult.
1.4.2. Con: Measures that lead to a greater profit typically contradict what is "fair", and lead to much poorer conditions, including cutting programs that help to rehabilitate prisoners which may be deemed "unnecessary".
1.4.3. Con: The prison system can be viewed as a ["natural monopoly"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly) like roads or the electricity grid.
1.4.4. Con: Prisoners have no choice in which prison they end up in, and the state will only seek out the most accessible deal with a private prison if there are nearby prisons close enough to compete. Since this rarely happen, there is no actual competition.
1.5. Pro: The privatization of prisons means that justice becomes an industry, meaning the goal is for costs to be kept low while profits are kept high, meaning prisoners receive substandard treatment.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.5.2. Pro: Private prisons tend [to be more violent](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/12/12454410/private-prisons-violence-investigation) due to low staffing, thus leading to a more dangerous environment for prisoners and proving this is only a for-profit industry.
1.6. Pro: Turning the prison system into a profitable system has made it too susceptible to corruption.
1.6.1. Con: Public systems can be equally corruptible.
1.6.1.1. Con: Anything is corruptible, however there is much less incentive for public sytems to be corrupt.
1.7. Con: While reducing taxes, private prisons create jobs for small communities, which generates revenue.
1.7.1. Con: Those jobs would still be created if the state was running the prison itself.
1.8. Con: Having more prisons in operation helps reduce overpopulation in prisons and helps to stem overflow.
1.8.1. Con: Having more prisons is equally possible by increasing the number of non-private prisons.
1.8.1.1. Con: Due to bureaucracy and other constrains, private prisons are quicker to create and get running than non-private ones.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: While the US federal government, for example, takes "at least two years to build a prison, private prison corporations claim they can build a prison in less than 18 months" [\(Antonuccio, p. 580\)](http://lesliecaton.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/A5-Antonuccio.pdf).
1.8.2. Pro: Due to prison overcrowding, private prisons are necessary so the government can speed up the process of creating new prisons.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.
1.8.3. Con: Another viable way to reduce prison overpopulation is to adopt restorative justice methods as an alternative to imprisonment.
1.8.3.1. Pro: "[Restorative justice](https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/02/Restorative_Justice_Report_Beckett_Kartman_2016.pdf) offers a response to interpersonal harm that can avoid over-reliance on prisons and jails while holding responsible parties accountable and offering harmed parties the opportunity to have their needs addressed."
