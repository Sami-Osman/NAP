Discussion Name: Would a global social credit system be beneficial?

1. A global social credit system would be beneficial.
1.1. Con: A global social credit system is an overreach of government power which is susceptible to abuse.
1.1.1. Pro: The metadata collected by a global social credit system may give the state immense predictive abilities, which could end up being abused by those in power.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Wielding such a massive amount of data, the government could be preemptively punish people for crimes they are statistically likely to commit. This is dystopian, unfair, and a massive violation of freedoms.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: It would likely take a significant amount of time, potentially decades, to gather enough metadata with a high level of accuracy to predict crime before it happens.
1.1.2. Con: Any system or branch of government is susceptible to abuse, regardless of the importance or purpose of the system.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that most government systems are prone to abuse is not a valid enough reason to avoid implementing a new system that could benefit society.
1.1.3. Pro: Governments will be able to use a social credit system to [control their citizens](https://www.newsweek.com/china-social-credit-system-906865)(If the Chinese government extracts a cohesive national system from the pilots' schemes and successfully implements it across the country, as planned, the Communist Party of China \(CPC\) will be able to monitor and shape the behavior of all its citizens. In other words, Xi will have total "social and political control," Samantha Hoffman, an independent analyst and visiting academic at Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Newsweek.\n\n"The system's number one objective is to keep the party in power," Hoffman said.) and remain in power.
1.1.3.1. Pro: [Protesting](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/15/china-social-credit-system-authoritarian/)(In a county in Inner Mongolia, parents were threatened with blacklisting for protesting against the enforcement of Mandarin-language curricula at local schools) is considered a negative behavior in a social credit system.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: It may not necessarily be considered so under this particular global social credit system.
1.1.4. Con: One could argue that any limitation on freedom could be an overreach of government power.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Limitations on free speech are considered by many to be an [overreach of government power](https://www.thepolicycircle.org/brief/first-amendment-free-speech-academic-freedom-america/)(This is based on the idea that laws restricting the content of speech usually violate First Amendment rights because such laws “distort public debate and contradict a basic principle of self-governance: that the government cannot be trusted to decide what ideas or information ‘the people’ should be allowed to hear.” This applies to speaking, writing, printing, and broadcasting, as well as publications on the Internet, displays and demonstrations, and even clothing.).
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: A social credit system would likely cause people to avoid expressing controversial opinions in order to maintain their score at an acceptable level.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Some limitations on free speech are [justifiable](https://www.thepolicycircle.org/brief/first-amendment-free-speech-academic-freedom-america/)(What the government can do is impose “time, place, and manner” restrictions, such as requiring permits for meetings. The government is also allowed to intervene when a protest “crosses the line from speech to action.” For the most part, however, freedom of speech is seen as necessary to self-government because it “gives the American people a ‘checking function’ against government excess and corruption.”) and do not represent an overreach of government power.
1.1.5. Pro: An effective and comprehensive social credit system requires equally effective and comprehensive surveillance, particularly in areas that were previously free from it.
1.1.5.1. Pro: In China, government representatives have been known to make [unannounced visits](https://share.america.gov/chinas-surveillance-state-an-open-air-prison-in-xinjiang/)(Uyghurs are not even alone in their own homes. They are subject to compulsory stays by Chinese officials in their private residences, which are intended to prevent the observance of Islamic practices.\n\nThe Uyghurs do not have a choice. These “relatives,” as they are called, enforce Chinese Communist Party loyalty and monitor their hosts for “extremist” tendencies, such as: Do the Uyghurs have a copy of the Quran in their home? A prayer mat? Do they hesitate when offered pork or alcohol?\n\nThese monitors have total power over their Uyghur households, reporting on their loyalty and religious practices and beliefs and recommending whether they should be sent to the internment camps, according to a report from ChinaFile, an online magazine published by the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.) to the homes of Uyghurs in order to discourage Islamic practices.
1.1.6. Pro: Proper behavior will be determined by a centralized entity and could therefore be subject to corruption.
1.1.6.1. Pro: People are [blacklisted](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/15/china-social-credit-system-authoritarian/)(Interpretative leeway means local cadres can misuse the system. One city blacklisted a citizen over online comments that supposedly caused a panic about a local COVID-19 outbreak. In a county in Inner Mongolia, parents were threatened with blacklisting for protesting against the enforcement of Mandarin-language curricula at local schools. And there is still little to prevent local officials from ignoring offenses by state-owned enterprises.) under these systems for minor violations by overzealous or corrupt administrators.
1.1.6.2. Con: This argument can be used to disqualify anything a government does. In well-functioning democracies, government corruption and overreach will be monitored and disincentivized.
1.2. Con: A social credit system could easily cover a disguised oppressive government by distracting the populace so that gamification makes them comply with rules.
1.3. Con: Human rights in places where social credit systems have been deployed have been extremely restricted.
1.3.1. Pro: The right to privacy is [nearly nonexistent](https://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-human-rights-implications-of-chinas-social-credit-system/)(The first casualty under the social credit system is the right to privacy. China’s Constitution preserves “privacy of correspondence” \(Art.40\), but scores for all 1.4 billion citizens compiled using public and private data will be made publicly available by 2020. The scheme is mandatory for all citizens – there is no opt-in or consent for data collection and end use. Private companies share user data with each other and with the government, as is evident from applications like the ‘Deadbeat Map’ which show details of any person on the government blacklist within 500 metres of a user, and allow reporting on social media. The volume of data being collected and stored also increases the risk of hacking of personal information, especially since China does not impose any security or reporting standards on data collection agencies.) under a social credit system.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition technology [monitor people's movements](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained)(The country has developed advanced facial recognition systems that are able to follow people across entire cities. In a show of power at the end of 2017, Chinese officials working in co-operation with BBC News showed how it could track down and find one of the organisation's reporters within seven minutes. The movements of journalist John Sudworth were monitored as the country's network of 170 million CCTV cameras was leveraged to follow him.) throughout a given area or city.
1.3.1.2. Con: Privacy is already [severely limited](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html) by the digital age without the need for a social credit system; every move is already tracked and recorded by smartphones.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Social credit systems use [enhanced smartphone tracking data](https://share.america.gov/chinas-surveillance-state-an-open-air-prison-in-xinjiang/)(China’s surveillance of Uyghurs extends beyond Xinjiang. Beijing and Shanghai metro stations, for example, already have facial recognition and cellphone scanning systems, says Ferkat Jawdat, a Uyghur software engineer living in the United States who in March met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the situation in Xinjiang.) to help determine how people are behaving.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: The difference is that the social credit system data will be owned by the state whereas smartphone tracking data is owned by private companies. The potential for abusing the data is [much higher](https://www.kialo.com/a-global-social-credit-system-is-an-overreach-of-government-power-which-is-susceptible-to-abuse-13627.12?path=13627.0~13627.1-13627.12).
1.3.2. Pro: The freedom of movement is [limited](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/2/18057450/china-social-credit-score-spend-frivolously-video-games) under a social credit system.
1.3.3. Con: Human rights in China were [restricted](https://2017-2021.state.gov/chinas-disregard-for-human-rights/index.html) well before the social credit system was introduced.
1.3.4. Pro: If quality of life is a function of the freedom of choice to some extent, then a social credit system would lower the quality of life.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Every individual should have the freedom to assess and decide on the risk level of a given action on their own.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Allowing individuals to make their own choices is likely to result in a large number of people making bad choices.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Individuals have the freedom to make hundreds of choices every day, the vast majority of which are benign and cause no harm.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Crossing an empty street on a red light is not harmful. Yet, there is still a risk of getting punished for it.
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Society [functions best](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/view/9781526137951/9781526137951.00008.xml)(People may not know much about political theory, but they know what they mean by ‘liberty’. Usually, people are only aware of liberty when they are deprived of it in an illegal or unfair manner by the deliberate acts of other individuals. Thus, freedom concerns human relationships and is clearly related to power in its many forms: financial, physical and political. Some people in positions of power will attempt to constrain liberty, usually with appeals to the ‘common good’ or a ‘higher principle’ beneficial to the whole of society or mankind.) when individuals are free to make their own decisions.
1.3.4.1.4. Con: Though certain behaviors do not cause immediate harm, they could still become problematic if everyone were to engage in those behaviors constantly.
1.3.4.2. Con: Social credit systems will not necessarily prevent freedom of choice. They will merely increase the social, economic, and reputational costs of engaging in certain types of behaviours.
1.3.5. Con: The social credit system in China has helped [protect people](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/15/china-social-credit-system-authoritarian/)(The SCS’s main aim is to improve the enforcement of legal and administrative rules. Food safety scandals are a recurring problem in China, as are workplace safety issues, wage arrears, and noncompliance with contracts and court orders. When it came to tackling these problems, there were laws in place, but enforcement was lackluster, and anyone who did get caught could simply go to the next province and reoffend. The SCS was meant to help by enabling data sharing between agencies and introducing nationwide blacklists to coerce offenders into compliance. Surveillance and repression of political dissidents or minorities were left to other, more invasive initiatives, such as the Golden Shield and Sharp Eyes projects.) by improving food safety and making workplaces safer.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Most of the violations are [lodged against companies](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/15/china-social-credit-system-authoritarian/)(Contrary to common belief, the cities mainly target companies, not individuals. Nonetheless, legal representatives of a violating company are also included in the blacklists to prevent reoffending elsewhere or under a different company. Nationally, about 75 percent of entities targeted by the system end up on blacklists because of court orders they have ignored—the so-called judgment defaulters. The remaining companies are typically collared for severe marketplace violations—for instance, for food safety infringements, environmental damage, or wage arrears. But much of these cities’ day-to-day use of the SCS is banal thanks to the system’s fragmentation and inflation of results.), not individuals. This improves citizens' lives.
1.3.5.2. Con: Despite improving overall food safety, this type of system could cause some traditional restaurants and food stalls to shut down due to burdensome regulations.
1.4. Pro: A global social credit system will discourage bad and improper behavior and encourage good behavior.
1.4.1. Con: The system does not encourage good behavior, rather it encourages efficient behavior.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The pursuit of societal efficiency by means of a global social credit system comes at a great cost to individual liberty.
1.4.1.2. Con: Behavior that would be considered efficient can be redefined and readjusted to equate good behavior.
1.4.2. Pro: Many hidden, otherwise unappreciated acts of good behavior would be rewarded and many hidden acts of bad behavior punished.
1.4.2.1. Con: If we consider bad behaviour to be that behaviour which is outside the law, existing systems already have prisons to disincentivize bad behaviour.
1.4.3. Con: Citizens might end up engaging in groupthink to the extreme, which can lead to negative consequences regarding [decision-making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597898927583).
1.4.3.1. Pro: Oftentimes people engaging in groupthink who [dissent the general consensus](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-groupthink-2795213)(People who are opposed to the decisions or overriding opinion of the group as a whole frequently remain quiet, preferring to keep the peace rather than disrupt the uniformity of the crowd. The phenomenon can be problematic, but even well-intentioned people are prone to making irrational decisions in the face of overwhelming pressure from the group.) prefer to stay silent instead of upsetting the status quo, which can cause groups to make erroneous decisions.
1.4.3.2. Con: [Increasing the diversity](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.170193#d3e1493)(6. Diversity as a means of recovering group advantages\n\nA solution to the problem of group members becoming too similar to each other is to increase the diversity of the group.\n\n6.1. Identity and functional diversity\n\nWe can distinguish between identity diversity, which refers to differences in personal characteristics such as gender, age and cultural background, and functional diversity, which refers to differences in how people cognitively represent and solve problems \[148\]. Identity diversity stimulates individual thought; people who are not like us make us reconsider our own position \[149,150\], reducing the risk of being stuck on a local peak when a better solution exists \[151\]. Functional diversity, which can be facilitated by identity diversity \[152,153\], ensures that the group more thoroughly searches the hypothesis space for better models of the world and better solutions to the problem at hand \[148\].) of a group can help reduce groupthink; it is imperative that social credit systems are designed and implemented by a diverse group of people.
1.4.4. Pro: As society seeks to progress and develop, a social credit system could speed things up and help achieve these goals more efficiently as the population would be unified under this system.
1.4.4.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that buy-in would be 100%, there would likely be boycotts and forms of resistance to this system.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The system would allow disadvantaged people to make progress through good behavior, thus increasing intersocial mobility.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Some people could become even more disadvantaged if their behavior, sometimes out of desperation, is considered unacceptable.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Taken in aggregate, individuals engaging in good behaviour will be more likely to produce an ordered society.
1.4.5. Pro: People who already behave properly have nothing to fear and will only gain social credit.
1.4.5.1. Con: Different cultures have varying definitions of what they consider to be "good" behavior. A universal definition of "good" would be oppressive to some cultures.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: The scientific community is clear that corporal punishment is [harmful to children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447048/). Yet, it is still acceptable in the majority of countries.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: If the state does not make a specific determination between good and bad behavior, all actions become permissable.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Each country already has their own set of general laws, rules, and regulations. A global social credit system is unnecessary.
1.4.5.2. Con: Upstanding citizens could be punished for accidental mistakes.
1.4.6. Con: A global social credit system would oppress certain individuals who already have difficulties behaving within the current norms of society.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Allowing people to break from the status quo is important for [innovation](https://www.creativitypost.com/article/want_to_innovate_science_says_be_a_nonconformist). Therefore, a social credit system may undermine the socially and financially rewarding outcomes associated with originality.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Many artists and creatives [shun social norms](https://sevennorth.com/blogs/seven-north-art/why-are-artists-crazy)(Well it’s a question that certainly runs along a very fine line between creative genius and totally all out Nuts! Anybody walking that line to get to the extremes of creativity or like Einstein to explain the universe in words probably runs that risk. \n\nDon Quixote dared to dream the impossible dream in the great novel by Miguel De Cervantes. Which he had to go way over the line to do and he did not know he had crossed it. It was just what he had to do; which is a common answer from highly successful and creative sorts!); they would likely be punished in a social credit system.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Handicapped individuals my already have problems following the same rules as everybody else. A social credit system would punish them for their handicap.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: Due to the metadata collected by a social credit system, it would likely be possible to identify and satisfy a handicapped individual's current and future requirements so that they can more easily blend into society; a social credit system will not necessarily punish people for things they cannot control.
1.4.6.3.2. Con: A social credit system hopefully would be nuanced enough to cater to special needs individuals. The aim is to address unsociable behaviour proportionately - in a way that deters and educates. Appropriate checks and balances can be introduced to prevent abuse.
1.4.6.4. Con: It could be argued that some negative people deserve to be oppressed. Society already rewards good behavior and judges negative behavior, a social credit system would just take this one step further.
1.4.6.5. Con: The status quo would be demystified because a social credit system would have clear rules on what is considered bad and good behavior.
1.4.6.5.1. Con: It will be harder to find a unique identity if one fears that some quirks might be considered bad behavior.
1.5. Pro: [Most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score) already have a successfully functioning credit score, which proves that a prototypical version functions at a national level.
1.5.1. Con: The credit score system is full of problems that ruin peoples lives; making something similar would be undesirable.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The credit score system is [racially biased](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/from-inherent-racial-bias-to-incorrect-data-the-problems-with-current-credit-scoring-models/)(Today, FICO considers payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit and credit mix in its model. But that data may be influenced by generational wealth that many Black and Hispanic borrowers did not have equal access to, says Frederick Wherry, professor of sociology and director of the Dignity and Debt Network at Princeton University.\n\n“We’re often told to stop talking about history, but history won’t stop talking about us,” Wherry says. “The data used in current credit scoring models are not neutral; it’s a mirror of inequalities from the past. By using this data we’re amplifying those inequalities today. It has striking effects on people’s life chances.”).
1.5.1.2. Pro: Many people have [inaccurate credit scores](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/from-inherent-racial-bias-to-incorrect-data-the-problems-with-current-credit-scoring-models/)(The report goes on to state that “the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \(CFPB\) receives more credit reporting complaints than complaints in any other industry it regulates.”\n\n“There’s an Aaron Klein that didn’t pay his AT&T bill, but it’s on my report. One can understand the level of errors in the system is also correlated,” Klein says. “The credit scoring system has every economic incentive to provide as much data volume as possible with as little cost to provide accuracy as the market will tolerate.”\n\nIf what Klein says is true, then figuring out which Aaron Klein is on what credit report is expensive, so allowing for a certain number of errors in the name of profitability is more desirable for these credit reporting agencies. The result can be devastating for consumers.) due to mistakes and poor data.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Victims of domestic violence accumulate coerced debt, which destroys their credit score and prevents them from escaping their abuser \([p. 366](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1010&context=penn_law_review)(Coerced debt wreaks havoc on credit scores. Victims of coerced debt often do not discover the debt until they attempt to leave an abusive relationship, when much of the debt is delinquent or in danger of becoming so. Delinquency occurs in several situations: when the debt is still outstanding; when the abuser has already repaid the debt, but only after it was in default, thus leaving a negative mark on the victim’s credit report; or when the debt is so large that the victim is unable to pay it in a timely manner. All of these scenarios can mar a victim’s credit rating at precisely the point when she most needs a clean bill of credit health.)\).
1.5.1.4. Con: Since a social credit score is not based on a financial credit score, the challenges faced by the latter cannot automatically be applied to the former.
1.5.2. Pro: The idea for a social credit system is not novel, it coincides with nearly the same time period as credit scores and credit reporting were introduced \([pp. 2-4](https://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/60424/LAW_2019_01.pdf)\).
1.5.3. Pro: Without these scores, current credit options \(payment plans/credit cards\) would be riskier for companies, which would likely increase the end cost for consumers.
1.5.3.1. Con: The extent to which the need for credit scores for financial purposes can be extended to other areas is unclear.
1.5.4. Pro: Albeit on a smaller scale than a social credit score, the current financial credit score system has not been abused. This suggests that a wider scheme could also be abuse-free.
1.5.4.1. Con: A social credit score is infinitely more complex; it is unlikely that such a massive system with so many minor details would be abuse-free.
1.5.5. Con: Demonstrating that the financial version of a credit score functions on a national level doesn't prove that a wider social version would.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Financial information is far easier to collect and evaluate than information on behavior in general.
