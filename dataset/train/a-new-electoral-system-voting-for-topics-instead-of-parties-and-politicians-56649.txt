Discussion Name: A new electoral system: Voting for topics instead of parties and politicians.

1. Voting for topics is superior to voting for parties and politicians.
1.1. Pro: There are political systems where political parties devote their attention to representing certain focus groups, resulting in political decision making, based on each party figthing on behalf of its own focus group. Voting for topics could help increase the number of parties which try to represent all of society.
1.1.1. Pro: By voting for topics, the needs and want of everyone, including all the focus groups, becomes clearer. Therefore, the need for seperate representation for focus groups shrinks.
1.1.2. Pro: [Single-issue voters](https://www.thoughtco.com/single-issue-voters-5214543) often end up voting for one of two parties, even when they dislike the candidate running for office or disagree with their other ideological viewpoints. Voting for topics would allow voters to maintain these distinctions.
1.1.3. Con: Not all sections of society deserve to be represented. Increasing the representation of extremist voices may end up amplifying their voices and giving them a powerful platform to radicalize others.
1.2. Con: A topic-voting system will still be run by political actors. Thus, due to conflicts of interest, political actors may select which topics the public gets to vote on in a self-serving manner.
1.2.1. Pro: Political parties may ensure that they do not consult the public about paradigmatic or significant issues that could undermine or end their political career.
1.2.2. Con: The topic-voting system can be designed in such a way that every political decision is made based on the popular vote. This will eliminate bias entirely.
1.3. Pro: Voting for topics stimulates political engagement of voters.
1.3.1. Pro: Voting for topics requires more effort from voters to deepen their knowledge.
1.3.1.1. Pro: This will filter out voters who are not politically engaged enough.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: More politically engaged voters will have a positive influence on governing.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: If voters put more thought into their vote, the vote is more likely to contribute to sufficient solutions.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that those who are the most politically engaged are most knowledgeable about the topic in question.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The relationship between voter knowledge and engagement is likely to be weak, because some of the most [educated and well-informed](https://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/03/13/in-britain-people-with-higher-educational-attainment-are-less-likely-to-vote-because-they-are-younger/) demographic groups record low voter turnout rates.
1.3.1.2. Con: While voting would be more effective if voters are better informed about the topic at hand, the right or duty to vote is not sufficient to motivate voters to deepen their knowledge.
1.3.2. Pro: It is likely that voters will be interested to learn more about a topic if it helped decide election results.
1.3.3. Con: Voters in the US are already engaged over politicians.
1.3.3.1. Pro: In the 2020 elections in the US, [36% demonstrated support for a candidate on social media.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/14/key-findings-about-voter-engagement-in-the-2020-election/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20third%20\(36%25\)%20say%20they%20demonstrated%20support%20for%20a%20candidate%20on%20social%20media.)
1.3.3.2. Pro: In the 2020 US elections, [a quarter of the population donated money to one of the political caimpaigns.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/14/key-findings-about-voter-engagement-in-the-2020-election/#:~:text=Another%20quarter%20say%20they%20contributed%20money%20to%20a%20political%20campaign%2C)
1.3.3.3. Pro: In the 2020 US election, [23% expressed their voting preference using a sign, poster, clothing, or any other visual representation.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/14/key-findings-about-voter-engagement-in-the-2020-election/#:~:text=while%20about%20as%20many%20\(23%25\)%20say%20they%20displayed%20a%20poster%2C%20sign%20or%20bumper%20sticker%20or%20wore%20clothing%20or%20a%20button%20to%20show%20their%20support%20for%20a%20candidate.)
1.3.3.4. Con: US voters being engaged over politicians is not necessarily a good thing, as this can cause voters to make voting decisions based on [who is running for office](https://time.com/6085604/january-6th-republicans-truth/)(Negative partisanship is a simple concept with profound implications. At its most basic, it means that “the parties hang together mainly out of sheer hatred of the other team, rather than a shared sense of purpose.” When negative partisanship dominates, a political coalition is united far more by animosity than policy. The policy priorities are malleable and flexible, so long as the politician rhetorically punches the right people.\n\nThe problem is severe and getting worse. Available data indicates that partisan perceptions of the opposing party have been plunging for more than 30 years, to the point where the overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats have profoundly negative perceptions of their political opponents.) and remain blind to their impact on key issues facing the country.
1.3.3.5. Con: Many Americans are [single-issue voters](https://www.thoughtco.com/single-issue-voters-5214543), meaning people may be forced to vote for candidates they do not like, solely based on single issues. This can be avoided by allowing people to vote on each single issue rather than on politicians.
1.3.4. Pro: In the past, referendums have been found to increase political engagement among [otherwise disengaged groups](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/08/26/survey-evidence-the-eu-referendum-had-a-clear-positive-impact-on-young-peoples-political-engagement/); topic voting is likely to have a similar effect.
1.3.5. Con: Voting for topics may stimulate political engagement because it is particularly rare and novel. This effect may wane once this process becomes routine.
1.4. Pro: In many countries, the public have voted on issues affecting national policy. This proves that public voting is feasible and effective.
1.4.1. Pro: In Australia, the legalization of same-sex marriage was the outcome of a public vote, during which a majority of the electorate voted in favor of [marriage equality](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-42006450).
1.4.2. Pro: In the UK, [Brexit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) was the outcome of a majority of the populace voting to "leave" rather than "remain" in the EU.
1.4.3. Pro: In [Ireland](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live), the legalization of abortion was based on a referendum, whereby a majority voted in favor of repealing the eighth amendment of the constitution, which imposed strict restrictions on abortion.
1.4.4. Con: Just because it is possible does not mean it is a justifiable use of taxpayer money.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The high cost of voting for topics rather than elections may elicit backlash from political representatives and voters, making such a paradigmatic shift unfeasible.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: The current partisian structure in many \(if not all\) democracies have to be changed as well.
1.4.4.2. Con: In the UK, elections cost around [140](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-election-cost-140-million/)-[150 million](https://www.democraticaudit.com/2014/03/08/the-uk-spends-approximately-150-million-per-year-administering-elections/) pounds per year. In comparison, the cost of voting for issues is marginally cheaper; at the very least, it is not more expensive.
1.4.4.3. Con: The UK referendum was an isolated occurrence, so special arrangements had to be made to enable people to vote on Brexit. Once standardized, these costs may reduce significantly.
1.4.4.4. Pro: The Brexit referendum cost Britain [130 million pounds](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-referendum-costs-idUKKBN1OD1FT).
1.5. Pro: Voting for topics removes the personal aspect of politicians and focuses solely on ideas themselves.
1.6. Con: Voters need representatives to filter their ideas to be more reasonable and manageable.
1.6.1. Con: Voting for topics \(or issues\) is superior because it includes a wider range of opinions and expertise, rather than only those of a limited number of representatives.
1.7. Pro: Voting for topics will better represent voters' opinions.
1.7.1. Pro: It will provide voters with the opportunity to state their opinions on every topic seperately. Leading to a more accurate representation than partisian voting.
1.7.2. Con: Not all individuals are equally aware or competent to make informed choices about public policy.
1.7.2.1. Pro: There are sections of society that actively deny established scientific facts, such as [climate change deniers](https://psychology.org.au/community/advocacy-social-issues/environment-climate-change-psychology/resources-for-psychologists-and-others-advocating/the-psychology-of-climate-change-denial) and [anti-vaxxers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/anti-vaxxer). These individuals should not be allowed to vote on public policy, as this would have a net negative impact on the public.
1.7.2.2. Con: Elected persons are often unaware of scientific facts or perpetuate [harmful](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2020/08/24/some-americans-are-tragically-still-drinking-bleach-as-a-coronavirus-cure/?sh=3c178a446748), [unscientific](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/here-are-all-the-current-members-of-congress-who-have-doubted-or-denied-climate-change/articleshow/69061934.cms), and [bigoted misinformation](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/trump-says-he-was-right-about-china-virus-coming-from-wuhan-lab-remark-121060400150_1.html). Therefore, topic voting may not be more dangerous than the current system of voting for political parties.
1.7.2.3. Con: Every person has a right to vote. This right is not reduced in any way by poorer awareness or competence, irrespective of whether the vote is for a topic or a politician.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: The wellbeing of citizens is more important than the right of citizens to vote. If citizens are not able to make informed choices about public policy, their own wellbeing might be in jeopardy due to their votes.
1.7.3. Con: Better opinion representation is not necessarily a good. Populism and the "bandwagon fallacy" does not mean that an opinion is correct, or is even a correct interpretation of government.
1.8. Con: Voting for topics does not work in countries where the politicians represent a state, rather than an ideology.
1.9. Con: The efficiency of voting for parties can be improved by fixing this system, rather than replacing it.
1.9.1. Pro: Votes could be weighted, for example, based on education, occupation, and criminal history. Thus, the vote of upstanding citizens who are best equipped to make voting decisions will matter more than those of their counterparts.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Rights cannot be decoupled from responsibilities. Weighted votes ensure that all people have a right to vote, while also ensuring that their contribution to the popular vote is commensurate to their demonstrated capabilities.
1.9.1.2. Con: Weighted votes can unfairly advantage the more privileged sections of society and deprive women, racial minorities, and other marginalized groups of the power needed to effect political change.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Racial minorities are [disproportionately represented](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/) in prisons and correctional facilities. Weighted voting would be a means of suppression of the votes of racial minorities.
1.9.1.2.2. Con: Underprivileged sections of society already face [unequal access](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_inequality_keeps_people_from_voting) during elections. Thus, weighted votes would be no different in this regard.
1.9.1.2.3. Con: This claim assumes that the electorate will solely vote for its own benefit. But if the assumption is adjusted to the phenomena that more competent voters are more likely to vote in favour of society, the reasoning does not hold.
1.9.1.2.3.1. Pro: If more competent voters are more likey to vote for society as a whole, minorities are likely to see the needed change in spite of their vote's value being downgraded.
1.9.1.2.3.2. Pro: Educated people are more likely to vote because they perceive this as a civic duty \([p. 21](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30998354_The_Effect_of_Education_on_Voter_Turnout)\). This means that their behaviors are guided by the greater good, rather than self-serving motives.
