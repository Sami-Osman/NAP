Discussion Name: The Obama Years: Did he achieve more good than bad?

1. The Obama presidency achieved more good than bad.
1.1. Pro: Obama strengthened the American economy.
1.1.1. Pro: Obama successfully brought the country out of the worst [recession](https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf) since the Great Depression.
1.1.1.1. Con: The average jobless rate during Obama's presidency was [7.7%](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/)(But getting down to that point was a long, slow grind. So slow that over all of Obama’s 96 months in office, the median jobless rate was 7.7 percent — the highest for any administration since the end of World War II.) - the highest for any administration since WWII.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Obama's $787 billion [economic stimulus package](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-obama-s-stimulus-package-3305625) released in 2009 instilled confidence in the economy and spurred consumer spending.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Obama's 2009 stimulus has been criticized for being [too small](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/03/obama-stimulus-congress-bailout-lessons-390951) while concentrating benefits among the rich and failing to provide support for the worst affected citizens.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: During Obama's tenure, corporate profits [hit record highs](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/)(Corporations did much better than workers during Obama’s time. Their profits hit several new yearly highs during his tenure.).
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The Recovery Act [initiated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/02/17/obamas-2009-recovery-act-kicked-off-over-10-years-of-economic-growth/?sh=43ebacf868b7)(The recent growth period started in July 2009 and has lasted for 127 months through January 2020. This surpasses the previous record of 120 months from March 1991 to March 2001) the longest period of growth in American history.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The American Recovery Act included over [$80 billion](https://www.theedadvocate.org/grading-obamas-education-policy/)(The American Recovery Act allocated $5 billion for early childhood programs, and $77 billion for reforms to support elementary and secondary education.) for education programs that were struggling from a lack of funding.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The bottom of the recession was in [June 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), 17 months after Obama took control, and it didn't set back in during the following six years and seven months that he held office.
1.1.2. Con: Obama created [fewer jobs](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/)(In fact, the only other post-war administrations to see smaller gains in employment were those of Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, who eked out a bare 1 percent gain, Dwight D. Eisenhower \(7.1 percent in his eight years\), and Bush’s father, George H.W. Bush \(2.5 percent during his four years\).) than any Democratic president since Harry Truman.
1.1.3. Pro: The stock market [rose steadily](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/01/14/obama-had-more-stock-market-records-than-trump/?sh=4e7cc5956684)(Over the last four years of Obama’s Presidency the Dow reached 118 new highs and finished at 19,732.) during the Obama years, reaching 118 all time highs.
1.1.3.1. Con: The stock market is [not a good indicator](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-27/stock-market-is-not-the-economy-by-any-yardstick) of the economy.
1.1.4. Con: [Income inequality](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-inequality-has-changed-under-obama-msna375586) increased drastically under Obama.
1.1.4.1. Pro: In 2013, [income inequality](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/) was at its highest rate since 1928.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Obama failed to address the [inequalities](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-03-20/6-charts-that-illustrate-the-divide-between-rural-and-urban-america) of America's rural and urban populations.
1.1.4.3. Con: Growing inequality can be better explained by [changing technology](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/05/03/technology-isnt-destroying-jobs-but-is-increasing-inequality/?sh=216dba725e78) over the past decade.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: As technology tends to make the most productive workers more productive, [those with more skills](https://poliquin.xyz/files/poliquin_jmp.pdf) tend to experience greater wage increases.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: Politicians can [control and regulate](https://theconversation.com/new-technology-isnt-the-cause-of-inequality-its-the-solution-123476) how technology affects the economy and compensate those who lose out. That Obama failed to do this effectively is a shortcoming.
1.1.5. Pro: The Obama administration successfully [negotiated](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/12/fact-sheet-obama-administrations-record-trade-enforcement) a variety of international trade deals that benefited Americans.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Obama supported the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/economy/trade) \(TPP\), which would have strengthened America's position in the global economy.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Trump [pulled out](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-trans-pacific-partnership-tpp) of the TPP on his first day in office, so this was not an Obama achievement.
1.1.5.2. Con: Obama did not accompany his trade agreements with policies protecting potential job losses, making his agreements [likely to cost jobs](https://www.epi.org/blog/fast-track-to-lost-jobs-and-lower-wages/).
1.1.6. Con: The US national debt increased by [$8.59 trillion](https://www.thebalance.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296) under Obama, the largest increase in absolute terms for any administration.
1.1.6.1. Pro: This led to the first [downgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades) of America's credit rating in history.
1.1.7. Pro: Obama introduced measures to help the country's poorest.
1.1.7.1. Con: [Poverty increased](https://newpol.org/issue_post/inequality-was-increasing-trump/) in almost every year of Obama's presidency.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Obama [cut taxes](https://www.thebalance.com/obama-tax-cuts-3306330) on small businesses and [raised taxes](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/9/11894794/obama-tax-increase-rich-one-percent) on the rich.
1.2. Pro: Obama made significant progress in improving domestic social issues.
1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.2. Pro: Obama's presidency greatly benefitted those facing oppression and discrimination in the US.
1.2.2.1. Pro: President Obama's election was a huge step forward for African Americans.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Even if there was little material benefit for African Americans, at least Obama proved many ugly stereotypes wrong by providing competent, eloquent, and patient leadership.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Obama's presidency greatly improved the economic conditions for many African Americans.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The real median income of African American households [increased by 4.1%](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration) between 2014 and 2015.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Since the start of the Affordable Care Act's first open enrolment period at the end of 2013, the uninsured rate among non-elderly African Americans has [declined by more than half](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration).
1.2.2.1.2.3. Con: When Obama left office, the [black unemployment rate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/05/trump-obama-economy/) was 7.5%, higher than the national average of 4.7%.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: Obama often failed to side with Black Lives Matter protestors and the victims of police brutality.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: He often [praised and defended](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/14/barack-obama-us-racism-police-brutality-failed-victims) police officers in towns where BLM protests had started.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: Despite repeated requests from protestors, Obama lagged and refused to support and create [civilian oversight boards](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/is-civilian-oversight-the-answer-to-distrust-of-police/) for police conduct.
1.2.2.1.3.3. Con: Obama gave over [$20 million](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8528225/obama-20-million-police-body-cameras) to police departments for body cameras.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: Voter turnout among African Americans fell both in the [2016](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/) election, indicating dissatisfaction with the administration.
1.2.2.1.5. Con: As the first African American president, Obama inadvertently generated a lot of backlash from racists.
1.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: It's debatable whether Congress would have made an abrupt pivot to obstructionism if he'd been [white](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/us/politics/02cong.html).
1.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: It's doubtful that America could have elected a [white supremacist](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/) after anyone but a black president.
1.2.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: While there is always some desire for change in every election, the election of Donald Trump symbolizes an extreme reaction to Obama.
1.2.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: Trump has repeatedly evidenced his racist ideologies.
1.2.2.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Trump is responsible for starting the '[birther](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/29/16713664/trump-obama-birth-certificate)' conspiracy theory against Obama, a racist precept that questions black people's right to their place in the US.
1.2.2.1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: There are many places where white people are born that aren't the United States of America, but [birtherism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories) somehow only started with the first black president.
1.2.2.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: [Trump](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916/drug-dealers-criminals-rapists-what-trump-thinks-of-mexicans) publicly cast Mexicans as "drug dealers, criminals and rapists".
1.2.2.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: Trump sought the advice of people like [Steve Bannon](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/steve-bannon-call-racist-wear-badge-honor/story?id=53656814), who proclaim that the term 'racist' should be worn as a badge of honour.
1.2.2.2. Con: Obama's presidency severely harmed immigrant communities.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Obama's administration deported more than [2.4 million people](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/immigration-stands-as-obamas-most-glaring-failure).
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Obama [failed to restructure](https://theweek.com/articles/746663/obama-failed-immigrants-theyre-paying-now) the US' outdated immigration system.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: Obama's immigration reforms were scuttled by intransigent Republican opposition and [Supreme Court rulings](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/23/supreme-court-blocks-obama-immigration-plan).
1.2.2.2.3.1. Con: At the start of his first term, there existed [bipartisan support](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/us/politics/09immig.html) for comprehensive immigration reform.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Obama protected the rights and voices of the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: The biggest gains made by the LBGTQ+ community were due to [Supreme Court rulings](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/26/417717613/supreme-court-rules-all-states-must-allow-same-sex-marriages) rather than Obama administration's policies.

1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Obama came out in favor of [gay marriage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/05/09/gIQAivsWDU_story.html).
1.2.3. Con: Obama failed to support or connect with many [rural, poor, white Americans](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/the-original-underclass/492731/), which led to the [Tea Party movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement), and eventually the [election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election) of Donald Trump.
1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.2.3.2. Con: A significant cause of this backlash was due to the [prevalence of racist beliefs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/obama-legacy/racial-backlash-against-the-president.html) among many Americans and had little to do with Obama's policies.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Many were frustrated by the departure of [manufacturing jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/disaffected-rust-belt-voters-embraced-donald-trump-midwestern-obama), denying them the livelihoods their parents had. They blame Obama for not working to reverse the trend.
1.2.4. Pro: Obama instituted the Affordable Care Act \(Obamacare\) which helps [millions of Americans](https://psmag.com/news/new-evidence-that-obamacare-helped-millions-of-kids-get-health-insurance).
1.2.4.1. Con: Obamacare forced many to pay larger amounts of their disposable income for healthcare.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Obamacare [raised taxes](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2017/7/how-obamacare-tax-hikes-hurt-low-and-middle-income-americans) in ways that hurt low- and middle-income families.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Obamacare caused healthcare [premiums to rise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/07/28/overwhelming-evidence-that-obamacare-caused-premiums-to-increase-substantially/?sh=192193ff15be).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Since it was launched, Obamacare has dramatically [increased](https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/affordable-care-act-statistics/) healthcare coverage in America.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Before Obmacare, individuals with [pre-existing conditions](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/affordable-care-act/can-i-get-coverage-if-i-have-a-pre-existing-condition/index.html) had difficulty getting insurance, but now this barrier has been removed.
1.2.4.4. Con: Until 2019, US citizens were [fined](https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/) if they did not purchase insurance. This is government overreach: people should be able to choose whether or not they have health insurance.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: Being uninsured has [significant costs](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_in_the_literature_2003_jun_the_costs_and_consequences_of_being_uninsured_davis_consequences_itl_663_pdf.pdf) for both the individual and society, thus it should be mandatory.
1.2.4.5. Con: The number of doctors available on many healthcare plans [shrank](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/246006-doctor-networks-shrinking-under-obamacare-study-finds) after Obamacare was instituted.

1.2.5.1. Pro: Obama [pardoned](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/criminal/practice/2017/obama-commutes-record-number-of-inmate-sentences/) many non-violent drug offenders.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Freeing non-violent drug offenders was a good thing because people who don't hurt others are not dangerous to society or in need of rehabilitation.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Obama's time in office saw the decriminalization and legalization of [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States) in many states.
1.2.5.3. Con: The [rapid increase](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html)(The second wave began in 2010, with rapid increases in overdose deaths involving heroin. The third wave began in 2013, with significant increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids) in the use of heroin, fentanyl, and other opioids began during the Obama administration.
1.2.6. Pro: Obama had an overall [positive impact](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/01/13/500421608/obamas-impact-on-americas-schools) on the American education system.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Obama's [Race to the Top initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Top) [improved](https://www.educationnext.org/results-president-obama-race-to-the-top-reform/)(The overall findings, however, indicate that Race to the Top had a meaningful impact on the production of education policy across the United States. In its aftermath, all states experienced a marked surge in the adoption of education policies.) American school policy-making across the country.
1.2.6.3. Con: Some critics have [attacked](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-real-obama-education-legacy)(This delivered a short-term boost to these reforms, but only by conjoining them to Washington and, more specifically, the Obama administration's agenda. The result is the most unfortunate part of Obama's legacy in K-12 schooling: His administration took potentially promising reforms and badly bungled them, turning encouraging developments into divisive fads.) his education policies as political and partisan.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Teacher's unions maintained [vociferous opposition](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/10/obama-vs-teachers-unions-its-stilll-on-000264/) to many of Obama's policies.
1.2.6.4. Con: Student loan debt [steadily rose](https://educationdata.org/average-student-loan-debt-by-year) during the Obama years.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: Obama's student [debt repayment policies](https://money.cnn.com/2016/11/30/pf/college/obama-student-loan-cost/index.html) came at a huge cost to the American government.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: University tuitions [consistently increased](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2017-09-20/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities) during Obama's presidency.
1.2.6.5. Con: Comparing PISA results from [2009](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/46619703.pdf) and [2015](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-2015-results-in-focus.pdf), one can see that American students fell in rankings compared to students from other OECD countries.
1.3. Pro: Obama's track record for scientific achievements is positive.
1.3.1. Con: Obama halted important scientific research.
1.3.1.1. Pro: In 2014, the Obama administration placed a pause on all ‘[gain of function](http://www.monash.edu/arts/research/high-impact-research/more-case-studies/gain-of-function-research-ethical-analysis)’ research, against scientific advice.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The pause in this [research](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/11/3048) limited our understanding of coronaviruses that could have given scientists an earlier and better understanding of Covid-19.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The pause was only [lifted](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/12/feds-lift-gain-function-research-pause-offer-guidance) in 2017 during the Trump administration.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Despite wanting to promote scientific research, Obama's actual [funding](https://www.aaas.org/news/science-and-technology-funding-under-obama-look-back)(Many of these activities have received positive reviews from observers. But on the funding front, perhaps the best word to describe the Obama Administration’s impact is “muted.”) changes for science initiatives yielded mixed results.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Many of the funding battles were [limited](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/12/feds-lift-gain-function-research-pause-offer-guidance)(But Obama’s science legacy is mixed, in large part because of the outcome of budget battles with Congress that prevented him from boosting science funding.) by Congress, not the Obama administration.
1.3.1.3. Con: Obama pursued policies in [many scientific fields](https://theconversation.com/obamas-legacy-in-science-technology-and-innovation-70699)(An immediate analysis of his science and technology policies, however, reveals significant accomplishments in the promotion of science and technology, education, space exploitation, clean energy, climate change and the environment.) that had a positive effect.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Obama [supported](https://www.ibtimes.com/nasa-2016-budget-big-leap-toward-manned-launches-commercialized-space-exploration-2230845) the privatization of many space exploration initiatives, which bolstered NASA's capabilities.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Obama's cybersecurity policies have been [criticized](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3162844/obamas-cybersecurity-legacy-good-intentions-good-efforts-limited-results.html) as well-intentioned, but ineffective.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: In 2015, China [hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach) into US government files, stealing critical information on over 22 million people.
1.3.2. Pro: The Obama administration produced a detailed ['game plan'](https://khn.org/news/evidence-shows-obama-team-left-a-pandemic-game-plan-for-trump-administration/) to deal with potential global pandemics.
1.3.2.1. Con: The Obama administration allowed the national supply of N95 masks to be [depleted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/03/fact-check-did-obama-administration-deplete-n-95-mask-stockpile/5114319002/)(There is no indication that the Obama administration took significant steps to replenish the supply of N95 masks in the Strategic National Stockpile after it was depleted from repeated crises.) without renewing funding for them to be replenished.
1.3.3. Pro: Obama took important steps towards solving climate change.
1.3.3.1. Con: Obama was the first president to [allow oil drilling in the Arctic](https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/11/politics/obama-approves-arctic-drilling/index.html), despite stern warnings against doing so.
1.3.3.2. Con: Obama was the sitting president when the [Dakota Access pipeline debacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests) started, intensified, and boiled over, mostly due to his inaction and [disregard for treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests).
1.3.3.3. Pro: After the [2010 BP oil spill](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10177052), Obama halted oil drilling in the region for six months and forced BP to pay compensation for the damage caused.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: The [job losses](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/09/obama-block-deepwater-drilling-causes-anger) that this moratorium on drilling caused led to greater opposition in the American South to future environmental policies, as they were seen as threats to jobs.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Research suggests that the moratorium may have actually acted as a kind of [economic stimulus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/22/why-the-job-market-actually-improved-after-the-bp-oil-spill/) for the affected regions.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Obama put in place a set of [important policies](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/22/17493414/trump-executive-order-deepwater-horizon-drilling-oceans) regulating the use of US waters.
1.3.3.3.3. Con: Obama's response to this crisis was largely seen as [slow and insufficient](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/28/barack-obama-gulf-oil-spill).
1.3.3.4. Pro: Unlike previous administrations and Trump's, Obama took climate change at least somewhat seriously and took steps to fight it, including the [Paris Agreement.](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/cop21-president-obama-celebrates-paris-deal-that-transformed-the-us-a6771841.html)
1.3.3.5. Pro: Obama's [Presidential Climate Action Plan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/06/28/third-anniversary-climate-action-plan) took significant steps to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: America's production and consumption of natural gas [grew dramatically](https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2020/12/31/president-obamas-support-for-americas-shale-oil-and-natural-gas/?sh=75e14ab61883) under Obama. While "greener" than coal, natural gas is still worse for the environment than renewables.
1.4. Con: Obama failed to act in alignment with the values he espoused.
1.4.1. Pro: Despite wanting to bring the country together, Obama was one of the most [polarizing presidents](https://news.gallup.com/poll/181490/obama-approval-ratings-historically-polarized.aspx?utm_source=Politics&utm_medium=newsfeed&utm_campaign=tiles) in U.S. history.
1.4.1.1. Con: Polarization was more the result of conservative media who demonized Obama, even before he was sworn in. \([p. 2](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/legacy/The-COLOR-OF-NEWS-FINAL.pdf)\)
1.4.1.2. Pro: Obama frequently [mocked Fox News and Republicans](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-mocks-scandals-republicans-at-white-house-correspondents-dinner) and the issues they raised, which alienated millions of their followers.
1.4.2. Con: A [majority](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1131521/share-us-adults-former-president-barack-obama-embodied-american-values/) of Americans polled in 2020 thought that Obama embodied American values.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Obama consistently [espoused and acted on](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/obamas-taught-us-family-values-203028733.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_c2E9dCZyY3Q9aiZxPSZlc3JjPXMmc291cmNlPXdlYiZjZD0mY2FkPXJqYSZ1YWN0PTgmdmVkPTJhaFVLRXdqa3BNdUwzT1h1QWhXcklxWUtIUTBFQnZNUUZqQUJlZ1FJQkJBQyZ1cmw9aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cueWFob28uY29tJTJGbGlmZXN0eWxlJTJGb2JhbWFzLXRhdWdodC11cy1mYW1pbHktdmFsdWVzLTIwMzAyODczMy5odG1sJnVzZz1BT3ZWYXcyZFp1dGxvdTlnbThuYUdMUUtuZF82&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEDlJj2jZEQNn4_rEcdNZ7hFjDwbJOJL4mJnJQsYI2CUDs4hn8dqoguCkiVQQFcjui8iozNw3yD2_LmkNeU9WokJRNKxAdE-8TyNFPb7J957BkNw3toNE3YYttF4ucyjR61nqVaJxKhMetS_PSQNBzZFXDL6DZYKit6CJ1x1CNdg) family values that made him a role model for many.
1.4.2.2. Con: While Obama may have been very popular, there is good evidence that many, even within his own party, were frustrated or disappointed with his administration.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: [Many Democratic voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries) voted against Hilary Clinton, who was largely seen as the ['continuity candidate'](https://observer.com/2016/07/obama-and-biden-cast-clinton-as-the-candidate-of-continuity-and-experience-at-dnc/) for the Obama administration, in the 2016 Democratic primary.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Clinton had a [long public history](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/20/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-poll-analysis/index.html) that made her unpopular with many voters for different reasons. This is not necessarily a fault of the Obama administration.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: [A significant number](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/) of Obama voters ended up voting for Trump in 2016.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: A large part of Joe Biden's popularity comes from his being a [part of the Obama administration](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/09/barack-obama-joe-biden-2020-campaign-178115), indicating Obama's consistent popularity.
1.4.3. Con: Obama started the [Obama Foundation](https://www.obama.org/summit/values/), which is built and acts on a clear set of values.
1.4.3.1. Con: The Obama Foundation has been accused of [supporting projects](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/professors-join-chorus-opposition-obama-foundation-presidential-library/) that do not benefit local communities.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The Foundation's attempt to build Obama's presidential library has faced [intense local opposition](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/professors-join-chorus-opposition-obama-foundation-presidential-library/), who accuse the project of privatizing public parks, wasting tax money, and gentrification.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The Obama Foundation has [started](https://www.gocollegenow.org/article/barack-obamas-foundation-announces-new-program-for-chicago-students/) initiatives to improve educational and employment opportunities for traditionally underserved youth.
1.4.3.3. Con: The Foundation has been accused of siphoning large amounts of [money for its executives](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/the-obama-foundations-financials-dont-match-its-rhetoric/).
1.4.4. Pro: Obama broke many campaign promises.
1.4.4.1. Pro: In his campaign, Obama promised his healthcare reform would have universal coverage. Obamacare ultimately [did not live up](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/433/sign-a-universal-health-care-bill/) to this promise.
1.4.4.2. Con: It is inevitable that presidents will be unable to fulfill all of their campaign promises when in office.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Obama's broken promises represent a broader betrayal of the notion of ['change'](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96810759) and the new form of politics he built the excitement around his 2008 campaign on.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: While compromise may be inevitable, most of Obama's tended to [favor wealthy individuals and interest groups](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/barack-obama-revolving-door-lobbying-217042) who had donated to his campaign.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: Obama's campaign rhetoric regarding the economy promised to be more concerned with [worker's rights and issues](https://www.thebalance.com/obama-2008-economic-promises-and-platform-3305774), in contrast to previous administrations.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: It is a necessary part of democracy for ruling and opposition parties to compromise on policy proposals. While this means some promises cannot be kept, it ensures more voters are represented.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Despite [criticizing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/obamas-claim-that-the-bush-tax-cuts-led-to-the-economic-crisis/2012/09/30/06e8f578-0a6e-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_blog.html) them, Obama [extended the Bush-era tax cuts](https://www.thebalance.com/obama-tax-cuts-3306330) on the wealthy.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Obama failed to implement or even force a vote on the [Employee Free Choice Act](https://www.employmentlawwatch.com/2009/09/articles/employment-us/labor-relations/the-employee-free-choice-act-an-update/), which he supported during his campaign.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: The Act would have been one of the [most important worker protection laws](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/EFCA_Summary.pdf) in recent memory and had even won bipartisan support when voted on during the Bush era.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Such broken promises likely led to the [exodus of many working-class people](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/11/23/where-midwesterners-struggle-trumpism-lives-on/) from the Democrat Party in swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania during the 2016 campaign.
1.4.5. Pro: There was too much of [showbiz](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/20/14289476/barack-obama-president-pop-culture-late-night) about Obama's persona, too much staged empathy with 'popular' causes.
1.4.5.1. Con: Every president since Kennedy has [appeared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/22/from-jfk-to-nixon-to-trump-presidential-candidates-and-their-goofiness-on-late-night-tv/) on TV shows and used the platform to spread their ideas and garner support from voters.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Many celebrated Obama as being the ["pop culture president"](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/20/14289476/barack-obama-president-pop-culture-late-night).
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Much of the pop culture that Obama associated himself with was that followed by richer groups on the coasts. This [alienated him from many](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/04/30/151686824/obama-heads-to-hollywood-conservative-group-mocks-celebrity-president) within the country.
1.5. Con: Obama's foreign policy failed to achieve its goals and harmed American interests.
1.5.1. Pro: Obama and his cabinet consistently made mistakes in their engagement with other states and involvement in conflicts.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Often, Obama was quick to use unnecessary force.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Obama [escalated](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush)(There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama’s presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush.) the use of drones to target terrorists.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: US drone strikes [killed many civilians](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush).
1.5.1.1.2. Con: Obama was criticized for not being aggressive enough and "[leading from behind](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-obama-doctrine-leading-from-behind/2011/04/28/AFBCy18E_story.html)."
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Obama's failure to back up his ['red line' threat](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/15/17238568/syria-bomb-trump-obama-russia) in Syria severely damaged his credibility.
1.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Obama's Pivot to Asia](https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/the-pivot-to-asia-was-obamas-biggest-mistake/) lacked a sufficient military component.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: An aggressive military strategy would have isolated China, making it [more difficult](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/assessing-u-s-china-relations-under-the-obama-administration/) to conduct economic initiatives.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: It also would have signaled to China that the US does not accept illegal actions like [island building](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/04/17/chinas-island-fortifications-are-a-challenge-to-international-norms/) and [intimidation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-25/china-sends-more-warplanes-through-taiwan-airspace/13087734) of its [neighbors](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/23/china-threatens-vietnam-over-south-china-sea-drilling.html).
1.5.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The lack of dedication in the US military posture in East Asia caused former allies like [the Philippines](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-arms-idUSKCN12414A) to move into China's orbit.
1.5.1.1.2.3. Pro: Obama's strategic patience towards [North Korea allowed the secluded state to develop functional nuclear weapons.](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2016-11/features/north-korea-obama%E2%80%99s-prime-nonproliferation-failure)
1.5.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The Obama years [showed](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/25-years-of-negotiations-provocations/) a marked decrease in engagement between the US and North Korea, while also showing an increase in provocation from the North.
1.5.1.1.2.3.2. Con: The US had no appetite for another war.
1.5.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: A more forceful approach would not have required war. [Many](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43908853?seq=1) wish Obama had been more proactive at de-escalating tensions and negotiating an end to their nuclear build-up.
1.5.1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Risking war with countries like North Korea could have led to the [devastation](https://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-tactics-that-make-north-korean-artillery-so-dangerous-2019-5?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=North%20Korea%20has%20thousands%20of,to%20go%20re%2Darm%20itself.) of South Korea, hundreds of thousands of deaths, and a collapse in financial markets.
1.5.1.1.2.4. Con: Following eight years of [aggressive foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_George_W._Bush_administration) under George W. Bush, the country and world wanted to tone down America's military involvement overseas.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: President Obama promised to [scale down](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35123915) US involvement in foreign conflicts, but he [continued to send](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/obama-doctrine-wars-numbers/474531/) troops to war zones.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Obama [continued](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Barack-Obama/Wars-in-Iraq-and-Afghanistan) the US war in Afghanistan.
1.5.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Troop numbers in Afghanistan [surged](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-41014263) under Obama, but failed to bring decisive victory.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: Obama's intervention in Libya was violent, [ineffective](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/obamas-worst-mistake-libya/478461/), and set the stage for the ensuing difficulties the country faced.
1.5.1.1.3.2.1. Con: The intervention in Libya was [spearheaded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/sarkozy-libya-france-reputation-reelection) by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, not Obama.
1.5.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: The NATO intervention was more focused on overthrowing Gadaffi than protecting Libyans, which led to the [conflict magnifying](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/lessons-libya-how-not-intervene) and fostered greater destabilization.
1.5.1.1.3.3. Con: The emergence of [ISIS](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/30/syria-us-deployment-troops-obama-special-operations) was an important and unpredicted threat. It would have been unreasonable to expect Obama to not take action against them.
1.5.1.1.3.4. Pro: The Obama administration's [involvement in the Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_foreign_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration) has led to [a lot of innocent lives being lost](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/yemen-saudi-arabia-obama-riyadh/501365/).
1.5.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Obama, like many world leaders, failed to grasp the significance of the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) or [respond](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/middle-east-egypt-us-policy/409537/) to it successfully.
1.5.1.2. Con: Even where mistakes were made, Obama's foreign policy reinforced and strengthened the norms of the rule-based liberal international order.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Obama sought [international cooperation](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/world/europe/obama-at-his-final-nato-summit-meeting-acknowledges-challenges.html), even for actions like military interventions.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Through [international institutions](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/barack-obama-as-quiet-international-reformer/), trade deals, and diplomatic negotiations, Obama sought to increase global interconnection and the economic growth of states.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: Obama's view on foreign policy allowed for the US to [meddle aggressively](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/trump-united-nations-obama/540288/) in the affairs of other states.

1.5.2.1. Con: Obama successfully organized the operation that [killed Osama Bin Laden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden), which was a significant blow to al-Qaeda.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The NSA increased their unconstitutional [spying operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29)(The ACLU has asserted the following regarding the FAA: "Regardless of abuses, the problem with the FAA is more fundamental: the statute itself is unconstitutional.") under Obama's watch.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: NSA surveillance is necessary to protect American lives from terrorists.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: One study [found](http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/41902006/The_effectiveness_of_surveillance_technology_What_intelligence_officials_are_saying.pdf)(The key points of intelligence officials’ statements on the effectiveness of surveillance technology are that, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance programs.) that intelligence officers themselves were uncertain how effective surveillance is in thwarting attacks \(p. 100\).
1.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: Since 9/11, [dozens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsuccessful_terrorist_plots_in_the_United_States_post-9/11) of terrorist attacks have been thwarted by law enforcement's [intelligence collection](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2011.582628)(Most plots, especially domestic terrorist plots, are not foiled through imaginative analysis, but through conventional law enforcement efforts and aggressive domestic intelligence collection that reveal to authorities just what the plotters are up to.).
1.5.2.2.1.3. Con: The threat from terrorism is [overstated](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2014/Hoopersurveillance.html)(Even with the September 11 attacks included in the count, the number of Americans killed by international terrorism since the late 1960s \(which is when the State Department began counting\) is about the same as the number of Americans killed over the same period by lightning, accident-causing deer, or severe allergic reaction to peanuts.) and does not justify large scale surveillance.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: The [NSA files](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files) proved that Obama's government was massively spying on its citizens.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Obama [pardoned](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/obama-commutes-bulk-of-chelsea-mannings-sentence.html) Chelsea Manning, despite her leaking hundreds of thousands of documents that were "damaging to national security".
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Whistleblowers should not be punished, especially when they reveal information as important as [what Chelsea Manning revealed](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wikileaks-publishes-first-documents-leaked-by-chelsea-manning).
1.5.2.4. Pro: Obama [promised to close](https://qz.com/623131/all-the-times-obama-has-said-hes-going-to-close-guantanamo-bay/) Guantanamo Bay but [did not.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/01/why-obama-has-failed-to-close-guantanamo)
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Guantanamo Bay is one of the worst [human rights offenses](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/guantanamo-bay-human-rights) currently committed by the United States. The importance of closing it cannot be understated.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: A majority of Americans have [consistently opposed](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/03/04/rel4d.-.threats.draft.guantanamo.pdf) plans to close Guantanamo Bay.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: The [complexity](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/guanatanamo-bay-forever-prisoners/482289/) of closing Guantanamo is enormous.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: Where to put all the prisoners will be a big question, especially because some of them are considered [very dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-bay-worst-in-pictures).

1.5.3. Con: Obama improved global diplomatic relations.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Obama was able to resolve two conflicts remaining from the Cold War: [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_thaw) and [Iran](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/05/remarks-president-iran-nuclear-deal).
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The [Iran deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33521655) was one of the biggest diplomatic achievements in a long time.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Since Trump pulled America out of the deal in 2018, it [failed to achieve](https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-explained) the goals set forth by the Obama administration.
1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Iran has [continued to develop](https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2020-09-10/irans-nuclear-program-remains-steady-trajectory)(A Sept. 4 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\) confirms that Iran continues to exceed limits on its uranium enrichment program imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal...) their nuclear capabilities, flaunting regulations imposed on them from the deal.

1.5.3.2. Pro: America's international image largely [improved](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/06/29/as-obama-years-draw-to-close-president-and-u-s-seen-favorably-in-europe-and-asia/) during Obama's administration.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: [Very few citizens](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/08/27/obamas-middle-east-problem/) in other countries approved of Obama's performance.
1.5.3.3. Con: Obama created rifts between the US and several strategically important countries.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Many officials in Saudi Arabia were [critical](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/9/23/one-thing-obama-got-right-theyll-have-to-share-the-middle-east) of Obama's Middle East policies.
1.5.3.3.2. Pro: US-Russia relations [suffered](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/)(Obama’s favorability is also down considerably in Russia, reflecting recent tensions over the crisis in Ukraine. Only 15% of Russians currently express confidence in the American president, down from an already low 29% in 2013. U.S. favorability has also declined dramatically – just 23% of Russians say they have a favorable opinion of the U.S., less than half of the 51% registered in last year’s survey.) under Obama.
1.5.3.3.2.1. Con: Much of the [souring](https://ifsh.de/file-CORE/documents/yearbook/english/14/Pifer-en_S.pdf) of US-Russia relations had to do with Russia's [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) of Ukraine, human rights [abuses](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/06/who-was-sergei-magnitsky-and-how-did-uk-sanctions-come-about), and Putin's [return to the presidency](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/04/putin-alleged-voter-fraud-russian-election) in 2012.
1.5.3.3.3. Con: In most cases, it was not Obama's fault when relations with other countries broke down.
1.5.3.3.3.1. Pro: Relations between the [US and Turkey soured](https://www.cfr.org/blog/donald-trump-repeating-obamas-errors-dealing-turkeys-erdogan-there-another-way-forward) as a result of Turkey's increasing cooperation with Iran and Russia.
1.5.3.4. Con: Obama's attempt to keep good relations with countries often came at the expense of not criticizing and taking action against violent human rights abuses.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: Obama continued to [give support to Erdogan](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/world/europe/obama-erdogan-turkey-coup-attempt.html) after the 2016 failed coup in Turkey, despite the government's violent repression.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: Obama kept close ties to Saudi Arabia and even provided [material support](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/11/19/obama-officials-incomplete-reckoning-failure-yemen) for their inhumane war in Yemen.
1.5.3.4.3. Con: Ruining strategic alliances would have undermined US interests to a large extent. Obama's primary responsibility was towards American citizens.
1.5.3.5. Pro: The [2009 Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize) was awarded to Obama for his "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between people."

1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: The Nobel committee secretary [stated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34277960) that he regrets awarding Obama the Peace Prize in 2009.
