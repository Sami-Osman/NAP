Discussion Name: Should the Tampon Tax be Abolished?

1. The tampon tax should be abolished.
1.1. Con: The state needs enough income from taxes to finance social benefits. The tampon tax is part of that income.
1.1.1. Con: Many countries have managed to maintain social benefits after abolishing the tampon tax.
1.1.1.1. Con: Denmark, a country with a [famously comprehensive social safety net](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-01-25/denmarks-social-policies-generally-remain-a-model-say-experts)(What makes life so worth living in Denmark are the country's strong social policies, say experts. From cradle to grave, the Danish state knows how to help its people: maternity or paternity leave — parents can decide to split it up — is a full year. Nurseries and then schools are both guaranteed and paid for by the municipality. University education is tuition free and students can apply for living expenses. Families with children receive a generous allowance, regardless of income level. Even elderly care, such as senior centers, adapted transport and meals-on-wheels programs are paid for the by the state.), taxes menstrual products at [over 20%](https://www.statista.com/chart/18192/sales-tax-rates-on-feminine-hygiene-products-in-europe/).
1.1.1.2. Pro: The UK has extensive social benefits and has been funding them for years without [any government benefit from the tampon tax](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/uk-tampon-tax-fund-charities/)(LONDON, Jan 5 \(Thomson Reuters Foundation\) — Britain's decision to scrap taxes on period products may also spell the end of a state-run charity fund financed with the proceeds — depriving vulnerable women and girls of a "lifeline," campaigners and nonprofits warned on Tuesday.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, the government stopped charging value-added tax \(VAT\) on sanitary pads and tampons — revenue that the Tampon Tax Fund distributes among charities helping women and girls facing issues including abuse, homelessness, or mental illness.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe Tampon Tax Fund was set up in 2015 following outcry from women's groups over the "sexist" 5% VAT levied on menstrual products until last week.).
1.1.1.3. Con: The UK and Canada, which still fund social benefits without the tampon tax, are two of the [wealthiest countries in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/)(1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Germany\n5. United Kingdom\n6. India\n7. France\n8. Italy\n9. Canada\n10. South Korea). Funding social benefits in the absence of a broad tax base may be harder for poorer countries.
1.1.1.4. Pro: The [Government of India](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44912742)(The announcement their campaign had been successful was made by India's interim finance minister, Piyush Goyal, who said he was "sure all mothers and sisters will be very happy to hear that sanitary pads are now 100% exempt from tax".) abolished the tampon tax in 2018. This has not resulted in any adverse effects on existing schemes; instead, the government has been able to introduce [additional schemes](https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/government/schemes-launched-by-modi-government).
1.1.1.5. Pro: Canada [abolished](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tampon-tax-scrapped-in-canada-after-petition-convinces-conservative-government-10283929.html)(Canada will stop taxing feminine hygiene products from 1 July, the government has confirmed. Pressure is mounting on other governments to follow suit.\n\nTampons, sanitary towels and menstrual cups will all be included in the change, which came from a private members bill that received all-party support.) the tampon tax and is still able to fund social benefits.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: The Canadian government only made [36 million CAD a year](https://www.taxfairness.ca/en/news/beyond-tampons-how-tax-policy-fails-women)(In theory, governments aren’t supposed to tax essential items.\n\nYet every year the CRA collects an estimated $36 million from federal tax on tampons.That's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a tax system that fails many women.) from the tampon tax. Canada collects over 780 billion CAD a year in tax \([p. 2](https://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-canada.pdf)\).
1.1.1.5.2. Con: While Canada may still be able to provide social services, reduced funding will inevitably affect the quality of these services.
1.1.2. Pro: A broad tax base can provide government-funded services that benefit women, such as subsidised healthcare.
1.1.2.1. Con: Taxpayer-funded services are generally available to all members of society. It is unfair to make women fund them more than others through the tampon tax.
1.1.2.2. Pro: A broader VAT base increases [economic efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_efficiency.asp)(- Economic efficiency is when every scarce resource in an economy is used and distributed among producers and consumers in a way that produces the most economic output and benefit to consumers.\n\n- Economic efficiency can involve efficient production decisions within firms and industries, efficient consumption decisions by individual consumers, and efficient distribution of consumer and producer goods across individual consumers and firms.\n\n- Pareto efficiency is when every economic good is optimally allocated across production and consumption so that no change to the arrangement can be made to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off.) \([p. 228](https://ifs.org.uk/uploads/mirrleesreview/design/ch9.pdf)(Broadening the VAT base increases economic efficiency and increases consumers’ welfare. And it is easy to target direct tax and benefit reforms that, on average, compensate those on low incomes and that leave behind money for the government.)\).
1.1.3. Con: [Many people resent taxes](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-hate-taxes-and-why-some-people-want-us-to/)(Tax season may be behind us, but with the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, the word “tax” looks set to remain central to U.S. political debates in the weeks and months ahead. And for most Americans, there are few words they dread more; nothing unites Americans like their collective dislike of taxation. The funny thing is, this hatred of taxes is particularly acute in the United States—other countries have taxes too, but it seems as though non-Americans don’t dislike paying them quite as much. What is it about America that drives this aversion to taxes?). The tampon tax should be abolished along with many others.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Any abolished tax is a step to a better future. The [less redistribution, the better](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/is-redistributing-wealth-a-bad-thing-you-betcha/)(Our nation was just treated to an entire weekend of conservative commentators talking about the evils of income redistribution and class warfare. For once they are on the money! Wealth redistribution is not just a bad thing—it is at the core of the current economic crisis.) for society.
1.1.3.2. Con: Taxes help the state fund things like [public education](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/an-overview-of-the-funding-of-public-schools)(According to Education Week, public school funding comes from a variety of sources at the local, state and federal level. Approximately 48 percent of a school’s budget comes from state resources, including income taxes, sales tax, and fees. Another 44 percent is contributed locally, primarily through the property taxes of homeowners in the area. The last eight percent of the public education budget comes from federal sources, with an emphasis on grants for specific programs and services for students that need them.) and [healthcare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060215/)(The predominant method of financing health care in Canada and many high-income countries is through general tax revenues, the largest proportion of which is obtained through income tax. Increasing either personal or corporate income tax rates as a strategy for funding health care has several advantages. First, because income taxes are progressive \(i.e., the marginal tax rate increases with income\), raising taxes is viewed by many as an equitable way to fund health care. Second, raising money through income taxes is very administratively efficient.). Taxing menstrual products in a similar way to other products means more funding for these causes.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Higher income to fund public welfare initiatives has never been cited as a reason to tax other necessities; therefore, it would be discriminatory to selectively justify the tampon tax based on government revenue implications.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: US states have predicted and witnessed significant losses in tax revenue resulting from eliminating the tampon tax.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Some women have [filed lawsuits against their governments](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/13/tampon-tax-lawsuit-menstrual-taxes-michigan/3363164001/)(Paying taxes on menstrual hygiene products could possibly come to an end because an organization has sued Michigan over the additional costs. \n\nAdvocates and an organization called Period Equity assisted three Michigan women in filing a lawsuit against the state, alleging that charging taxes "on the purchase of menstrual products is sex-based discrimination.") over the tampon tax. Governments would not have to pay for these expensive lawsuits if they abolished the tax.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Dealing with protests and complaints about tampon taxes also costs legislators and their staff time. The public pays these people's wages.
1.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Lawsuits are likely to be significantly more expensive for individual citizens \(or groups of citizens\) rather than the deep-pocketed [government treasury](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/judgment-fund/).
1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: The California state government predicted that removing the tampon tax would result in an annual loss of 20 million USD \([p. 1](https://womenscaucus.legislature.ca.gov/sites/womenscaucus.legislature.ca.gov/files/PDF/AB%2031%20GARCIA%20-%20No%20Tax%20on%20Tampons.pdf)(AB 31 continues the movement to make feminine hygiene products exempt from the sales and use tax at both the state and local level. The women of California still pay over 20 million dollars annually for taxes on tampons and sanitary napkins)\).
1.1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: California has the largest economy in the US \([p. 3](https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4093/ca-geography-wealth-090519.pdf)(California is the wealthiest state in the nation. Despite this overall prosperity, wealth varies considerably across the state and its residents. The concentration of wealth among a small number of very wealthy individuals and households has been the topic of much research and commentary in recent years. Perhaps less discussed is the similarly uneven geographical distribution of wealth. This publication provides a short introduction to the geography of wealth in California based on data from the period 2014 to 2016.)\). 20 million USD would not be a significant loss to the state's funding.
1.1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: California [ranks fifth](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/debt-by-state)(California has the fifth-highest debt of any state, with total liabilities coming out to $362.87 billion. Total assets come out to $301.1 billion, creating a $55.96 billion net debt and giving California a debt ratio of 120.5%. California's debt and liabilities can be broken down into three categories: retirement liabilities, budgetary borrowing, and bond debt. However, combining California's federal, state, and local debt brings California's debt total to over $1 trillion. According to this report, the debt would cost each resident of California $33,000 or each taxpayer $74,000.) on the national debt list. The government should not reduce - let alone abolish - any tax when they are a trillion dollars in debt.
1.1.3.2.2.3. Con: The increased affordability of tampons and other menstrual products may reduce [missed workdays during women’s periods](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/menstrual-symptoms-linked-to-nearly-9-days-of-lost-productivity-through-presenteeism-every-year/)(Menstrual period symptoms may be linked to nearly nine days of lost productivity every year through presenteeism, suggests the largest study of its kind, published in the online journal BMJ Open.\n\nBut the real impact on women and society is underestimated and poorly appreciated, say the researchers.\n\nThey set out to evaluate lost productivity associated with menstrual symptoms, as measured by time off from work or school \(absenteeism\) and working or studying while feeling ill \(presenteeism\) in 32,748 Dutch women between the ages of 15 and 45.), benefiting the economies of these states.
1.1.3.2.2.4. Pro: The state of New York reportedly witnessed a [14 million USD](https://www.investopedia.com/tampon-tax-4774993)(In New York State, where the tax is no longer imposed, the loss in revenue was estimated to be $14 million a year, according to a lawsuit filed in 2016. The Tax Foundation's Nicole Kaeding argued that removing taxes on these products puts other items at risk of higher rates, and different products can be regarded as necessities by different groups.) drop in annual tax revenue following the elimination of the tampon tax.
1.1.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: The original class-action lawsuit against the New York State Department of Taxation had demanded that revenue generated through the tampon tax be [refunded to women](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-menstruation-idUSKCN0W52NE)(The lawsuit seeks to end the tax and to refund money to the estimated 5 million women who purchase menstrual products in the state.\n\nThe 4 percent state sales tax applied to tampons, sanitary napkins and other products used by women during their monthly menstrual cycle amounts to $14 million a year in New York, Maazel said.). This would have cost the government multiples of 14 million USD.
1.1.3.2.2.4.2. Con: The annual tax revenue of the state of New York is [80.4 billion USD](https://www.tax.ny.gov/research/collections/fy_collections_stat_report/2020_2021_annual_statistical_report_of_ny_state_tax_collections.htm)(This edition presents information for New York State fiscal year 2020-2021 \(SFY 2020-2021\) which began April 1, 2020 and ended March 31, 2021. \n\nDuring SFY 2020-2021, the tax department collected $80.4 billion from state-imposed taxes and fees as follows:\n\n- personal income tax—$54.9 billion\n- state sales tax plus excise and user taxes—$15.3 billion\n- business taxes—$7.5 billion\n- property transfer taxes—$2.5 billion\n- other taxes and fees—$0.2 billion). The tampon tax, therefore, only made up 0.017% of the state's tax revenue.
1.1.3.3. Con: Many people resent [payment in any form](https://www.whatartschooldidntteachyou.com/2020/08/payment-in-exposure/)(The offer to work for exposure runs rampant in the art world. Being an artist or small creative business is a career, but artists are constantly asked to work for free. This is called “payment in exposure” or PIE.), yet this is not considered a legitimate reason to make all products free. Therefore, personal feelings do not negate the necessity of tax.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Individuals rarely have the option to refuse participation in tax-benefited society. Taking money from individuals against their will is theft.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: People who don't pay taxes [go to jail](https://iea.org.uk/is-owen-jones-right-that-taxation-is-theft/)(Last week, I spoke on Sky News about the cap on public sector pay rises. The Guardian columnist Owen Jones was on the segment with me. When I asked him how he thought the government’s deficit should be reduced, he replied that high earners should be asked to pay more tax. I objected to his use of the word “asked”, pointing out that we pay tax on threat of imprisonment.). Being imprisoned for not forfeiting money would be [considered a severe crime](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/can-you-go-to-jail-for-debt/)(Not being able to meet payment obligations can make anyone feel anxious and worried, but in most cases, you won't have to worry about serving jail time if you are unable to pay off your debts.\nYou cannot be arrested or go to jail simply for being past-due on credit card debt or student loan debt, for instance.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThere are a couple of instances where it may be possible to serve time as a result of not paying your debts, such as if you've failed to pay your federal taxes or make child support payments.) in other circumstances, but when it is done by tax collectors, it is considered justice.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: People who threaten to imprison people if they do not pay large amounts of money are usually referred to as [kidnappers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kidnapping)(kidnapping, also spelled kidnaping, criminal offense consisting of the unlawful taking and carrying away of a person by force or fraud or the unlawful seizure and detention of a person against his will. The principal motives for kidnapping are to subject the victim to some form of involuntary servitude, to expose him to the commission of some further criminal act against his person, or to obtain ransom for his safe release. More recently, kidnapping for the purpose of extortion has become a tactic of political revolutionaries or terrorists seeking concessions from a government. In all countries it is considered a grave offense punishable by a long prison sentence or death.).
1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: Not paying for goods or services used is a punishable offense and sometimes [a culpable felony](https://www.kohlerandhart.com/articles/theft-of-services/). Similarly, failing to pay federal taxes is tantamount to refusing to pay for [government services](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal_income_tax.asp) provided to the public \(e.g., roads, parks\).
1.1.3.4.2. Con: [Mass opposition](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39594886)(Controversial water charges in the Republic of Ireland will largely come to an end after a vote in the Dáil \(Irish parliament\).\n\nThe austerity measure was introduced in 2014 but was the subject of widespread protests.\n\nThe Dáil voted by 96 votes to 48 to accept a report by the Committee on the Future Funding of Water Services.\n\nThe report recommended that only people who excessively use water will be charged as opposed to all water users.) to certain taxes may result in them being abandoned.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Mass opposition to the tampon tax has resulted in it being [removed in some countries](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/06/budget-2020-chancellor-plans-to-finally-end-tampon-tax)(The chancellor will announce the abolition of the “tampon tax” in next week’s budget, marking the successful conclusion to a 20-year campaign by women’s rights activists.).
1.1.3.4.3. Con: In a corrupt state that does nothing for you, taxation is theft. But when a state gives something back to its citizens, taxation is a fee paid for those services.
1.1.3.5. Con: Taxes are a [moral obligation](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/avoiding-tax-legal-but-ever-ethical)(At a time when government spending cuts are having a real impact on the everyday lives of people, how can multinational corporations be avoiding paying their fair share of taxes? As Vince Cable said: "Systematic tax avoidance by rich individuals and UK-based companies strikes a particularly ugly note in these straitened times."\n\nIn a 2012 IBE survey carried out by Ipsos MORI, tax avoidance was the second most important ethics issue that the British public thought business needed to address. Avoiding tax is avoiding a social obligation. Tax avoidance can make a company vulnerable to accusations of greed and selfishness, damaging its reputation and destroying the public's trust. Starbucks and Amazon, for example, were vilified and boycotted as a result of their tax policies. Will Google face a similar backlash after their chairman's comments?) towards others in society and should not be seen as a punishment.
1.1.4. Con: Abolishing the tampon tax would help low-income women who cannot afford menstrual products.
1.1.4.1. Con: The abolition of VAT on products [rarely results in the savings being passed on](https://oxfordtax.sbs.ox.ac.uk/article/tampon-tax)(First because, for exclusions from the base to achieve distributional and social aims, the decrease in the tax rate must be passed on to consumers in the form of price reductions. Theoretically this should be \(mostly\) the case, but there is now a wealth of studies showing that prices tend not to fully reflect reductions in VAT. The risk is therefore that a decrease in taxation of tampons would not result in a full price decrease.) to the consumer.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Tanzania [reintroduced its tax on menstrual products](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-48634426)(In his budget speech in parliament on Thursday, Mr Mpango announced a 25% tax on imported wigs and hair extensions and a 10% tax on those made locally as part of a series of measures aimed at increasing government revenue.\n\n\[...\]\n\nMr Mpango also scrapped the exemption on value added tax placed on sanitary towels, saying consumers had not benefited as businesses did not reduce prices when it was introduced) after scrapping it did not reduce prices for consumers.
1.1.4.2. Con: Reusable menstrual products allow for the tax on disposable tampons to be largely circumvented, thereby enabling poorer women to manage their periods affordably.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Reusable menstrual products are taxed at the same rate as non-essential items.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Reusable products are [still taxed](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/periods-tax-discrimination-sustainable-menstrual-products-wuka-pants-a9638281.html)(A company that produces underwear to wear during menstruation has called on the government to reduce tax on sustainable menstrual products such as theirs.\n\nWUKA shared an Instagram post to unveil its petition that urges the government to recognise period pants as a menstrual product so that they can be taxed in line with tampons and sanitary towels.\n\nDespite the fact that the government recently announced that there’d be no period tax on tampons and pads from next year, they did not acknowledge reusable period pants as a menstrual product, despite the fact they are more sustainable.) in some states where the tampon tax has been abandoned.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Con: Despite the tax, reusable alternatives are still cheaper than disposable menstrual products and are a viable option for poorer women.
1.1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: If the items are reusable, women will only pay the tax once, not repeatedly.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Even though reusable products are cheaper than disposable ones, women still have to pay more for them than they should.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: The poorest women in the world live in countries where [an obsession with virginity](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/16/virginity-obsession-morocco-extract-leila-slimani-sex-and-lies)(Virginity is an obsession in Morocco and throughout the Arab world. Whether you’re liberal or not, religious or not, it’s impossible to escape this obsession. According to the family code, before she is married a woman is meant to provide a “certificate of unmarried status”. Of course, the man’s virginity, which is impossible to prove and which isn’t in demand anyway, bothers nobody.) precludes their use of reusable products like [menstrual cups](https://www.indiatimes.com/explainers/news/virginity-and-menstruation-myth-561230.html)(In several Asian countries, the usage of menstrual hygiene products are inextricably linked with the questions of privacy, access, and morality. And these pervasive cultural conceptions of linking menstrual products with women's sexuality are working towards detriment of their health. \n\nMenstrual hygiene has nothing to do with sexual activity. However, in India, women are not allowed to use any product that involves insertion into a vagina before her marriage. Moral policing around virginity becomes a determinant of not only products like menstrual cups but also tampons. \n\nDespite emerging as durable and eco-friendly hygiene products, they have remained invisible outside of pharmacies.), which need to be inserted into the body.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Globally, many more women use [pads than tampons](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1075218/market-share-of-feminine-hygiene-worldwide-by-type/). This is partially attributable to [beliefs surrounding virginity](https://www.vice.com/en/article/594ybb/pm-tampons-virginity-periods-menstruation-hymen)(Later, I learned that the notion that tampons take virginity exists in numerous cultures throughout the world, and that plenty of other girls continue to go through the same thing I did. Religious and cultural conservatism about tampons has existed for as long as they have. Shortly after tampons were invented in 1929, Catholic priests denounced unmarried women's use of tampons because they believed tampons compromised virginity. Similar to masturbation, using tampons became frowned upon or considered sinful in cultures all over the world, and it's still taboo in various Christian denominations and many strictly religious Jewish and Muslim households.), which - by extension - also limit the use of [other inserted menstrual products](https://www.femina.in/wellness/gynaec/menstrual-cups-myths-busted-202113-2.html)(A menstrual cup is a relatively better and more sustainable and eco-friendly choice than pads or tampons. A person uses at least three to four pads on each day of the cycle, and if the amount of waste produced is calculated thereby, that number is alarming. So, we’re here to bust all the myths and misconceptions that are stopping you from making this highly sustainable change.\n\nThe nagging worry surrounding virginity remains a constant here as well. According to experts, there is no such thing in a woman’s body as a 'virginity indicator'. The hymen, which is considered by many as a mark of virginity, is just a tissue that can rupture at any time during a woman’s life. It could be due to exercise, lifting weight, cycling etc, so quit believing in such myths.) like cups.
1.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Implicit [tampon-virginity associations](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/ask-experts/is-wearing-a-tampon-mean-u-lost-ur-virginity-or-can-u-loss-ur-virginity-by-wearing-a-tampon) are also made in countries where premarital sex is [socially acceptable](https://www.statista.com/statistics/297288/global-views-on-premarital-sex/)(The majority of the Europeans found premarital sex to be morally acceptable or not a moral issue at all.). This implies that aversion to tampons is not attributable to virginity beliefs, but a broader variable, such as [purity culture](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0614-7_24)(In exiting a space emphasizing childhood innocence, girls are preoccupied with dissociating themselves from sexuality. We see this in the rejection of tampons, birth control, promiscuity, as well as through the use of splintering. Through these methods, girls resist entrance into broader sexual relations where they lose further control of their new bodies. They cling to the image of the good girl, an attempt to hold on to some sense of childhood innocence \(that is, asexuality\) and to approach teenage sexuality through the safest avenue. Nevertheless, these strategies play into the reproduction of the same cultural ideals and power relations that obstruct the development of girls’ sexual subjectivity.).
1.1.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: In China, 89% of the female hygiene market is pads. Only [8.2 million women](https://uschinatoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tampons-final-1.pdf) use tampons in China, out of a female population of over 660 million.
1.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Not all reusable [period products](https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/fashion-beauty/best-sustainable-period-products-uk-review-b1821265.html) need to be inserted into the vagina.
1.1.4.2.2.3. Con: Virginity-based cultural aversion to inserted menstrual products should be challenged through proper education rather than by offering alternative products.
1.1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: In many cultures that are [obsessed with virginity](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/16/virginity-obsession-morocco-extract-leila-slimani-sex-and-lies), women go so far as to undergo [hymen reconstruction](https://www.aesthetic-plasticsurgeryparis.com/hymenoplasty), as an intact hymen is a [prerequisite for marriage](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/health/pure-patriarchy-hymenoplasty-commodifies-women-breaches-privacy-rights-67050). Education is unlikely to be effective amid such [strong social norms](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/pseudoscience-virginity-testing-hymenoplasty/620089/).
1.1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: Some tampon companies address questions about tampons affecting virginity [on their websites](https://www.ubykotex.com/en-ca/periods/pads-and-tampons/will-i-still-be-a-virgin-if-i-use-a-tampon), suggesting that this is a common concern among women.
1.1.4.2.2.4. Pro: [Some religions](https://www.vice.com/en/article/594ybb/pm-tampons-virginity-periods-menstruation-hymen)(Religious and cultural conservatism about tampons has existed for as long as they have. Shortly after tampons were invented in 1929, Catholic priests denounced unmarried women's use of tampons because they believed tampons compromised virginity. Similar to masturbation, using tampons became frowned upon or considered sinful in cultures all over the world, and it's still taboo in various Christian denominations and many strictly religious Jewish and Muslim households.) consider the use of inserted menstrual products to be [immoral](https://menstrualcupreviews.net/major-religions-and-menstrual-taboos/)(Jewish women of all sects use different menstrual products such as sanitary pads and menstrual cups. However, Traditional Orthodox Jewish girls are encouraged not to use tampons or menstrual cups, as they may break their hymen before marriage. \[...\] Most Muslim women wear sanitary pads during their period, and will not use tampons or menstrual cups until they are married.).
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: A high tax on products that damage the environment, such as tampons, will deter consumers from making choices that are bad for the environment \([pp. 2-3](https://www.oecd.org/env/tools-evaluation/48164926.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Taxing tampons to help the environment will only work if coupled with financial incentives to buy reusable menstrual products.

1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: Taxing tampons to protect the environment will be perceived as disingenuous when condoms - which cause [significant](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-019-01701-y) [environmental damage](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1943815X.2021.1949354) - are [exempt from tax](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/35-states-u-still-charge-170021575.html?guccounter=1)(Every state has its own list of items deemed “necessary” that are tax exempt, ranging from lip balm and dandruff shampoo and condoms, to pumpkins specifically for eating in Pennsylvania and gun club memberships in Wisconsin.) in many countries.
1.1.4.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Unwanted children are probably [worse for the environment](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191015192949.htm)(Population growth is a key driver of climate change; greater and more effective use of contraception reduces unplanned pregnancies which contribute to population growth; and many more men and women would freely choose to use contraception if only it were available and acceptable, they say.\n\nBy 2100, the planet is expected to be home to nearly 11 billion people, some 3 billion more than at present. And that means greenhouse gas emissions will rise further, making global warming an even more intractable problem in the coming decades than it is now, they point out.\n\nBut: "slower future population growth could reduce emissions globally by an estimated 40% or more in the long term," they write) than condoms, so this tax exemption probably benefits the environment in the long run.
1.1.4.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: The environment argument is disingenuous because, in countries where the tampon tax exists, the same tax rate also applies to [environment-friendly](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/sustainable-sanitary-products-should-be-taxed-differently/article19266211.ece)(Under GST, 12% tax is imposed on sanitary products, including menstrual cups and cloth pads.) reusable menstrual products such as menstrual cups and cloth pads.
1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Consumers have changed their purchasing behaviours [in response to environmental taxation](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/fivefactsaboutenvironmentaltaxes/2018-10-09)(3. Five times as many diesel cars are now registered in Great Britain compared with 20 years ago, following changes to transport taxes\n\nOver the last 20 years, the number of petrol-driven cars registered in Great Britain has fallen by around 10%, whilst diesel car registrations have increased fivefold \(406%\). \n\n\[...\]\n\nThese changes can be influenced by taxes, for example, a reduced Vehicle Registration Tax for all cars with low carbon dioxide \(CO2\) emissions and a tax cut on diesel fuel duty in 2001, encouraged motorists to trade in their petrol cars for diesel vehicles, which tend to produce less CO2.) in the past.
1.1.4.2.3.3. Con: A high tax on menstrual products can be construed as government infringement of the bodily autonomy of women, as they dictate which products women can and cannot use - something that is already practiced in prisons \([p. 41](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.3.4. Pro: Disposable menstrual products are [bad for the environment](https://plasticoceans.org/making-menstruation-products-eco-friendly/)(In total, it’s estimated that over 45 billion period products are used every year … and most contain plastic. In fact, according to a study conducted by Natracare, a pack of typical pads contains about the same amount of plastic as five typical plastic shopping bags!); therefore, such products should gradually be eliminated and replaced with reusable products to help fight against the [plastic](https://www.wen.org.uk/our-work/environmenstrual/)(Menstrual pads can contain up to 90% plastic.) and waste crisis.
1.1.4.2.3.4.1. Con: Environment-friendly [disposable menstrual products](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/health/g36104251/best-eco-friendly-tampons/)(To be clear, when we use the term ‘reusable tampon’, we’re talking about the applicator not the tampon itself. There’s been a rise on Etsy of individuals selling reusable cloth or crocheted tampons and while we appreciate their DIY efforts, there’s no data out there to support that these reusable tampons are safe to use - leave the crochet to your gran's vintage tablecloth or Kate Moss’ outfits circa 2008.\n\nA reusable applicator, on the other hand, can be sterilised in-between uses - similar to your menstrual cup - and used again and again, cutting down on plastic. Clean, reload, insert, repeat.\n\nAll the tampons on our list are made from organic cotton too, which means they avoid any pesticides, synthetic material and bleach, which would otherwise end up inside your body. As cotton is a natural fibre, not only is it safe for your skin but it also biodegrades in soil, unlike synthetic tampons that contribute to the waste in our landfills and waters.) are available.
1.1.4.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Environment-friendly options are often [prohibitively expensive](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buying-green-is-too-pricey-for-the-average-consumer/)(Buying "green" is too pricey for the average consumer\n\n\[...\]\n\nFor consumers wanting to buy "green," the choices these days appear endless. Unless, that is, you're on a budget.\n\nEco-friendly straws, sneakers, garments and packaging are often pricier than their conventional counterparts, leaving poor and middle-class people with not much of a choice, according to Bloomberg.\n\n"There's a lot of innovation going on with sustainability right now, it's just not really affordable," Alexis Benveniste, who recently wrote about the phenomenon for Bloomberg, told CBS News. "It's hard to scale when you're paying more for a green product.").
1.1.4.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: [Carmesi](https://www.thebetterindia.com/164284/carmesi-eco-friendly-pads-sanitary-napkins-menstrual-health/)(The pads, they claim, are made using entirely natural ingredients such as corn starch and bamboo fibre, making them biodegradable, and easy to compost — an eco-friendly alternative to conventional pads which take up to 800 years to biodegrade.\n\nWhen discarded along with organic waste, Carmesi pads begin decomposing in 6 to 12 months, Tanvi claims, and can even be composted at home.) offers menstrual products made of corn and bamboo that are compostable at home and will decompose within one year.
1.1.4.2.3.4.1.3. Con: Even if a disposable product is environment-friendly, the process of disposal is likely environment-unfriendly, as safe disposal requires the use of products such as lined-receptacles and gloves \([p. 71](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.3.4.2. Con: There are companies \(e.g., [Turn and Flow](https://www.turnandflow.org/)\) that recycle used and disposed menstrual products to reduce waste, generate renewable energy, and create other green products.
1.1.4.2.3.4.3. Con: Alternatives to using disposable menstrual products - such as taking medication to suppress periods - are also harmful to the environment, as the hormones secreted through urine have a negative impact on the ecosystem, including human beings \([p. 13](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.3.4.4. Pro: Tampons and tampon applicators frequently end up on beaches where they cause [harm](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-is-there-plastic-in-my-tampon_uk_5a96cc5be4b07dffeb6ec7bb)(The AHPMA expressly discourages the flushing of feminine hygiene products. This is a key way that plastic makes its way into our oceans.\n\n“The plastic in tampons is an urgent problem that we need to address,” Kate Metcalf, co-director of Women’s Environmental Network told HuffPost UK. “Plastic doesn’t biodegrade when it reaches our oceans and rivers, it disintegrates into smaller pieces. These ‘microplastics’ are having a devastating impact on marine life as they are injested by fish, birds and other marine life with fatal effects.”) to birds and fish that consume them.
1.1.4.2.3.4.4.1. Con: Plastic waste ends up on beaches because of [poor waste management](https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/how-does-plastic-get-into-the-ocean) at the individual and infrastructural level. [Improving](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/how-does-plastic-end-ocean) this will reduce the amount of disposed menstrual products on beaches.
1.1.4.2.3.4.4.2. Pro: The Center for Marine Conservation reported that between 1998 and 1999, more than [170,000 tampon applicators](https://wemoon.com.au/environmental-choice/) were collected from US coastal areas.
1.1.4.2.3.4.5. Pro: Reusable pads require far less energy to manufacture than disposable products \([p. 5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DtnujjZMq7TEVNt5A9sFI3rF5czPH2jz/view)\).
1.1.4.2.3.4.6. Pro: Harmful [insecticides](http://www.pan-uk.org/cotton/) are used during the production of cotton that is used in tampons.
1.1.4.2.4. Con: The existence of cheaper alternatives does not change the fact that it is wrong to tax a luxury rate for a daily necessity.
1.1.4.2.5. Pro: Many women use [reusable menstrual products](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/health/g36119139/best-reusable-sanitary-products/)(You already know that your menstrual cycle impacts your training regime, but have you ever considered the effect that your sanitary products are having on our planet? If not, it's time to give reusable pads, period pants and menstrual cups a try.\n\nNot only do these eco-friendly products avoid the fragrances, dyes and chlorine bleaching that can disrupt your vagina's delicate pH balance and cause infections, but they also help to cut down on period pollution.\n\nBrits flush 2.5 million tampons, 1.4 million pads and 700,000 panty liners down the loo every day. That's a horrifying volume of menstrual waste heading for our oceans and landfill sites. By choosing a tried and tested reusable alternative that's both sustainable and secure, you won’t be adding to this growing problem.), drastically reducing their period expenditure over their lifetime and benefitting the environment.
1.1.4.2.5.1. Con: The fact that many women voluntarily choose to use reusable products does not justify penalizing women who opt to use disposable menstrual products.
1.1.4.2.5.2. Pro: It is cheaper in the long run to buy a menstrual cup as they do not have to be bought monthly, like disposable menstrual products.
1.1.4.2.5.2.1. Con: While cheaper in the long run, menstrual cups require a much larger initial payment which many women cannot afford.
1.1.4.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Menstrual cups are [provided for free](https://www.mooncup.co.uk/blog/did-someone-say-free-period/)(Now more than ever, it’s time for schools to grab this opportunity to address the issue of youth period poverty. Eradicating period poverty doesn’t have to cost the earth either. The Mooncup® menstrual cup is available free of charge in state schools in England, and it’s not just a product for now, but for the future too. There’s no reason to go without.) in English state schools.
1.1.4.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: Menstrual cups come in [different sizes](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/menstrual-cup)(If you’re interested in using a menstrual cup, talk with your gynecologist. Although you can buy any of the brands online or in most stores, you’ll first have to find out what size you need. Most menstrual cup brands sell small and large versions.); a woman would need to try menstrual cups of different sizes to find the one that suits her best. Purchasing multiple menstrual cups can prove expensive.
1.1.4.2.5.2.1.3. Pro: People on minimum wage are often left with [so little spare money](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35924293)(The 2015 study found that a single adult would need £632.80 a month to cover essentials. This includes £72.28 on fuel bills, £187.98 on food and £115.60 on travel. This would also cover £78.09 for household goods and services such as detergent or getting an appliance fixed and £59.24 for personal goods and services, such as toiletries or a trip to the dentist.\n\nAssuming rent was £364, that would leave £94.20 a month for everything else, including clothing, any socialising, leisure activities, birthday and Christmas presents, holidays, pension contributions and general savings.) that it may not be possible for them to save up enough to buy a menstrual cup.
1.1.4.2.5.2.1.3.1. Con: Cheaper products cost poor people more in the long run \([p. 1](https://new-ideo-com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/files/pdfs/IDEO_Patterns_issue28.pdf)(When companies design products and services for the poor, they often think about making them as low-cost as possible. But whether you’re tapping a market opportunity or addressing a social need, it’s important to realize that people living in poverty value quality design.\n\nQuality design doesn’t mean that goods and services need to cost more. Quality experiences meet people where they are, acknowledging such important factors as status, aspiration, and dignity.)\), because low-cost products tend to be less durable. Therefore, improving budgeting skills by investing in products that save money in the long term \(e.g., menstrual cups\) would be more beneficial to the poor.
1.1.4.2.5.2.1.3.2. Pro: The financial ramifications of minimum wage employment for the tampon tax are more pronounced for young women aged [16-22 and apprentices](https://www.minimum-wage.co.uk/), who earn less than £10 an hour, respectively.
1.1.4.2.5.2.2. Pro: Menstrual cups can be used for [several years](https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/case-studies/menstrualcups.html#tabs-2); some last for up to 10 years.
1.1.4.2.5.2.3. Pro: A menstrual cup can cost as little as [£7.99](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B016UBWBFO/ref=mp_s_a_1_6_a_it/260-9313679-1042804?ie=UTF8&qid=1526411311&sr=8-6&keywords=menstrual+cup&dpPl=1&dpID=413qsV7lU-L&ref=plSrch). That is approximately the cost of [two boxes of tampons](https://www.expatistan.com/price/tampax/london) which wouldn't last as long as the menstrual cup.
1.1.4.2.5.3. Pro: [Period panties](https://menstrualcupreviews.net/best-period-panties-reviews/) are a type of underwear that absorbs blood. As they are reusable, they will almost certainly save women money in the long run.
1.1.4.2.5.3.1. Pro: Over three years, a woman’s average expenditure per cycle would be [double for a box of tampons](https://www.health.com/condition/menstruation/period-products-that-will-save-you-money)(Most period underwear costs around $36. For a five-day flow, without laundry, you'll spend $175. If you take good care of your new underwear, over three years, you'll have spent less than $5 per period. Given that a box of name-brand tampons runs around $10, that's not a bad deal.) than if she reused five period panties; the expenditure would be even lesser if she washed and reused those panties during the same cycle.
1.1.4.2.5.3.2. Con: Women may still need to wear a tampon or similar product when using period panties.
1.1.4.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: During heavy flow, some women prefer to wear an additional [tampon or menstrual cup](https://mes-menstruelles.com/en/menstrual-panties-faq/).
1.1.4.2.5.3.2.2. Con: Wearing a pad is not recommended because not only is it unnecessary but also the absorbent material in the period panty combined with the pad can be [uncomfortable](https://mes-menstruelles.com/en/menstrual-panties-faq/)(No. This is unnecessary because the bottom of sanitary pads is waterproof. Moreover, you would feel uncomfortable; it would make you feel as if you were wearing a diaper. We advise that you wear either a Period Panty or use a menstrual pad. You can use any one that you think suits you, because each woman is different and makes her own choice.) and feel as though one is wearing a diaper.
1.1.4.2.5.3.3. Con: Women would need more than one pair of period panties during their period; poor women cannot afford to purchase multiple pairs or wash their only pair daily.
1.1.4.2.5.3.3.1. Con: Reusable pads can be [handwashed in the sink](https://wearemout.co.uk/washing-reusable-period-pads/)(You can handwash your pads as soon as you take them off by rinsing them under cold running water in your bathroom sink. Once rinsed give them a good clean with some soap. Anything you have to hand will work, we’ve been known to use handwash, shower gel or even shampoo. Some of our customers are organised enough to keep a stash of detergent in their bathrooms. Give the pad good scrub then run under a hot tap. Rinse and squeeze until the blood has all run out and it’s all clean.\n\nThis wash and wear method cuts down on the water, electric and the number of pads you’ll need.).
1.1.4.2.5.3.3.2. Pro: Poor people tend to use laundromats because they do not own [washing machines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/18/the-stark-inequality-of-washing-machines/). Thus, poor women would not be able to afford to wash their reusable menstrual products every day of their period.
1.1.4.2.6. Con: Reusable menstrual products can be impractical.
1.1.4.2.6.1. Con: Because they never get thrown out, people should always have reusable menstrual products at home. This makes them more practical than having to go to the shops when people run out of single-use products.
1.1.4.2.6.2. Con: Reusable menstrual products reduce household waste as they do not need to be thrown out after a single use, potentially reducing burdensome trips to outdoor bins or dumps.
1.1.4.2.6.3. Pro: Washing reusable menstrual products can prove to be expensive and difficult, especially for poor women.
1.1.4.2.6.3.1. Con: If rinsed beforehand, reusable pads can be washed as part of a [regular laundry load](https://www.theperiodlady.co.uk/blog/how-to-care-wash-reusable-sanitary-pads.html)(Pads can be added to normal household laundry do a separate rinse first and then add the rest of your laundry. Make note you should NOT use laundry softener as this will decrease the absorbency over time by leaving a residue on the fabrics.).
1.1.4.2.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.5.3.3.2.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2. Con: Menstrual cups can simply be [rinsed out with water](https://www.mooncup.co.uk/using-mooncup/how-do-i-clean-my-mooncup/)(How to clean your Mooncup during your period\n\nWhen a sink is at hand:\n\n- Wash your Mooncup menstrual cup with water or mild, non-perfumed soap. Always rinse it well with water after using soap as any traces left on the Mooncup may cause irritation.) during a woman's cycle.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1. Con: Reusable menstrual products can be [difficult to sterilise](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a31077442/crocheted-reusable-tampons/)(Sure, crocheted tampons and reusable cloth tampons might seem fine, but in actuality, there’s no data about the safety of reusable tampons. This means we don’t know how the foreign material of these tampons interacts with the vagina environment, says ob-gyn Adeeti Gupta, MD, founder and CEO of Walk in GYN Care.\n\nAside from the non-info about reusable tampons, it also seems like docs are pretty skeptical about the idea anyway. “From the medical perspective, I would suggest that the use of the cotton reusable or crocheted tampon is both impractical, not healthy, and a gimmick,” adds Mitchell S. Kramer, MD, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital.) and may be unsafe if not properly cleaned.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.1. Con: Many reusable products - like handkerchiefs and feeding bottles - also require sterilization. Yet, this has not precluded their widespread use.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.2. Con: Menstrual cups can be easily sterilized using [menstrual cup sterilizers](https://www.thesirona.com/products/sirona-menstrual-cup-sterilizer-clean-your-period-cup-effortlessly-kills-99-of-germs-in-3-minutes-with-steam-1-unit), which effectively neutralize harmful pathogens.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Menstrual cup sterilizers are a further expenditure on top of the menstrual cup that makes it less accessible for others.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Menstrual [cup sterilizers](https://www.amazon.com/Menstrual-Cup-Sterilizer-Minutes-Period/dp/B07M5HGTJ6/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=sirona%2Bmenstrual%2Bcup%2Bsterilizer&qid=1643808151&sprefix=sirona%2Bmenstrual%2Caps%2C351&sr=8-4&th=1) cost less than $40 - the cost of four tampon boxes.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.2.3. Con: Purchasing menstrual cup sterilisers create clutter around the house.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.3. Pro: Water sterilises at 80 [degrees Celsius](https://www.morebeer.com/category/cleaning-sanitizing-chemicals.html#Sanitization%20Methods) while washing machines generally heat water to about [54.4 degrees Celsius](http://www.thespruce.com/laundry-and-water-temperature-1900646). Thus, washed reusable menstrual products are not safe for reuse.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Even water heaters heat water only up to about [60 degrees Celsuis](https://www.aireserv.com/about/blog/2018/april/best-temperature-for-a-water-heater/), after which the thermostat automatically switches off. This implies that a primary source of hot water in most homes cannot be used to sanitize menstrual products.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.3.2. Con: While reusable menstrual products cleaned in a washing machine may not be safe, these products can be hand-washed using boiled water from a kettle or stove.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.3.3. Con: Product manufacturers [do not suggest](https://www.heygirls.co.uk/reusable-period-pads-washing-instructions/)(WASH\n\n- After you’ve worn your pad and you’re ready to wash them, it’s always a good idea to pre-rinse them with natural soap or cold water to help prevent staining. Soak the pads and ring them dry until the water runs clear.\n\n- You can hand or machine wash the pads, stick to a 40’ cycle and avoid using heavy fabric conditioner – this can affect the absorbency of the material inside the pads.) washing reusable pads at very high temperatures.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.4. Pro: Menstrual cups require boiling water to be effectively cleaned and remain safe for use. Many women don't have consistent and easy access to facilities for this level of care.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: As many as [140,000 poorer households](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43827846.amp)(Hundreds of thousands of the poorest families in Britain are going without basic necessities, according to two separate surveys.\n\nCitizens Advice said as many as 140,000 households are going without power, as they cannot afford to top up their prepayment meters.) in Britain don't have access to power, which would be necessary to access boiling water to wash a menstrual cup.
1.1.4.2.6.3.2.1.4.2. Con: There is a difference between "sterilizing" and "cleaning" one's cup; while menstrual cups should be cleaned every few hours, sterilization only needs to be done at the [end of their period](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-clean-menstrual-cup).
1.1.4.2.6.3.3. Pro: Homeless women may have no facilities to wash reusable menstrual products.
1.1.4.2.6.3.4. Pro: The average woman will use approximately [9120 tampons](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7258780?guccounter=1) in their lifetime; washing enough reusable products to last that many uses is an impractical amount of labor.
1.1.4.2.6.3.5. Pro: For women with medical conditions that cause heavy periods such as endometriosis, menstrual cups would be impractical as they would need to be cleaned [more frequently](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325093)(In addition, a person with a very heavy flow or who frequently get clots in their menstrual blood may experience some leaks.).
1.1.4.2.6.4. Con: Many environment-friendly products and practices are [impractical](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/plastic_free_week)(A few years ago, bringing your own bags to a supermarket was considered odd. In my plastic-free week, people were mostly helpful. The checkout assistant gave me an exasperated look when I handed back a plastic band from my spring onions, but they were still friendly.\n\nYes, shopping plastic-free took more time than my usual food shop and ruled out a lot of food.), but that does not mean they are not the moral choice.
1.1.4.2.6.5. Pro: Reusable menstrual products are prohibited or discouraged in certain environments.
1.1.4.2.6.5.1. Pro: Women visiting prisons cannot wear inserted menstrual products, as this could interfere with strip searches \([p. 41](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.6.5.2. Pro: Workplace safety regulations encourage the use of disposable menstrual products, as this reduces the risk of transmission of diseases to sanitation workers \([p. 12](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)(Disposable products are viewed beneficially by workplace safety regulators, but negatively by environmentalists. Occupational Safety and Health Administration \(“OSHA”\), the federal government charged with regulating workplace safety, assumes effective absorbency of commercially available disposable menstrual products. OSHA has determined that bloodborne pathogens will not be transmitted by the used products since the products’ absorbency will prevent any leaks of the menses. Therefore, OSHA does not require workplaces to undergo any special precautions to protect workers who might come in contact with the used and disposed products. OSHA expects, but does not require, that the used products be discarded into lined receptacles. This standard, therefore, encourages the use of commercial disposable products as the basis for workplace safety.)\).
1.1.4.2.6.5.3. Con: Instead of expecting women to adhere to different period-related rules and regulations in different environments, such practices should be abolished so that women can independently choose the products they prefer.
1.1.4.2.6.6. Pro: Some women find the menstrual cup uncomfortable.
1.1.4.2.6.6.1. Pro: Women shouldn't have to be uncomfortable for approximately [60 days a year](https://www.menstrupedia.com/articles/physiology/menstruation-last) for financial reasons.
1.1.4.2.6.6.2. Pro: To insert a menstrual cup without irritation, women need to use [lubricants](https://www.healthline.com/health/menstrual-cup-dangers#dont-use-if). Eliminating disposable menstrual products penalizes women without access to lubricants \(e.g., school girls\): purchase lubricants and appear sexually active or cope with the pain of using a menstrual cup without lubrication.
1.1.4.2.6.6.3. Con: Menstrual cups typically cause discomfort when they are [used incorrectly](https://www.juju.com.au/blogs/juju-products/menstrual-cup-hurting) or without adequate lubrication. Appropriate education \(e.g., pamphlets included in the product\) can reduce the likelihood of discomfort.
1.1.4.2.6.7. Pro: Reusable menstrual products require more forethought and planning, making them less convenient.
1.1.4.2.6.7.1. Con: To discard disposable menstrual products, women need to carry [wrapping materials](https://www.menstrupedia.com/articles/girls/sanitary-dispose)(Sanitary pad or tampon should never be flushed down the toilet because it may clog the drainage system and lead to flooding of the toilet. After use, a disposable sanitary pad or a tampon should be wrapped in a news paper or waste paper and put in a garbage bin.), such as plastic bags or covers. Thus, both reusable and disposable menstrual products require forethought and planning.
1.1.4.2.6.7.2. Pro: Most reusable menstrual products [need to be cleaned](https://www.heygirls.co.uk/reusable-period-pads-washing-instructions/)(How to wash and care for your reusable period pads).
1.1.4.2.6.7.3. Pro: If a woman is using reusable menstrual products to save the environment, they should not be bought to deal with an emergency. This can cause issues for women with [unpredictable cycles](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/irregular-periods/)(You have irregular periods if the length of your menstrual cycle \(the gap between your periods starting\) keeps changing.\n\nYour periods may come early or late.\n\nThe average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, although it's normal for it to be a bit shorter or longer than this.\n\nAfter puberty, many women develop a regular cycle with a similar length of time between periods. But it's not uncommon for it to vary by a few days each time.).
1.1.4.3. Pro: The tampon tax is a [regressive tax](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/fiscal-policy/regressive-tax/)(A regressive tax is a tax which takes a higher percentage of tax revenue from those on low incomes. As income increases, the proportion of your income paid in tax falls.), having the largest percentage impact on the poorest people. Tampon tax thus harms poor people, who are most likely to be [women](https://wbg.org.uk/blog/dwp-data-reveals-women-continue-to-be-worst-affected-by-poverty/).
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Deductions exist for everything from [medical treatment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/213) to [vacations](https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/abc-of-money/tax-deductions-for-travel-expenses), yet the tampon tax cannot be claimed as a deduction. This penalizes women and benefits the government.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: All sales taxes are regressive as they are flat. Nonetheless, they provide a vital revenue stream for governments that can be redistributed to reduce income inequality.
1.1.4.4. Con: Abolishing the tampon tax is not an effective means of improving access to menstrual products for low-income women. It is the cost of these products - not the tampon tax - that is prohibitively expensive.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Prison stores charge exorbitant rates for tampons; governments that overcharge prison inmates to make profits cannot be expected to make period products free for all women on humanitarian grounds \([p. 58](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Campaigning to abolish the tampon tax is wrong because it normalizes the problematic notion that women should pay for menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Given the [low lifetime cost](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42013239) of the tampon tax, abolition would be more symbolic than impactful. Instead of investing into campaigns focusing on such cosmetic changes, resources should be redirected toward making menstrual products free.
1.1.4.4.2.2. Con: The campaign to end the tampon tax can exist alongside the campaign to make menstrual products free without taking away from the latter movement.
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: Even if the [tampon tax](https://pepperdine-graphic.com/opinion-the-tampon-tax-can-benefit-women/)(Hypothetically, the price of a pack of tampons is $10 — $4 for cost price, $4 for profit and $2 for tax. When the government abolishes the “tampon tax,” the manufacturers could still keep the price at $10, $4 for cost and now $6 for profit. Therefore, abolishing the “tampon tax” could possibly increase the revenue of the tampon manufacturers and the people who need tampons might not receive many benefits from it.) were abolished, manufacturers could increase the price of menstrual products, making them unaffordable for low-income women.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Some manufacturers are [already raising their prices](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/549391-pg-is-raising-prices-on-feminine-care-brands-this-fall)(If you menstruate, you already know how costly tampons and pads can be — not to mention the Advil for your cramps and skin care for those pesky zits. This fall, the price tag is about to get even higher. Thanks COVID-19. \n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain and driven up demand for many care products, including toilet paper and diapers, while others, including razors \(looking at you with the overgrown beard\), have dropped. Feminine care sales dropped in European markets last year, according to the P&G third quarter report, but were partially offset by "premium innovation growth in North America.") on menstruation products.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Con: Before its abolition in 2021, stores like Tesco [paid](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/tesco-absorbs-tampon-tax-5-per-cent-vat-sanitary-products) the UK's 5% tampon tax themselves instead of charging customers for it. Some companies, therefore, are allies in combating overpriced menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: While the UK was a [member of the EU](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-the-uks-decision-to-abolish-the-tampon-tax-is-significant-7131123/)(Until December 31, the UK was a part of the EU, where period products such as sanitary napkins and tampons are classified as non-essential, and member states are required to levy a 5 per cent tax on them.\n\nNow that the UK is out of the 27-member bloc, it is not bound by its directives, under which sanitary products had been subjected to five different VAT rates since 1973– with the lowest 5 per cent slab being applicable since 2001.\n\nThe removal of the tax has thus been praised by women’s right activists and Brexit proponents at the same time.), they were obligated to comply with regulations stipulated by the latter. [Soon after Brexit had occurred](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56580419)(Tampon Tax\n\nA cut in VAT for tampons and sanitary products was the first Brexit 'dividend', announced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak on 1 January - a day after the end of the transition period.), the tax was scrapped in 2021.
1.1.4.4.3.2.2. Con: Tesco has been accused of [large-scale tax avoidance](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/12/uk-companies-condemned-tax-havens)(The UK's 100 biggest public companies are running more than 8,000 subsidiaries or joint ventures in onshore and offshore tax havens, according to research published on Monday, raising fresh concerns about the full extent of corporate tax avoidance.\n\nThe figures, published by the charity ActionAid, show that only two of the companies listed on the UK's FTSE 100 have no subsidiaries in tax havens – while companies such as Barclays and Tesco own hundreds.) in the past, a practice that probably has a much more significant impact on women's health than paying for 5% of the price of menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: Removing the tampon tax will not cut their price enough to make them affordable for women experiencing period poverty.
1.1.4.4.4.1. Con: If tampons are taxed, the money obtained from the tax can be used to provide free menstrual products to those who otherwise could not afford them.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1. Pro: The tampon tax is affordable for most women in developed countries. Rather than abolishing the tax altogether, the government should subsidize menstrual products for low-income women.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.1. Con: People are already reluctant to support [food stamps](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20835692/conservative-think-tank-foundation-for-government-accountability-food-stamps-snap-poverty-welfare)(Several states — including Kansas, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Kentucky — have implemented one of the FGA’s signature proposals: work requirements for SNAP recipients.

It is even less likely that the political will exists to subsidise hygiene products.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Some of the [wealthiest members of society](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/millionaires-call-on-governments-worldwide-to-tax-us-now)(The group of 102 millionaires and billionaires, including Disney heiress Abigail Disney, said the current tax system is rigged in their favour and needs to be rewritten to make taxation fairer for hard-working people and restore trust in politics.\n\n“As millionaires, we know that the current tax system is not fair,” they said in an open letter published on Wednesday. “Most of us can say that, while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic – yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes.”\n\nThe super-rich signatories, who brand themselves as “patriotic millionaires”, called for the introduction of “permanent wealth taxes on the richest to help reduce extreme inequality and raise revenue for sustained, long-term increases in public services like healthcare”.) have urged the government to tax them more in an attempt to reduce socioeconomic inequality. Therefore, tax rates for the economically elite can be increased.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Ignoring their own privilege, wealthy people incorrectly attribute their success to their [hard work](https://www.popneuro.com/neuromarketing-blog/psychology-wealth-success-meritocracy-luck-self-made-fundamental-attribution-error)(This staunch, paradoxical belief in meritocracy directly impacts the way the general public sees the wealthy. \[...\] “The difficult thing about a meritocracy—or what we think is a meritocracy—is that we believe billionaires deserve it and that we should idolize them.”\n\nThis is also reflected in how rich individuals view themselves and their own accomplishments. It’s all that much more satisfying if you think that you deserved it. In fact, research suggests that people in higher income brackets are much more likely than those with lower incomes to say that individuals get rich primarily because they work hard. Wealthy people also are more likely to attribute their own success to hard work rather than to other circumstantial factors. \[...\] And yet, the data suggests that the best predictors of wealth are the circumstances of one’s birth. Factors like the educational levels of your family, or intergenerational wealth, which by definition, the person has no control over.). Lawmakers, many of whom are [economically privileged](https://thehustle.co/self-made-myth-luck-versus-hard-work/)(A toxic myth pervades the business world: Hard work and perseverance are the only things required to achieve immense success and reach the top of your field.\n\nIt’s a mantra championed by everyone from Wall Street titans to our sitting US President \(“I built what I built myself,” Trump told Charlie Rose in 1992. “I did it by working long hours, working hard and working smart!”\).\n\nThis idea is staunchly rooted in the very foundations of America — a nation built on the cornerstones of rugged individualism, picking oneself up by the bootstraps, and accruing riches through sheer determination.

1.1.4.4.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Food stamps may be unpopular because they are extremely expensive. In 2015, the cost of the food stamp program was almost [25 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program#/media/File:SNAP_Benefits_Paid_2005-2012.png) that of [annual sales](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/04/29/womens-periods-menstruation-tampons-pads-449833.html)(U.S. consumers spent $3.1 billion on tampons, pads and sanitary panty liners last year, according to Euromonitor, and the global sanitary protection products market reached $30 billion.) of menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: On average, women spend [1,773 USD](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/period-cost-lifetime_n_7258780)(There are other options, but 70 percent of women use tampons. You're instructed to change your tampon every 4 to 8 hours, so we'll use 6 hours as an average. A box containing 36 tampons costs $7 at Walgreens.\n\n1 tampon every 6 hours = 4 tampons per day x 5 days of a period = 20 tampons per cycle x 456 periods = 9,120 tampons. At 36 tampons per box, that's 253.3 boxes x $7 = $1,773.33) on tampons throughout their lifetime.

1.1.4.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: In the US, the average woman spends [313 USD per month](https://www.byrdie.com/average-cost-of-beauty-maintenance) on beauty products; thus, for the average woman, monthly expenditure on appearance is four times higher than the lifetime cost of the tampon tax.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Tampons are only one part of period expenditure. If one includes all medicines and materials needed to help women deal with their periods, women can spend up to [18,171 USD](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/period-cost-lifetime_n_7258780)(Women's monthly periods are costing them much more than the pain of menstrual cramps. Between tampons, pain relievers and heating pads to soothe the aches, the costs associated with that magical time of the month add up. Aunt Flo is one expensive lady.\n\nThough the numbers may vary slightly for you due to local price changes, or your superhuman ability to avoid unwanted stains, having a period is a hefty cost that half the population will never have to pay -- and this doesn't even include the cost of the regular doctor's exams to keep your birth control prescription up to date, and your reproductive health in check.) on managing their periods over their lives.
1.1.4.4.4.1.1.2.3. Con: A hypothetical lifetime tampon tax bill of 88 USD assumes a woman only has to buy tampons for herself. [In families with several girls](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/tampons-pads-period.html)(Ms. Cotton, an Indianapolis-based mom of three, had to buy Mucinex for a cold, extra tissues and Christmas gifts: an Amazon tablet for her son, a discounted Nintendo for one daughter and sketchbooks for the other. But the expenses weighed heavily on Ms. Cotton, 30, who was laid off from her housekeeping job at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nAs she scrambled to budget savings for her family’s needs — meals, clothes, school supplies — she found menstrual products particularly difficult to cover. Period products for herself and her two daughters, 10 and 11, can sometimes cost up to $50 a month, Ms. Cotton said, because they each have different cycles and needs.), this can become a significant expenditure.
1.1.4.4.4.1.2. Pro: Many governments have already started providing [free menstrual products to people who need them](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/period-products-in-schools-and-colleges/period-product-scheme-for-schools-and-colleges-in-england)(The period product scheme is available to all state maintained schools and 16 to 19 education organisations in England. It provides free period products to learners who need them in their place of study. The scheme is available for organisations to order until July 2022.\n\nTo make sure organisations have access to a wide range of period products in the most cost-effective and efficient way, we have a contract with Personnel Hygiene Services Limited \(phs\). This allows you to order period products and have them delivered when you need them.). Wealthier women do not need this assistance.
1.1.4.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: [94% of secondary schools in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/94-of-secondary-schools-provide-free-period-products-to-students)(New data on the government’s free period product scheme shows schools and colleges stepping up to make sure no student has to miss lessons because of their period.\n\nThe data published today \(Thursday 27 January\) shows the value of products being ordered increased by almost a quarter \(23%\) in 2021 to £3.4 million compared with £2.8 million in 2020.\n\nThe number of environmentally friendly or reusable products ordered increased from less than a third in 2020 \(30%\) to almost half \(48%\) of all products in 2021.\n\nIn total, 13,822 individual organisations \(68% of all those eligible\) have ordered free period products since the scheme began in January 2020, helping reduce stigma around menstruation. This includes 94% of secondary schools and 90% of post 16 organisations.) offer free menstrual products to students.
1.1.4.4.4.1.2.2. Con: That wealthier women do not need free menstrual products does not negate the fact that it is unfair to tax them for purchasing menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.4.1.3. Con: It is unfair to make only women who can afford the tampon tax pay for free menstrual products for women in poverty. This money should come from everyone.
1.1.4.4.4.1.3.1. Con: [Charitable donations](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/women-more-likely-to-give-and-give-more-than-men-study-finds) are [gendered](https://theconversation.com/giving-while-female-women-are-more-likely-to-donate-to-charities-than-men-of-equal-means-141518) in that women donate in larger numbers and donate larger amounts. Therefore, wealthy women are unlikely to be opposed to the idea of financing the menstrual needs of underprivileged women.
1.1.4.4.4.1.3.2. Pro: Funds for government schemes to help people in poverty normally come from all taxpayers.
1.1.4.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.4.1.1.2.
1.1.4.4.4.3. Con: Instead of paying for all women’s menstrual expenses, the government should increase women’s purchasing power, enabling them to afford menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.4.3.1. Pro: Granting tax exemptions or subsidies for women's products would reinforce [benevolent sexist notions](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/prejudice/benevolent-sexism/)(Benevolent sexism, however, is an affectionate but patronizing attitude that treats women as needing men’s help, protection, and provision \(i.e., as being more like children than adults\). \[...\] Behaviors that illustrate benevolent sexism include overhelping women \(implying they cannot do something themselves\) \[...\] Because benevolent sexism is often more subtle, however, many women are induced to accept its promise of men’s affection, protection, and help, without fully realizing that this can diminish their own independence and opportunities.) that women require unique accommodations or privileges; such attitudes perpetuate [gender inequality](https://wp.nyu.edu/steinhardt-appsych_opus/the-role-of-benevolent-sexism-in-gender-inequality/)(Women do not interpret these condescending behaviors as acts of prejudice, but as protective and caring actions \(Glick & Fiske, 2001\). Men fail to recognize their benevolent sexist acts as oppressive, and often become fixated on fulfilling their traditional gender roles as the providers in their romantic relationships \(Glick & Fiske, 2001; Good & Sanchez, 2009\). Therefore, both genders’ actions within the framework of benevolent sexism influence each other—with men taking care of women, and women depending on men to take care of them—to the extent where motivation to rework an unjust system is diminished \(Becker & Wright, 2011\).).
1.1.4.4.4.3.2. Con: Fixing deeply entrenched [social problems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/14/why-gender-pay-gap-still-persists-what-we-can-do-about-it/)(Embedded in the very DNA of Americans’ understanding of work is a devaluation of women’s time and skills. Men’s contributions to the public sphere — as doctors, lawyers, soldiers — have always tended to be fairly priced. Meanwhile, when women translate the tasks they’re expected to offer a household into a full-time job, they don’t receive the pay that they’re due. That’s why legislative advances on equal pay continue, but female workers don’t always see their effects.\n\nThe pay gap can’t be erased with the swish of a legal magic wand. Its roots go deeper into American society, striking at the core of our understanding of what constitutes work.) such as the gender pay gap would be more complicated than paying for women's menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.5. Con: Making menstrual products free would be too expensive for governments.
1.1.4.4.5.1. Con: The total amount spent on menstrual products in the US in 2015 was [3.1 billion USD](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/04/29/womens-periods-menstruation-tampons-pads-449833.html). The federal budget was [3.8 trillion USD](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/). The government could easily afford to make menstrual products free for every woman, thus ensuring that women's rights are guaranteed.
1.1.4.4.5.2. Pro: The [166 million women](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2021/womens-history-month.html)(166.6 million\n\nThe number of females in the United States as of July 2019.

1.1.4.4.5.3. Con: Avoiding a decrease in government revenue is not a good enough reason to maintain a discriminatory policy.
1.1.4.4.5.4. Pro: Paying for all women's menstrual products will cost Scotland [24 million GBP annually](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/25/938893768/scotland-becomes-first-country-to-make-period-products-free)(The Period Products \(Free Provision\) \(Scotland\) Bill, which passed unanimously, requires local authorities to ensure that period products are generally obtainable free of charge. Schools and colleges must ensure period products are freely available to students, and designated public places must also make the products available.\n\nThe Scottish government has estimated the measure will cost 24 million pounds a year – about $32 million.). For a population of just over five million people, this amounts \(approximately\) to an extra 10 GBP of government expenditure per woman.
1.1.4.4.5.4.1. Con: Transferring the cost of purchasing menstrual products from governments to individual women is not a fair or reasonable solution to this significant expenditure.
1.1.4.4.5.4.2.

1.1.4.4.5.4.3. Pro: The Scottish government [spends more money than they collect in tax revenue](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scottish-independence-exactly-how-much-money-does-scotland-contribute-to-england-and-what-is-the-barnett-formula-3233129)(According to the 2018/2019 Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland \(GERS\) report, tax revenue in north of the border amounted to around £66 billion.\n\nThat figure includes North Sea oil revenues.\n\nHow much money does Scotland receive from the UK Government?\n\nIn 2018/2019, Scotland received about £81 billion in public spending, according to GERS.\n\nThat means the UK Government spent an additional £15 billion in Scotland as a whole, than it collected from the country via taxes.\n\nThe Westminster Government is able to achieve this because it pools tax revenues taken from across the four UK nations, before the money is re-allocated to each as public spending using a formula invented by Labour politician Joel Barnett in the 1970s.), with the rest covered by the British government. The country can't afford to pay for all women's menstrual products by itself.
1.1.4.4.5.4.3.1. Con: Scotland's financial relationship with the rest of the UK is complicated. [Some surveys](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-has-scotland-subsidised-the-rest-of-the-uk)(Ian Blackford said Scotland “has subsidised the rest of the UK in most of the last 40-year period”.\n\nThe only statistics we know of that cover four decades of Scotland’s finances are these experimental data published by the Scottish government in 2013.) have argued that Scotland actually contributes to the UK's tax pool.
1.1.4.4.5.4.3.2. Pro: [London subsidises the rest of the United Kingdom](https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/may/23/london-uk-scotland-ons-brexit-scottish-independence)(Yet two conclusions seem clear. First, if Brexit presents challenges for London, with its heavy weighting towards financial services, the problem is the rest of the UK’s too. As matters stand, London and the south-east are the UK’s cash cow.\n\nSecond, an independent Scotland would face hard choices. The deficit per head in Scotland was £2,824 last year, according to the ONS data. To reduce that figure as a standalone nation, taxes would have to rise or spending would have to fall, other factors being equal. That makes the currency question – one of the central debates in the 2014 referendum – critical.). If Scotland was an independent country, it is unlikely they could afford to maintain expensive policies like free menstrual products.
1.1.4.4.5.4.4. Pro: Paying for menstrual products in more populous countries would be very expensive. [In the US](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2021/womens-history-month.html)(The number of females in the United States as of July 2019. There were 161.7 million males. In 2010, there were 157 million females and 151.8 million males.), free menstrual products \(priced at 10 GBP per woman\) would cost over two billion USD annually.
1.1.4.4.6. Con: People who don't use menstrual products should not have to cover the cost of people who do through their taxes.
1.1.4.4.6.1. Con: People pay taxes for things they don't use all the time, [including other people's healthcare](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/how-nhs-funded)(From April 2003, National Insurance Contributions were increased to boost NHS funding. This increased the share of NHS funding that comes from National Insurance Contributions, but general taxation still accounts for the vast majority of NHS funding.). There is no reason why menstrual products should be any different.
1.1.4.4.6.2. Pro: There is growing awareness about the unfairness of higher [taxes on single persons](https://belladepaulo.medium.com/21-ways-single-people-are-taxed-more-and-not-just-financially-dcefd81ac862) disproportionately benefiting married couples. Therefore, expecting one group to fund benefits for other groups is antithetical to this zeitgeist.

1.1.4.5.1. Con: Many countries have made significant progress in tackling period poverty.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: [Twenty governments](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/free-period-products-countries-cities-worldwide/) around the world have taken efforts to improve access to menstrual products by distributing them for free, particularly in schools.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.4.1.2.1.
1.1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: That only [20 governments](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/free-period-products-countries-cities-worldwide/) \(in mostly developed countries\) have tried to reduce period poverty is suggestive of government complacency in 90% of countries, most of which are less developed and presumably in greater need of intervention.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Con: Tackling period poverty by providing free menstrual products has no implications for the tampon tax, which is still applicable for privileged women who purchase them.
1.1.4.5.1.3. Con: The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicebroster/2020/05/28/period-poverty-is-getting-worse-during-coronavirus-warns-charity/?sh=3dbce55c3f73) has stalled or reversed progress in tackling period poverty by exacerbating financial strain and inequalities. This proves that government efforts to tackle period poverty are inadequate, particularly in the face of crises.
1.1.4.5.1.3.1. Pro: Many places that provided free menstrual products were [shut down due to the pandemic](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/how-has-coronavirus-affected-period-poverty-in-the-uk)(Second, projects that provide products to food banks, community centres, schools and other organisations have faced additional challenges due to public health restrictions. Many are volunteer-run and rely on donations being sent to a central ‘packing’ station to then be distributed. But access to volunteers has proven difficult over the last year, due to social distancing, shielding, travel restrictions, lockdowns and changes in work or childcare demands. These have all affected people’s ability to assist with the packing and distribution of products.).
1.1.4.5.1.3.2. Con: The COVID-19 pandemic is [unprecedented](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/we-are-facing-unprecedented-global-challenge-protect-every-country-covid-19) - so much so that even the most robust healthcare infrastructures have collapsed. Therefore, the government cannot be blamed for the consequent exacerbation of period poverty.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: The unaffordability of menstrual products for low-income women coerces them into engaging in criminal and risky behaviour.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: In African countries, social entrepreneurs and charitable organizations have been employing local women as seamstresses who can create sustainable menstrual products, thereby improving [female employment](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/provide-sanitary-pads-to-south-african-girls/) as well as [reducing period poverty](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/ecological-sanitary-napkins-saving-lives-in-africa/2256844).
1.1.4.5.2.2. Con: Women being forced into risky and criminal behaviour to obtain everyday essentials is not a problem specifically related to the unaffordability of menstrual products. It is a reflection of [rising global levels of poverty](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/covid-19-leaves-legacy-rising-poverty-and-widening-inequality)(Poorer countries are contending with a deeper, longer-lasting crisis that has increased global poverty and is reversing recent trends of shrinking inequality. \n\nThe result is that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is largest for the world’s poorest. In 2021, the average incomes of people in the bottom 40 percent of the global income distribution are 6.7 percent lower than pre-pandemic projections, while those of people in the top 40 percent are down 2.8 percent. The reason for this large difference: The poorest 40 percent have not started to recover their income losses, while the top 40 percent has recovered more than 45 percent of their initial income losses. Between 2019 and 2021, the average income of the bottom 40 percent fell by 2.2 percent, while the average income of the top 40 percent fell by 0.5 percent.).
1.1.4.5.2.2.1. Con: Period poverty is not exclusively an economic problem. It can result from [poor hygiene standards or a lack of awareness](https://feminisminindia.com/2021/07/28/what-is-period-poverty/)(Period poverty is the struggle that many menstruators face while trying to afford menstrual products as a result of economic vulnerability, lack of awareness, and poor hygiene standards. A vast majority of people in rural India are still dependent on unsafe materials like rags, hay, sand, and ash as their alternatives to safer but more expensive menstrual products. This in turn exposes them to UTI and other infections.) limiting access to menstrual products.
1.1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: Poverty is gendered to such an extent that this phenomenon has earned its own moniker: feminization of poverty \([p. 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268506084_FEMINIZATION_OF_POVERTY)\). Period poverty, therefore, is merely a symptom of the unique ways in which poverty affects women.
1.1.4.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Women in every age demographic are [more likely than men to be in poverty](https://www.statista.com/statistics/233154/us-poverty-rate-by-gender/) in the US.
1.1.4.5.2.2.2.2. Con: "[Feminization of poverty](https://www.unrisd.org/beijing+20-chant)(More recently, programmes have embraced young women’s and girls’ ‘entrepreneurial capacity’ \[...\] their social media messaging includes: ‘Invest in a girl and she will do the rest’. While not denying some gains for women and girls through such interventions, it remains to be seen how much they can truly be ‘empowered’ by them. This is especially so when the onus on women and girls as a conduit of policy for the benefit of others implies a continued essentialization of “female altruism” \(Molyneux 2006\), and where feminized burdens of coping with the daily demands of household poverty may well be further intensified \(Chant 2008\). The targeting of women and girls, and exclusion of men and boys from poverty reduction initiatives, can also undermine male support for sharing this work, and, in turn, weaken struggles for gender justice \(Chant and Sweetman 2012\).)" is an oversimplified misrepresentation of how poverty intersects with the female identity. Worse, it promotes interventions that are based on benevolent sexism and alienates boys and men to the detriment of gender justice.
1.1.4.5.2.3. Pro: Women have been forced to make their own menstrual products due to their socio-economic status.
1.1.4.5.2.3.1. Pro: Making and cleaning menstrual products takes time - time that can be invested in improving the socio-economic status of the women making them by engaging in other productive, income-generating activities.
1.1.4.5.2.3.2. Con: If homemade menstrual products are as effective, safe, and comfortable as store-bought products, then there is no actual difference in terms of the dignity of using either.
1.1.4.5.2.3.2.1. Con: Many of the most effective reusable menstrual products \(such as [period cups](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/health/g36119139/best-reusable-sanitary-products/)(Best menstrual cup\nSaalt Soft Menstrual Cup\n.\n£25.00\nSHOP NOW\n\nDesigned to hold three tampons’ worth of blood, our winning menstrual cup triumphed for its seamless fit and excellent protection.

Unsurprisingly, crocheted tampons made by random people for themselves, or sold to others on the internet, do not have to pass the same safety regulations as store-bought. And these regulations are in place for very good reason.\n\n“Crochet tampons are completely untested. We have no idea how they may affect the production of bacteria associated with toxic shock syndrome or the toxin and no idea how to clean them appropriately,” said Dr Jen Gunter, a gynecologist who recently published a book called ‘The Vagina Bible,’ where she discusses crocheted tampons among many other ‘period hacks.’).
1.1.4.5.2.3.2.3. Pro: Handmade menstrual products that are available for purchase are often created by [poor women](https://menstrualhygieneday.org/huffington-post-meet-young-malawian-women-tailoring-selling-reusable-sanitary-pads/).
1.1.4.5.2.3.3. Pro: Among female Bangladeshi factory workers, [60%](https://www.sswm.info/humanitarian-crises/camps/hygiene-promotion-community-mobilisation/hygiene-promotion-community/menstrual-hygiene-management) use rags from the factory floor for menstrual cloths, resulting in infections that cause 73% of women to miss work for six days a month, on average.
1.1.4.5.2.4. Pro: The inaccessibility of menstrual products to homeless women exacerbates their current predicament.
1.1.4.5.2.4.1.

1.1.4.5.2.4.2. Pro: Homeless women often end up using discarded menstrual products found in trash bins, which poses significant safety and health risks \([p. 70](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.1.4.5.2.4.3. Con: Homeless women are resourceful. They devise strategies to cope with periods by utilizing available facilities, such as public bathrooms, shelters for homeless people, and bathrooms in private establishments \([p. 5](https://menstrualhygieneday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Homeless-Menstruation-Report.pdf)\).
1.1.4.5.2.5. Pro: [One in ten](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/28/we-dont-know-enough-about-menstruation-and-girls-are-paying-a-price)(“Girls are literally selling their bodies to get sanitary pads,” says Dr Penelope Phillips-Howard. “When we did our study in Kenya, one in ten of the 15 year old girls told us that they had engaged in sex in order to get money to buy pads. These girls have no money, no power. This is just their only option.”) 15 year-olds in Kenya said that they had had sex in order to earn money to pay for sanitary pads.
1.1.4.5.2.6. Pro: Some girls miss school while on their period because they cannot afford menstrual products. Such absenteeism can have a detrimental effect on their [academic and personal lives](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=239326)(Missing lots of school between kindergarten and eighth grade may have consequences when kids grow up, a new study suggests.\n\nWhen they reached their early 20s, frequent absentees were less likely to vote and more likely to have economic problems and poor educational outcomes, researchers found.\n\nThe results suggest early school absenteeism should be taken seriously.).
1.1.4.5.2.6.1.

1.1.4.5.2.6.2. Pro: In Uganda, girls miss up to eight days of school a term due to [period poverty](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/getting-girls-in-school-period/)(It’s not abnormal for girls to menstruate, but it is keeping them out of classrooms. In rural Uganda, girls miss up to eight days of school each term because they’re menstruating, while in Kenya, girls miss an average of 4.9 days of school each month. With each day of school missed, girls can find themselves falling behind the curriculum, and that plays a major role in the reasons why she drops out.), while in Kenya, girls miss an average of 4.9 days a month.
1.1.4.5.2.6.3. Con: [Girls still do better than boys in all subjects in most countries](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do/380318/)(As the new school year ramps up, teachers and parents need to be reminded of a well-kept secret: Across all grade levels and academic subjects, girls earn higher grades than boys. Not just in the United States, but across the globe, in countries as far afield as Norway and Hong Kong.\n\nThis finding is reflected in a recent study by psychology professors Daniel and Susan Voyer at the University of New Brunswick. The Voyers based their results on a meta-analysis of 369 studies involving the academic grades of over one million boys and girls from 30 different nations. The findings are unquestionably robust: Girls earn higher grades in every subject, including the science-related fields where boys are thought to surpass them.). The impact from period-based absenteeism cannot be having a particularly large impact.
1.1.4.5.2.6.3.1. Con: Just because the broader academic picture for girls is positive does not mean that girls who miss school due to their period are not seriously impacted.
1.1.4.5.2.6.3.2. Pro: There is a difference between absenting to avoid attending school \(e.g., [academic disinterest](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-019-01072-5)(Large effects were found for 11 risk domains, including risks related to having a negative attitude towards school, substance abuse, externalizing and internalizing problem behavior of the child, and a low involvement of parents in school.)\) and absenting because one is unable to \(e.g., common non-serious illnesses\), despite wanting to attend classes. The latter is unlikely to be harmful, as the motivation to learn is unaffected.
1.1.4.5.2.6.4. Pro: Taking leave on several consecutive days could implicitly inform classmates that the absentee is on her period. Given the [prevalence of period stigma](https://pha.berkeley.edu/2018/06/05/menstruation-stigma-must-stop-period/)(A study conducted by the International Women’s Health Coalition found that there are about 5,000 slang words used to refer to menstruation in 10 different languages. Though using euphemisms may seem innocuous, it is indicative of a larger trend in attitudes regarding menstrual health around the globe.\n\nMenstruation is a shared experience among all females — females everywhere understand what it is like to get her first period, and most females experience the same symptoms. And yet, menstruation is also a widely stigmatized issue. It is a topic that people are usually uncomfortable talking about and is typically a topic that is only discussed behind closed doors. This is because cultures all over the world have developed detrimental concepts and beliefs about menstruation.), this can be particularly troubling for young girls.
1.1.4.5.2.6.5. Pro: In rural India, [one in five](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/04/29/womens-periods-menstruation-tampons-pads-449833.html)(If all this sounds unfair, try getting your period in the developing world. Taboos, poverty, inadequate sanitary facilities, meager health education and an enduring culture of silence create an environment in which girls and women are denied what should be a basic right: clean, affordable menstrual materials and safe, private spaces to care for themselves. At least 500 million girls and women globally lack adequate facilities for managing their periods, according to a 2015 report from UNICEF and the World Health Organization \(WHO\). In rural India, one in five girls drops out of school after they start menstruating , according to research by Nielsen and Plan India, and of the 355 million menstruating girls and women in the country, just 12 percent use sanitary napkins.) girls drops out of school after they start menstruating.

Therefore, the number of days missed for periods may be artificially inflated.
1.1.4.5.2.6.6.1. Con: Due to period stigma, girls and women often need to provide "[socially acceptable](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/menstrual-cramps-etiquette-advice-about-periods-and-car-honking.html)" reasons to take leave. Therefore, it is likely that the number of days missed due to period-related concerns is an underestimate.
1.1.4.5.2.6.6.2. Pro: In many underdeveloped countries, menstruating women are [isolated](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/nepal-criminalises-isolation-of-menstruating-women-1029033-2017-08-10). In such countries, school policies that require girls to attend school while on their period [promotes inclusivity](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/22/india-menstruation-periods-gaokor-women-isolated) by suggesting that menstruating women do not need to be "quarantined."
1.1.4.5.2.6.6.3. Pro: In one study, [40%](https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2012/10/22/checkup-women-lie-about-period/) of the participating women reported that they had lied about being on their period to get out of doing something that they did not want to do, and none of them reported feeling guilty.
1.1.4.5.2.6.6.4. Con: A teacher who argued that girls were using their periods to skip school [has been heavily criticised](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/schoolgirls-furious-after-head-sixth-23071145)(However, students at the school feel the email was unfair and that is shouldn't have been sent to boys too as it risks making them "unsympathetic".\n\nOne student, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "Obviously I have to understand that people cannot take their whole period off each month but that is not what anyone is trying to do.) for dismissing the [genuine physical and emotional discomfort](https://theconversation.com/3-out-of-10-girls-skip-class-because-of-painful-periods-and-most-wont-talk-to-their-teacher-about-it-150286)(More than one-third of young women in a nationwide survey said they missed at least one class, either at school or university, in the past three months due to menstrual symptoms, including pain and fatigue.\n\nMore than three quarters of young women said they had problems concentrating due to their period.

1.1.4.5.4. Pro: Period poverty has been significantly exacerbated by [the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicebroster/2020/05/28/period-poverty-is-getting-worse-during-coronavirus-warns-charity/), which has exerted a more adverse socioeconomic [effect on women](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02006-z) than on men. Charging a tampon tax amid a healthcare crisis is inhumane.
1.1.5. Pro: Abolishing the tampon tax results in a significant decrease in government revenue.
1.1.5.1. Con: Progressive taxes such as [income tax](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217493/revenues-from-income-tax-and-forecast-in-the-us/) already provide a much greater amount of US tax revenue than the regressive [sales tax](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249137/us-state-and-local-sales-tax-revenue/). Therefore, removing certain consumption taxes \(such as the tampon tax\) would not severely impact the US economy.
1.1.5.2. Con: If people purchase reusable items, like [menstrual cups](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/menstrual-cup), then little revenue is generated for governments, while still posing an economic burden on consumers.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Removing the tampon tax would suggest that the government considers this issue more important than adequately financing social benefits.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Reduced government revenue resulting from the elimination of the tampon tax coerces governments to increase the tax rate for [other products](https://taxfoundation.org/tampon-taxes-sales-tax/)(As the sales tax base gets smaller, states must raise tax rates on the remaining items to generate the same amount of revenue.).
1.1.5.4.1. Con: People may displace spending from menstrual products to other items that are taxed when the tampon tax is removed, ensuring revenue doesn't significantly decrease.
1.1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.5.3.
1.1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.6. Pro: Instead of abolishing the tampon tax, it could be decreased, allowing the state to continue to receive income while allowing some financial relief to women.
1.1.6.1. Con: If the tampon tax were decreased but not abolished, the state would both lose money and not gain any positive publicity from its abolishment.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Cuts in Value Added Tax \(which the tampon tax is\) [can stimulate the economy](https://voxeu.org/article/temporary-vat-cut-unconventional-fiscal-policy)(The unexpected, temporary VAT cut in Germany in the second half of 2020 worked as a measure of unconventional fiscal policy. We show that the policy stimulated spending on durables and, to a lesser extent, on semi-durable and on non-durable consumption goods. From a distributional perspective, the temporary VAT cut worked in a progressive way. Young, low-net-wealth households reacted the most. This reaction did not depend on measures of financial literacy and saving discipline. We do not take a stance on the optimality or even the appropriateness of this policy measure. We do show, however, that, as suggested by Correia et al. \(2013\), an unexpected temporary VAT cut operates indeed like conventional monetary policy and can be an effective stabilisation tool when the ELB binds.).
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: A reduced tax rate implies greater disposable income that people can spend on goods and services. The resulting increase in money circulation promotes [economic prosperity](https://www.thebalance.com/consumer-spending-definition-and-determinants-3305917)(Consumer spending is the single most important driving force of the U.S. economy. \[...\] Even a small downturn in consumer spending damages the economy. As it drops off, economic growth slows. Prices drop, creating deflation. If slow consumer spending continues, the economy contracts.).
1.1.6.2.2. Con: Menstrual products are not luxury goods that people will splurge on when they are discounted. People will not buy more menstrual products than they need because they are cheaper.
1.1.7. Pro: The tax revenue from the tampon tax should be used to provide [free menstrual products](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/oct/07/axing-the-tampon-tax-seems-a-good-move-but-is-it-the-best-move)(But as Eleanor Robertson noted back in 2015, removing the GST on tampons won’t do much to help the cause of gender equality. The issue is that all women – especially those on low income – unlike men, have to pay for sanitary products, not that they have to pay 10% extra.\n\nA more real solution to the problem would be, for example, to keep the tax and use the $30m to provide free tampons and sanitary products to women earning below a certain level of income.) to women in poverty.
1.1.7.1. Con: When a government provides goods for free instead of allowing customers to pick their own, they can often be of [lower quality](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n399)(The UK government wasted hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on poor quality and unusable personal protective equipment \(PPE\) while leaving frontline workers insufficiently protected from covid-19, the parliamentary public spending watchdog has concluded.) and [subject to corrupt purchasing methods](https://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/Corruption-Public-Procurement-Brochure.pdf)(Public procurement is one of the government activities most vulnerable to corruption.

1.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.4.1.2.
1.1.7.4. Con: The [administration cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/administrative-expenses.asp) involved in implementing this policy may be more expensive than simply cutting the tax for all women.
1.2. Con: There should be no difference in taxation rates between gender-specific and unisex products.
1.2.1. Con: Taxes on sex-specific items put financial pressure on one sex when all people benefit from what the government subsidises with these taxes.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Government-subsidized healthcare \(e.g., the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.goodrx.com/insurance/aca/who-is-eligible-for-obamacare-affordable-care-act-aca)(Obamacare is designed to make healthcare affordable for people regardless of income.

There is no reason why women should pay a higher price for access to these services by means of the tampon tax.
1.2.1.2. Con: Until 2021, the UK government refused to spend the money collected by the tampon tax. The [15 million GBP](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/women-and-girls-set-to-benefit-from-15-million-tampon-tax-fund)(Thousands of women from across the UK will benefit from £15 million from the latest round of the Tampon Tax Fund, the Minister for Sport and Civil Society Tracey Crouch announced today.\n\nProjects that tackle sexual violence, address social exclusion among BAME women and improve mental health and wellbeing will receive funding over the next two years. The money will also be used to make grants to smaller organisations so they can deploy services that support the most vulnerable and disadvantaged women and girls in the country.) raised each year was instead donated to women's charities.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Funding for women's charities generated through the tampon tax was significant enough that many women's charities were [worried about surviving without it](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/uk-tampon-tax-fund-charities/)(Britain's decision to scrap taxes on period products may also spell the end of a state-run charity fund financed with the proceeds — depriving vulnerable women and girls of a "lifeline," campaigners and nonprofits warned on Tuesday.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, the government stopped charging value-added tax \(VAT\) on sanitary pads and tampons — revenue that the Tampon Tax Fund distributes among charities helping women and girls facing issues including abuse, homelessness, or mental illness.\n\nOfficials have not said what will happen to the Tampon Tax Fund or announced any new funding, and charities fear they could lose a vital money source.) following the British government's abolition of the tampon tax.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Some of the charities that received government funding were problematic or were causes that the government should have directly funded in the first place.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The term "charity" includes a wide range of organizations, some of which may have contradictory objectives. That a charity is perceived as problematic by some sections of society does not imply that it necessarily is.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: That government funds were provided to problematic charities does not negate the value of government funds for charities with a good cause; therefore, the goal should be to create stricter regulations for selecting and funding worthy causes.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: In the UK, [250,000 GBP](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/28/anti-abortion-life-charity-will-get--tampon-tax-funds)(There was an outcry earlier this year after the Observer revealed that £250,000 of the money raised from the so-called tampon tax – the 5% rate of VAT that is levied on sanitary products – would go to Life, a charity that campaigns against abortion.\n\nThe organisation also opposes plans for the expansion of sex education in primary schools and has been at the centre of controversy over the information provided by a network of unregulated pregnancy counselling centres.) of tampon tax money went to a charity called Life, a pregnancy charity that advocated against women's reproductive rights.
1.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: In the UK, over [2.5 million GBP](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/women-and-girls-set-to-benefit-from-15-million-tampon-tax-fund) generated from the tampon tax went to domestic abuse organizations. This is essentially making women pay for their own protection from abusive men.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: People are better placed to decide which charities matter to them than governments. It is unfair to tax people under the guise of such philanthropic redistribution.
1.2.1.2.4. Con: The UK government [did not want to tax menstrual products but were forced to do so by the EU](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34638831)(The government said change would need the agreement of every EU member state.\n\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, said during the debate that the government "sympathises \[with\] the aim of this clause" but said: "The UK does not have the ability to extend unilaterally zero rating to new products."). Redirecting the money collected into women's charities was their second-best option.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Taxes on items that are only used by one sex are [discriminatory](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/discriminatory-tax)(discriminatory tax\n\n\[...\]\n\na tax that is considered unfair by some people, because it does not affect everyone equally).
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Everyone uses toilet paper, toothpaste and soap. Only women use menstrual products, making the tampon tax a tax on women.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Women are often the ones purchasing gender-neutral [household items](https://www.inc.com/amy-nelson/women-drive-majority-of-consumer-purchasing-its-time-to-meet-their-needs.html), women-specific products \(e.g., tampons\), as well as products used exclusively by men \(e.g., [condoms](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2342365/Survey-finds-women-taking-lead-buying-condoms-men-shy-buy-them.html)\). A tampon tax would, at least, symbolically address this financial inequity.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Sales and use taxes are not based on who will consume a good but rather on what type of product it is. Suggesting a consumer-based tax would result in inequitable tax treatment.
1.2.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Consumer-based tax is unfeasible because many end users are incapable of purchasing the products they need. For example, diapers are needed by babies, yet parents are often the ones purchasing them.
1.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Inequitable tax treatment already exists. In the UK, tax breaks exist for people over 60 who [install mobility aids in their homes](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-shopping/mobility-aids)(VAT on mobility aids\n\nIf you’re over 60, you pay a reduced rate of VAT \(5%\) on certain mobility aids when you pay for them to be supplied and installed in your home.\n\nQualifying products\n\nYou can get the reduced rate on:\n\n- grab rails\n- ramps\n- stair lifts\n- bath lifts\n- built-in shower seats or showers containing built-in shower seats\n- walk-in baths with sealable doors).
1.2.1.3.1.3. Con: The tampon tax affects the purchasers of menstrual products, not women.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Some women do not menstruate and, thus, need not buy menstrual products.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Following the revelation that periods have no health benefits, [many women are choosing to stop having periods altogether](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/18/women-dont-need-to-bleed-why-many-more-of-us-are-giving-up-periods)(With recent confirmation that periods have no health benefit, an increasing number of women are using contraception to stop them altogether\n\n\[...\]\n\nWhen a new wave of feminist authors and activists are calling on women to embrace their periods, the idea that some do not want a monthly bleed and are seeking to avoid having them altogether can seem radical.\n\nThe technology is there, in contraceptives. They don’t only prevent pregnancy. A recent drop in tampon sales has been linked to women using contraceptive methods that stop, or lighten their periods. About a fifth of women using the contraceptive implant no longer bleed \(myself included\), while many who take contraceptive pills without a break often achieve the same result – and they are not the only methods.) through contraceptives. These women do not need menstrual products.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: In countries where [contraceptive pills or implants are free](https://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5857904/where-the-pill-is-free)(One thing that's interesting here is the total lack of consistency. North America is the only continent where the pill is free or subsidized everywhere. In Western Europe, most countries offer a full or partial subsidy for the pill, but Spain and Ireland - two countries with strong Catholic roots - offer none. Neither does much of former-Soviet Eastern Europe. In the Middle East, maybe unsurprisingly, Saudi Arabia does not offer subsidies for the pill - but Iran makes it free. Norway doesn't subsidize the pill, but Sweden does. This suggests there's no clear consensus, regionally, about the state's proper role in providing birth control.), some women can effectively dodge the entire cost of menstrual products by stopping their period.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Women should not be coerced into altering their body chemistry to save money on [menstrual products](https://www.pandiahealth.com/the-true-cost-of-your-period/).
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Increased female labor force participation may have reduced [tampon sales](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4127556/Tampon-sales-fall-women-opt-contraceptives.html)(The sales of tampons has fallen as more women opt for 'convenient' contraceptive methods that stop periods.\n\nThe number of packets of tampons sold in Britain dropped from 29million in 2012 to 23million last year. \n\nThe amount spent on tampons fell from £56million in 2012 to £43million over the same period, according to a study by Kantar Worldpanel.) by increasing the use of contraception, showing how the economic [emancipation of women](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/16/tampon-sales-fall-working-women-choose-contraceptives-stop-monthly/)(Natika Halil, chief executive of the Family Planning Association, said: "Some long-term contraception methods mean women's periods will become lighter or shorter.\n\n"Many may enjoy these benefits, as well as the convenience of not having to remember to take pills, which could be particularly useful for women who cannot remember to take a pill everyday, such as working mums.") reinforces their bodily autonomy.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Most forms of hormonal birth control can cause detrimental [side effects](https://theconversation.com/birth-control-continues-to-fail-women-so-why-has-nothing-changed-164195) for those who take them.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Periods are necessary for women who want to have children. Stopping their periods through contraception is not an option for these women.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Women can [still bleed](https://helloclue.com/articles/sex/pill-your-period)(Unexpected bleeding on the contraceptive pill\n\nSpotting can happen outside of your usual withdrawal bleed time. This is called breakthrough bleeding. It doesn’t mean your pill isn’t working, but it can be frustrating to deal with \(2\). Up to 1 in 5 people experience breakthrough bleeding when first taking the contraceptive pill \(6\). It is not usually a cause for concern and will often stop after a few weeks or months \(7\). Others will need to try a different pill brand, with different levels of hormones. Many experts recommend choosing a pill with the lowest dose of estrogen \(ethinylestradiol/EE\), and only changing to a higher dose if breakthrough bleeding is a persistent problem.) while taking the contraceptive pill.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: Women who have gone through [menopause](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-menopause)(Understanding the menopausal transition\n\nMenopause is a point in time 12 months after a woman's last period. The years leading up to that point, when women may have changes in their monthly cycles, hot flashes, or other symptoms, are called the menopausal transition or perimenopause.) do not need menstrual products.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Most women who have gone through menopause needed menstrual products earlier in their lives when they still had periods.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Menopause can be [hormonally or surgically induced](https://thebms.org.uk/publications/tools-for-clinicians/induced-menopause-in-women-with-endometriosis/)(The methods of inducing menopause are:\n\n- Gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists: These downregulate the pituitary gland and lower estrogen levels to within the menopausal range. They induce amenorrhoea and often menopausal symptoms.\n\n- Surgery involving bilateral oophorectomy. This may be with or without a hysterectomy but will permanently induce menopause. The loss of libido is often more marked with a surgically induced menopause.), particularly as a treatment for conditions like [endometriosis](https://www.womens-health-concern.org/help-and-advice/factsheets/induced-menopause-in-women-with-endometriosis/)(Endometriosis means that deposits of endometrium \(lining of the womb\) exist outside of the womb cavity and they thicken and bleed with every cycle. Inducing menopause causes suppression of the menstrual cycle and activity of the ovaries meaning that the symptoms of endometriosis may resolve.). Women who wish to no longer have periods can opt for such procedures.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.3. Con: Women who do not menstruate are less common than those who do. [Most women](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/why-is-my-period-late)(Most women who haven’t reached menopause usually have a period every 28 days. However, a healthy menstrual cycle can range from every 21 to 35 days. If your period doesn’t fall within these ranges, it could be because of one of the following reasons.) menstruate or have done so at some point in their lives.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.4. Pro: Women with medical conditions that [disrupt menstruation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amenorrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20369299)(Amenorrhea \(uh-men-o-REE-uh\) is the absence of menstruation, often defined as missing one or more menstrual periods.\n\nPrimary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation in someone who has not had a period by age 15. The most common causes of primary amenorrhea relate to hormone levels, although anatomical problems also can cause amenorrhea.\n\nSecondary amenorrhea refers to the absence of three or more periods in a row by someone who has had periods in the past. Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea, although problems with hormones also can cause secondary amenorrhea.) do not require menstrual products as frequently as those with regular cycles.
1.2.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: In traditional cisheterosexual households, where the man is the breadwinner, the tampon tax is ultimately borne by the man \(e.g., father, husband\), not the woman who requires the tampon.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3. Con: The majority of people who purchase menstrual products are women.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: Women may be the ones physically purchasing menstrual products, but they may not be the ones paying for them, given that the [female participation rate](https://www.ilo.org/infostories/en-GB/Stories/Employment/barriers-women#global-gap) in the workforce is less than 50%.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.2. Con: Due to period [pain and discomfort](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/period-pain/), women who have run out of menstrual products may be unable to visit stores for purchases. In such instances, others likely purchase these products for them.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.3. Con: People [other than women can menstruate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4HDcgFZ9whsBWrK75yyzdLG/five-period-myths-debunked)(Although menstruation is often associated with women, it’s important to remember that having a period is not a requirement of womanhood nor is it only women who experience menstruation.\n\nOn the one hand, transgender men and non-binary people might get their period; on the other, some cis women might not have it for a variety of different reasons.\n\nPeriod rights are not only women’s rights but human rights.). [Trans men](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-men-pain-menstruation-more-just-physical-n1113961) and [non-binary people](https://www.health.com/mind-body/lgbtq-health/menstruating-as-non-binary-person) assigned female at birth \(AFAB\) require menstrual products, whereas [trans women](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-trans-women-get-periods) do not.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.4. Pro: General [household shopping](https://www.inc.com/amy-nelson/women-drive-majority-of-consumer-purchasing-its-time-to-meet-their-needs.html) is more commonly undertaken by women. Therefore, it stands to reason that they are the ones most likely shopping for tampons, which they need.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.5. Pro: Anecdotal reports suggest that men find it [embarrassing](https://www.thedailyvox.co.za/men-are-still-ashamed-to-publicly-buy-sanitary-pads/) to shop for menstrual products. Therefore, it is very likely that women are the ones purchasing menstrual products for themselves.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.6. Pro: [Menstrual products](https://www.ippf.org/blogs/period-products-what-are-options)(Period products: what are the options?\n\nThe landscape of period products has changed dramatically in recent years.) come in all shapes and sizes to suit the unique needs \(e.g., [heavy flow](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heavy-periods/)(Heavy periods \(also called menorrhagia\) are common and may just be normal for you. Treatment can help if they're affecting your daily life.)\), requirements \(e.g., [winged](https://clothpads.wordpress.com/styles/wings/)(While the most common style of cloth pads is to have wings \(which fold around the gusset of your underpants to help hold the pad in place\). Pads don’t need to have wings, and sometimes wingless pads can be preferential to having wings.)\), and preferences \(e.g., [scented](https://pgconsumersupport.secure.force.com/ContactUs/sf_FAQArticleTemplate?id=kA080000000PSts)(Scented – Our scented pads and liners have an added fragrance. The packaging may contain the word ‘Clean Scent" of "Fresh", have a flowery logo or mention the scent on the front of the pack. Check them out here: Always Scented Products)\) of women. Therefore, women need to inspect and purchase products that suit their individual needs.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.6.1. Con: Needs and preferences are likely stable over time; therefore, a woman would need to inspect the range of options only the first time she shops. In subsequent instances, anyone could purchase the desired variant that she specifies.
1.2.1.3.1.3.3.6.2. Pro: Examples of men being [confused by the range of menstrual products](https://www.indy100.com/viral/boyfriend-tampons-lemon-lime-flavour-periods-9093236)(A boyfriend wanted to make sure that he got the right “flavor” of tampons for his girlfriend, so he texted her asking if she wanted the “lemon” or “lime” ones. \n\nA woman known as Brogan screenshotted her boyfriend Lewis’ text and posted it on Twitter under her username \@broganpaget. \n\n“when you ask ur boyfriend to buy you tampons,” the post read, showing Lewis texting her a photo of the “lemon” and “lime” Tampax boxes side-by-side.) available have gone viral online.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: [Positive discrimination](https://humanrights.gov.au/quick-guide/12078)(Discrimination on the basis of certain attributes such as age, sex, race or disability is not always against the law.\n\nThe term ‘positive discrimination’ is sometimes used to refer to ‘positive measures’ or ‘special measures’. Special measures aim to foster greater equality by supporting groups of people who face, or have faced, entrenched discrimination so they can have similar access to opportunities as others in the community.) is often needed to redress imbalances in society.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Discrimination based on sex is illegal under almost [every human rights treaty](https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/thematic-areas/human-rights-and-gender/)(Discrimination based on sex is prohibited under almost every human rights treaty, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which under their common article 3 provide for the rights to equality between men and women in the enjoyment of all rights. In addition, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women \(CEDAW\) is dedicated to the realization of women’s human rights. Considered the international bill of rights for women, the Convention defines what constitutes discrimination against women and sets an agenda for national action to end such discrimination.).
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Price discrimination is [rarely illegal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp)(Is price discrimination illegal?\n\nThe word discrimination in price discrimination does not typically refer to something illegal or derogatory in most cases. Instead, it refers to firms being able to change the prices of their products or services dynamically as market conditions change; or charging different users different prices for similar services or charging the same price for services with different costs. Neither practice violates any U.S. laws—it would become unlawful only if it creates or leads to specific economic harm.).
1.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: To combat discrimination, governments must ensure that nobody is unfairly burdened \([pp. 1-4](https://www.marinhhs.org/sites/default/files/boards/general/equality_v._equity_04_05_2021.pdf)(Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome. \[...\] For example, if I gave a rich woman and a poor woman each $100 that would be an example of equality since I gave both the same amount of money. Alternatively, if I gave a rich woman $100 and a poor woman $200, then it could be said I am trying to achieve equity by “fairly” giving the poor woman more help based\non her financial situation.)\). Within the context of the tampon tax, this requires governments to ensure that periods do not unfairly disadvantage women.
1.2.1.4. Con: Women benefit more from government services, which are more heavily funded by taxes paid by men.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: The US prison system costs the state [80 billion USD a year](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/12/17/the-hidden-cost-of-incarceration)(The Bureau of Justice Statistics reckons that the United States spends more than $80 billion each year to keep roughly 2.3 million people behind bars. Many experts say that figure is a gross underestimate, though, because it leaves out myriad hidden costs that are often borne by prisoners and their loved ones, with women overwhelmingly shouldering the financial burden. These costs rise during the holiday season, relatives of people in prison say, as they make more visits, call more often and send more care packages.). The [vast majority](https://www.statista.com/statistics/252828/number-of-prisoners-in-the-us-by-gender/) of prison inmates are men.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Most men are not benefitting from the state spending money to keep them in prison.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: Within the context of gender-based crimes, only a very small [proportion of perpetrators](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/5/7/why-do-so-few-rapes-result-in-a-conviction)(In 2017-18, there were 54,045 rapes reported and 2,635 convictions – a conviction rate of 4.9 percent. The following year, there were 58,657 rapes reported and 1,925 convictions – a conviction rate of just 3.3 percent.) are convicted and imprisoned. This implies that predatory men - not women - are those benefiting from the penal system.
1.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: Anecdotal reports suggest that there are incentives for people to deliberately get themselves arrested because imprisonment increases access to food, healthcare, and other [unaffordable or desirable](https://www.businessinsider.in/slideshows/miscellaneous/7-surprising-reasons-people-have-gotten-arrested-on-purpose/slidelist/63276444.cms#slideid=63276448)(An unfortunate reality for homeless people is that sometimes, it may seem more appealing to spend the night in jail than on the streets.\n\nThat was the case for Lance Brown, a homeless man from Columbus, Georgia, who in 2012 hurled a brick through the town courthouse building and spent nine months in jail awaiting his trial.\n\nBrown said he vandalized the building because in jail, "someone's going to offer me a sandwich and drink." Brown was eventually sentenced to one more month in jail, according to the Associated Press.) resources.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: In some countries, men pay significantly [more taxes](https://fullfact.org/economy/are-women-paying-60-less-income-tax-men/)(There are more women in the workforce than ever before, and yet they still contribute 60% less in income tax than men.) than women.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: Women pay less tax because women are [not being paid enough for their work](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/)(Since the second half of the 20th century, women’s labor force participation has grown significantly. Women are working longer hours and pursuing higher education in greater numbers. However, despite this progress, significant wage gaps between men and women persist—particularly for women of color. So what exactly is the gender wage gap? What drives it? And what does it mean for women and their families? This fact sheet provides answers to these questions and more.), not because women are charged lower tax rates.
1.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: Business are more often [started by men](https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/02/small-business-owner-gender-and-age-statistics.html)(New firms are overwhelmingly started by men. While women start 30% of businesses, men account for the remaining 70%.

In direct comparison, firms owned by men made $367,795 more revenue on average than women-owned businesses last year.). Thus, men contribute more to the tax base through business tax as well as tax on incomes paid to all employees.
1.2.1.4.3. Con: Men often need less help from government expenditure, as they already benefit from [unfair employment practices](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-employers-favor-men)(It’s not news that women are much less likely to get hired for jobs than men, even when the candidates have the exact same qualifications. Now, new research sheds light on why this happens.\n\nEmployers favor men not because they are prejudiced against women, but because they have the perception that men perform better on average at certain tasks, according to the research paper When Gender Discrimination Is Not About Gender.) and the [gender pay gap](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/)(The gender gap in pay has remained relatively stable in the United States over the past 15 years or so. In 2020, women earned 84% of what men earned, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings of both full- and part-time workers. Based on this estimate, it would take an extra 42 days of work for women to earn what men did in 2020.).
1.2.1.4.4. Pro: [Healthcare use](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10718692/)(Studies have shown that women use more health care services than men. We used important independent variables, such as patient sociodemographics and health status, to investigate gender differences in the use and costs of these services.) and [government spending](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)(Estimated spending differed the most between sexes at age 10 to 14 years, when males have health care spending associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and at age 20 to 44 years, when women have spending associated with pregnancy and postpartum care, family planning, and maternal conditions. Together these conditions were estimated to constitute 25.6% \(UI, 24.3%-27.0%\) of all health care spending for women from age 20 through 44 years in 2013. Excluding this spending, females spent 24.6% \(UI, 21.9%-27.3%\) more overall than males in 2013.) on healthcare is higher for women than for men.
1.2.1.4.4.1. Pro: Despite being more vulnerable to [mental health problems](https://www.whiteswanfoundation.org/gender/men/men-may-be-less-likely-to-seek-professional-help)(Despite there being a higher prevalence of mental health issues in men, there seems to be gap when it comes to seeking help. Men are less likely to reach out and seek help.), men are less likely to seek help due to restrictive [gender norms](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/why-dont-men-ask-for-mental-health-help/)("I don't think that it's biologically determined that men will seek less help than women," says University of Missouri Counseling Psychology Professor Glenn Good, PhD, who studies men and masculinity and also has a private practice that focuses on men. "So if that's true, then it must mean that it's socialization and upbringing: Men learn to seek less help." \[...\] "What we're finding is that the more men 'do their gender' and define themselves by traditional roles in our society, the less they tend to get help," Mahalik says.). The notion of "subsidized" healthcare further exacerbates this conflict, as it connotes an additional layer of assistance.
1.2.1.4.4.2. Con: Much of the surplus expenditure on women's healthcare is due to [pregnancy and childbirth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31052665)(But the $30,000 \(£20,000\) invoice that I was so afraid of is what an American woman gets billed on average for giving birth naturally. The total bill for a Caesarean section, meanwhile, tops $50,000, according to Truven Health Analytics.\n\nThe delivery alone costs an average $10,000 in the US, while a Caesarean delivery costs over $15,000, according to the International Federation of Health Plans \(IFHP\).). Men also want to become fathers \(or want the human race to continue to exist\), so it is reasonable for them to shoulder some of this burden.
1.2.1.4.5. Con: Women do not choose to be the ones who give birth to children, nor do many women choose to be their primary caretakers. Biology and society dictate those things.
1.2.1.4.6. Pro: Women are the vast [majority of single parents](https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/what-we-do/media-centre/single-parents-facts-figures/)(Single parents today\n\nIn the UK:\n\n- There are around 1.8 million single parents – they make up nearly a quarter of families with dependent children \(i\)\n- Less than one per cent of single parents are teenagers \(ii\)\n- Around 90 per cent of single parents are women \(iii\)\n- The average age of a single parent is 39 years \(iv\)). Single parents are entitled to [a range of social benefits](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a562850/your-rights-and-benefits)(What benefits are all parents entitled to?\n\nAll parents are entitled to claim child benefit.

However, you may be liable to the high income child benefit tax charge if you, or your partner, has an individual income of more than £50,000. This means that part or all of your child benefit is clawed back. HM Revenue & Customs has details of how to claim child benefit.\n\nYou will be able to receive free dental care and free prescriptions while you’re pregnant and until your baby is a year old. It doesn’t matter how much you earn, all new mums and mums-to-be are entitled to this. Ask your GP or midwife for an exemption certificate at your booking appointment.).
1.2.1.4.6.1. Con: Men can also benefit from these social benefits, they just choose not to be custodial fathers in far greater numbers than women.
1.2.1.4.7. Pro: Women outnumber men at [every level](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-ostapchuk/breakdown-of-us-high-scho_b_9265724.html)(Female student graduate rates are consistently higher than males in every state. The greatest discrepancies are in the District of Columbia and Mississippi where the female graduation rates are 25% and 17% higher than the male rate, respectively. Comparing to the overall graduation rates, the states with the most uneven graduation rates by gender are also at the bottom of overall graduation rates.) of [education](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/06/womens-college-enrollment-gains-leave-men-behind/)(Even though college enrollment rates among young people have risen in recent decades, a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data shows that females outpace males in college enrollment, especially among Hispanics and blacks.\n\nIn 1994, 63% of recent female high school graduates and 61% of male recent high school graduates were enrolled in college in the fall following graduation. By 2012, the share of young women enrolled in college immediately after high school had increased to 71%, but it remained unchanged for young men at 61%.); this service is often state-subsidised.
1.2.1.5. Con: Individuals will always benefit from the revenue from taxes they don't pay. For example, people who don't buy alcohol still benefit from the taxes paid by people who do.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Governments charge a particularly high tax rate on alcohol, as this has been proven to reduce [health problems](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/13/18130843/alcohol-taxes)(Based on the research, a higher alcohol tax would reduce drinking and likely excessive drinking in particular, saving thousands of lives and preventing all sorts of crime and public health problems. This research dates back years, and there’s a lot of it, Toomey said, making a tax hike one of the most evidence-backed ideas in alcohol policy.) caused by excess alcohol consumption. This offers dual benefits: increased savings and improved health.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: People choose to drink alcohol, but women do not choose to have periods.
1.2.1.6. Pro: There are still far [fewer women than men](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS) in parliament in most countries. Taxing women on sex-specific products \(or any products\) in these circumstances amounts to [taxation without representation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax_without_representation.asp)(What Is Taxation Without Representation?\n\nThe phrase taxation without representation describes a populace that is required to pay taxes to a government authority without having any say in that government's policies. The term has its origin in a slogan of the American colonials against their British rulers: "Taxation without representation is tyranny.").
1.2.1.6.1. Con: [Women can vote on the same terms as men in most countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/05/key-facts-about-womens-suffrage-around-the-world-a-century-after-u-s-ratified-19th-amendment/)(This year marks the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees women the right to vote. But the United States was hardly the first country to codify women’s suffrage, and barriers to vote persisted for some groups of U.S. women for decades. At least 20 nations preceded the U.S., according to a Pew Research Center analysis of women’s enfranchisement measures in 198 countries and self-administering territories. Today, none of these 198 countries and territories bar women from voting because of their sex; some countries do not hold national elections.). It is not taxation without representation if women also voted for these male politicians.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: Women still have their ability to vote [controlled or suppressed](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/countries-where-women-can-t-vote/)(It’s in these countries where women face obstacles against the most basic human rights, from a lack of education to minimal political agency. Women are disproportionately impoverished globally, and while in the UK there are still archaic opinions about the women’s place being as the child-rearer and home-maker, in other parts of the world this is considered fact. Whether it’s due to religion, tradition or a lack of education, it all amounts to women being subservient.\n\nIt’s important to understand just how prevalent this is, especially at times like this, where we’re celebrating just how far women have come in the UK. We might be benefiting from what former generations fought for, but there is still a fight to be had. Just take a look at these countries where it’s still really difficult for women to vote \(and work and live\) ...) in many countries, reinforcing the injustice of them being subject to male-dominated governments.
1.2.1.6.1.2. Pro: Women's right to vote is restricted in only 9 countries, and in only one of these countries is this right to vote restricted by law \(i.e., [Saudi Arabia](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-where-women-cant-vote)(Women are strictly forbidden to vote or hold public office. Baseless arrests are common in Saudi Arabia, with torture a common police tactic. Elections are rare with King Abdullah having the power to over-rule anything.)\).
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Months after New Zealand [Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/new-zealand-tackles-period-poverty-with-free-sanitary-products-for-all-schoolgirls)(New Zealand tackles 'period poverty' with free sanitary products for all schoolgirls\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nMore than 90,000 girls stay away from school because they cannot afford pad or tampons, Jacinda Ardern says) announced efforts to tackle period poverty, an NZ supermarket became the first to include [a "period" label](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/26/new-zealand-supermarket-chain-countdown-becomes-first-to-use-period-label-on-menstrual-products)(Shoppers at a New Zealand supermarket chain will no longer see euphemistic language like “sanitary” or “feminine hygiene” products to describe pads, tampons and menstrual cups after the chain said it would be the first in the world to use the word “period” to describe the items.\n\nNo other local or international retailer used the word “period” to describe the products shoppers buy for menstruation, according to a spokesperson for Countdown, a major supermarket chain in New Zealand that operates 180 stores.) on menstrual products. This demonstrates that female leadership has ripple effects at both the legislative and societal levels.
1.2.2. Pro: Abolishing the tampon tax would equate to an exemption, and exemptions make laws more complex.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Once tax exemptions are granted to particular groups, it is difficult to determine which other groups are worthy of having taxes lifted on their goods.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: VAT relief is primarily provided to individuals for whom the respective product is a unique non-optional expense \(e.g., [equipment to aid with disabilities](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-relief-on-certain-goods-if-you-have-a-disability)(If you’re disabled you’ll generally have to pay VAT on the things you buy, but VAT relief is available on a limited range of goods and services for disabled people.)\). Identifying eligible persons and products would, therefore, be straightforward.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Tax exemptions for particular groups and purposes can be exploited by malicious groups who technically qualify for exemptions.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: White supremacist groups in the US have [qualified for tax exemption status](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/charlottesville-white-supremacy-groups-neo-nazis-ku-klux-klan-us-government-giving-tax-exemptions-a7917966.html)(The IRS, the agency in charge of enforcing these rules, must decide whether groups qualify for tax exemptions. It makes that decision impartially, meaning that organisations that, say, promote racist ideology are generally eligible for non-profit status as long as they are organised for a qualifying purpose and otherwise meet the criteria for exemption. For many white supremacist groups, that claim is on educational grounds \(established by IRS criteria\). After all, many on the far right, like Spencer and the operators of organisations like VDare, declare that they do not hate others but rather promote whiteness.) by claiming they provide an educational service.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Potential misuse of tax exemptions has never been cited as a reason to not provide tax exemptions for products essential for daily living; therefore, the focus should be on stricter imposition of tax law, not the elimination of tax exemptions.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Those with Afro hair require specific hair care products, such as specific [detangling combs](https://www.blackenterprise.com/uk-woman-invents-detangling-comb-for-afro-hair-hopes-to-inspire-young-women-to-become-engineers/), but they are not entitled to a tax-free status.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Male athletes require [groin guards](https://medium.com/\@elizabethsmit/what-is-a-groin-guard-and-how-do-they-work-53a7eb4b4bc1), but these products are not exempt from tax.
1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: A groin guard is a normal piece of equipment needed to play an optional sport. The need for tampons cannot be circumvented by choice.
1.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: Even minor injuries to the testicles are [extremely painful](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/what-really-happens-after-a-kick-to-the-groin-20140528/) and can result in the loss of the [injured testicle\(s\)](https://medium.com/\@elizabethsmit/what-is-a-groin-guard-and-how-do-they-work-53a7eb4b4bc1)(When you talk about groin injuries, they are very different to others, in the sense testicles are not protected by bones and are very fragile. Even a small injury can result in their fatal damage. You can lose one or both very quickly.). Not wearing a groin guard during any activity entailing potential risk to the groin is, therefore, not optional.
1.2.2.2. Con: Complexity is not a good reason to reject important legislation.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Most people already [don't understand taxes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/90-percent-of-americans-couldnt-answer-this-straightforward-tax-question.html)(As tax season heats up, many Americans are still unclear as to how recent changes to the law could affect them. A 2019 survey found about 28 percent say they don’t understand the ins and outs of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed in December 2017.\n\nTo take a closer look at what’s confusing taxpayers, financial website GOBankingRates created a four-question quiz that covers key portions of the law. A whopping 77 percent of the 501 respondents failed, assuming, the site notes, that “a passing grade means getting more than half the questions right.”\n\n“Most Americans are in need of a refresher prior to filing their taxes,” GOBankingRates concludes. “These results appear to indicate that many taxpayers are poorly informed.”). Further complexity will make this problem worse.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Most people do not need to understand the specifics of VAT, as most vendors [will apply it before the item is purchased](https://entrepreneurhandbook.co.uk/understanding-vat/)(VAT \(Value added tax\) is an administrative headache for a lot of people. It’s charged by businesses on goods or services at the point of sale, and as it’s a consumption tax, it’s paid by the end customer, rather than the company selling the goods.).
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Product price is not always easy to accurately determine, as it may be inclusive or exclusive of tax; displayed prices can be misleading if they exclude taxes but are perceived otherwise. Abolishing tax on some products \(i.e., menstrual products\) but not others increases confusion.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Tampon taxes do not affect [tax codes](https://www.which.co.uk/money/tax/income-tax/tax-codes-and-paye/understand-your-tax-code-a19qm0w5wjxp) which are what most people struggle to understand.
1.2.2.4. Con: Exemptions to gendered products already exist in many places; condoms and men's razors are [not typically taxed](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tampon-cost/)(Band-aids—check. Condoms—check. Sunscreen—check. Tampons? Nope, sorry. The U.S. government has a long list of what counts as a medical expense eligible for tax breaks, but menstrual products don’t make the cut.).
1.2.2.5. Con: [Complex laws](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/tpaf/pages/vat.htm) ensure accuracy, fairness, and effectiveness in local and international trade, as opposed to batch-processing diverse and nuanced goods and services \([p. 718](https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1365&context=lr)(As it turns out, legal complexity is more complex, and more unavoidable, than even this much suggests. Even if we could all agree that through some reform we are simplifying a particular law in some particular respect, often we would only be displacing the legal complexity we started with, by shifting that complexity backward or forward in the legal system, or onto some other stage of the broader political process. We may fairly conclude that for all these reasons, complexity in the law cannot simply be reduced in any reasonably uncontroversial way. Simplifying the law in general, or even some particular area of the law, takes on the profitlessness of the proverbial wild goose chase.)\).
1.2.2.6. Pro: Tax complexity creates opportunities for businesses to avoid tax \([pp 7-8](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/193497/ots_david_ulph_measuring_tax_complexity.pdf)(Tax complexity can create opportunities for tax avoidance that can create significant costs to the economy in terms of both reduced efficiency and fairness.)\).
1.2.3. Con: Tampons are [legally classed as medical devices in the US](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/facts-tampons-and-how-use-them-safely)(You may be surprised to learn that the FDA regulates tampons as medical devices. Tampons cleared by the FDA are meant to be used one time and then thrown away. No tampon should be used more than once.). They should, therefore, be treated as such in the tax code and be rendered non taxable.
1.2.3.1. Pro: To avoid exposing the public to potentially unhygienic body fluids, all menstrual devices should be as inexpensive as possible.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Governments build public toilets to reduce [open defecation](https://www.un.org/en/desa/%E2%80%98transformational-benefits%E2%80%99-ending-outdoor-defecation-why-toilets-matter), which reduces the risk of transmission of diseases spread through urine and feces. Similarly, governments should cover the cost of menstrual devices to reduce the risk of transmission of [blood-borne diseases](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/disease-types/bloodborne-diseases).
1.2.3.1.2. Con: The notion that menstrual blood is unhygenic is unfounded. Menstrual blood is as ["pure" as venous blood](https://sites.utexas.edu/thechattygal/the-chemistry-of-period-blood/).
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Menstrual blood is only one component of menstrual discharge. [Other components](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494145/)(Menstrual blood is a complex biological fluid composed of blood, vaginal secretions, and the endometrial cells of the uterine wall as they exist immediately prior to menses. These cells are the end product of a dynamic cyclical process focused on pregnancy and reproduction.) include vaginal secretions and endometrial tissue.
1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Period blood's additional components do not make menstrual blood [any more unhygienic or dangerous](https://www.recircle.life/period-not-impure)(Unless a woman has a blood-borne illness, menstrual fluid is harmless. No toxins are released in menstrual flow, as this is a lining that must be pure and clean enough to have nurtured a baby. Menstrual fluid is no more dangerous than regular blood \(source: Menstruation: Bleeding\). Your organs release many secretions in the body, and your whole body has blood inside it too. If it was toxic or harmful, you would not be alive!).
1.2.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Menstruating women are at higher risk for contracting [sexually transmitted diseases](https://www.health.com/condition/sexual-health/std-risk-during-your-period)(Almost every STI poses a slightly larger threat when you have your period. Bacterial infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can be especially dangerous, however, because once they get beyond the cervix, they can turn into pelvic inflammatory disease, a more serious infection of the reproductive tract that can affect your fertility.\n\nHIV and hepatitis are also dangerous. “Period blood is the perfect Petri dish for spreading disease,” says Dr. Ross. “Bloodborne sexually transmitted infections like HIV and hepatitis love the nutrients that a period has to offer.") than their non-menstruating counterparts. Exposure to period blood, therefore, implies greater risk of exposure to pathogens to which one would otherwise not be exposed.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Menstrual blood is no more dangerous than other blood, but blood is [still dangerous](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/fluids-protecting-against-infection)(Blood and body fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluid, can contain viruses that can be passed on to other people. If you have contact with a person’s blood or body fluids you could be at risk of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or other blood borne illnesses. Body fluids, such as sweat, tears, vomit or urine may contain and pass on these viruses when blood is present in the fluid, but the risk is low.).
1.2.3.1.2.3. Pro: The belief that menstrual blood is dirty can result in [misogyny, ostracisation and even death](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4HDcgFZ9whsBWrK75yyzdLG/five-period-myths-debunked)(One of the most dangerous myths around menstruation is the belief that menstrual blood is dirty and, as a consequence, that periods are shameful. This myth is at the root of the marginalisation of girls, women, and people with vulvas around the world.\n\nIn Nepal, for example, a tradition called “Chhaupadi”, despite being officially banned in 2017, sees menstruating women in rural areas being exiled from the family home in so-called “menstruation huts”. These facilities are not safe and several women have in fact died of suffocation and at least one teenage girl has died after being bitten by a snake.).
1.2.3.2. Con: Menstruation is not an illness or something that needs to be treated with medicine, so classifying tampons as medical devices is inappropriate.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: "[Sanitary products](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-womens-sanitary-products-notice-70118)(Women's sanitary products \(VAT Notice 701/18\)\n\nFind out which sanitary protection products you can supply at the zero rate of VAT.)" are, as the name suggests, primarily intended for sanitary use rather than urgent medical use.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: The phrase "sanitary products" is [inappropriate](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-you-need-to-stop-saying-sanitary-products-when-talking-about-periods_uk_5ef5c326c5b612083c4bea1b)(Walk into your average supermarket or chemist and you’ll find an aisle labelled “feminine hygiene” or “sanitary products”. Scan the packaging of your tampons or towels, and the word “period” is nowhere to be seen.\n\nEuphemisms for menstrual bleeding have become normalised around the world, but a supermarket chain in New Zealand is taking a stand.\n\nThe chain, Countdown, is the first in the country to use the word “period” to describe its products. The fact it’s made headlines globally is, quite frankly, bonkers – and goes to show how ingrained the “period” taboo is.\n\nIsn’t it about time we followed suit in the UK and learned to call a spade a spade? Not just in period marketing – but in everyday conversation, too?) for describing menstrual products.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: Menstrual products serve no medical purpose. Instead, in accordance with [dictionary meanings](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sanitary)(clean and not dangerous for your health, or protecting health by removing dirt and waste, especially human waste), they serve a sanitary purpose: collect and discard unclean and potentially harmful human waste to reduce exposure to others.
1.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Urgency is not a litmus test for taxation. A review of [VAT schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax) worldwide and [sales tax in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States) shows that no jurisdiction taxes health-related materials differently based on immediacy of need.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: There is a distinction between [medical devices and medicines](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/50/medicines-and-medical-devices), and they are governed by different sets of regulations. Therefore, the tax-exempt status of medicines is not applicable to [medical devices](https://www.who.int/health-topics/medical-devices#tab=tab_1)(A medical device can be any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance, implant, reagent for in vitro use, software, material or other similar or related article, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination for a medical purpose.).
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Not all medical devices [are designed to cure illnesses](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/how-determine-if-your-product-medical-device)(The FDA considers a product to be a device, and subject to FDA regulation, if it meets the definition of a medical device per Section 201\(h\) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n\[...\]\n\nintended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and) - many are designed to help keep people healthy or control aspects of their bodies. Menstrual products help do both.
1.2.3.2.4. Con: Many of the unpleasant side-effects of menstruation can be [alleviated through medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279323/)(Anti-inflammatory painkillers like diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen can help relieve severe period pain. These medications sometimes have side effects such as stomach problems.\n\nPeriod pain and cramps \(dysmenorrhea\) are common. Most girls and women have pain of varying intensity at some point during their period. In some women the pain is so bad that they're unable to carry out their usual daily activities, like going to work or school, on one to three days every month.).
1.2.3.2.5. Pro: Tampons are not life sustaining like medicines, so they should be taxed.
1.2.3.2.5.1. Pro: Free-bleeding is as safe as, if not possibly safer than, using menstrual products.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: Anecdotal reports suggest that free-bleeding confers medical benefits.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Free-bleeding has [no proven health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/health/free-bleeding#sanitation)(7. Are there any other benefits?\n\nExperts note that free bleeding has no proven health benefits.).
1.2.3.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Free-bleeding maintains vaginal health by eliminating the risk of vaginal drying caused by [excess absorption](https://helloclue.com/articles/culture/6-benefits-freebleeding)(There’s nothing worse than removing a barely soaked tampon too soon or on a light day. The friction can feel terrible, and it temporarily dries out your vagina. Tampons absorb more than just menstrual blood — about a third may be vaginal and cervical fluids \(depending on how absorbent your tampon is\) \(1, 2\). This might change the amount of fluid your vagina produces during the rest of the cycle, but more research is needed \(2\). Free bleeding keeps your usual secretions in place \(2\).) of vaginal and cervical fluids by tampons.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: Menstrual products like pads often cause chafing and irritation - a condition called "[pad rash](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pad-rash)(Wearing a sanitary pad can cause friction from movement, resulting in a rash. According to the Center for Young Women’s Health, walking, running, and other forms of physical activity can cause the pad to move back and forward and contribute to a friction rash on the vulva.)." Free-bleeding eliminates this risk entirely.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1.4. Con: Features such as color, consistency, flow heaviness, and presence of clots provide [important information](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-does-menstrual-blood-look-like-2721937)(You'll know what's normal for you if you pay attention to what your period blood looks like and what your menstrual cycle feels like. Tracking your period helps you to know if something has changed. It may lead you to seek care based on how your period changes. \[...\] It's important to know what's normal for you. Changes in your period may be a sign of other health issues. For example, you may always experience heavy periods. About 20% of people do. But in others, they may be linked to a bleeding disorder or other medical condition.) about one's health. These properties can be difficult to examine when free-bleeding, and this could delay early diagnosis and treatment.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1.5. Con: Not changing menstrual pads can result in [complications](https://nuawoman.com/blog/6-health-risks-poor-menstrual-hygiene/)(Wearing one pad for way too long:\n\nA lot of us are guilty of this one and it is one of the worst things to do. If you do not change your pads frequently \(at least every 6-8 hours\), you are much more prone to develop rashes and vaginal yeast infections with the side effect of bad odour.) from extended vaginal contact with stagnant blood. Free-bleeding women who do not change their underwear every few hours may have similar problems.
1.2.3.2.5.1.1.6. Pro: Some women have reported that free-bleeding can [help reduce cramps](https://www.healthline.com/health/free-bleeding#other-benefits)(Experts note that free bleeding has no proven health benefits. There are several anecdotal ones, though.\n\nPeople have experienced reduced menstrual cramping and tend to feel less discomfort.) associated with using tampons.
1.2.3.2.5.1.2. Con: Social censure experienced by women who practice free-bleeding could trigger mental health problems.
1.2.3.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Social censure would likely weaken with time. Analogically, societies have come a long way in [breaking the silence](https://www.unicef.org/mena/stories/making-period-stigma-history)(Learning about menstruation and creating safe spaces to have conversations and exchange knowledge is a crucial aspect to empower, build self-esteem and end period stigma. Since 2014, there has been increased numbers of governments, NGO’s and UN agencies working on menstruation education. \[...\] Conversations about menstruation should be done openly at schools, in the private life, including with the support and engagement of male family members, as well as in the community at large.) over period stigma; over time, as free-bleeding becomes more common, aversive reactions to the sight of period blood may reduce.
1.2.3.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: [75% of women](https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/premenstrual-syndrome)(As many as three in four women say they get PMS symptoms at some point in their lifetime. For most women, PMS symptoms are mild.) experience premenstrual syndrome in their life, which includes symptoms like [anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/causes/pms) and [depression.](https://www.webmd.com/women/pms/depression-pms) Social stigma from free-bleeding could exacerbate that.
1.2.3.2.5.1.3. Con: Bodily fluids evoke a sense of disgust in others; therefore, to prevent such unpleasant reactions, free-bleeding should be avoided.
1.2.3.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: [Watching someone vomit](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/if-you-barf-when-you-see-barf-congrats-youre-empathetic-flna994124)(In human brains, scientists have discovered “mirror neurons” that cause some people to feel the same emotions as others around us. This explains why you might tear up when you see someone in the room cry.\n\nIf that sounds like you, when you see someone vomit, your brain feels empathy and causes you to actually feel that disgust with the other person, and so the food in your gut wants to come out.) can be so repulsive that many people, particularly those with a high level of empathy, end up throwing up. This demonstrates that reactions to bodily fluids are somewhat biologically based, at least in some individuals.
1.2.3.2.5.1.3.2. Con: Disgust is an [evolutionary response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013466/)(An evolutionary perspective, however, provides a parsimonious explanation for the multiple elicitors and the behavioural tendencies of the disgust system. According to Darwinian thinking, disgust should be considered an adaptive system that drives the behavioural avoidance of infectious disease.) to potentially harmful substances; this is why urine and feces evoke disgust, but innocuous fluids like teardrops do not. Since menstrual blood is [not harmful](https://sites.utexas.edu/thechattygal/the-chemistry-of-period-blood/), disgust towards periods is likely a socioculturally configured response rather than a biological one.
1.2.3.2.5.1.4. Pro: Free-bleeding would remove the risk of [toxic shock syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/toxic-shock-syndrome#causes)(Infection usually occurs when bacteria enter your body through an opening in your skin, such as a cut, sore, or other wound. Experts are not sure why tampon use sometimes leads to the condition. Some believe that a tampon left in place for a long period of time attracts bacteria. Another possibility is that tampon fibers scratch the vagina, creating an opening for bacteria to enter your bloodstream.), commonly associated with tampon use.
1.2.3.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: Women must take several time-consuming precautions to reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome from tampons; even correct tampon use can result in risks such as [tiny abrasions](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/toxic-shock-syndrome-tss)(Tampons can stick to the vaginal walls, especially when blood flow is light, causing tiny abrasions when they are removed.) during removal.
1.2.3.2.5.1.4.2. Con: There is no need to free-bleed to avoid the risk of toxic shock sydrome - [pads also remove this risk](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/toxic-shock-syndrome-tss)(- Toxic shock syndrome \(TSS\) is a rare and potentially life-threatening illness that is thought to be caused by infection with certain types of bacteria.\n\n- Women who have their period \(are menstruating\) are most at risk of getting TSS, as it is thought to be associated with tampon use.\n\n- Suggestions for reducing the risk of TSS include changing tampons regularly and using pads instead of tampons overnight.).
1.2.3.2.5.1.4.3. Con: Toxic shock syndrome resulting from tampon use is extremely rare: it occurs in approximately [one in 100,000 women](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2018/07/tss.php). For comparison, about one in 100,000 people in the US [accidentally drown](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/death-index-top-50-ways-americans-die/6/)(In 2017, doctors said 3,709 deaths were caused by accidental drowning.) every year.
1.2.3.2.5.2. Con: Not all medicines are life sustaining, and not all life-sustaining medicines are [effective](https://www.sciencealert.com/recent-study-finds-400-medical-devices-procedures-or-practices-that-are-ineffective)(A recent study, designed to create a more comprehensive list, has unearthed nearly 400 established treatments, devices and procedures that fit this bill. \[...\] The findings are based on more than 15 years of randomised controlled trials, a type of research that aims to reduce bias when testing new treatments. Across 3,000 articles in three leading medical journals from the UK and the US, the authors found 396 reversals.\n\nWhile these were found in every medical discipline, cardiovascular disease was by far the most commonly represented category, at 20 percent; it was followed by preventative medicine and critical care.\n\nTaken together, it appears that medication was the most common reversal at 33 percent; procedures came in second at 20 percent, and vitamins and supplements came in third at 13 percent.). Nonetheless, these caveats are not regarded as a defensible basis for the revocation of their tax-exempt status.
1.2.3.2.5.3. Con: There can be severe [health consequences](https://www.healthline.com/health/toxic-shock-syndrome#tampons)(Experts aren’t sure why tampon use sometimes leads to the condition. Some believe that a tampon left in place for a long period of time attracts bacteria. Another possibility is that tampon fibers scratch the vagina, creating an opening for bacteria to enter your bloodstream.\n\nTampons have changed a lot over time, and it’s unclear if a specific type of tampon or tampon applicator can cause TSS. If you feel like one type of tampon seems to irritate \(or scratch\) the vagina, you may consider switching brands.) to not routinely changing tampons. Removing the tampon tax removes financial barriers that prevent women from changing tampons regularly, thereby making them life-sustaining.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Tampons are rarely used for non-medical purposes.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Menstrual products can be used for a [whole range of purposes](https://naturallysavvy.com/nest/21-unusual-uses-for-tampons-and-sanitary-pads/), ranging from hair curlers to toe separators for polishing nails.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Even when tampons are not used as a menstrual product, they are often used to [absorb other bodily fluids](https://naturallysavvy.com/nest/21-unusual-uses-for-tampons-and-sanitary-pads/), such as blood \(e.g., a tampon for a nosebleed or a pad as emergency bandage\). This also qualifies as medical use of tampons.
1.2.3.4. Con: Not all countries grant medical devices a tax-exempt status. In [Ireland](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/search-vat-rates/M/medical-equipment.aspx), medical equipment is taxed at the standard rate of 23%.
1.2.4. Con: Through a phenomenon known as the [pink tax](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/the-pink-tax/)(What Is the Pink Tax?\n\nThe pink tax refers to the extra amount of money women pay for specific products or services. Sometimes you’ll see or hear it referred to as price discrimination or gender-pricing.), women already pay more than men for 42% of products.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Women's razors [cost 6% more](https://www.riftrefunds.co.uk/blogs/pink-tax-today-how-much-extra-do-women-and-girls-pay-for-everyday-essentials/)(4 pack of disposable razors:\nWomen’s: £3.38\nMen’s: £3.18\nWomen’s razors are 6.28% more expensive) than men's.
1.2.4.1.1.

1.2.4.1.2. Con: Women's razors have [specially shaped heads and lubricated strips](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/645184/womens-razors-vs-mens-razors-what-is-difference)(“When you think about all the ways women have to hold a razor to reach those tricky spots and then add in a shaving gel or soap and water in the shower—things can get slippery. It’s no wonder women need a different kind of handle,” dermatologist Dr. Jody Levine, who’s also a spokesperson for Gillette and Venus, told Reader’s Digest. Women’s razors also sometimes have two lubricating strips, above and below the blades, to moisturize the skin and prevent nicks when quickly shaving such a large region.\n\nMen’s razors, on the other hand, are mainly intended for people shaving their faces.) to make them more suitable for shaving their bodies.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Men need razors to remove facial hair, whereas women need razors to remove body hair. These [different purposes](https://www.rd.com/article/mens-and-womens-razors-whats-the-difference/)(“The handle on women’s razors are very different from the handle on a razor for men.

It’s no wonder women need a different kind of handle.”\n\n“The razor blade cartridge shape on women’s razors is typically different from men’s razors. The oval shape suits women’s shaving better than the square head of a men’s razor because it fits better into the curves such as behind the knee and underarms. It helps pull the skin taut, so even areas like underarms get a close, smooth shave. The women’s razor head also pivots with individually adjusting blades that flex, so it’s easy to shave hard-to-reach spots.”\n\n“The pivot of the razor head is also designed differently to allow the cartridge to follow the contours of a woman’s body—which are very different in comparison to the contours of a man’s face.”) necessitate different features.
1.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Men also [shave their body hair](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/content/story/83-of-men-trim-their-body-hair-heres-what-theyre-trimming)(In a recent survey we conducted, we found that 83% of the men we spoke to trimmed some or all of their body hair. In the chart above*, you’ll see the breakdown of who shaved what. Ears, eyebrows and noses made a predictably high showing, but the next-highest body part on the list was the groin area by a strong margin. Nothing else even came close, in fact: The nearest competition were the armpits and chest, which saw 50% fewer guys whacking the weeds in those areas. The back, meanwhile, saw even less attention, and as for arms and legs, it seems most guys are content to leave them to their own devices.).
1.2.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Women who use men's razors reportedly find them to be better than those designed for women; further, the minor disadvantages they report are also [easily rectifiable](https://beardedcolonel.co.uk/blog/why-women-should-use-mens-shaving-razors/)(We gave our razors to a couple women who had never tried using a guy’s razor before. Nearly all of them found it to be a better shave. Those who didn’t had the small complaint that men’s razors left their skin a little drier, but one of the ladies who experienced this issue offered up a solution: coconut oil. According to her, applying coconut oil and then shaving gave her a better shave than she had ever had, with no dryness. So we went back and asked the ladies to try again, this time with coconut oil. The result was a resounding improvement compared to their overpriced women’s razors, and an escape from the pink tax!).
1.2.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: In a men's razor, the [blades are arranged](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/645184/womens-razors-vs-mens-razors-what-is-difference)(Men’s razors, on the other hand, are mainly intended for people shaving their faces. Contrary to popular belief, men’s razor blades aren’t usually any sharper or higher-quality than women’s blades. But according to Today I Found Out, they’re more closely packed together in a razor head—the better for cutting through coarse facial hair and getting as close a shave as possible. The smaller, squared head helps people be precise about which parts of their facial hair they’re shaving off.) closer together than in a women's razor; this makes them particularly well-suited to shaving coarse facial hair.
1.2.4.1.2.2. Con: The argument that product enhancements justify cost differences was made by [a spokesperson for Gillette and Venus](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/645184/womens-razors-vs-mens-razors-what-is-difference)(When you think about all the ways women have to hold a razor to reach those tricky spots and then add in a shaving gel or soap and water in the shower—things can get slippery. It’s no wonder women need a different kind of handle,” dermatologist Dr. Jody Levine, who’s also a spokesperson for Gillette and Venus, told Reader’s Digest.), brands with a financial interest in charging women more for shaving products.
1.2.4.2. Pro: While originally understood as just affecting luxury items, the pink tax affects [basic necessities](http://time.com/4159973/women-pay-more-everything/)(In a study titled “From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being a Female Consumer,” New York City’s Department of Consumer Affairs tracked price discrepancies in otherwise identical products that were marketed to male and female consumers. After analyzing the prices of almost 800 products across 35 categories, researchers found that the so-called “pink tax” doesn’t just apply to shampoo and razors—women pay more for almost ever product over the course of their lives, from baby clothes to home health care items.) too.
1.2.4.3. Con: "Similar" does not mean "identical." There are differences in the goods and services that men and women require, which justify the [difference in cost](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/201512/why-do-women-s-products-services-cost-more)(All men’s shirts have a similar shape and are made of cotton, polyester, or a blend. \[...\] For women, the situation is completely different. Women’s shirts and blouses come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and materials that change every few months. This makes it difficult to press at high speed with machines configured for standardized tasks. \[...\] A similar logic also applies to haircuts. \[...\] For labor-intensive services, gendered pricing is logical, fair, and the price differences are simply due to cost differences to deliver the service.).
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Men's haircuts are generally cheaper than women's, but men's haircuts usually [take less time and require fewer products](https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/27/why-do-women-have-to-pay-so-much-more-than-men-for-their-haircuts-6737965/)(I spoke to a couple of hairdressers to ask for justification for the price change.\n\nLydia Jayne Higgins, a former hairdresser at Nicky Clarke in Mayfair who now runs her own business, told metro.co.uk: ‘In my personal experience it costs more for women’s hair as it takes more time and you use more products, so costs are higher than a gent’s cut, unless that gent also takes up the same time, then the price goes up.’).
1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: Women with short hair [have also been charged the full price for a woman's haircut](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/woman-short-hair-blasts-salon-17478833)(A woman with short hair has slammed a salon which refused to give her the cheaper men's rate.\n\nThe customer provoked a lively debate on Reddit about salon prices with her scathing rant today.\n\nShe said she doesn't want to return to the establishment, which said it would charge $22 \(£17.54\), rather than the $40 \(£31.90\) for a woman's cut.\n\nWhen the manager "looked shocked", the customer stormed out.\n\nAnd some online have branded her treatment "sexual discrimination" and "legit sexism".\n\nThe woman, from the US, wrote on Reddit: "It usually only takes about 10-15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut.), despite the haircut taking the same amount of time as a man's.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: In general, people with short hair need to get their hair cut [significantly more frequently](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/how-often-should-you-cut-your-hair)(Whether you have a pixie cut, bowl cut, or a contemporary crop, you’ll probably need to maintain it every month or so.\n\n“Short cuts look overgrown faster than hair past the shoulder because of the way they frame the face,” Huff states.\n\nIn other words, they lose their distinctiveness pretty quickly. Regular trims will help keep things looking sharp. \[...\]\n\n“Long hair can go much longer, especially if \[you\] don’t color or use heat on it,” says Huff.\n\nBetween 3 and 6 months is usually recommended.) than those with long hair. Given that more men than women have short hair, men may end up spending more on haircuts in the long run.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Products targeted toward women are more expensive, even when they fare worse on [quality and quantity dimensions](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2016-02-17/the-pink-tax-why-womens-products-often-cost-more)(Some items marketed to women not only cost more but actually contain less of the product because manufacturers make the product smaller and more feminine-looking, an approach called “shrink it and pink it.” \[...\] For gendered toys, the blue version is often sturdier and more intellectually stimulating than the pink one \(although companies like GoldieBlox are working to change this\). “If you look at the pink Duplos \[which are like Legos for younger kids\], you can do only a fraction of what you can do with the regular Duplos,” Whelan says.).
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Since no product comparable to menstrual products exists for men, price differences cannot be determined and used as a meaningful basis to assess the acceptability of the tampon tax.
1.2.4.4. Con: Consumer items targeted at women cost more due to market forces, not because of any law.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: The argument that the pink tax is anything other than market forces [is patronising towards women](https://reason.com/2016/01/05/the-pink-tax-is-a-myth/)(Of course, individual consumers do have control over which products they buy, though. And while the pink razors with the butterflies on the packaging my be marketed toward women, no one's forcing us to buy those over basic blue Bics. If the products in this study really were identical save for some totally non-desired factors, it seems likely that women, or at least a larger proportion of women, would simply choose the products marketed toward men. \n\nSince they don't, one can jump to one of two conclusions: either women are so brainwashed by marketing that they choose products against their own best interests because of it, or women find some discernible appeal in the women's products—be that different ingredients, cosmetic factors, or whatever else—that make them worth paying more for. I'm going to go with the explanation that grants women a little intelligence and agency.), as it suggests that women don't have the agency to pick similar items marketed towards men.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: Given that governments establish price controls to ensure [fairness and affordability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-controls.asp)(The term "price controls" refers to the legal minimum or maximum prices set for specified goods. Price controls are normally mandated by the government in the free market. They are usually implemented as a means of direct economic intervention to manage the affordability of certain goods and services, including rent, gasoline, and food.), the absence of a law regulating the pricing of gendered products is indicative of government apathy toward the pink tax.
1.2.4.4.3. Pro: Women are not charged more for the items they buy, but rather products targeted at women cost more. Women can buy the men's version of the product they want and pay less.
1.2.4.4.3.1. Con: There are examples of women being charged more for the same product [simply because they are women](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50691249)(I was working on a show at the Lyric Hammersmith and needed just the back and sides doing, partly for the show," she says. "When I asked to have my hair cut, the barber just laughed in my face and said 'no' and made some remark about me being a woman.).
1.2.4.4.3.2. Pro: If women are aware of the pink tax but refuse to buy identical men's products, they are allowing themselves to be affected by [internalized sexism.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/communication-success/202005/10-signs-internalized-sexism-and-gaslighting)(Often, those with internalized sexism are consciously or unconsciously socialized into believing that women are inferior and “the weaker sex," and should either indiscriminately please, or “take a backseat” in their relationships with men \(especially the dominant male figures in their lives\). Significantly, one of the most common expressions of internalized sexism is when some women routinely attack \(“trash”\) other women and girls to marginalize their selfhood and power.)
1.2.4.4.3.3. Con: It is fundamentally unfair to expect women to purchase equivalent products designed for men in order to save money.
1.2.4.4.4. Con: While the pink tax isn't enshrined in law, it still [exists](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/29/pink-tax-women-pay-more/417648002/)(Young girl's clothes cost 4% more than boys' clothing. Women pay 7% more than men for accessories such as tote bags and watches, 8% more for clothing and 13% more for personal care such as deodorant, according to NYC.gov.\n\n“It doesn’t take any more chemicals to make women’s deodorant than men’s deodorant,” says Angela Hattery, director of the women and gender studies department at George Mason University. “Part of the point is being able to take advantage of a group of people — in this case, women — by extracting more resources from them.”).
1.2.4.5. Pro: Most women will pay [tens of thousands](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/money/a27409442/what-is-pink-tax/)(In fact, according to axthepinktax.com, the pink tax has cost a 30-year-old woman more than $40,000. A woman in her 60s will cough up nearly $82,000 in fees that men don’t have to pay. Currently no federal law prohibits companies from charging different prices for identical items based on gender.) of USD more for the same services as men throughout their life.
1.2.4.6. Con: Gendered pricing is not only a problem for women. [Men pay more than women](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/the-pink-tax/)(Pricing Disparity Frequency Chart, All Industries\n\n\[...\]\n\n- Women pay more \[...\] 42%\n\n- Equal \[...\] 40%\n\n- Men pay more \[...\] 18%) for 18% of products.
1.3. Pro: Taxing menstrual products is antithetical to the notion that access to these necessities is a [fundamental human right](https://www.unfpa.org/menstruationfaq)(Human rights are rights that every human being has by virtue of his or her human dignity. Menstruation is intrinsically related to human dignity – when people cannot access safe bathing facilities and safe and effective means of managing their menstrual hygiene, they are not able to manage their menstruation with dignity. Menstruation-related teasing, exclusion and shame also undermine the principle of human dignity.) \([p. 491](https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2068&context=lawfaculty)(In the international context, human rights law may provide a promising foundation for similar legal challenges to the tampon tax because human rights law takes a capacious approach to gender equality. In the European Court of Human Rights, for example, there are several tax cases that recognize gender-differentiated taxes as a form of impermissible discrimination.)\).
1.3.1. Pro: Menstrual products should be taxed in a manner consistent with taxes on toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, dental floss, and other products necessary for basic hygiene.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Proper hygiene is essential for maintaining good health; if menstrual products are taxed minimally, like toilet paper, it will be cheaper and, thus, easier to ensure a healthy population.
1.3.2. Pro: It is effectively impossible to carry out daily activities without menstrual products because of the risk of embarrassment and discomfort.
1.3.2.1. Con: Adherents of the [free-bleeding movement](https://helloclue.com/articles/culture/whats-all-fuss-about-free-bleeding-why-does-it-matter)(Free bleeding is the practice of intentionally menstruating in public, without blocking or collecting the period flow.\n\nWhen you hear about free bleeding, you might think, “But what about all that laundry?” But more than just a period practice, free bleeding is a movement. \n\nFree bleeding has been used to challenge period stigma and taboos, to protest high prices of period products, and to draw attention to the environmental issues relating to disposable pads and tampons. But where did this movement come from? Let’s start from the beginning.) advocate for a less shame-filled approach to menstruation. This approach could help people overcome the discomfort they face and allow them to do more when menstruating.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The desire to hide the emission of bodily fluids like menstrual blood does not necessarily have to stem from a place of shame.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the same way that members of modern civilized societies prefer to use toilets for excretory purposes, women may prefer to remain discreet about their periods.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some people get embarrassed when they are seen [buying toilet paper](https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/4228421-To-hate-buying-toilet-paper).
1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: In modern civilized societies, women are encouraged or expected to [swallow semen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960515/)(This sounds awful: I literally just put my mouth over it and it just … \[laughs\] I was just like, “Ugh, Tim!” He was just like, “Swallow it!” I was like, “No,” and it went everywhere. It was horrible. I was so upset. He was like: “I’m sorry.” It was … ugh \[laughs\].\n\nSo he wanted you to swallow?\n\nYeah.\n\nHave you done that before?\n\nYeah, I hate it. I cannot stand it. But he was like, “Please.” I was just like, “No,” and then I ended up spitting everywhere, which was nasty \[laughs\].\n\nWhy did he want you to swallow it?\n\nI don’t know. I did ask him that actually. I think it’s just a man thing. I don’t know. He didn’t really have a straight answer for it \[laughs\].) as this is deemed enjoyable to their male partners. To regard semen as worthy of being swallowed and menstrual blood as something that must always be hidden reflects sexist double standards.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Free bleeding informs onlookers about the [fertility cycle](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-long-does-ovulation-last-1960235) of a woman - information that many women may not feel comfortable disclosing to strangers.
1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Analogically, semen can [stain various fabrics](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/house-and-home/household-advice/a656973/remove-semen-stains/); like menstrual blood, this is also considered a stain that must be kept out of the public eye, even though there is no such thing as "semen stigma" or "semen shame".
1.3.2.1.1.4. Con: Historically, menstruation has been considered [unclean](https://aeon.co/essays/throughout-history-and-still-today-women-are-shamed-for-menstruating)(All kinds of taboos and myths surrounded menstruation. The ancient Greeks believed that if a girl’s menarche was late, blood would accumulate around her heart, and her uterus would wander around her body. This could produce erratic behaviour, from violent swearing to suicidal depression. Right into the 20th century, any inappropriate behaviour or poor mental health in women was termed hysteria, after the Greek word for ‘uterus’.\n\nPliny the Elder, who died in 79 CE, warned: ‘If a woman strips herself naked while she is menstruating, and walks round a field of wheat, the caterpillars, worms, beetles, and other vermin, will fall from off the ears of corn … bees will forsake their hives if touched by a menstruous woman … linen boiling in the cauldron will turn black, the edge of a razor will become blunted.’ But then he also believed that drinking the blood of a gladiator would cure epilepsy.), and women have been prevented from taking part in certain activities due to it.
1.3.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Attitudes toward periods vary significantly [across cultures](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/blog/news/2019/10/18/how-do-people-around-the-world-celebrate-periods). In some cultures, periods are [celebrated](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/08/11/431605131/attention-trump-some-cultures-treat-menstruation-with-respect).
1.3.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The celebration of periods is often a guise for [intense gender socialization](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/blog/news/2019/10/18/how-do-people-around-the-world-celebrate-periods), during which a young girl is taught how to act like a woman and encouraged to adopt stifling gender norms.
1.3.2.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Menarche is regarded as the timepoint at which a girl becomes a woman. Like other developmental milestones \(e.g., marriage, childbirth\), [this calls for a celebration in many cultures](https://www.indiatimes.com/culture/11-first-period-traditions-from-around-the-world-that-celebrate-a-girl-s-journey-into-womanhood-338129.html)(There you have it. 11 countries and 11 unique first period traditions that don’t stigmatise a young woman when she starts menstruating. It’s also worth noting how all these customs have been in practice for ages – goes to show how evolved some societies are when embracing womanhood.).
1.3.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: The Bible claims that menstruating women are [unclean and can spread their uncleanliness to others](https://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/leviticus/passage/?q=leviticus+15:19-33)(19. Whenever a woman has her menstrual period, she will be ceremonially unclean for seven days. Anyone who touches her during that time will be unclean until evening. 20. Anything on which the woman lies or sits during the time of her period will be unclean.).
1.3.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Jesus invalidated Old Testament laws governing menstruation when he [healed the bleeding woman](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A20-22%2CMark+5%3A25-34%2CLuke+8%3A43-48&version=NIV)(20 Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. 21 She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”\n\n22 Jesus turned and saw her. “Take heart, daughter,” he said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.) who had touched his robe in the hopes of being healed.
1.3.2.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: At a time when scientific knowledge was lacking, Biblical laws calling menstruating women unclean may have established norms that allowed women to not engage in usual daily life activities that might otherwise increase their [physical strain](http://womeninthebible.net/women-bible-old-new-testaments/menstruating-woman/menstruating-womans-world/)(These basic regulations seem harsh/impractical to a modern woman who does not allow herself, or cannot afford, time out during her period of menstruation.\n\nBut the ancient regulations created time out for women, periods of separation away from their husbands and other male members of family and community.\n\nOf course the regulations divided the community by gender, but menstruating women themselves formed a community for the period of menstruation, and at the end of their seven days they went together to the pool for ritual bathing.).
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Some women free-bleed as an act of protest. In 2015, activists in the UK [free-bled outside parliament](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/we-protested-outside-parliament-while-bleeding-without-tampons-because-a6728456.html)(When Parliament recently voted against scrapping the "tampon tax", we knew something had to be done. A new approach was needed. If everyone knew what it was like to have a period, we thought, then society would change for the better. We wanted to do something about it, but there was a slight catch – making everyone know what it's really like to bleed from your genitals every month isn't just easier said than done, it's pretty much impossible.

1.3.2.1.4. Con: The free-bleeding movement is inaccessible to many women who feel intimidated by existing social stigma and censure surrounding periods.
1.3.2.1.4.1.

But the female teacher made the girl show the stain in class, local media reported her mother as saying.) for wearing blood-stained clothes. It is highly unlikely that girls and women in such societies would be able to practice free-bleeding.
1.3.2.1.4.2. Con: The only way to combat period-based social stigma is by challenging it, as the free-bleeding movement does.
1.3.2.1.5. Con: Free-bleeding women probably wouldn't be allowed to partake in some activities, such as swimming in communal pools.
1.3.2.1.5.1. Con: There is no physical check to see if a person in a public pool might be on their period and whether they are using a tampon or menstrual cup. Unless a woman is bleeding heavily and visibly, nobody will know that they are on their period.
1.3.2.1.5.1.1. Con: The question of whether checks are feasible and how they should be implemented is secondary. What matters more is that a policy that prohibits menstruating women from using swimming pools is [discriminatory](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pool-sign-women-periods-georgia_n_57addf65e4b007c36e4e434b)(Sexist Pool Sign Tells Women Not To Swim During Their Periods).
1.3.2.1.5.1.2. Con: Free-bleeding women will, in all likelihood, be visibly bleeding before they get into the water.

The good news is it probably won’t be visible. When you get out of the water your period will flow again normally, so it’s a good idea to use a tampon or menstrual cup while swimming. Pads and pantyliners aren’t a good option because they will absorb water and become ineffective. Menstrual cups can be left in for up to 12 hours, so they are a long-lasting alternative to tampons.) when it is diluted in a large body of water.

Con: Pools often contain [small amounts of other bodily fluids](https://www.cbsnews.com/media/6-gross-facts-about-swimming-pools/)(Though it's a commonly held belief that red eyes while swimming means there's too much chlorine in the pool, that's not the case, health officials say.\n\nIt turns out, red eyes \(and an irritated nose or throat\) after spending time in a pool is a direct result of bodily fluids in the water -- including urine, feces, and sweat.), such as urine and sweat, but the [chlorine](https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/science-questions/question652.htm)(Chlorine is the chemical most often used to keep swimming pools and Jacuzzis free of bacteria that can be hazardous to humans.\n\nChlorine kills bacteria though a fairly simple chemical reaction. The chlorine solution you pour into the water breaks down into many different chemicals, including hypochlorous acid \(HOCl\) and hypochlorite ion \(OCl-\). Both kill microorganisms and bacteria by attacking the lipids in the cell walls and destroying the enzymes and structures inside the cell, rendering them oxidized and harmless. The difference between HOCl and OCl- is the speed at which they oxidize. Hypochlorous acid is able to oxidize the organisms in several seconds, while the hypochlorite ion may take up to 30 minutes.) with which the water is treated prevents the spread of disease. This is no different with menstrual blood.
1.3.2.1.5.2.1. Con: Some diseases and parasites [can survive for days in chlorinated pools](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/may/should-you-be-worried-about-germs-in-your-swimming-pool/)(This means that it's important to regularly check both the chlorine level and pH of your pool. When both chlorine and pH are maintained at the right level and range, the result is a perfect balance between germ-killing and pool-system longevity. In addition, this range reduces skin and eye irritation that can occur at both a very high or a very low pH.\n\nOne thing to note, however, is that chlorine doesn't immediately kill germs. While it can kill most bacteria in less than a minute, other germs are more chlorine-tolerant. For instance, one of the common causes of recreational water diarrheal illness, Crypto, can survive as long as 10 days in a properly chlorinated pool.).
1.3.2.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Swimming pools are a [public health hazard](https://time.com/5631608/swimming-illness-risks/) and can cause a whole range of diseases, some of which are fatal.

1.3.2.1.5.2.1.3. Con: The inefficiency of swimming pool chlorine is not a case for women on their period avoiding pools, but rather a case against using communal pools at all.
1.3.2.1.5.2.1.4. Con: The [most common illnesses caught in swimming pools](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/may/should-you-be-worried-about-germs-in-your-swimming-pool/)(The most commonly reported recreational water illness is diarrhea — often caused by germs such as E. coli, norovirus and Cryptosporidium \(also referred to as Crypto\).

1.3.2.1.5.3. Pro: Other pool users may view free bleeding as a hygiene risk and complain to management or shame these women.
1.3.2.1.5.3.1.

And so, in part, the push for racial segregation and racial exclusion was for white swimmers to avoid being infected by the supposed "dirtiness" of black Americans.\n\nBut I argue that the primary and the most crucial cause for racial segregation was gender integration, that most whites did not want black men, in particular, to be able to have access to white women at such an intimate public space...) from using a service.
1.3.2.1.5.3.2.

1.3.2.1.8.1. Pro: In reality, feminists adopt a [more balanced approach](https://blogs.webmd.com/womens-health/20190124/free-bleeding-an-obgyn-weighs-in) toward free bleeding: while isolated public instances of free bleeding can be effective in reducing period stigma, it is neither practical nor medically advisable.
1.3.2.1.8.2. Con: Even if the motives behind the people originally promoting the movement were malicious, that does not mean free-bleeding has not empowered those women who follow it.

1.3.2.2. Pro: Women run the risk of being publicly shamed, if they bleed onto surfaces or through their clothes.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Nearly half of American women](https://nypost.com/2018/01/03/nearly-half-of-women-have-experienced-period-shaming/)(Menstruation is one of the most natural functions in the world. It is a mark of femininity and fertility, and a huge part of life for most women. Yet, for some reason, women are frequently made to feel ashamed or embarrassed simply because they bleed, and, according to new research, this shaming often comes from those closest to them.\n\nA new poll of 1,500 women and 500 men from across the country has found that 58 percent of women have felt a sense of embarrassment simply because they were on their period.\n\nForty-two percent of women have experienced period-shaming, with one in five being made to have these feelings because of comments made by a male friend.) have reported being shamed for their periods.
1.3.2.2.1.1.

Getting fired for an accidental period leak was humiliating. I don’t want any woman to have to go through what I did, so I'm fighting back.”) for accidentally leaking during two heavy periods.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: The abolition of the tampon tax could have unintended effects on period shaming. Notably, women practicing free bleeding may be subjected to more period shaming for their refusal to use menstrual products, despite their greater affordability via abolition.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Popular media have promoted the idea that women's periods [are embarassing and disgusting](https://www.vulture.com/article/periods-in-movies-and-tv.html)(A comedy classic, Superbad has a classic period-shaming scene. Seth \(Jonah Hill\) is dancing with a drunk girl at a party when he notices that she’s bled onto his pants. His response, “I’m going to f\[******\] throw up,” encapsulates the attitudes of disgust and shame associated with periods \(especially from people who don’t menstruate\) that remain to this day, 15 years after the scene was shot.).
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Advertising for menstrual products often [normalises the problematic notions](https://helloclue.com/articles/culture/what-advertising-teaches-us-about-periods)(They are often sexist, strange, and silly, but advertisements for menstrual products are an important source of information about periods for many people. Advertising reaches huge audiences and has the power to spread stigma and shame around menstruation—or to inform and empower viewers.\n\n\[...\]\n\nMany brands still use terms like “virtually undetectable” or advertise that their product has a “discreet wrapper” to ensure “discreet protection.” This suggests it’s important to hide the fact you’re menstruating. In 2010, Kotex challenged period shame with their “Break the Cycle” campaign, showing that it’s cool to carry your tampons proudly in a transparent handbag.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe ubiquitous blue liquid used in many ads sends confusing a message to young people about what periods are and what these products are for. It also suggests that period blood is too disgusting to show on TV, when blood is regularly shown in sports, medical dramas, and horror films.) that periods should not be directly addressed or that they don't involve blood.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Con: Many normal bodily functions are [stigmatized in popular media](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/lee-suckling-the-bodily-function-we-need-to-stop-being-embarrassed-about/PKTO6LBE2GVUAJZWZKB6NPEPZ4/)(Sweat patches are embarrassing but we never really analyse the reason they make us feel ashamed. When we have them ourselves, we feel self-conscious until they dry up. When we see them on others, they are immediately noticeable – rather than the cliché that something "sticks out like a sore thumb" we should really be saying something "sticks out like a sweaty armpit".\n\nEverybody sweats. We just like to pretend we're not human sometimes, and that our bodies don't work the way biology intends. Being embarrassed about sweat patches is akin to farting or bowel movements – things everybody does, but for some reason we all pretend we don't.).
1.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: Periods are rarely referenced [in popular media](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/7xm8dq/10-bloody-important-onscreen-moments-about-menstruation)(Periods: half the world has one, and yet they barely get a mention in film and TV. When they are, they’re mostly used as a means of shaming female characters. In one particularly charming episode of Family Guy, for example, Stewie tells Meg to “pop in couple of tampons” because she “must be PMSing”. Or it’s used as a trope to rinse male characters, like in The Departed when Leo orders a cranberry juice at the bar and the guy next to him asks whether he’s on his period. At its worst, periods are just used to gross the audience out, like in the 2005 classic Dirty Love, in which Jenny McCarthy \(lol, remember her?\) goes on a tampon run and starts bleeding on the floor of the supermarket, causing some old lady to slip and go flying.). This reinforces the idea that they are secret or don't even exist.
1.3.2.2.3.

Cosmopolitan called 2015 the year the period went public, with a combination of academic research, grassroots activism and social media leading to commentators arguing menstruation is now ‘having a moment’. In that year, Kiran Ghandhi demonstrated free bleeding in the London marathon, Rupi Kaur’s Instagram image of her everyday menstrual bleeding was removed and reinstated, many ongoing campaigns against tampon tax gained momentum and Amika George’s Free Periods campaign launched in the UK.).
1.3.2.2.3.1.

And while period stains can feel like one of those tough moments, the truth is they're actually NBD.) towards periods, accidental leaks and people who judge women for them.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Human beings have evolved to respond [strongly and aversively](https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-02/why-does-blood-make-some-people-squeamish-not-others/)(Up to 30 percent of children are afraid of the sight of blood, a response that usually continues into adulthood, according to the definitive study on the topic, by Isaac Marks of the Institute of Psychiatry in London. That study also revealed that approximately 15 percent of the adult population faints when donating blood.\n\nFainting at the sight of blood generally comes from an overactive vasovagal response, an evolutionary fear reflex. This response slows down your heart rate and lowers your blood pressure, causing blood to drain to your legs. This means that less oxygen-rich blood is going to your brain, which is what causes people to feel lightheaded, or even pass out.\n\nThis survival mechanism is nice if, say, you need to play dead in the presence of a predator, which may be the origin of the response. And if you’re bleeding, the reduced heart rate might help prevent too much blood loss.) to the sight of blood. Even if period stigma is altogether eliminated, period blood would continue to evoke the same reactions as venous blood.

But then you're faced with the icky task of trying to scrub the mess from your clothes and bedding before stains sets in—and you're forced to trash another pair of panties or set of sheets.), and so avoid strenuous activity in case of leaks.
1.3.2.3.1.

While your instinct might be to just apply to the stain-side, guess what?! Odds are if it's stained, it's already soaked through, so double your chances of defeating the stain by treating both sides. Give it ten minutes to soak in and do its thing, then rinse in cool water. Continue this treatment until the stain is gone, and then you can wash the item in warm water using detergent and the same stain remover \(yes, one more time\).).

Similarly, as a compromise, tax rates can be lower for basic menstrual products and higher for more expensive variants.
1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: Menstrual products are a privately produced good, meaning that the government has no burden in regards to supplying/producing them.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: While clothes, water, and shelter are often subject to taxation, that does not mean that these items should be taxed. It is immoral to tax any item, including menstrual products, that is a basic necessity.

Con: Beards are [increasingly tolerated](https://careeremployer.com/professionalism/are-beards-professional/)(But times have certainly changed and the question of whether or not beards are professional has come a long way.\n\nTake this post for example which discusses famous CEO’s with beards, something practically unheard of a mere two-decades ago.) in most workplaces.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Con: Given that the sight of period blood is more widely frowned upon than having a beard, almost all working women could not go about their daily life without menstrual products, while many men could work with a beard.
1.3.4.2.1.3. Pro: Having facial hair can make it impossible to get jobs in [specific sectors](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/28/17916056/workplace-beards-facial-hair-black-men-sikhs-publix-chick-fil-a)(The best treatment for the problem is to stop shaving altogether, but many men work for companies that bar facial hair. Workers in food service, the military, and public service jobs commonly run into such bans. And men who run Fortune 500 companies typically don’t have facial hair either, but that trend may be changing. Younger executives, such as Google’s Sundar Pichai and Sergey Brin, wear beards, as did Steve Jobs later in his career.\n\nJust having facial hair can make men targets of employment discrimination. Practicing Sikhs, who wear beards for religious reasons, have filed lawsuits against companies that have denied them jobs because of their appearance.

Therefore, it may be acceptable for your boss to require you to tweeze your eyebrows, trim your facial hair or maintain a nail and hand care routine.\n\nHowever, it would not be appropriate to enforce such rules for some male employees and not others.

You can revert to the stubble look once you’re on the job and have sussed out the culture of the workplace.) clean-shaven employees. Thus, shaving products are inextricably linked to men's livelihood and survival.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Not every person needs to shave or use antiperspirants. Nearly every woman needs to deal with her period.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Shaving products, antiperspirants, and menstrual products are all similar in that they do not gratify a basic need. Instead, they help people abide by the norms of modern society: look clean shaven, be free of body odor, and keep bodily fluids out of sight, respectively.
1.3.4.2.2.2. Pro: Some major world religions, [such as Sikhism](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/customs/fiveks.shtml)(Kesh - uncut hair\n\nVarious reasons and symbolisms have been put forward for the Sikh practice of keeping hair uncut.\n\n- Throughout history hair \(kesh\) has been regarded as a symbol both of holiness and strength.\n- One's hair is part of God's creation. Keeping hair uncut indicates that one is willing to accept God's gift as God intended it.\n- Uncut hair symbolizes adoption of a simple life, and denial of pride in one's appearance.\n- Not cutting one's hair is a symbol of one's wish to move beyond concerns of the body and attain spiritual maturity.\n- A Sikh should only bow his head to the Guru, and not to a barber.\n- It is a highly visible symbol of membership of the group.\n- It follows the appearance of Guru Gobind Singh, founder of the Khalsa.), forbid shaving.

1.3.4.2.2.4. Pro: Not all people are afflicted with [underarm stench](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-without-underarm-protection/). Nonetheless, their decision to use antiperspirants is motivated by social norms rather than a desire to offset stench caused by perspiration.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Among men, growing a beard can be an indicator of [emotional distress](https://themighty.com/2017/10/beard-shave-depression/), whereas shaving can be a ritual of "[psychological cleansing](https://www.apetogentleman.com/men-with-beards-are-more-miserable/)."

This proves that [shaving is a necessity](https://blog.themancompany.com/shaving-ritual-trend-necessity/)(With spreading of shaving throughout the world, unshaven men of societies became known as “barbarians” meaning the “unbarbered”.), not just a preference.
1.3.4.2.4.1. Con: That something has a long history does not prove it is necessary.
1.3.4.2.4.2. Pro: Not shaving is not an option for most men, as even bearded men need shaving products to ensure that they do not look unkempt.
1.3.4.2.4.3. Pro: Shaving has life-and-death implications. Specifically, men who shave less frequently are at significantly higher risk for [disease mortality](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/157/3/234/71268)(Over the 20-year follow-up period, 835 men \(34.3 percent\) died, of whom 312 died from coronary heart disease and 81 from lung cancer.

For these men, shaving is not optional.
1.3.4.2.5.1. Con: Making all materials required for religious rituals tax-exempt would be too far-reaching as it would include items like wine and incense.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1. Con: In India, items that are considered to be sacred or of religious importance are [tax-exempt](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/puja-items-rudraksh-sacred-thread-kept-in-zero-tax-gst-list-4687812/)(The GST Council on Saturday decided to keep the items used in Puja including Rudraksha, sacred thread and wick, under zero tax.

1.3.4.2.6. Con: Abolishing the tampon tax could set a legal precedent for abolishing taxes on all basic necessities, including shaving products and antiperspirants.
1.3.4.2.7. Con: Both men and women use shaving products and antiperspirants. Thus, unlike the tampon tax, VAT on these products does not penalize only one sex.
1.3.4.2.7.1. Con: Due to gender differences in hormones, men have [more facial hair](https://www.livescience.com/32700-why-do-men-have-facial-hair-but-women-dont.html), which requires shaving products. In contrast, women focus on [upper lip hair removal](https://www.allure.com/story/how-to-remove-upper-lip-hair) and [eyebrow shaping](https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/a9381/eyebrows-through-the-years/), which can be more efficiently achieved without shaving products.

1.3.4.2.8. Con: Hotel rooms provide [toiletry kits](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/in-depth/viewpoint-why-do-hotels-ignore-female-sanitary-needs) that include items for shaving, oral hygiene, and sewing, but not menstruation. This demonstrates that these products are [not regarded](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8174137/Traveller-hotel-quarantine-told-pads-tampons-NOT-essential.html) as necessities.
1.3.4.2.8.1. Con: Whether a hotel chain considers an item essential should not be the measure by which broader society determines what essentials are.

1.3.4.4. Con: To draw conclusions about what "should" be the case based on what "is" the case is a logical fallacy, namely, the [is-ought fallacy](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Is-ought.html).
1.4. Pro: Removing the tampon tax could aid gender equality.
1.4.1. Con: The tampon tax could improve gender equality. For example, tax revenue from the tampon tax could be earmarked specifically for [women's charities.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/autumn-statement-george-osborne-says-tampon-tax-will-fund-womens-charities-a6748241.html)
1.4.1.1. Con: Philanthropy targeting women is a collective societal responsibility. Women should not have to pay the tampon tax to fund this venture.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The funding for men's charities does not come from the taxation of essential products for men.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: In general, governments [do not fund](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/13/federal-government-fund-ngos.asp)(Government funding of NGOs may provoke controversy when public officials and/or constituents differ about the NGO's goals or the purposes of the funding.

Tax revenue-based funding for gender-specific charities could provoke controversy.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: [Most people](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/social-and-lifestyle/givingtuesday-73-of-americans-consider-companies-charitable-work-when-making-a-purchase)(73% of Americans consider companies’ charitable work when making a purchase) are happy to pay for products that support charitable causes. The redirection of the tampon tax into charities should therefore be uncontroversial.
1.4.2. Pro: Removing the tampon tax would help combat period stigma by clarifying that menstruation is a normal part of life.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The charity [Plan International UK](https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/campaign-for-a-period-emoji-gathers-pace-as-20000-people-cast-their-vote)(The poll showed that the stigma surrounding women and their period is stopping them talking about menstruation with the following groups:\n\n- Two thirds of women don’t feel comfortable discussing their period with their dad or male friends.\n\n- More than 1 in 10 women don’t feel comfortable talking about it with their female friends.\n\n- A quarter of women don’t feel comfortable talking about it with their female peers at work.\n\n- Only one third of women would feel happy to speak about it with their female superiors at work.) has revealed that many women and girls are embarrassed to talk about their periods. Abolishing the tampon tax would help to counter this stigma.

1.4.2.2. Pro: Governments should [tax things](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/would-taxes-on-unhealthy-foods-reduce-obesity)(Governments commonly use taxes to make some goods more expensive than others to discourage people from purchasing them. These are called ‘corrective taxes’ because they aim to correct the fact that the market price of a product may not fully reflect all the costs associated with consumption, including any to wider society.) that they would like to discourage. Thus, if governments want women to feel comfortable about using menstrual products, they should not tax them.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: The idea that taxation should be used to discourage people from doing certain things does not guide decision-making. Otherwise, VAT on most products would interpreted as discouragement from buying anything at all.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Governments impose higher taxes on products that are [unhealthy](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/countries-share-examples-of-how-tobacco-tax-policies-create-win-wins-for-development-health-and-revenues)(In 2018 only 38 countries, covering 14% of the global population had sufficiently high tobacco taxes - which means taxing at least 75% of the cost of these health-harming products.

It is a win for population health, revenue and for development.), e.g., cigarettes, to promote public health.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: In countries such as India [pharmaceutical drugs](https://cleartax.in/s/impact-of-gst-rate-on-pharmaceutical-industry) are taxed. Thus, tax rates do not appear to be determined by the prioritization of public welfare.
1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: Tax rates may not be determined based on public welfare, but they are revised based on such considerations. The Indian government scrapped the 12% tampon tax, after activists underscored its contribution to [menstrual and gender inequity](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44912742)(Campaigners argued the tax would make them even more unaffordable in a country where an estimated four out of five women and girls already have no access to items like sanitary pads.\n\nThe news was welcomed by campaigners.\n\nSurbhi Singh, founder of Sachhi Saheli, a menstrual health awareness charity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: "This was a most-awaited and necessary step to help girls and women to stay in school, their jobs, to practise proper menstrual hygiene.\n\n"This will help them to grow, to show their true potential."\n\nPeriods are one of the leading reasons why girls drop out of education in India, while many others are forced to stay at home because they can't access sanitary products.\n\nSome women use cloth or rags - which, if not clean, can increase the risk of infections.).
1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: The tax rate for health insurance in India is [18%](https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/general-info/articles/gst-impact-on-insurance-premium/). For many Indians, this prohibitively [expensive tax rate](https://www.livemint.com/) means spending a sizeable portion of their income or letting go of their healthcare cover.
1.4.2.3. Con: Taxing something does not mean people should be embarrassed about it. [Adult clothing is taxed in many places](https://cubetoronto.com/nova-scotia/is-there-tax-on-baby-clothes-in-nova-scotia/)(Is clothing VAT exempt?\n\nIf you sell adult clothing and accessories then most – if not all – of the products that you will sell are likely to be standard rated for VAT purposes.But if you sell children’s clothes, shoes hats and clothing accessories such as belts then these are zero rated, so that no VAT is added to the selling price.), but that does not mean people should feel ashamed for wearing clothes.
1.4.2.4. Con: [Many people don't understand the complexities of VAT](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=40516)(This study assesses the level of tax education, particularly the level of understanding of VAT law amongst three categories of taxpayers in Nigeria. The data for the study were collected by means of structured questionnaires administered to the respondents. The analysis of results showed that most of the respondents have poor knowledge of VAT law in Nigeria, irrespective of their level of literacy, and that there was no significant difference in the amount of knowledge of VAT law amongst the three groups of respondents used for the study. A suggestion was made of an aggressive and widespread public education on VAT matters that could involve an integration of tax education into the curricula of education in our institutions of higher learning and general public enlightenment through media, and organized workshops for specific groups.), so cutting it on certain items is an ineffective method of making political and cultural statements.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Making tax laws unnecessarily complex can adversely affect the ease of doing business for aspiring entrepreneurs and small businesses, as evidenced by the [aftermath of the introduction](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/unclear-gst-rules-blindside-indian-businesses/article9790463.ece)(The Goods and Services Tax was meant to unify the $2 trillion economy and make it easier for companies to transact across state borders.

For it to work well, we need a common low rate that’s held stable across all categories, as global success cases demonstrate, with only a few exceptions paying more. That would also untangle our inverted duty structures, a pain point in textiles. Unfortunately, over-reliance on indirect taxes has turned Indian GST into a revenue source more than an efficiency enabler. It’ll take an economic upsurge to get the fiscal space needed to fix it. Even so, our GST system must be simplified at the earliest.) in India.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: The tampon tax is famous - [hundreds of thousands](https://www.change.org/p/george-osborne-stop-taxing-periods-period)(This petition made change with 317,896 supporters!) of women signed a petition to remove it in the UK. Even if people don't understand all VAT rules, removing this one would send an important message to women.
1.4.3. Pro: Women are [paid less](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Gender_pay_gap_statistics)(In 2019, women's gross hourly earnings were on average 14.1 % below those of men in the EU.) than men and [pay more](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/relationships/pink-tax-5397/)(The pink tax refers to the trend where women pay more for the same products as men. If you’ve ever comparison-shopped in the deodorant aisle, you may have encountered a strange price disparity. Products like razors, toothbrushes, and even prescription drugs marketed towards women all tend to cost more, for no discernible reason other than the fact that they’re pink. \[...\] Compounded with the fact that women often make less than men, and their overall wealth is just 32 cents to every man’s dollar, their purchasing power is greatly reduced.) for most products. The tampon tax exacerbates this inequity and results in women having less disposable income than men.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In the workplace, race and socio-economic status intersect with gender to create unique forms of menstrual employment discrimination \([pp. 33-73](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/53/1/articles/files/53-1_Johnson.pdf)\).
1.4.3.2. Con: Theoretically, the gender wage gap should not affect women on minimum wage, who are most affected by the tampon tax.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The pay gap is primarily attributable to employer biases in [salary negotiations](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them)(Previous research has found that women are less likely to initiate salary negotiations than men are. But a new study of Australian women found no gender differences in negotiation behavior. Women were just as likely as men were to ask for higher salaries, and men and women were equally likely to report avoiding negotiations if they feared it would hurt their relationship with their boss. It’s possible that women’s behavior is changing; it’s also possible that this study is more accurate, since the dataset is based on real-world behavior, not surveys or lab experiments. The bad news? While women ask just as often as men, women are less likely to get what they ask for.). In contrast, the minimum wage is predefined; therefore, a man and woman who work the same hours would earn the same pay.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: [Minimum wage workers](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/the-gender-pay-gap-stretches-to-minimum-wage-workers-too) are not immune to the gender pay gap.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Con: In theory, the gender pay gap cannot exist among minimum wage workers as each employee is entitled to the [same amount per hour](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2020/home.htm). Any disparity in total pay is attributable to extraneous factors, such as number of hours worked.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Pro: Minimum wages are [lower](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/the-gender-pay-gap-stretches-to-minimum-wage-workers-too)(In fact, minimum wages are systematically lower in jobs more commonly held by women. For example, minimum wage workers in the health care sector earn substantially less than similarly skilled minimum wage workers in road transportation.\n\nThe higher the male share of employment in an occupation or industry, the higher the wages for both men and women. The gender wage gap among minimum wage earners could be reduced if it was neutral with respect to the gender composition of occupations and industries.) for jobs more commonly held by low skilled women, such as healthcare workers, as opposed to jobs more commonly held by low skilled men, such as road transportation.
1.4.3.2.2.3. Pro: In [Australia](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/the-gender-pay-gap-stretches-to-minimum-wage-workers-too)(Debate around gender pay gap often gravitates towards the higher-wage end of the labour market but it misses the employees at the other end of the pay spectrum – those who receive the legal minimum wage for their job. It’s the gender pay gap among these low-wage workers we should be most concerned about.\n\n\[...\]\n\nIndeed, according to data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia \(HILDA\) Survey, women on a minimum wage earn roughly 10% less per hour than men on the minimum rate. While the minimum wage gap is smaller than the 19% gap among those paid above the minimum wage, it is still sizeable.\n\nMoreover, the gender wage gap among award-reliant employees can’t be explained by differences between men and women in their skills and abilities.), "women on a minimum wage earn roughly 10% less per hour than men on the minimum rate."
1.4.3.3. Pro: Most men do not have to spend their own money on menstrual products, contributing to their significantly [higher disposable income levels](https://www.vouchercodes.co.uk/press/release/feeling-flush-the-average-brit-has-426-disposable-income-a-month-453.html)(The study also revealed that the gender gap is widening in terms of how much women have left to spend each month versus men. Women now have an estimated average of £369 left in disposable income each month compared to men’s £487, widening the gap by 48 per cent on 2015’s totals of £332 and £412 respectively. The study found that the average woman sets aside a larger proportion of their monthly income to bills and utilities, including the cost of childcare, carving out an estimated 23 per cent of their monthly budget for this compared to men, who set aside 20 per cent.). It is already unfair that women have to pay for menstrual products and even more unjust that they are taxed for it.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.4.5. Pro: Tampons were classed as "[luxury items](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/08/europe/tampon-tax-germany-luxury-item-grm-intl/index.html)(What do wine, cigarettes and tampons have in common? They're all classed as "luxury goods" in Germany and taxed at the highest possible rate.)" by patriarchal governments with little to no consultation of women. Removing the tampon tax would signal a willingness to centre women in discussions that affect them.

Denmark, Sweden and Norway aren't far behind with standard VAT of 25 percent.)\).
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Despite having a 25% tampon tax, Denmark is the best [country in the world for women to live in](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/denmark-named-the-world-s-best-country-for-women-to-live-in-a6824456.html)(Denmark is the best country in the world for women to live in, according to a new report.\n\nThe US News and World Report survey contains the views of 7,000 women, who were asked to score countries on five attributes - including gender equality, income equality, safety and its progressiveness.\n\nThe aim of the list revised by brand strategy firm BAV Consulting and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was to “gauge global perceptions of the world’s biggest economies in terms of specific attributes associated with countries”.).
1.4.5.1.2. Con: That some of the world’s most gender-equal countries have tampon taxes is not proof that the tax is a necessary part of a progressive society.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Men still have [many](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.teenvogue.com/story/common-questions-guys-have-about-periods-answered/amp)(Whether it’s because they’ve never been interested, are too scared to ask, or simply don’t think it’s information they need, many men are mostly clueless when it comes to the way a woman’s body works.

The coroner is called in. This doesn’t look good.\n\nWhat exactly did that janitor find in the girls’ bathroom? A used menstrual pad.\n\nOf course, he didn’t realize that’s what it was at first.

1.4.5.3. Pro: Items that are neither essential nor life-sustaining are taxed at lower rates than tampons.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Many countries [don't tax menstrual products](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/tampon-tax-explained-definition-facts-statistics/)(Other countries that have made menstrual products tax-free include Kenya, Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Tanzania, Lebanon, Malaysia, Colombia, South Africa, Namibia, and Rwanda.).
1.4.5.3.2. Con: "Essential" is subject to interpretation. Books can be considered essential for knowledge and skill acquisition, which benefits the economy, whereas Viagra is essential for optimal sexual functioning and reproduction.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: Many jurisdictions, including several [US states](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/jan/22/ashley-judd/are-pads-and-tampons-taxed-viagra-and-rogaine-not/)(Five states \(Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon\) have no sales tax at all.

1.4.5.3.3.1. Con: Viagra is a [medicine](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/sildenafil-viagra/)(Sildenafil is a medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction.\n\n\[...\]\n\nSildenafil is also sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension \(high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs\).) that helps people with a specific problem. It being exempt from VAT is no more unfair than the tax-exempt status of any other medicine.
1.4.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: Due to social norms regarding the sexual prowess of men, sexual problems like [erectile dsyfunction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746995/) trigger adverse psychological responses, including [suicidal ideation](https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/impotence-driving-indians-towards-suicide-982074-2017-06-11). A product that alleviates such problems should not be taxed.
1.4.5.3.3.1.2. Con: Erectile dysfunction is often caused by [psychological problems](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/psychological). Imposing a high tax rate for purchases without a prescription would incentivize men to seek professional help and identify the root cause of their sexual problems, rather than self-medicate to the detriment of their psychosexual well-being.
1.4.5.3.3.2. Pro: Viagra helps men have sex, which is optional. Unless they artificially stop their periods, people do not choose to menstruate.
1.4.5.3.4. Pro: [Superyachts](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/In-detail/Rules-for-specific-transactions/International-transactions/GST-free-sales-and-purchases-of-new-recreational-boats/)(You can sell or purchase a new recreational boat GST-free if it is exported from Australia within 12 months.) and [caviar](http://www.marcusward.co/some-odd-vat-facts/) are exempt from tax in some countries. If superyachts and caviar are not luxuries, it is impossible to argue that tampons are.
1.4.5.3.5. Con: VAT rules are [notoriously complex](https://www.vatglobal.com/global-vat-the-most-dominant-and-complex-of-taxes/)(In theory, VAT is simple. The principles are easy enough to understand. There is broad agreement on how to regulate and collect VAT. If you know how VAT works in one country, you have a pretty good idea of how it works everywhere else. \n\nOr not. The European Commission’s report on the VAT GAP forecasted the loss of VAT revenue to be €164 billion in 2020. So not everyone is being VAT-savvy. \n\nAnd VAT is everywhere. It’s the world’s largest source of consumption tax. Over 160 countries have adopted VAT. You pay VAT when you buy milk at the corner shop. And VAT needs to be accounted for when a contractor hires an engineering firm to perform a multimillion Euro project. \n\nAt the same time, VAT is extremely complex. Think of it as the complexity of small differences. Each country has subtly different VAT compliance requirements. Keeping track of those subtleties is extremely difficult. But failing to keep track of them can seriously harm your business.) and do not necessarily align with whether an item is necessary. Comparisons of exemptions often only prove the messiness of the development of VAT, not some broader ethical point about state priorities.
1.4.5.3.6. Pro: In Germany, books are charged a lower rate of tax than tampons. One feminist group has [started selling tampons inside books](https://www.creativeboom.com/features/the-creative-team-railing-against-the-tampon-tax-by-hiding-sanitary-products-in-a-beautifully-illustrated-book/)(Stuttgart-based startup The Female Company, founded by Ann-Sophie Claus und Sinja Stadelmaie, is making a stand against it in a cute, playful way with its new publication The Tampon Book.\n\n"Periods are no luxury," they quite rightly point out. "Why tax them as if they were? Caviar, Truffles and even oil paintings – in Germany many luxury goods are taxed with the reduced rate of only 7%, while tampons and other female sanitary products attract the top value-added tax rate of 19%."\n\nThe book solution was deliberate: "Books are taxed at the reduced rate of just 7%." So, they sell their organic tampons hidden inside a book, "thus avoiding the sexist tampon tax".) to avoid the tampon tax.
1.4.5.4. Pro: As recently as 2015, British Members of Parliament tried to have a discussion on the tampon tax without [saying the word "tampon"](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/10/27/stella-creasy-tampon-tax-bill-cash_n_8396726.html)(A veteran MP was met with raucous cheers as he finally used the word 'tampon' in the House of Commons last night.\n\nBill Cash, the Tory MP for Stone, was called out after he repeatedly said "products" instead of "tampons", during a heated debate over attempts to axe the 5% VAT 'tampon tax' and was heckled by Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy.\n\nExpressing his support for removing the tax, 75-year-old Cash seemed to be avoiding referring to the female sanitary items by name, after he said "products" several times.). This shows a fundamental disconnect between the mostly-male government and their understanding of tampons' necessity.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Hesitation to use the word "tampon" does not necessarily stem from misogyny; 75-year-old Cash belonged to a different era, during which speaking about bodily functions and related products may have been regarded as [immodest](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540261.2018.1436655?journalCode=iirp20)(Neither psychiatrists nor anthropologists have dedicated a great deal of attention to modesty in the elderly, perhaps because it is taken for granted that there is a natural and cultural need for old men to behave modestly, otherwise the penalty is modesty illico et immediate; but is this perhaps true only true for sexuality ‘without reproduction’?).
1.4.5.4.2. Con: Many women are [uncomfortable with men talking about menstruation](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/men-talk-about-periods/411931/)(A few months ago, during a weekend with my boyfriend’s family, his sister asked us to pick her up some tampons when we went on a grocery run. When I grabbed a box with cardboard applicators, my boyfriend all but knocked it out of my hands.\n\n“Those are like sandpaper,” he said. “Get the nice ones.”\n\nIn a weird way, it’s a sweet story. Here’s a guy who a\) cares about his sister, and b\) is mature enough to acknowledge that his sister has a vagina without making a fuss about it.\n\nBut also, here’s what I hate: that I still felt the need to preface that with in a weird way. Yes, his sister’s vagina is, conceptually, an awkward combination of words. But on the other hand, why should he care about her discomfort any less just because it happens to be in that part of her anatomy? And why, in a story about a man and a woman and a box of tampons, is the woman the one who can’t be a grownup about it?). It is unsurprising that some men are hesitant to talk about menstruation in public.
1.4.5.4.3. Pro: Many legislatures have serious problems with sexism \([p. 432](http://mlkrook.org/pdf/Collier_Raney_18.pdf)(The widespread problem of sexual harassment has made headlines around the world, including in political legislatures. Using public accounts of sexism and sexual harassment, we highlight the longstanding pervasiveness of these problems in three countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Although sexual harassment is a global issue, our aim is to show how the shared rules, practices, and norms of these Westminster institutions perpetuate sexist cultures that produce unequal and unsafe work conditions for female politicians. The findings highlight some of the unique challenges female politicians face in their representational and policy-making roles across legislative settings.)\). These people cannot be counted on to promote women's rights on all issues, let alone menstrual equity.
1.4.5.5. Con: Until the 5% tax was abandoned in [January 2021](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55502252)(The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the "tampon tax" - will be abolished in the UK from 1 January.\n\nEU law required members to tax tampons and sanitary towels at 5%, treating period products as non-essential.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak committed to scrapping the tax in his March Budget.\n\nCampaigners welcomed the end to what they called a "sexist tax" with activist Laura Coryton saying it was "about ending a symptom of sexism".\n\nThe UK was able to get rid of the tax now because it is no longer subject to European Union rules on sanitary products.), menstrual products were taxed at the same rate as many other essential and healthcare products in the UK. This demonstrates that the tampon tax was not the product of anti-women sentiments.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: The tax rate for menstrual products was reduced to 5% only in 2001, in response to a motion to abolish the tampon tax by the then-MP [Christine McCafferty](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/socialpolicy/2021/03/26/a-stain-on-equality-the-uks-refusal-to-remove-tax-from-period-underwear/)(MP Christine McCafferty tabled an Early Day Motion to abolish the ‘tampon tax’ in 1999. That effort only partially succeeded: it prompted Gordon Brown to reduce the tax from 17.5% to 5% in 2001. In 2015, Chancellor George Osborne announced that whilst the tax could not be scrapped \(due to EU laws\), its revenue would fund women’s organisations through the Tampon Tax fund.) in 1999. Prior to this revision, the applicable tax rate was 17.5%.
1.4.5.6. Con: The UK government, which is [predominantly male](http://www.ukpolitical.info/female-members-of-parliament.htm), [repealed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55502252)(The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the "tampon tax" - will be abolished in the UK from 1 January.\n\nEU law required members to tax tampons and sanitary towels at 5%, treating period products as non-essential.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak committed to scrapping the tax in his March Budget.\n\nCampaigners welcomed the end to what they called a "sexist tax" with activist Laura Coryton saying it was "about ending a symptom of sexism".\n\nThe UK was able to get rid of the tax now because it is no longer subject to European Union rules on sanitary products.) the tampon tax.
1.4.5.6.1. Con: Modern politicians wanting to repeal the tampon tax does not mean that the politicians who put the tax in place made it with women's needs in mind.
1.4.5.6.2. Con: The UK government only did this under [heavy pressure from feminist lobbying groups](https://www.change.org/p/george-osborne-stop-taxing-periods-period)(Stop taxing periods. Period. #EndTamponTax\n\n\[...\]\n\nVictory\nThis petition made change with 317,900 supporters!) and after Scotland's \(female-led\) government [made menstrual products free](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51629880)(Scotland has become the first country in the world to make period products free for all.\n\nMSPs unanimously approved the Period Products \(Free Provision\) \(Scotland\) Bill on Tuesday.\n\nThere is now a legal duty on local authorities to ensure that free items such as tampons and sanitary pads are available to "anyone who needs them".).
1.4.5.6.3. Pro: British prime ministers since 2015 [have vocally supported repealing the tampon tax](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/26/david-cameron-faces-possible-commons-defeat-on-tampon-tax)(Cameron has argued that the EU sets the rules and it would be difficult to get them overturned.\n\nDuring the election campaign, he said: “I wish we could get rid of this … There’s a problem with getting rid of VAT on certain individual issues because of the way this tax is regulated and set in Europe.”), but have been bound by EU legislation that kept it at 5%.
