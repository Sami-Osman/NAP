Discussion Name: Who should Joe Biden choose as his running mate?

1. Who should Joe Biden choose as his running mate?
1.1. [Elizabeth Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren).
1.1.1. Pro: Choosing Elizabeth Warren could help Joe Biden secure support from leftist voters.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Elizabeth Warren's [political leanings](http://Choosing Elizabeth Warren could help Joe Biden secure support from leftist voters.​) are closer to the left, which makes her an attractive choice for voters who currently prefer Bernie Sanders to Joe Biden.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Many [Biden allies](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/487897-biden-allies-see-warren-as-potential-running-mate) considers Warren as the best way to unite the progressive left and centrist wings of the Democratic Party.
1.1.1.3. Con: Providing an ideological balance is less important than [securing states](https://www.newsweek.com/bidens-running-mate-needs-win-him-entire-state-not-just-constituency-opinion-1493747) which Biden isn't expecting to win.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Biden previously recommended Warren to other candidates for gathering leftist support. There is no reason that he shouldn't do the same.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Joe Biden recommended Elizabeth Warren as a running mate for Hillary Clinton during the [2016 election](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-223104), after having previously considered Warren as his running mate before cutting his campaign short. This is because he believed choosing Warren would help gather support from the left.
1.1.1.5. Con: By deliberately appealing to leftist voters, Biden risks alienating the politically unaffiliated towards the right.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: There are number of [swing states](https://www.270towin.com/) that Biden or Trump must win to secure the presidency.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Those who do not have strong political convictions are less likely to support policies radically on either side of the political spectrum.
1.1.1.5.3. Con: Those who lean right are more likely to support Trump, and therefore Biden should focus his energy on unaffiliated voters who lean left.
1.1.1.5.3.1. Con: If Biden were to ignore the right of the political spectrum, he reduces the chance of acquiring the vote of a large chunk of the population.
1.1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: According to one poll, in [2019](https://news.gallup.com/poll/275792/remained-center-right-ideologically-2019.aspx), 37% of Americans identified as conservative, 35% as moderate and 24% as liberal.
1.1.2. Con: Becoming Vice President would boost Warren's chances of being elected in 2024. Choosing Warren as his VP could therefore hurt Biden's chances of securing a 2nd term.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Given that the Vice Presidency is a much more publically visible position, Warren would likely become much more recognizable among the American populace working as the Vice President.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Being Vice President for 4 years would give Warren a lot of government experience and merits.
1.1.2.3. Con: Even if Warren does become Vice President, this does not guarantee she will perform well in the role. Thus, this could hurt her chances of being elected in the 2024 election.
1.1.2.4. Con: Biden has [signalled](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129) both publicly and to his aides that he would only serve a single term as a ["transition candidate"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-pick.html).
1.1.3. Pro: Warren is the most popular choice for Vice President according to a [poll](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/elizabeth-warren-the-clear-choice-for-bidens-vp-poll).
1.1.3.1. Con: The [sample size](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/bfiid7tfh3/econTabReport.pdf) in this poll was just 1500. Therefore, it may not be representative. \(p. 154\)
1.1.4. Con: Democrats would lose a seat in the Senate if Warren becomes Joe Biden's Vice President.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Warren would have to leave her [seat](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/democratic-primary-results-biden-sanders-young-voters.html) in the senate if she became Vice President. This seat would then likely be lost for the Democrats, as her seat is in a state run by a Republican governor who would choose the replacement.
1.1.5. Pro: Biden and Warren are well suited to hold one another accountable.
1.1.5.1. Pro: The President and the Vice President are the two most powerful political positions in the United States. Thus, it is crucial that those who occupy these positions are able to check the power of each other.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: The [Vice President](https://www.vox.com/2016/12/27/14028424/powerful-jobs-people-trump-administration) lacks formal powers. The result is that any influence a Vice President has is dependent on the President.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Often, one of the roles of the Vice President is to [advise the President](https://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-what-the-us-vice-president-actually-does-2016-5?r=US&IR=T) on key political issues.
1.1.5.2. Pro: The [longstanding rivalry](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/12/biden-vs-warren-2020-democratic-primaries-bankruptcy-bill-225728) between Biden and Warren will encourage them to challenge each others ideas.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Their long-standing rivalry could become a distraction that detracts from running the country effectively.
1.1.5.3. Con: If Warren and Biden are most concerned about holding one another accountable for their actions, it may disrupt their ability to cooperate.
1.1.6. Con: She would be 71 years old on the date of inauguration. Since Joe Biden is already 77 years old, he ought to choose someone significantly younger than him to balance the ticket.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Biden is already struggling to [appeal](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democrats-sound-alarm-about-joe-biden-s-young-voter-problem-n1163296) to young voters. Choosing an older candidate rather than someone younger who can better relate to young voters would significantly hurt Biden's chances of being elected.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Elizabeth Warren was quite [popular](https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2019-11-05/elizabeth-warren-surges-among-young-voters) among young voters during her campaign, second only to Sanders. This indicates that age of the candidate is less relevant when it comes to attracting young voters.
1.1.7. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has government experience, which makes it likely that she will be able to provide politically smart advice.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Warren has experience in handling economic crises, which could prove invaluable as the [economic crisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52236936) takes hold.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Warren [chaired](https://today.law.harvard.edu/warren-appointed-to-congressional-panel-overseeing-treasurys-economic-bailout-plan/) the [Congressional Oversight Panel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/congressionaloversightpanel.asp), which was created to monitor the $700 billion bank bailout.
1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Warren is credited with [saving the taxpayer $1 billion](https://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/how_elizabeth_warren_saved_taxpayers_1_billion/) by scrutinising the Treasury's bailout process, including ensuring it was not influenced by banks' political connections.
1.1.7.1.2. Pro: Warren helped design the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/) as part of the [Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp) introduced by the Obama administration in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: The prospective Vice President should not be chosen based on their suitability to govern during a temporary crisis.
1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: The Coronavirus could change the economy in the long-term or even permanently.
1.1.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: With 80% of Americans lacking a financial buffer against the effects of the Coronavirus, the [inequality gap](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-effect-economy-life-society-analysis-covid-135579#econ) could widen and many households could plunge further into poverty.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Warren has been serving as the senior United States senator from [Massachusetts since 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren).
1.1.7.3. Con: Warren's government experience in one state does not make her politically informed to provide the best advice for the entire country.
1.1.8. Con: Biden and Warren might not be able to reconcile on important policy matters.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Biden and Warren disagree over [Medicare for All](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-healthcare-factbox/where-democratic-presidential-candidates-stand-on-medicare-for-all-idUKKBN1ZU1EX).
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Biden has strongly dismissed Medicare for All by saying that [he would veto it](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/biden-says-he-wouldd-veto-medicare-for-all-as-coronavirus-focuses-attention-on-health.html) if it were passed.
1.1.8.1.2. Con: Warren [only paid lip service](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/12/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders-public-option) to the policy of Medicare for All; this is unlikely to be an irreconcilable difference between them.
1.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: [Warren's health care plan](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/12/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders-public-option) involved delaying Medicare for All for three years while pushing for a publicly run health care plan that would compete against private insurers.
1.1.8.1.3. Pro: During a debate in 2019, Warren [denounced insurance companies](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/30/elizabeth-warrens-inconvenient-truths-227490) and for-profit hospitals for causing immense suffering and injustice. By contrast, Biden [panders to the health care industry](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/09/health-care-joe-biden-medicare-for-all).
1.1.8.1.3.1. Pro: Indicative of this, Biden had received [twice as many contributions](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/07/20dems-are-taking-money-healthcare/) from the health care industry as Warren as of July 2019.
1.1.8.2. Con: As President, Biden would have the final say so disagreements between him and his Vice President would never truly be irreconcilable.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: Even though the President could override the Vice President, doing so would likely undermine their professional relationship.
1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: There is no justifiable reason for the President overruling the Vice President to undermine their professional relationship; if Warren were to insist on having equal power, then she would be subverting the Constitutional rules differentiating their roles. There is nothing to suggest Warren wants to disrupt these.
1.1.8.2.1.2. Con: Having been Vice President in the Obama administration, Biden has likely learned how to navigate the subtleties of the relationship between the President and Vice President.
1.1.8.3. Pro: Biden and Warren have strong disagreements over [bankruptcy laws](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/6/18518381/baccpa-bankruptcy-bill-2005-biden-warren).
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: Their disagreements over bankruptcy laws are indicative of their [contrasting world views about the economy](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/6/18518381/baccpa-bankruptcy-bill-2005-biden-warren).
1.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely that Warren will be prepared to compromise on economic policy given that it was her views on this that originally [inspired her to enter politics](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/6/18518381/baccpa-bankruptcy-bill-2005-biden-warren).
1.1.8.3.1.1.1. Con: Compromising on economic policy in exchange for securing a more senior political position is a worthy trade off for Warren.
1.1.8.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Even though such a trade-off can be rationalised like this, it does not follow that Warren will be able to do so. This is because after so many years fighting for her economic principles, she may now be too emotionally invested in them.
1.1.9. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has provided many favors to Biden in the primaries. This means that Warren is more than willing to put in all her efforts to ensure that Biden wins.
1.1.9.1. Con: The fact that Warren has previously provided Biden with many favors may make her feel entitled to call in return favors from Biden once in office. This could undermine Biden's presidential leadership.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely that favors are given for nothing in politics.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Warren [incinerated Mike Bloomberg](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256), who then [dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8074295/Democrats-tell-Mike-Bloomberg-Elizabeth-Warren-quit-Joe-Bidens-dramatic-comeback.html).
1.1.9.3. Pro: Warren has [declined to endorse Bernie Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-endorsement-bernie-sanders.html), which will prove to be beneficial for Biden.
1.2. [Val Demings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Demings).
1.2.1. Pro: Val Demings was selected as one of the [impeachment managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Demings#U.S._House_of_Representatives) for the trial against Trump. This experience could be helpful for running against Trump.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Her [information](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/guest-commentary/os-op-val-demings-why-we-impeached-trump-20200303-664d7b3u5bdedbnpvgqri24q5q-story.html) as part of the impeachment trial can help defeat Trump in debates and make him speechless.
1.2.2. Pro: Val Demings has been very successful in her previous political campaigns.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Val Demings is one of only three Democrats to have won a seat as the [representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Demings#Political_career) of Florida's 10th congressional district.
1.2.3. Con: Val Demings' [problematic record as Orlando's Police Chief](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/val-demings-5-things-to-know-about-bidens-possible-democratic-vp-contender) would likely be brought up, which might make her unpopular with voters.
1.2.3.1. Pro: While Demings was Police Chief, there were numerous [complaints of excessive use of force](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/orlando-police-complaints-in-the-spotlight-as-african-american-ex-chief-runs-for-congress/443526/) by the Orlando Police Department.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Police brutality and distrust are likely a real concern for many voters in America.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Fatal police brutality is one of the [leading causes of death in young men](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/14/20803872/police-violence-mortality-public-health-black-men-rutgers) in America.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Police brutality is closely associated with [racial issues](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/08/police-officer-shootings-gun-violence-racial-bias-crime-data/595528/), which have become a prominent part of public discourse in recent years.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Con: Trust is being restored and relationships repaired between police departments and their communities in the United States.
1.2.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Police brutality in American has [declined in recent years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/fatal-police-shootings-of-unarmed-people-have-significantly-declined-experts-say/2018/05/03/d5eab374-4349-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html), resulting in many Americans [restoring their trust](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/repairing-relationship-between-community-and-police-starts-with-building-trust/103-86f98ba8-da90-4822-be22-43801135756c) in the police.
1.2.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Many police departments are [working closely](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/repairing-relationship-between-community-and-police-starts-with-building-trust/103-86f98ba8-da90-4822-be22-43801135756c) with their communities to restore trust and repair relationships.
1.2.3.1.1.3.3. Con: Even if relationships are improving, it doesn't follow that communities have forgotten about the harms caused by police brutality. As such, they may still attach importance to Demings being part of the problem.
1.2.3.1.1.4. Con: For African American voters, gun violence is a [more serious problem](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/black-voters-gun-violence-police-misconduct-poll) than police misconduct or brutality.
1.2.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: The results of a poll [indicated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/black-voters-gun-violence-police-misconduct-poll) that 80% of African American voters described gun violence as an “extremely serious” problem, compared with only 50% for police misconduct.
1.2.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: In a [survey](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2816673-Communities-of-Color-Survey-Results.html), a majority of African American voters believed that most police officers are professionals who do the right thing, and that only a few “bad apple” officers who discriminate based on race.
1.2.3.1.1.5. Con: Only [24%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/black-voters-gun-violence-police-misconduct-poll) of Latino voters view police misconduct as an “extremely serious” problem in America.
1.2.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Since there are [60 million Latinos](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/08/u-s-hispanic-population-reached-new-high-in-2018-but-growth-has-slowed/) in the US, accounting for nearly 20% of the total US population, 24% of Latino voters is still a huge percentage of the electorate.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: These complaints have [not stopped](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/orlando-police-complaints-in-the-spotlight-as-african-american-ex-chief-runs-for-congress/443526/) Demings from holding other important government positions. It is unlikely that they will be a problem now.
1.2.3.2. Con: Demings' record as Orlando Police Chief is very positive.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Violent crime](https://demings.house.gov/sites/demings.house.gov/files/documents/Rep.%20Val%20B.%20Demings%20-%20BIO.pdf) in Orlando reduced by 40% while Demings was Police Chief. \(p. 1\)
1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Demings occupying the role of Orlando Police Chief does not equate to her being the reason behind performance improvements.
1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: In a [hierarchical organizational structure](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-management/chapter/management-levels-and-types/), it is likely that the person at the top played some role in improving outcomes. This may occur through indirect means, such as hiring someone, who hired another team member that managed to elevate performance.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Demings steered the Orlando Police Department through the [financial crisis](https://demings.house.gov/sites/demings.house.gov/files/documents/Rep.%20Val%20B.%20Demings%20-%20BIO.pdf), managing to keep the same number of officers on the streets despite budgetary constraints. \(p. 1\)
1.3. [Keisha Lance Bottoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisha_Lance_Bottoms).
1.3.1. Pro: Mayor Bottoms have shown consistent support for Joe Biden's campaign, [endorsing](https://apnews.com/5774a8bf4f0944428be1489cfd80a424) him as early as June 2019.
1.3.2. Pro: While Bottoms is less well-known than many other potential VPs, picking her as running mate would mean there's no risk of her out staging Biden during the campaign.
1.3.2.1. Con: Even if Bottoms is less-well-known than many other potential VPs, her performance on the campaign trail could result in her out staging Biden during the campaign.
1.3.3. Con: Mayor Bottoms has previously been [investigated](https://www.kialo.com/keisha-lance-bottoms-34796.146?path=34796.0~34796.146&active=~34796.146&action=new-con) for improper use of funds, which could reflect poorly on Biden's campaign should he pick her as a running mate.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Bottoms being investigated for political corruption could further Trump's [narrative](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/482065-the-iowa-caucus-debacle-plays-right-into-trumps-swamp-narrative) that the democratic establishment is corrupt.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: During Trump gained popularity during his successful 2016 presidential [campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign#Results) through his platform of '[Draining the Swamp](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/10/18/donald-trump-rally-colorado-springs-ethics-lobbying-limitations/92377656/)', which suggests that a lot of his supporters considers political corruption a big problem in the US.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Just after becoming elected mayor, she [secured jobs](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/city-funds-used-pay-mayor-bottoms-campaign-workers/Es4yzBYu2udAx1hHt83Z1L/) for her campaign staffers in a way that some considered improper.
1.3.3.3. Con: She was not legally accused or charged with anything in a court of law. Thus, it is unlikely that this will be held against her or Biden.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Given that Bottoms was not found guilty for improper use of funds, any attempt to use this against her or Biden during a campaign is likely to be viewed as slander.
1.4. [Tammy Duckworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth).
1.4.1. Pro: Tammy Duckworth is likely to be perceived as a patriotic Vice Presidential nominee.
1.4.1.1. Con: Patriotism means [different things](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/opinions/letters_to_editor/patriotism-means-different-thing-to-different-people/article_6ee24d01-9166-53d6-9e01-9d7251d0f7a3.html) to different people, so it is unlikely that her patriotism will appeal to majority of Americans.
1.4.1.2. Pro: As a former lieutenant colonel who [sustained injuries in the Iraq War](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256), Duckworth personifies US patriotism.
1.4.2. Con: Duckworth's embarrassing past might hurt Biden's chances of winning.
1.4.2.1. Pro: During her bid for Senate in 2016, Duckworth has to [settle an embarrassing lawsuit](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256) accusing her of workplace retaliation when she led Illinois’ Department of Veterans Affairs.
1.4.3. Pro: Duckworth has been [publicly endorsed ​by a contingent of Bay Area donors](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/12/tammy-duckworth-vp-contention-357234), which might help pool in campaign resources for Biden's run.
1.5. [Michelle Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama).
1.5.1. Pro: To win, Biden would need the voter base to [turn out in large numbers](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/) this November. Michelle Obama can help secure such a turnout based on her popularity.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Michelle Obama has a powerful national and international presence, which can help garner additional support for Biden.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Michelle Obama has [regularly ranked](https://time.com/5489158/michelle-obama-most-admired-woman/) as one of the most admired women in America. Running alongside her might help Biden secure more votes among people who admire Michelle.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: According to a 2019 study conducted by [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/international/articles-reports/2019/07/18/2019-worlds-most-admired), Michelle Obama is the most admired woman in the world.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: Michelle Obama's reputation is based on [community work](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/first-lady-michelle-obama), not political experience. Even if this reputation wins Biden the election, her experience would not be helpful in running the government.
1.5.1.2. Pro: A poll by Stanford’s Hoover Institution [indicated](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/) that a majority of respondents \(31%\) expressed the desire for Michelle Obama to run as VP.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: This percentage of support for Michelle Obama bypassed all other VP choices [to a large degree](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/): Kamala Harris \(19%\), Amy Klobuchar \(18%\) and Stacy Abrams \(13%\) among others.
1.5.1.3. Con: Michelle Obama could probably increase voter turnout for Biden without being his official running mate.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Michelle Obama could rally supporters by appearing at Biden's rallies, press conferences, and other high-profile events leading up to the elections.
1.5.1.3.2. Con: Even if Michelle Obama could increase voter turnout for Biden without being his official running mate, it is likely that voter turnout for Biden would be comparatively higher if she were to be officially running alongside him.
1.5.2. Con: Michelle Obama is [unwilling](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/) to even to pretend to be friendly with people with whom she has disagreements with.
1.5.2.1. Con: A political leader that is willing to stand up for what they believe in is not an undesirable quality.
1.5.2.2. Pro: If Michelle Obama is unwilling to be friendly with people she disagrees with, this may negatively impact her ability to reach compromises.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Given that Biden has the [same reputation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/19/joe-biden-segregationist-senators-criticism), he might end up facing losses among influential politicians.
1.5.2.4. Con: This characteristic may allow her to drive radical change in American politics.
1.5.3. Con: Without a real track record in official politics, it is unclear how well Michelle Obama would fare as the Vice President of the US.
1.5.3.1. Con: Given that Donald Trump had no political track record prior to winning the Presidency in 2016, many Americans may not attach much importance to Michelle Obama's lack of experience either.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Michelle Obama is on the opposite end of the political spectrum to Donald Trump, so this comparison is misguided.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Michelle Obama has been extremely critical of Donald Trump's views and remarks about [immigrants](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/michelle-obama-trump-its-our-america-861610/).
1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: Michelle Obama described [Donald Trump's inauguration](https://www.businessinsider.com/michelle-obama-trump-inauguration-a-lot-emotionally-2019-7?r=US&IR=T) as a deeply unsettling day for US politics.
1.5.3.1.1.3. Pro: As the wife of a former Democratic president, Michelle Obama is likely to be politically at odds with an alt-right Republican president.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Donald Trump’s election showed that [experience doesn’t matter](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256) to many voters.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Although lack of experience may not matter to voters, it may still result in [incompetence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster).
1.5.3.2. Con: Although Michelle Obama has never been an elected official, her career path has still provided her with first-hand experience in politics.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: In the 1990s, Michelle Obama worked as an [assistant to Chicago's then mayor](https://www.history.com/topics/first-ladies/michelle-obama), Richard Daley.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: Michelle Obama was a successful [campaign aide](https://www.history.com/topics/first-ladies/michelle-obama) for Barack Obama when he was running for Illinois state senator in 1996.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Individuals that have been politicians during their entire professional career are the most experienced and are thus the most equipped to hold political positions of the highest esteem.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Michelle Obama was originally a [lawyer](https://www.biography.com/us-first-lady/michelle-obama) when she left college. Thus, she has not been a politician throughout her career.
1.5.4. Con: Due to Michelle Obama's personal connection with Barack Obama, voters who do not perceive Barack Obama in a favorable way are likely to have a biased stance against Michelle Obama.
1.5.4.1. Pro: It is likely that those with grievances against Barack Obama will hold Michelle Obama equally responsible due to her active role as [First Lady](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/first-lady-michelle-obama) in the Obama administration.
1.5.5. Con: She has already stated that she [doesn't want to be Vice President](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/27/opinion/michelle-obama-doesnt-want-be-vice-president-get-over-it/).
1.5.5.1. Pro: When Michelle appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live in [2018](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/), she said she wasn’t a candidate for office: “I’ve never had any serious conversations with anyone about it because it’s not something I’m interested in or would ever do. Ever.”
1.5.5.2. Con: There are strong incentives for Michelle to run as Biden's VP.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: Preventing Trump from securing a 2nd term is in Michelle Obama's interest, as there's a risk that he would finish [dismantling the legacy](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/) of the Obama presidency should Trump be reelected.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Pro: Michelle's large [popularity](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/) could be a solid factor in helping the Democrats secure the Presidency.
1.5.6. Pro: Joe Biden's great [relations](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-barack-obama-held-party-women-their-families-graduating-2019-6?r=US&IR=T) with the Obama family mean he has a good chance of convincing Michelle to run with him as his VP.
1.5.6.1. Con: The fact that Obama hasn't [endorsed](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-dog-that-didnt-bark/) Joe Biden during the democratic primaries implies that their relationship isn't strong enough for Biden to utilize to advance his own political interests.
1.5.6.2. Con: Whether Biden is able to convince Michelle to run with him as his VP or not, does not mean it would be a good decision to do so.
1.5.6.3. Pro: His relation with Barack Obama is good enough that he [consults](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/decision-2020/biden-has-talked-with-obama-about-possible-vice-presidential-pick/2339449/) him about whom to pick for Vice President.
1.6. [Gretchen Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer).
1.6.1. Pro: Whitmer has a positive and strong national profile.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Gretchen Whitmer [delivered](https://www.mlive.com/news/2020/02/michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer-hits-back-on-trumps-economic-message-in-state-of-the-union-response.html) the [Democratic response](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-05/michigan-gov-whitmer-endorses-biden-days-before-primary) to Trump's State of the Union address.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Whitmer is at the forefront of issues that have gained national attention, such as [banning flavored vapes](https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/michigan-becomes-first-state-to-ban-flavored-e-cigarettes.html).
1.6.2. Pro: Gretchen Whitmer can help secure a victory for Joe Biden in [Michigan](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/03/gretchen-whitmer-to-give-michigan-a-voice-in-joe-biden-campaign-strategy.html), a state that is a [crucial battleground](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/16/whitmer-biden-pledge-female-vice-president-pick-not-me/5058449002/) for November general elections.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Whitmer is [continuously highlighting](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/03/gretchen-whitmer-to-give-michigan-a-voice-in-joe-biden-campaign-strategy.html) Biden's policies for strengthening Michigan's economy, like supporting the auto industry and the Affordable Care Act. This can help sway many undecided voters.
1.6.2.2. Con: Biden should prioritize choosing a pick that has a broader appeal, rather than go for a running mate to secure a specific state.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Swing states [can determine](https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a31142244/swing-states-2020-election/) the result of the upcoming election and thus Biden would be wise to make his decision for who should be VP based on such critical criteria.
1.6.2.4. Con: Biden has a duty to pick a running mate that he feels would make the best Vice President and should not pick a prospective Vice President based on how they effect his overall chances of winning the election.
1.6.3. Con: Many believe that Gretchen Whitmer's response to the Coronavirus pandemic went too far in [restricting](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/15/politics/gretchen-whitmer-operation-gridlock/index.html) individual liberty.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Whitmer's [executive order](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/15/politics/gretchen-whitmer-operation-gridlock/index.html) restricted gatherings of people not part of a single household, travel to in-state vacation or second homes as well as the use of motorboat or jet ski.
1.6.3.2. Con: These measures were necessary given that Michigan has a [considerably high proportion](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/15/politics/gretchen-whitmer-operation-gridlock/index.html) of Coronavirus cases and deaths in the United States.
1.6.3.3. Pro: A core component of American political culture is [liberty](https://www.studyblue.com/notes/note/n/five-elements-of-american-political-culture/deck/12421904). Thus, any over intrusive attack on liberty is likely to have a detrimental impact on a political candidate's performance in future elections.
1.7. [Catherine Cortez Masto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Cortez_Masto).
1.7.1. Pro: Joe Biden has already stated that Masto is among his [top three](https://www.newsweek.com/who-nevada-senator-catherine-cortez-masto-joe-biden-says-shes-among-his-top-three-picks-vice-1494549) picks for Vice President, showing that he regards her as a very strong pick.
1.7.1.1. Con: Even if Joe Biden considers Catherine Cortez Masto as the best pick, this does not mean she is indeed the best pick.
1.7.2. Con: Catherine Cortez Masto demonstrated [weakness](https://www.nrsc.org/press-releases/national-security-problems-wont-go-away-for-catherine-cortez-masto-2016-01-19/) in foreign policy and issues of national security.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The nuclear deal between the United States and Iran was orchestrated under the guidance of Catherine Cortez Masto's, [even though Iran continued to undermine the United States.](https://www.nrsc.org/press-releases/national-security-problems-wont-go-away-for-catherine-cortez-masto-2016-01-19/)
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Masto should not be blamed for Iran's decision to undermine the US as this is beyond her control.
1.7.2.2. Con: Unless Biden actively prescribes her a role in foreign policy or national security, as Vice President she will have [very little say](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/us-vice-president) in these areas.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Vice Presidents have [no vote](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/us-vice-president) in the Senate except from when there is 50-50 deadlock.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: Even if a Vice President does not have decision making power when considering matters of foreign policy, they should at least be competent in the area, as a source of advice for the President.
1.7.2.2.3. Con: The main purpose of a Vice President is to have someone who [can take over](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/us-vice-president) if the President dies, becomes unwell, or is impeached. If this happens, then she would have considerable say on foreign policy and national security having assumed the role of President.
1.7.2.3. Con: Catherine Cortez Masto was [one of only 34 senators](https://contactsenators.com/nevada/catherine-cortez-masto) to sign a letter condeming Trump's decision to cut funding toward Central American countries.
1.7.3. Con: Political ads [targeting Masto](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/7/10/1547018/-NV-Senate-Catherine-Cortez-Masto-off-to-a-good-start-but-this-will-be-close) for campaign donations might make her an unpopular choice as Biden's Vice President.
1.7.3.1. Pro: These widespread ads allege that when Masto was Attorney General, she hired a Washington law firm to help residents deal with the housing crisis, then [reaped thousands in campaign donations](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/7/10/1547018/-NV-Senate-Catherine-Cortez-Masto-off-to-a-good-start-but-this-will-be-close) from the firm’s attorneys.
1.7.3.2. Con: The public will not necessarily believe political advertisements.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Political ads are often [not fact-checked](https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2020/jan/12/facebook-us-election-2020-news-lies-campaigns-fact-check), thus they are not considered as a reliable source of information.
1.7.3.2.1.1. Con: People may not realize the information they are consuming is not factual.
1.7.3.2.2. Con: Political ads are likely to sow seeds of mistrust in the hearts and minds of voters due to repeated references.
1.7.3.2.3. Con: Advertisements regarding elections are likely to be perceived as 'official' by many and thus as factual and trustworthy sources.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Since political ads during elections [appeal to traits](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/ads-public-opinion/negative-political-ads-effects-voters-research-roundup/) displayed by majority of the voters, it is likely that they will have a successful impact on how voters view the candidate.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: An analysis of televised campaign ads found that three-quarters of ads aired during the 2012 elections “[appealed to anger.](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/ads-public-opinion/negative-political-ads-effects-voters-research-roundup/)”
1.7.4. Pro: Biden's underperformance with Latino voters could take a [u-turn](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256) by running with Cortez Masto, the only Latina senator in the US.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Satisfaction with Biden among Latino voters [about 40%](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-is-doing-terribly-among-latino-voters-who-will-be-key-in-2020-2019-12), which is not enough for a Presidential victory.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Democrats need about [70% of Latino vote](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/latino-support-trump-problem-democrats/606613/) to take back the White House.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Even though Trump has done everything to anger Latino voters, his support among this crucial portion of the electorate remains [surprisingly consistent](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/latino-support-trump-problem-democrats/606613/). Thus, Biden needs to strategize wisely to gather their support.
1.7.4.3. Con: Unless Biden does not [prioritize the issues](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/latino-support-trump-problem-democrats/606613/) faced by Latino voters, it is unlikely that even having Masto as a running mate might guarantee their support for him.
1.8. [Amy Klobuchar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar).
1.8.1. Pro: She would be an attractive running mate to both moderate Democrats and Republicans.
1.8.1.1. Con: Appealing to moderates in both parties would alienate the more radically left-wing members within the Democratic Party.
1.8.1.2. Pro: According to one [poll](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/democratic-party-left-liberal-q-poll/index.html) by CNN, over half of the American people believe that the Democratic Party, has moved too far left. Thus, a moderate candidate can address this concern by bringing the party back towards the center.
1.8.2. Pro: Being from the Midwest, she would [help deliver](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/will-joe-biden-pick-a-former-foe-as-his-vp) her home state of Minnesota to Biden as well as many other critical midwestern states such as Michigan or Wisconsin.
1.8.2.1. Con: Polling data shows that Biden is already on course to win in [Michigan](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html) and [Wisconsin](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/wi/wisconsin_trump_vs_biden-6849.html), so he does not need Klobuchar to help win them.
1.8.2.2. Pro: If she could help deliver Michigan to Biden, it would also [strengthen his chances](https://www.inquirer.com/news/joe-biden-michigan-pennsylvania-2020-take-aways-20200311.html) for winning against Trump in Pennsylvania.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: Michigan is, in many ways, a [good parallel](https://www.inquirer.com/news/michigan-black-vote-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020-20200310.html) to Pennsylvania, a Trump supporting state. A similar victory strategy could help Biden win Pennsylvania.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Michigan and Pennsylvania are economically and demographically [similar](https://www.inquirer.com/news/joe-biden-michigan-pennsylvania-2020-take-aways-20200311.html), with a mix of manufacturing, agricultural, and white-collar jobs.
1.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: Both Michigan and Pennsylvania are [older and whiter](https://www.inquirer.com/news/joe-biden-michigan-pennsylvania-2020-take-aways-20200311.html) than the country as a whole \(which proved crucial in Trump’s 2016 victories\), but also have large and politically influential African American populations.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: Pennsylvania voted Trump because it found Clinton unacceptable in 2016. Biden's chances in [small cities and rural regions](https://www.inquirer.com/news/iowa-caucuses-2020-newton-jasper-county-20200204.html) might be able to energize the Democratic faithful in his [support](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/trump-luzerne-county-rally-democrats-pa-barletta-casey-20180802.html).
1.8.3. Pro: Klobuchar is a safe pair of hands for addressing the fallout of the Coronavirus crisis, which [will likely persist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52000219) during Biden's term in office.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Klobuchar [acknowledges the magnitude](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/494704-klobuchar-minnesota-suffering-from-lack-of-national-strategy-about) of the Coronavirus problem.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Klobuchar has been appealing for the government to adopt a [national strategy](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/494704-klobuchar-minnesota-suffering-from-lack-of-national-strategy-about) in response to the outbreak, recognising that individual states cannot tackle it alone.
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: Since her [husband was hospitalised](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/it-s-nothing-else-klobuchar-husband-talk-about-his-battle-n1178536) for Covid-19, she has lived experience of how serious the virus can be.
1.8.3.1.2.1. Con: One does not need lived experience to see how serious the virus is, considering that it resulted in a [global socio-economic shutdown.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-the-week-the-world-shut-down)
1.8.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Though lived experience is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for appreciating the severity of the situation, it does make it more likely.
1.8.3.1.2.2. Pro: Following her husband's recovery, Klobuchar opened up publicly about the [personal toll](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/amy-klobuchar-husband-coronavirus-recovery-cnntv/index.html) of the crisis and extended gratitude to the key workers who cared for him.
1.8.3.1.3. Con: Given the [severity and pervasiveness](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states) of the Coronavirus across the USA, it is likely that all of Biden's running mates will comprehend the magnitude of the problem. As such, this is not a distinguishing feature about Klobuchar.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Klobuchar is cognizant of how [rural communities](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/16/21222746/amy-klobuchar-coronavirus-rural-areas-hospitals) are particularly vulnerable to the health and economic impacts of the Coronavirus.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: Given rural communities were largely responsible for the [shift to Republicans](https://www.npr.org/2016/11/14/501737150/rural-voters-played-a-big-part-in-helping-trump-defeat-clinton) in recent years, a Vice President who is cognizant of rural voters could boost Biden's chances of winning the presidency.
1.8.3.2.2. Con: Most who are a potential candidate to be the President's running mate would likely be aware that areas with less robust healthcare systems are more at risk to the Coronavirus.
1.8.3.2.3. Con: Klobuchar's current Coronavirus response is [limited to rural communities](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/16/21222746/amy-klobuchar-coronavirus-rural-areas-hospitals), where the virus does not have the same intensity as urban areas.
1.8.3.2.3.1. Pro: US urban cores [disproportionately](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/04/10/who-lives-in-the-places-where-coronavirus-is-hitting-the-hardest/) comprise counties where COVID-19 cases are currently clustered, a stark contrast to rural areas where the level of Coronavirus exposure still remains relatively low.
1.8.3.2.3.2. Con: In the US, the Coronavirus is [likely to hit](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/28/21197421/usa-coronavirus-covid-19-rural-america) rural communities much worse in the future.
1.8.3.3. Con: The long term effects of the Coronavirus are [unclear](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/lingering-and-painful-long-and-unclear-road-to-coronavirus-recovery-long-lasting-symptoms). Thus, it is also unclear how far Klobuchar is equipped to deal with these consequences.
1.8.3.3.1. Con: Even though the precise long term effects of the Coronavirus are unclear, the economic theory which will guide any informed response to a recession will remain the same. Klobuchar's government experience makes her well-equipped to deal with the impending crisis.
1.8.3.3.1.1. Con: Events can produce different responses, guided by diverging theories.
1.8.3.3.2. Con: The unpredictability of the Coronavirus does not render an informed response impossible. The unpredictability in itself generates clear principles to follow, such as taking risk averse and protective economic measures.
1.8.3.3.2.1. Pro: The lack of quantifiable knowledge about the economic consequences of the Coronavirus is an example of [Knightian uncertainty](http://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-knightian-0602). However, [info-gap decision theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230277328_1) models the best economic policy when faced with such uncertainty. \(p. 3-4\)
1.8.3.4. Pro: In the Democratic debate in February, Klobuchar explained that she would coordinate [disease-outbreak preparedness](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/what-democrats-said-about-coronavirus-outbreak-at-the-debate.html) in her administration. It is likely should would and could still do this as Vice President.
1.8.3.5. Con: The inability of Klobuchar to effectively respond to Coronavirus in Minnesota reflects badly on her ability to handle the same on a national level.
1.8.3.5.1. Pro: There is a [lack of testing capacity](https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/coronavirus-lack-of-testing-capacity-still-a-cause-for-concern-in-minnesota) for Coronavirus patients in Minnesota.
1.8.3.5.1.1. Con: It is unclear to what extent this failing is attributable to Klobuchar.
1.8.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: In March, the [White House](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51761435) conceded that there are not enough testing kits across the whole country.
1.8.3.5.2. Con: Klobuchar cannot reasonably be blamed for the impact of the Coronavirus in Minnesota.
1.8.3.5.3. Con: As a result of Minnesota's [regular budgetary stress testing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-04-09/pew-minnesota-utah-among-states-with-economies-best-prepared-for-coronavirus), its economy is well-prepared for the Coronavirus upheaval.
1.8.3.6. Pro: Klobuchar has already been legislating to help people through the Coronavirus crisis.
1.8.3.6.1. Pro: Klobuchar has already been working to [legislate stimulus packages](https://time.com/5826497/amy-klobuchar-time-100-talks/) to help Americans get through the Coronavirus crisis.
1.8.3.6.2. Pro: In March, Klobuchar introduced new legislation to increase telehealth access and facilitate virtual visits in nursing homes called the [Advancing Connectivity during the Coronavirus to Ensure Support for Seniors \(ACCESS\) Act](https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/3/klobuchar-casey-introduce-legislation-to-increase-seniors-virtual-connection-to-health-care-and-community-amidst-coronavirus-outbreak).
1.8.4. Con: Klobuchar's past baggage might hurt Biden's chances of winning.
1.8.4.1. Con: There have been many accusations made against Donald Trump, yet this did not stop him from becoming President of the United States. Thus, Klobuchar's baggage is unlikely to impact Biden's chances of winning.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: [Over 20](https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12?r=US&IR=T) women have accused Trump of sexual assault.
1.8.4.2. Pro: There are several reports of Klobuchar [mistreating her staff members](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-staff.html).
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: Klobuchar's reputation for mistreating her aides is so entrenched that she found it [difficult to hire](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/amy-klobuchar-mistreat-staff-harry-reid_n_5c5db1ece4b03afe8d674530?ri18n=true) campaign aides for her presidential run.
1.8.4.2.2. Pro: Klobuchar has [admitted](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/19/amy-klobuchar-difficult-management-leadership-style-new-hampshire-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn) to pushing her staff members too hard.
1.8.4.2.3. Con: Some [former staff members](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/amy-klobuchar-staff-2020-election) have defended Klobuchar as "incredibly fair".
1.8.4.3. Pro: Klobuchar, while serving as District Attorney, imprisoned a black teenager on [reportedly flimsy evidence](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256). This could be used by Biden's opponents to try and weaken his support among black voters.
1.8.4.3.1. Pro: It is essential for Biden to win the support of black voters.
1.8.4.3.1.1. Pro: Since 2012, African American support for the Democratic Party has been [decreasing](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2017/11/01/441926/voter-trends-in-2016/). \(Figure 2\)
1.8.4.3.1.2. Con: Biden already has [significant support](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/biden-has-black-voters-support-over-sanders-it-s-not-ncna1150576) among black voters.
1.8.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Southern black voters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/02/bidens-twin-bases-are-black-moderate-voters-often-those-are-same-voters/?arc404=true) already support Biden for his relatively cautious stances on health care and taxation.
1.8.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Black voters [heavily dislike Trump](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/26/politics/trump-approval-black-voters-2020/index.html), meaning that they would offer their support to Biden regardless.
1.8.4.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: In [2019](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/26/politics/trump-approval-black-voters-2020/index.html), more than 3 in 4 black voters held a "mostly" or "very" unfavorable view of Trump.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.4.3.1.2.2.
1.8.5. Con: Progressive voices in the Democratic Party are already signaling they will react poorly to a Klobuchar pick.
1.8.5.1. Con: Even if there are members who are hesitant to support Klobuchar as Biden's running mate in the run up to Biden making the choice, it is likely that should she be chosen by Biden, they will extend their support to both in order to have a better chance at removing Trump and the Republican Party from power.
1.8.5.1.1. Pro: In the run up to the 2016 elections, Bernie Sanders tried [rallying his progressive supporters behind Hillary Clinton](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-join-forces-to-promote-unity-at-democratic-convention-1469492721) in order to defeat Trump.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Markos Moulitsas [tweeted](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256) that Klobuchar “would be Tim Kaine 2.0—doing nothing to unify the party, bringing no new demographics to the ticket. It would be \(once again\) a disaster.”
1.9. [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris).
1.9.1. Con: Kamala Harris previously implied that Joe Biden is racist during a [democratic debate](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/27/harris-attacks-bidens-record-on-busing-and-working-with-segregationists.html). Choosing Harris could bring those comments back into the spotlight, which would hurt Biden's campaign for presidency.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Kamala Harris making such strong remarks against Biden, only to later run as his VP would make them appear disingenuous.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: This indicates that Harris is not afraid of [pointing out policies that are segregationist](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/kamala-harris-biden-vp-381829).
1.9.1.2. Con: Harris has [endorsed Biden](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/08/kamala-harris-endorses-biden-123617) as Presidential candidate. This suggests that their relationships have improved since the public controversy with Biden.
1.9.1.3. Con: Harris has a strong incentive to defend Biden as her chances to become Vice President partly depend on how they both are perceived by the public.
1.9.1.4. Con: Biden has [clarified that](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/06/biden-harris-in-contention-for-vp-392219) "he doesn’t hold a grudge" against Harris for "attacking him in an early primary debate."
1.9.1.4.1. Pro: This was also confirmed by an Associated Press photographer, who was able to capture Biden’s handwritten notes. Under the section labelled "Kamala Harris", Biden had [written the words](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/biden-kamala-harris-notes/index.html) "Do not hold grudges", "Talented", "Great help to campaign" and "Great respect for her".
1.9.2. Pro: As a [biracial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-am-who-i-am-kamala-harris-daughter-of-indian-and-jamaican-immigrants-defines-herself-simply-as-american/2019/02/02/0b278536-24b7-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html) individual, Kamala Harris would increase diversity in Biden's prospective administration. This would likely encourage those who are uncertain about Biden in the Democratic Party to vote for him.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Biden would likely be perceived as a supporter of minority groups within the party.
1.9.2.2. Con: A political candidate should not be chosen based on their race, sexuality or gender.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: Some groups are [less well represented](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-arent-there-more-asian-americans-in-leadership-positions) in positions of power. Thus, to correct this misrepresentation, one should be mindful of the race, sexuality and gender of a candidate.
1.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: Race, sexuality and gender [impact](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-elephant-in-the-room/201302/the-reality-race-in-everyday-life) how one experiences the world around them. A political representative who has had similar experiences is more likely to be able to represent any grievances and concerns that commonly occur.
1.9.2.2.2. Pro: Race, sexuality and gender have no bearing on the policies that a candidate for office proposes. A candidate should be chosen based on their achievements and future political proposals.
1.9.2.2.2.1. Pro: Some political candidates, who themselves do not identify as LGBT, have demonstrated their [support](https://www.bustle.com/p/every-2020-candidates-lgbtq-rights-position-in-one-single-list-17988507) for LGBT+ policies.
1.9.3. Pro: Kamala Harris frequently fights on behalf of the political underdogs, which many may find refreshing.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Despite considerable pressure to settle from the Obama administration, Harris pursued a [lawsuit against mortgage lenders](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kamala-Harris) for unfair practices and secured a judgment five times higher than the settlement amount offered.
1.9.3.2. Pro: One of the enduring criticisms of the Democratic party is that it represents the establishment - [the corporate and political elite](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2018/07/09/democratic-party-left-me-column/766561002/) - and has left behind ordinary Americans. As Vice President, Harris could help reverse this.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: Trump's election evidenced how [many Americans believe the system is rigged](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/01/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-state-of-the-union) against them, and blame the Democratic party for doing little to address this.
1.9.4. Con: Joe Biden is already strong with African Americans, so he ought to choose a running mate that is strong in the areas he is weak instead.
1.9.4.1. Con: Harris is very popular among African American female voters, and the sentiment from them throughout the South is [really clear](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/will-joe-biden-pick-a-former-foe-as-his-vp): "We put in all this work and you should put a black woman on the ticket."
1.9.4.1.1. Con: 65% of the subgroup of nonvoters [least likely to mobilize](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/19/women-predominate-among-chronic-nonvoters-111770) are women, particularly from racial minority groups. As such, there is little Biden can hope to gain from targeting African American female voters.
1.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.3.1.2.
1.9.4.3. Con: Biden is [under pressure to choose an African American VP](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/12/tammy-duckworth-vp-contention-357234), "both to reward a constituency that powered his victory in the primary and as recognition of the reckoning on race the country is going through."
1.9.5. Pro: Kamala Harris has government experience, which makes it likely that she will be able to provide politically smart advice.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Kamala Harris served as San Francisco's [District Attorney](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Photo_Kamala_Harris.htm).
1.9.5.2. Pro: She served as California's [Attorney General](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Photo_Kamala_Harris.htm).
1.9.5.3. Pro: Harris has been a [star senator of the Trump era](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/will-joe-biden-pick-a-former-foe-as-his-vp).
1.9.5.3.1. Pro: She is widely known for her [tough questioning of William Barr](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/kamala-harris-william-barr-mueller-report/588514/), Trump’s handpicked attorney general, and [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.thecut.com/2018/09/kamala-harriss-abortion-questions-left-kavanaugh-speechless.html), Trump's controversial second Supreme Court pick.
1.9.6. Pro: Biden and Harris share a [pragmatic streak](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/will-joe-biden-pick-a-former-foe-as-his-vp) that could have a wide appeal within the US voter-base.
1.9.6.1. Pro: A Biden-Harris [ticket](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256) could aggressively pursue the Upper Midwest, the Southeast and the Southwest, from Maine to Montana, from Arizona to South Carolina.
1.9.7. Con: Kamala Harris is [not trusted](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/kamala-harris-biden-vp-381829) by Biden's search committee, making it unlikely for her to make the cut.
1.10. [Nina Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Turner).
1.10.1. Pro: Nina Turner could help Joe Biden secure the vote of progressives.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Turner has a history of [introducing progressive legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Turner#Ohio_State_Senate_\(2008%E2%80%932014\)) in the Ohio state senate.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: In [March 2012](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/3/12/1073566/-Women-legislators-turn-the-tables-and-introduce-bills-regulating-men-s-reproductive-health), as a response against bills that seek to control women's access to contraception and abortion,Turner introduced a bill to regulate men's reproductive health.
1.10.2. Pro: Nina Turner has [campaign experience](https://ballotpedia.org/Nina_Turner_%28Ohio%29) in [Ohio](https://theintercept.com/2019/09/30/nina-turner-cleveland-ohio-education-reform/) that may help Joe Biden win that state.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Turner has a [strong track record](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-will-pick-for-vp-2020-3) of wins in a swing state.
1.10.2.2. Con: According to polling data, Biden is already [on course to win Ohio](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/oh/ohio_trump_vs_biden-6765.html).
1.10.2.3. Con: A running mate should not be chosen based on a narrow criteria of whether they are able to win over the electorate in a single state.
1.10.3. Con: Nina Turner has [publicly denounced](https://dailycaller.com/2020/01/12/nina-turner-joe-biden-south-carolina-black-voters/) Joe Biden [several](https://moguldom.com/246951/nina-turner-joe-biden-is-pimpin-proximity-to-obama-not-earning-black-vote-like-bernie/) times.
1.11. [Ayanna Pressley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanna_Pressley).
1.11.1. Pro: Pressley is highly experienced, having worked in national politics for [over 16 years](https://www.fastcompany.com/90231590/6-things-to-know-about-rising-star-democrat-ayanna-pressley).
1.11.2. Pro: Pressley has been [open about difficult experiences](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/rep-ayanna-pressley-biden-for-sexual-assault-survivor-justice). This may encourage people to support her.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Pressley's support for sexual assault survivors may connect her with other members of the public who have experienced sexual assault.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: [1 out of 6](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) American women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape.
1.11.3. Con: Biden should not choose a running mate who has taken actions that have tarnished his public image.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Pressley has [called upon Biden](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ayanna-pressley-joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-allegations-a9500596.html) to address sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. This is likely to validate the accusations.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: A public call out is an opportunity for Biden to openly refute the accusations.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Any future working relationship between Biden and Pressley could be undermined because of such history.
1.12. [Stacey Abrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams).
1.12.1. Pro: Stacey Abrams would be Biden's strongest chance of winning the Presidency according to a recent [poll](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/poll-stacey-abrams-is-bidens-best-running-mate-choice.html).
1.12.1.1. Pro: A progressive think tank found that Abrams [performed uniquely well](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/study-finds-stacey-abrams-biden-s-best-choice-here-s-n1164361) across demographic groups and among both independent voters and core Democratic constituencies whose lower-than-expected turnout hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.
1.12.1.2. Con: The poll uses a small sample of [4,998](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/poll-stacey-abrams-is-bidens-best-running-mate-choice.html) participants and is thus unreliable.
1.12.2. Con: Stacey Abrams has a [string of ethical controversies](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-might-he-pick-michelle-obama-as-his-vice-president/) in her past that would be fully scrutinized in the spotlight of a national race, reflecting badly on Biden's choice.
1.12.2.1. Pro: In 1992, Abrams [burnt the Georgia state flag](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/politics/abrams-flag-burning-georgia.html) on the steps of the Georgia Capitol.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: The burning of a flag may be portrayed as a radical action that shows she is unfit to hold a position of power.
1.12.2.1.1.1. Con: Burning the Georgian flag was a [protest against](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/23/democratic-candidate-isnt-sorry-she-once-burned-georgia-flag/) the racial divisiveness that was embedded in the flag with the Confederate symbol. By partaking in such a powerful protest for equality, this makes Abrams fitting to hold a position of power.
1.12.2.1.2. Pro: America is an [extremely patriotic](https://www.businessinsider.com/yougov-19-most-patriotic-countries-in-the-world-2016-11?r=US&IR=T#1-united-states-19) country. As such, it is likely that burning the state flag will be viewed very disfavorably by the electorate.
1.12.2.1.2.1. Con: According to [one poll](https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/american-patriotism-is-at-a-record-low-poll/), the number of Americans who have been "extremely proud" of their country has declined.
1.12.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The same poll still found that [70%](https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/american-patriotism-is-at-a-record-low-poll/) of Americans are "proud" or "extremely proud" to be American.
1.12.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The poll concluded that the percentage of adults saying they are "extremely" proud to be American dropped from 51% to 47% on the year before, which is 4% less. However, the [margin of error](https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/american-patriotism-is-at-a-record-low-poll/) was +/- 4%, which makes this conclusion dubious.
1.12.2.1.2.2. Pro: In the [United States](https://www.businessinsider.com/yougov-19-most-patriotic-countries-in-the-world-2016-11?r=US&IR=T#1-united-states-19), 41% of people believe that it is the best country in the world, and 32% believe that it is better than most countries.
1.12.2.1.3. Con: Those members of the electorate who are not nationalists are unlikely to be concerned by the burning of the American flag.
1.12.2.1.3.1. Con: In 2006, [56%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/23524/public-support-constitutional-amendment-flag-burning.aspx) of Americans supported passing a Constitutional Amendment making it illegal to burn the American flag.
1.12.2.1.3.2. Pro: A significant number of Americans are not nationalists.
1.12.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Only [51%](https://www.statista.com/topics/5306/nationalism-in-the-us/) of Americans feel that white nationalism poses a very or somewhat serious threat, implying that 49% are either ambivalent towards white nationalism or actively endorse it.
1.12.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Nationalists demand independence from, and [object to collaborating with other countries](https://www.thebalance.com/nationalism-definition-examples-pros-cons-4149524). However, [7 in 10](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/most-americans-support-staying-in-the-paris-agreement/528663/) Americans support remaining a part of the [Paris Agreement](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/paris-climate-agreement-everything-you-need-know).
1.12.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: Nationalists favor [protectionist economic policy](https://www.thebalance.com/nationalism-definition-examples-pros-cons-4149524). However, [83%](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/lcc/record-number-americans-say-international-trade-good-us-economy) of Americans say that international trade is good for US economic policy.
1.12.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: Nationalism tends to manifest as [anti-immigration](https://www.thebalance.com/nationalism-definition-examples-pros-cons-4149524). However, [two-thirds](https://theconversation.com/americans-support-for-immigration-is-at-record-highs-but-the-government-is-out-of-sync-with-their-views-121215) of Americans are at least fine with immigration, and up to [81%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/246455/solid-majority-opposes-new-construction-border-wall.aspx) support offering legalization to undocumented immigrants.
1.12.2.1.4. Con: In [1989](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/law-protects-flag-burning-united-states/story?id=43855624), the US Supreme Court ruled that burning the flag is not illegal. Therefore, by 1992, burning the Georgia state flag may not have been seen as so controversial.
1.12.2.1.4.1. Con: The 1989 decision of the US Supreme Court was a controversial one, since the [decision was a 5-4 split](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/law-protects-flag-burning-united-states/story?id=43855624).
1.12.2.2. Con: It is likely that any potential running mate would have a past controversy that could be used against them in the context of a Presidential election. Thus, this does not differentiate Stacey Abrams from other candidates.
1.12.3. Pro: Stacey Abrams would champion women's rights, which would likely increase public support for Biden.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Stacey Adams challenges gender norms surrounding how women feel the need to [underplay their political ambitions](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/16/politics/stacey-abrams-gender-norms/index.html).
1.12.3.2. Con: Championing women's rights could discourage some groups from voting for Biden.
1.12.3.2.1. Pro: Some [men's rights groups](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/young-men-should-be-furious-inside-worlds-largest-mens-rights-activism/) describe themselves as anti-feminists. Thus, they are unlikely to support a candidate who focuses on women's rights.
1.12.3.2.1.1. Con: Men's rights activists \(MRAs\) often subscribe to a whole cluster of [right wing political views](https://msmagazine.com/2019/08/05/the-danger-of-the-trumped-up-mens-rights-movement/). As such, it is unlikely that they would ever have voted Democrat anyway. Consequently, Biden should not be concerned about missing out on their votes.
1.12.4. Pro: Having launched [Fair Fight 2020](https://fairfight.com/about-stacey-abrams/), it is clear that Abrams is committed to increasing electoral participation.
1.12.4.1. Con: Since Fair Fight 2020 was only [founded in November 2018](https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/businesssearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=2639897&businessType=Domestic%20Nonprofit%20Corporation&fromSearch=True), it does not in itself evidence any long-term commitment to increasing electoral participation.
1.12.4.2. Pro: Increasing electoral participation will help rectify the [democratic deficit in American](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/07/21/a-democracy-deficit-plagues-the-us-and-the-european-union/) politics and thus enhance the overall quality of democracy.
1.12.5. Pro: She could help him win her home state of Georgia, which many experts say could become competitive in 2020.
1.12.5.1. Pro: Trump super-PAC America First Action has placed Georgia among its [six “tier one” states](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/gop-bastion-georgia-is-suddenly-in-play-for-democrats-in-2020), anticipating that the state would see heavy competition.
1.12.5.2. Con: Stacey lost in Georgia as Democratic nominee for governor in [2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/gop-bastion-georgia-is-suddenly-in-play-for-democrats-in-2020).
1.12.5.2.1. Con: Although she lost, Stacey was still the [most successful Democratic nominee](https://fairfight.com/about-stacey-abrams/) in Georgia's history.
1.12.6. Con: Having never held any federal office before, she has insufficient governing experience to be in a position where she can assume power from the presidency.
1.12.6.1. Pro: Due to her lack of experience, the electorate may perceive her as either incompetent or not suited for an elite position within government.
1.12.6.1.1. Pro: A lack of experience in high levels of government means that a candidate does not have a proven track record. Thus, it is unlikely that the electorate will have unwavering faith in such a candidate.
1.12.6.2. Con: In reality, it is highly unlikely that she will have to take over the presidency.
1.12.6.2.1. Pro: Abrams could only take over the presidency in the event of Biden's death, resignation, or inability to discharge his powers and duties [according to the Constitution](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/index.html).
1.12.6.2.1.1. Pro: [Only one](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/index.html) Vice President has ever taken over the presidency following the President's resignation.
1.12.6.2.1.2. Pro: [Only eight](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/index.html) Vice Presidents have assumed the presidency upon the President's death, most of whom died in the [19th and early 20th Century](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/02/17/how-have-us-presidents-died-in-office/).
1.12.6.3. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.
1.12.7. Con: Stacey Abrams is not progressive enough.
1.12.7.1. Pro: Stacy Abrams [doesn't support legalizing Marijuana.](https://staceyabrams.com/vision/criminal-justice/)
1.12.7.1.1. Pro: [2/3 of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/) claim to support the legalization of marijuana.
1.12.7.2. Pro: She has [not advocated for universal healthcare](https://apnews.com/73a6439465d04d14883f46d29277a3ba/Stacey-Abrams%27-record-complicates-%27radical%27-label-from-GOP), which is an important issue to most progressive voters.
1.12.7.3. Pro: Having a progressive Vice President would be good for America.
1.12.7.3.1. Pro: A progressive voice in office could help get the US closer to adopting a version of the [Green New Deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/climate/green-new-deal-questions-answers.html).
1.12.7.3.1.1. Con: A version of the Green New Deal would likely be passed irrespective of having a progressive Vice President because [Biden has promised a "Clean Energy Revolution"](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/12/joe-biden-radical-green-new-deal-plan-moderate-column/1365919001/) if he takes office anyway.
1.12.7.3.2. Pro: A progressive voice might advise in favour of longer-term economic strategies to address rising [rising economic inequality](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/).
1.12.7.3.3. Con: Many Americans do not espouse progressive values. It might lead to further alienation and aggression in America.
1.12.7.3.3.1. Pro: A large proportion of Americans [strongly dislike](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) PC culture and continue to clash over the idea.
1.12.7.4. Pro: A progressive Vice President would help Joe Biden secure the votes of progressives.
1.12.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.12.7.4.2. Con: Progressives have no other realistic alternative, therefore Joe Biden doesn't need to worry about securing their votes.
1.12.7.4.2.1. Con: Progressives can vote for independent parties.
1.12.7.4.2.1.1. Con: It would be [almost impossible](https://newrepublic.com/article/146884/america-stuck-two-parties) for an independent candidate to win the Presidency.
1.12.7.4.2.2. Con: The neglected voters will stay home, contributing to low voter turnout.
1.12.7.4.2.2.1. Pro: Apart from in some key states, [non-voters generally lean more Democratic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/increased-voter-turnout-could-benefit-republicans-or-democrats-in-2020/). Therefore, low voter turnout could substantially harm Biden's prospects of winning the Presidency.
1.12.7.4.2.3. Pro: For progressives, Biden is the [only tool to defeat](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/progressive-democrats-sanders-supporters-hesitate-to-support-biden-presidential-election-20200415.html) Trump in 2020 elections.
1.12.7.4.3. Pro: Biden needs to win over progressive voters because, as of April, polling indicates that [Sanders supporters are “dangerously not” united](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-pick.html) behind Biden’s candidacy yet.
1.12.7.4.4. Pro: Biden is very [unpopular among younger voters](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/young-democrats-have-rejected-biden-and-it-could-cost-him-the-nomination/), who tend to be more progressive.
1.12.7.4.4.1. Con: Regardless of who Biden chooses as running mate, he would still be the more progressive choice when compared to a Republican.
1.12.7.5. Con: Abrams proposes to [invest in advanced and renewable energy](https://staceyabrams.com/vision/energy-environment/), such as through a Georgia Green Bank. This is similar to the [Green New Deal](https://www.investopedia.com/the-green-new-deal-explained-4588463) proposed and supported by progressives.
1.12.7.6. Con: A majority of Americans [do not consider](http://www.oleantimesherald.com/commentary/are-americans-conservative-progressive-or-both/article_d30521e6-6b42-11e8-8c4e-47d78099be0f.html) themselves to be progressive. As such, Abrams might be able to appeal to non-progressives, which form a higher vote percentage.
1.12.7.6.1. Pro: A [2017 Gallup poll](http://www.oleantimesherald.com/commentary/are-americans-conservative-progressive-or-both/article_d30521e6-6b42-11e8-8c4e-47d78099be0f.html) found that more Americans identify as “conservative” \(35%\) than “liberal or progressive” \(26%\).
1.12.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.13. [Karen Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass)

1.13.2. Pro: Bass has a [record of building coalitions](https://www.ncsl.org/legislators-staff/legislators/legislative-leaders/state-legislatures-magazine-karen-bass-coalition.aspx), especially during turbulent times, a skill-set that will prove to be beneficial for Biden.
1.13.3. Con: Karen Bass's [problematic past](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/karen-bass-scrutiny-biden-vice-presidential-pick/index.html) might reduce Biden's chances of winning the election.
1.14. [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton).
1.14.1. Con: Choosing her as a running mate would likely alienate a lot of people among both Republicans and Democrats.
1.14.1.1. Pro: Hillary Clinton was widely [unpopular](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/03/why-do-they-hate-her-215220) among a large portion of the American population even after the 2016 election was decided.
1.14.1.2. Pro: Many people would likely view choosing Hillary Clinton as a running mate as a sign that the Democrats have failed to learn lessons from 2016.
1.14.1.3. Con: Hilary Clinton won [more of the popular vote](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final-count/index.html) than Donald Trump, during her Presidential campaign. This suggests that a significant number of people would support her, should she be Biden's running mate.
1.14.2. Pro: Hillary Clinton won the [popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign#Election_results) in the 2016 general election, showing that she has widespread appeal among the American populace.
1.14.2.1. Con: Winning more of the popular vote did not stop Clinton from losing the election. Thus, overall, she did not have a strong enough appeal amongst the American populace.
1.14.3. Pro: Clinton has been referred to as a potential choice for Biden by US media. Given the [influential role of media in US elections](https://journalism.uoregon.edu/news/six-ways-media-influences-elections), it would be beneficial for Biden.
1.14.3.1. Pro: Influential TV-personality [Whoopi Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg) recently stated that she thinks Biden should pick Clinton as his [running mate](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/she-would-be-brilliant-whoopi-goldberg-says-hillary-clinton-should-be-vice-president).
1.14.3.2. Pro: It is likely that Biden's campaign might get [much more media coverage](https://journalism.uoregon.edu/news/six-ways-media-influences-elections) if he picks Clinton as his running mate.
1.14.4. Con: Hillary Clinton has [already lost](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/07/the-night-they-cant-forget-hillary-clinton-supporters-recall-the-election) an election to Donald Trump.

1.14.4.1. Pro: A Presidential candidate who is a former Vice President is more likely to be seen as having the experience necessary to undertake the Presidency.
1.14.4.1.1. Con: Many individuals have become President [without having any experience as Vice President.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience)
1.14.4.1.2. Con: A prospective Presidential candidate may have experience in other senior political positions which is likely to make others perceive them as competent.
1.14.4.2. Con: Since Clinton lost the 2016 election, [Russian meddling](https://time.com/5565991/russia-influence-2016-election/) has come to light. Without this, Clinton may have won the election.
