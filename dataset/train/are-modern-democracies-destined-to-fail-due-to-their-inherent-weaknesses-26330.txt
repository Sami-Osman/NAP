Discussion Name: Are modern democracies destined to fail due to their inherent weaknesses?

1. Modern democracies are destined to fail due to their inherent weaknesses.
1.1. Con: The way in which democracy is incorporated in a particular system largely determines whether its inherent weaknesses are likely to prove fatal.
1.1.1. Pro: Some modern democracies are too heavily reliant on one form of democracy \(Representative Democracy, or RD\) that is [too blunt](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/24/will-of-the-people-british-democracy) \(insufficiently nuanced\) to cope with the [evolving needs of more sophisticated electorates](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/the-current-crisis-has-been-a-long-time-coming-and-westminsters-system-is-behind-it/?utm_campaign=meetedgar&utm_medium=social&utm_source=meetedgar.com&fbclid=IwAR3DYLfCi-dWy9EvreNmLIaJzaCfSliPTPbxo9ccyyaHvWzoS0mOyxtt3cU).
1.1.2. Pro: [Some democracies](http://theconversation.com/what-canada-can-learn-from-new-zealand-on-electoral-reform-125915?fbclid=IwAR2OaiG7TNeJpxoq2Cv-XQr__h54wkZ5jOn6UbeqZLbtnG92lfVnl9mFgW8) evolve in better ways than others. Towards the end of the last century, New Zealand made substantial changes to the way it forms a government. It introduced proportional representation, changed the makeup of constituencies etc. It is now regarded as a thriving democracy.
1.1.3. Pro: In presidential systems, political power is centralized and heavily concentrated in a single office. This gives the president more opportunities to shape a country at her/his own discretion \([p. 14/15](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/8da2aa9b-e547-4a53-ba51-d00ad01413d9.pdf)\).
1.1.4. Pro: Representative Democracies are slow to change, some would say this is by design - to provide stability for planners, investors etc. This slowness means that some are more likely to fail than more agile forms of Government, such as dictatorships or federations or direct dictatorships. For example we increasingly hear about[individual states](https://upliftca.org/quick-guide-to-californias-climate-laws/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAjfvwBRCkARIsAIqSWlP0xAojNYEpXGeIFeH2EGhg65EiYaZLq72NZIsVlOR6OdTK76r3vywaAqBOEALw_wcB) within the United States running faster in their response to Climate Change than the USA as a whole.
1.1.5. Pro: There is no single expression of "modern democracy" that can be universally applied. Some modern democracies are weak and more likely to fail, others and strong and more resilient.
1.1.5.1. Pro: The relative strength of democracy, and therefore its likelihood to succeed or fail, rest on the quality of its institutions and how well it is delivered.
1.2. Pro: Modern democracies [rely](https://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/3660/A_hollowing_middle_class.html) on a substantial body of educated and articulate people who wish to affect decisions. This is commonly called the Middle Class. This is [declining](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/10/millennials-squeezed-middle-class-oecd-uk-income) in proportion due to a mix of reasons.
1.2.1. Pro: The mechanisms of 'modern democracy' are deeply rooted in a form called 'representative democracy', whereby a 'body politic' is elected by the public. These elections are often flawed by tribalism, gerrymandering, media manipulation and even the way votes are counted and allocated. Once the electorate becomes '[disaffected'](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/first-past-the-post-system-breeds-cynical-and-disaffected-voters) with the processes of democracy [their involvement in that democracy dissipates](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/02/19/knight-nonvoter-study-decoding-2020-election-wild-card-115796).
1.2.1.1. Con: Technologies exist that allow for greater use of direct democracy techniques \(e.g. referenda\) and for forms of sortition and [interactive democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_democracy) \(e.g. [citizens assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) \) to evolve. These can be adopted and refined to work [alongside](https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/peterborough-extinction-rebellion-call-citizens-assembly-covid-19-recovery-2869776) representative democracy and thus widen the base.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: [Electoral Reform](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/) is a very [slow process](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/dark-ads-and-dodgy-donors-how-the-queens-speech-missed-a-chance-to-protect-our-democracy/) when done democratically. Those in power like the status quo.
1.2.2. Con: The Middle Classes are generally rising in proportion as the ['working class](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/threatened-isolated-under-siege-the-uks-working-class-today-2302850.html)' is split into the 'underclass' \(dependent on benefits\) and lower middle class \(educated but in low paid service jobs\).
1.2.2.1. Pro: The wealth inequalities \(commonly accepted but described quantitively by [Pikkety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Piketty) \) may result in a situation where polarisation is so harsh that the biggest grouping is those on 'sustenance'. Underclasses typically feel that polarised governments do not work in their benefit and can be seen to get violent. This gives rise to [authoritarianism](https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/08/12/the-rise-of-democratic-authoritarianism/).
1.3. Con: Modern democracy is de facto the most successful governmental system in modern times.
1.3.1. Con: Whether this sends any persistent message about the success of democracy is questionable. According to [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018), less than half the world's countries qualify as truly "free" - and the situation is deteriorating in more countries than it is improving in.
1.3.1.1. Con: Regardless of recent minor trends,[democracy went from just 1% of countries to 50% in just one century](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) and has continued an upward trend.
1.3.2. Con: In point of fact, modern democracies are no pure democracies but [mixed governments \(republics\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_government) comprising monarchical, aristocratic, and democratic elements. Therefore, it can be argued that the merger of all these forms is the most successful governmental form.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [The United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_government) has rule by the one \(the President\) \(monarchy\), the few \(the Senate\) \(aristocracy\) and the many \(House of Representatives\) \(democracy\).
1.3.2.2. Pro: [In the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_government) context the Commission President represents the rule by the one while the Council represents the aristocratic dimension and the Parliament represents the democratic dimension.
1.3.2.3. Pro: In no modern democracy the people hold office.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: Most people do not want to hold political office. That is why we have a representative democracy.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Local government, as a route into politics at a regional/national level, is poorly financially compensated, making it harder for less wealthy people to participate and leading to a system is less representative.
1.3.3. Pro: Democracies are [richer and their citizens healthier](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) than other political systems.
1.3.4. Pro: Across the world, [more than half of all countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/14/more-than-half-of-countries-are-democratic/) are democracies. Another quarter has democratic elements.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Just as important: the [share of the world's population](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) living in democratically governed countries has been steadily increasing and now stands at over half.
1.3.4.2. Con: According to the [Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_Index_by_country_2018), there are only 20 "full democracies."
1.3.5. Pro: Democracy shows considerable signs of [resilience](https://www.idea.int/gsod/files/IDEA-GSOD-2017-CHAPTER-2-EN.pdf), a political system’s ability to cope with, survive and recover from complex challenges and crises that present stress or pressure that can lead to systemic failure.
1.3.6. Pro: Modern democracies promote values many people can identify with: equality, fairness, freedom.
1.3.6.1. Con: Not everybody sees the same [priorities](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/) on the notion of freedom within a democracy. [Mutual](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_STU\(2019\)631762) safety and capacity to expand is arguably more important in early democracies.
1.3.6.2. Pro: According to the '[Theory of Basic Human Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values#Self-enhancement),' independent thought and action—choosing, creating, exploring \(freedom\) is a motivational value that can be found interculturally.
1.3.6.3. Con: [Genuine freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema) is incompatible with equality and fairness.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: It does not matter whether freedom in democracies is genuine or limited; what does matter and what has made democratic systems so successful is the narrative of freedom.
1.3.6.3.2. Con: The rule of law \([liberalism](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/on-the-rule-of-law/liberalism/C58725873E37B51ADA05063455D81AEB)\) has created a canopy under which freedom, fairness, and equality can successfully coexist.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Con: The rule of law is necessarily a [restriction on genuine freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract).
1.3.6.3.3. Con: The relative degree of freedom in democracies is much higher in comparison to other forms of government.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: The [tensions](https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/individual-rights-and-community-responsibilities) between full freedom and citizens' responsibilities are characteristics of a healthy democracy. Examples would be gun laws, the rights to privacy, common limitations on free speech \(incitement to violence etc.\).
1.3.6.3.5. Pro: Many modern democracies have some unfairness embedded within their system. [Blasphemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law) is a common one. This puts the 'feelings' of one set of people above free speech for others.
1.3.6.3.5.1. Pro: In Italy [Blasphemy](https://end-blasphemy-laws.org/whats-wrong-with-blasphemy-laws/) against the host country's [religion](https://fot.humanists.international/about-the-report/) is still a [crime](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50221110?fbclid=IwAR1PwFJ14cU-2z8bHXKsW_kox3FcWmph4WZY6ixUuwIwNIFOnixpeR8LUso).
1.3.6.3.5.1.1. Con: The [Italian Penal Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law#Italy) punishes offenses against all religions or "deities" alike.
1.3.6.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Although this code has supposedly been amended to include all religions besides Catholicism, [the phrasing](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-terzo/titolo-i/capo-ii/sezione-i/art724.html) suggests that it will only apply to 'Christianity' . All [recent uses](https://fot.humanists.international/countries/europe-southern-europe/italy/) of the law support this contention.
1.3.6.3.5.1.2. Pro: One person's 'blasphemy' is another's 'freedom of speech'.
1.3.6.3.5.1.2.1. Con: Freedom of speech is not absolute and limited where it affects other citizens in a negative way, e.g., by hate speech, defamatory statements, or personal insults.
1.3.6.3.5.1.3. Pro: By end of July 2019, [public blasphemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law#Italy) was also made illegal on local level in Italian town Saonara, punishing an alleged blasphemer with fines of €400.
1.3.6.3.5.1.4. Pro: [Humanists](http://humanism.org.uk) are [persistently](https://fot.humanists.international/) ruled against. For example in the linked article ['. ... prosecutions against artists and protesters in recent years have increased....](https://humanism.org.uk/2019/11/13/non-religious-continue-to-face-severe-persecution-in-70-countries-new-report/?fbclid=IwAR1IuplMBcsxUw50Cej5N9o2ZwNQy0vgMiHFuKMKv4N855jG6UqXdlKpLYs)'
1.3.6.3.5.2. Con: Democracies usually promote the right to religious freedom: the individual can freely choose which religion they want to believe in.
1.3.6.3.5.2.1. Con: The 'complete right to religious freedom' is not interpreted equally or fairly. Many democracies do not include the rights to be agnostics or atheists or undecided and 'also' to be able to [criticise](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/democracy-and-why-we-need-to-abolish-blasphemy-laws-in-poland/) , peacefully, the thoughts and idols of others.
1.3.6.3.5.3. Con: Blasphemy laws are [vanishing](https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/08/25/blasphemy-laws-are-quietly-vanishing-in-liberal-democracies) in liberal democracies.
1.4. Con: Since education enables better decision-making and democracies have emerged in countries where people have [higher levels of education](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy), whilst they may have problems, they are the informed choice and the best option known to man at this time.
1.4.1. Con: Information can and is highly manipulated by interest groups.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Money allows for the effective placing of information by having access to experienced PR firms.
1.5. Pro: Majority voting, through elections and referendums, produces poor leadership and policy choices, that eventually lead to a broken system.
1.5.1. Pro: Democracy creates the rule of a fickle, dominating majority.
1.5.1.1. Con: Democratic systems usually have mechanisms and checks that prevent the majority from acting arbitrarily.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The majority are bound by the legal system and restrictions; therefore, they can not act arbitrarily or at their own discretion.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Legal systems can be changed and restrictions can be lifted.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Democratic systems usually have an opposition, whose job it is to hold the rulers at bay and accountable.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: In a system were the majority holds the power, a minority will never be able to change the outcome of a vote.
1.5.1.2. Pro: This is particularly true for referendums, in which the winner, the majority, takes it all.
1.5.1.3. Con: Other forms of government create the rule of dominating minority - either by some \(aristocracy\) or one \(monarchy\) - which is worse, with even fewer people involved.
1.5.1.4. Pro: When power is handed from one democratic leader to the next, the result is oftentimes a change of policy direction that undoes \(or at least does not continue\) what was done over the course of the preceding years.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: This can be seen in the U.S., where President Trump was recently elected on a platform [based largely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-rolling-back-obama-rules/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.988dda6cbafb) on repealing his predecessor’s accomplishments.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: The US government bureaucracy is [massive](https://www.volckeralliance.org/true-size-government) and its culture is [slow to change](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/gr3.pdf). The US [Constitution](https://www.cnn.com/2011/09/27/opinion/bennett-government-stalled/index.html) is designed to impede and slow down policymakers who must contend with a system of checks and balances that force political adversaries to make compromises. The result is chronic political [gridlock](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/04/25/political-gridlock-blocks-infrastructure-progress-and-costs-our-economy/) that prevents policymakers from implementing drastic changes.
1.5.1.4.1.2. Con: The current president really only gained power because of defects in the United State's election system. Were these flaws corrected, the platform of the sitting president would not have constituted such a rapid change.
1.5.1.4.1.3. Con: This issue could be addressed, by removing the two party system. This division of people \(which is ingrained in the United States' society\) causes many to vote simply via party lines, rather than where the issues matter. Yes, more options on a ballot might mean smaller vote totals for each candidate, but it would also cause the most optimal candidate for the people to be elected, since it wouldn't be simply voting for one candidate or their competition.
1.5.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Predominantly, two party voting is the natural result of having a directly elected chief executive, despite the fact that the US has many more than two political parties. The president would have to be replaced by a prime minister to make the system non-binary.
1.5.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: France has more then two parties. They also have a directly elected president whom is the chief executive. [\[French Parliament\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Parliament)
1.5.1.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: This is because France doesn't use FPTP. They instead use the two round runoff system for presidential elections, which despite not being the best voting method by a long shot, is still light-years better then FPTP. [\[Source\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_France#Electoral_system)
1.5.1.4.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: France's [current president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_French_presidential_election) and it's last 3 [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_French_presidential_election) [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_French_presidential_election) [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_French_presidential_election) before that all belong to different political parties.
1.5.1.5. Con: It is impossible to get 100% of the population supporting the same person, meaning that majority is the only viable option.
1.5.1.6. Con: Democracy provides the means to question inappropriate decisions taken earlier and correct the course if necessary without the use of force or violence.
1.5.1.6.1. Con: This is done via the constitutions and laws of the land. We do not directly go and vote to remove laws on the books. They are removed when they are found to be unconstitutional.
1.5.1.6.1.1. Con: In Switzerland, laws passed by the Federal Parliament can be removed by [referendum](https://www.ch.ch/en/demokratie/political-rights/referendum/). The same can be done at all levels of government.
1.5.1.6.2. Pro: Special interest groups lobby to have the voice of minorities heard. [What is the role of an interest group in a democracy?](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-role-an-interest-group-democracy-756695)
1.5.2. Pro: Democracy relies too much on laypeople to make decisions.
1.5.2.1. Con: The vast majority of decisions are made by politicians and their advisory teams; elections merely serve as a check to make sure politicians act in accordance with the will of the electorate.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Without knowledge of issues and contexts, choosing the right candidate or party becomes game of chance.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Representatives join party structures to get elected. Therefore they may be conflicted between party loyalties and their own assessments of what is best for their constituency. If there were more citizen involvement \(as the grandparent suggests\) then the representatives would be held to account more.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: A general election allows people to not have to vote on every bill.
1.5.2.1.4. Con: Representatives neglect their duties.
1.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: There are [instances](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/06/passing-unread-laws/) of bills in the US Congress being passed unread by the people in Congress. So representatives are either relying on the skills of others or acting under party orders.
1.5.2.1.5. Con: Even representatives are lay people, given the the immense variety of subject matters. Most are [lawyers](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_Working_with_Congress.pdf) which does not give them specialist insight into every topic.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Democracy cannot achieve its ideals because citizens are generally not sufficiently able and knowledgeable for the participation that is expected from them.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: This problem could be resolved through education.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Efforts to educate can be sabotaged by legislation. The uneducated can basically vote against education. Such a downward spiral would render efforts to educate void and ineffective.
1.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: A curriculum designed to educate the working public on civics, government, the principal issues facing the state, and key historical events that bear on these issues is practical, and not at all the same as an open-ended education about "everything". Gamifying this educational process is a valid approach, engaging the population by providing goals, enticements, competition, rewards and constraints.
1.5.2.2.1.3. Con: The human mind is not an infinitely malleable blank slate; some people simply cannot develop an in-depth understanding of complex political and economic topics, regardless of the efforts made to educate them.
1.5.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Notwithstanding brains and malleability the real danger in a democracy is people who know a bit and think they know it all, Whether in the electorate , the media or even in the representatives there are few real experts and they should be listened to. Sometimes an educated middle class generate 'noise' without the humility to own up to not knowing it all.
1.5.2.2.1.4. Con: Educating the entire populace in all relevant subjects, rather than having a few people with relevant knowledge make the decisions, would be a colossal expenditure of resources with little to no practical benefits.
1.5.2.2.1.4.1. Con: There would be practical benefits in educating the populace.
1.5.2.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: The original problem would be solved.
1.5.2.2.1.4.2. Con: People don't necessarily need to be vastly versed in every possible issue, just equipped enough to effectively research and consider issues overall.
1.5.2.2.1.4.2.1. Con: A variance in education levels across the country can lead to division as a result of people feeling more justified in their opinions, and thus be less likely to cede points.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: Democracy can potentially leverage the "[wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)" in a way that other systems cannot, meaning that the group can make a more intelligent decision than any single person.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Current communications technologies, such as mobile phones and the internet, make it possible to solicit individual input from entire populations, not just sample groups, giving the greatest possible odds that good input is not overlooked.
1.5.2.2.2.2. Con: Crowdsourced suggestions would still need to be put into final formulation and implemented, and this would required giving a relatively small group of people critical authority, putting potential for ultimate decision-making back into the hands of a potentially tyrannical few.
1.5.2.2.2.3. Con: Crowds are overwhelmingly unwise.
1.5.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: The [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect leads to experts being uncertain, and ignoramuses being confident. This leads to ignoramuses disproportionately affecting the group decision relative to their expertise.
1.5.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: People are often unaware of their ignorance/misconceptions and provide input regardless.
1.5.2.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: [30% of Republican primary voters nationally say they support bombing Agrabah, as do 20% of democrats](https://www.snopes.com/news/2015/12/18/agrabah-aladdin-republican-poll/). Agrabah is the fictional country from Aladdin.
1.5.2.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: [33% of americans don't believe in the theory of evolution](https://www.dailydot.com/via/dumb-things-30-percent-america-believes/), and even more believe that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.
1.5.2.2.2.3.3. Pro: In controlled tests, people [frequently](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160113-are-your-opinions-really-your-own) frequently adopt the view of the majority even when it is clearly incorrect.
1.5.2.2.2.3.4. Pro: Just a [few](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-stupidity-of-the-crowd/278188/) people being sure of a wrong answer can lead to a drop in group accuracy disproportionately large relative to the size of the group.
1.5.2.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.2.3.1.
1.5.2.2.2.5. Con: Wisdom of the crowd relies on people individually making up their own minds, the more people are influenced by each other, the greater the odds of achieving consensus around arbitrary positions. In a social media-driven world, large scale independent decision-making on political topics is unlikely.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: Voters should not be asked to make accurate judgements. When being consulted about policy it is incumbent on the authority to summarise the options neutrally in language accessible to the majority of the electorate.
1.5.2.2.4. Pro: Voters are frequently misinformed \(lied to\) or underinformed by their own elected representatives.
1.5.2.2.5. Con: All that is required of them is that they read the parties' policies, make a choice and get out to vote.
1.5.2.2.6. Pro: It is only rational for voters to remain ignorant and uninformed - and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. As individual votes have no chance of swaying decisions and as the costs of becoming informed can be enormous, there is little incentive to do so \([Rauch/Wittes, p. 5](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf)\).
1.5.2.2.6.1. Pro: The chance of exercising the pivotal vote is minuscule.
1.5.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: In the US presidential election \(based on 2008 data\), the chance that a randomly selected voter would be decisive was calculated at 1 in 60 million \([p. 323/324](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf)\).
1.5.2.2.6.1.2. Pro: The voting process is a costly 'show' which gives legitimacy to a process of choosing between two similar sets of liars jostling for money and trappings of state. \(My opinion expressed as a claim\).
1.5.2.2.7. Pro: Numerous examples illustrate the degree to which citizens are un- or misinformed.
1.5.2.2.7.1. Pro: Two-thirds of American adults can’t pass a basic financial literacy [test](https://fortune.com/2016/07/12/financial-literacy/).
1.5.2.2.7.1.1. Con: When a democracy does not educate its citizens sufficiently to operate as adults in society, then that democracy is broken.
1.5.2.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: That would be like the elite deliberately underfunding the education system to preserve their elite advantage and continually manipulating the less well educated to vote for status quo.
1.5.2.2.7.1.2. Con: [Other studies](https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3313-Finlit_Report_FINAL-5.11.16.pdf?x70028) have results that are less shocking, even if half of your adult population being financially illiterate is still a problem.
1.5.2.2.7.2. Pro: Large parts of the [British public](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) had a misguided perception of the EU, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted for leave.
1.5.2.2.7.2.1. Pro: Interested and informed voters could have easily found out that the populists' [numbers](https://www.rt.com/uk/346342-brexit-voters-ignorance-misinformation/) and "facts" about the EU are wrong.
1.5.2.2.7.2.1.1. Con: If more than the majority of citizens did not take use of such a possibility, it seems that this option was not so obvious and easy after all.
1.5.2.2.7.3. Pro: Citizens of many countries over-estimate the share of GDP spent on health services by a factor of two to five \([Ipsos MORI, s. 20](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.5.2.2.7.4. Pro: Citizens of Western countries routinely [over-estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2016/dec/13/europeans-massively-overestimate-muslim-population-poll-shows) the share of Muslims among the population, for example by a factor of 17 in the US and a factor of three in the UK.
1.5.2.2.7.5. Pro: Most people [vastly overestimate](https://borgenproject.org/us-foreign-aid-spending/) the percentage of a country's budget devoted to foreign aid.
1.5.2.2.7.6. Pro: Citizens routinely over-estimate the share among the population that finds homosexuality unacceptable, for example in the Netherlands by a factor of seven and in Germany by a factor of four \([Ipsos MORI, s. 10](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.5.2.3. Con: There are ways to solve this particular issue without jeopardizing the basic principles of democracy.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: If everybody who had to vote on an issue always had to first pass a basic test, in the context of the issue being voted on, then democracy would be better.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: The feasibility of this suggestion hinges on the ability to produce an objective, purely politically neutral, informational test. Creating such an agreeable test in a politically polarized society is dubious.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Citizens in democracies are generally not willing to make the efforts necessary to keep democracy running as intended.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: Willingness to make an effort is tied to convenience. New communications technologies like the internet, mobile devices, and social media platforms, as they are integrated into political participation, make it vastly more convenient for citizens to fulfill their civic duties.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: In many countries, for example [throughout the EU's east](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-turnout/), the turnout in national elections is under two thirds. This indicates that many citizens are not willing to make an effort.
1.5.3. Pro: People elect a leader who is best amongst the available choices rather than elect the best of all individuals.
1.5.3.1. Con: [Write-in candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate) are a possibility in some democracies, so this is not strictly true.
1.5.3.2. Con: It is impossible for voters to know which individual is the "best of all."
1.5.3.3. Con: There is no system that selects the best of all individuals to rule, so this is a poor criterion for determining a "failed" system.
1.5.3.4. Pro: Often, politicians are not the individuals best suited for a post, but those with extensive networks or financial resources.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: It is not uncommon for politicians in democracies to be part of a country's financial elite.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: In the US, [President Trump and the significant portion of his cabinet members](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-elite-capture-of-poli_b_13710494) belong to a class of well-connected and well-capitalized citizens.
1.5.3.5. Con: Electing from all individuals would require even those who do not want to govern to take part in government. This can hardly be in the interest of society.
1.5.3.5.1. Con: A period of government service could be mandated, similar to the way that military service is in some democracies.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: Someone who doesn't want to govern is arguably the best kind of leader, because they're not corrupted by the drive to gain power.
1.5.3.5.2.1. Con: But this also makes them the worst kind of leader, because they can be easily swayed due to lack of interest or proper training on a situation that might arise. They could also cause a shift of power from the individual being forced to make decisions \(who would choose to not decide/make someone else decide\), to the one who is secretly making the choices beneath them.
1.5.3.5.3. Pro: Electing someone who does not want to govern forces someone to take on specific kinds of work against their will.
1.5.3.5.3.1. Con: Conscription does the same, but is not seen as against society's interest when there is a need for soldiers.
1.5.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Many do take on the view that conscription should be abolished.
1.5.3.5.4. Pro: Those who do not want to govern probably won't be well-incentived to govern well.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Some politicians are elected upon their status and popularity regardless of how capable they are to carry out their duties. Popularity over Competence.
1.5.4. Pro: Limited terms and the need for re-election lead to short-term thinking and action of politicians.
1.5.4.1. Con: Term limits and the need for re-election should incentivize politicians to act in ways that would appeal to the widest number of voters possible.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Politicians usually have to appeal to their base in order to get fielded.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the United States, high-level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a [party's base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_\(politics\)) in order to gain the party's nomination and thus be guaranteed ballot access.
1.5.4.2. Pro: As a result, representative democracy systematically ignores the interests of future generations.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Ecological degradation, technological risk, nuclear waste and public debt - all this was caused by past or present generations, but not resolved.
1.5.4.3. Pro: In comparison, [China as an authoritarian regime](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190318-can-we-reinvent-democracy-for-the-long-term) has been incredibly successful at long-term planning.
1.5.5. Con: Democracy is designed for self-correction: free and fair elections, a system of laws, and protection of human rights, ensure that the people always have the means and opportunity to avert disaster, provided the system is upheld.
1.5.6. Con: Democratic systems are protected by the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law) \(division of power; constitution\) in order to prevent bad leadership choices from jeopardizing the existence of the political system.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Government officials can be [impeached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment) if they violate the rule of law or abuse their office.
1.6. Pro: Citizens can't be counted on to do what is necessary to sustain democracy.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.6.
1.6.3. Pro: The relative stability of democracy over several generations leads to people who have known nothing else becoming complacent regarding the [price paid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address) to win their freedom.
1.6.3.1. Con: Voter turnout in numerous democracies has been rising recently. This points to the opposite of complacency.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The 2018 midterm elections in the United States saw the highest voter turnout [in decades](https://www.fairvote.org/voter_turnout#voter_turnout_101). Turnout during past presidential elections is equally higher than in the past.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: Voter turnout in the 2019 elections for the European parliament was [the highest](https://election-results.eu/turnout/) in almost 25 years.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: The rise in Populism, cause or effect of dissatisfaction ? Either way It pulls out voters but not necessarily engagement.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Democracy has shown that it can survive crises - which, in turn, has become problematic since it has the potential to produce complacency and a tendency to underestimate present and future challenges \([Runciman, p. xvi](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=T6HGDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=democracy+complacency&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifyrL7saTlAhXUKqYKHd7DCPAQ6AEISzAF#v=snippet&q=complacent&f=false)\).
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: The Confidence Trap is yet another example of Groupthink. Democracies in themselves do not have memories \(are not sentient beings\). Many examples of 'democratic survival' involve mavericks. such as Churchill. who stand up for ideas before the herd turns to follow them.
1.6.4. Con: A characteristic feature of democracy is a strong [civil society](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c6c2e74e5274a72bc45240e/488_What_is_Civil_Society.pdf): all forms of social action carried out by individuals or groups who are neither connected to, nor managed by, the state.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Politics and and civil society are closely interrelated. This indicates that citizens are able to hold the political elites at bay and formulate their demands.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: [Civil societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society#Democracy) within democratic systems build shared values, which are transferred into the political sphere and help to hold society together, facilitating an understanding of the interconnections of society and interests within it.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: A strong civil society is often seen as an important driving force of good governance \([p.302](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.824.2905&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: A well-functioning institutional framework \(including reliable institutions; credible civil servants and politicians\) has a strong, positive effect on civil society \([p.302](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.824.2905&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.6.5. Pro: Citizens can be subtly wooed and 'nudged' over many years to achieve voting behaviour that is at odds with their own needs and the needs of society in general.
1.6.5.1. Pro: One example is the cumulative 'demonising' of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK. Originally his ideas were mocked, then the reporting in mainstream media just filtered him out. This is not accident it is manipulation, but it illustrates one facet of democracy
1.7. Pro: Democratic decision-making is too slow-moving to maintain social stability, given the scale and complexity of today's world, including the massively disruptive effects of modern technology.
1.7.1. Con: The slow pace of democratic decision-making is an advantage.
1.7.1.1. Con: The slow pace of democracies can be a disadvantage, for example when it comes to clearing red tape and preventing over-bureaucratization.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: For example, [China](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21161067/coronavirus-covid19-china) mobilised against CV19 very quickly once it got over the 'deny and hide' phase endemic to [authoritarian regimes.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-10/china-s-response-to-the-coronavirus-is-not-a-model-for-the-u-s)
1.7.1.1.2. Con: New Zealand is being hailed as one of the world's [best democracies](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/how-pr-completely-transformed-new-zealand-politics-metiria-turei-green-party-co-leader/) yet it was also fleet of foot in dealing with [CV19](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-government-coronavirus-response-a4462976.html).
1.7.1.1.3. Pro: Westminster is seen as having a[relatively](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/has-westminsters-winner-takes-all-mentality-hampered-parliaments-response-to-the-pandemic/) slow response to CV19
1.7.1.2. Pro: If laws can be churned out quickly, there’s less certainty for investors to know their projected profits will come about, detracting from investment and ruining the economy
1.7.1.2.1. Con: Being slow with new laws, and the application of existing ones, has not helped the vast mass of citizens, even investing citizens, during our crashes.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: The uncertainty for investor generally comes about a pendent law \(waiting for approvement for example\), not a about a law changing.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: Putting the needs of business over the needs of the people leads to unchecked capitalism, that leads to ever-growing economic inequality, that [pushes populations towards authoritarianism](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/14/is-capitalism-a-threat-to-democracy).
1.7.1.2.3.1. Pro: Suggesting that Democracies exist primarily to serve investors \(a small proportion of the citizen mass\) is a clarion call to revolution. To avoid failure democracies must [adapt](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-29/capitalism-needs-reform-not-the-risk-of-revolution) and at least seem to serve most citizens.
1.7.1.2.3.2. Pro: Or pushes them towards populism, which might be a precursor to authoritarianism.
1.7.1.2.4. Pro: For democracy on the level of the European Union it has been argued that the slowness of the democratic process contributes to the possibility of intensive public scrutiny of policy-making \([Moravcsik, p. 612](http://aei.pitt.edu/9136/1/Moravcsik92.pdf)\).
1.7.1.2.5. Pro: Slowness, deliberation and a low speed stabilize the political system. As studies show, participants in focus groups who engage in fast thinking tend towards "[general negativity, even hostility, towards politics](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.12113)". Slow thinking produces more productive and forgiving attitudes.
1.7.1.2.6. Pro: Liberal and democratic politics are built on and meant to be slow, especially in the legislative arena where this allows for deliberative and considerate debate and for taking into account a variety of viewpoints \([Scheuerman, p. 49-56](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3235508)\).
1.7.1.3. Pro: Democracy is slow in order to / as a result of involving as many actors as possible.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Many actors can be involved in a process in a fast way. What creates a slow pace in a democracy is not the number of people involved, but how they are involved.
1.7.2. Pro: Destructive minorities and special interests may slow down democratic procedures and progress in order to achieve their goals.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Business special interest groups invest in moving government policy in directions favorable to them, that may also be unsustainable in the longer run. For instance,[the oil industry has spent billions to control the climate change conversation](http://How the oil industry has spent billions to control the climate change conversation).
1.7.3. Pro: Technology has enabled new ways of [subverting](https://www.dw.com/en/what-role-did-cambridge-analytica-play-in-the-brexit-vote/a-43151460) democracy.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Technology has enabled a new form of autocracy - [datacracy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bhaskarchakravorti/2018/12/19/the-big-question-for-2019-can-democracy-be-saved-from-datacracy/) - as a rival.
1.7.4. Pro: Democracy's naturally slow pace can get in the way of rapid response when it seems to be called for \(eg: regulating rapidly advancing science and technology, combating climate change\).
1.8. Con: Elections make it possible for democracies to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances and demands. When one approach isn't working anymore, democracy has a mechanism to try something different.
1.8.1. Pro: Democracy helps prevent rebellions and civil wars.
1.8.1.1. Con: Social tensions can still turn into mass actions, which points to failings in some democracies.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Spain is a mature democracy within the EU, yet it has [many tensions](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2019/news/the-brief-before-it-is-too-late/) - not just Catalonia. It is unlikely to cause a Civil War but a general strike is on the road to rebellion.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: The history of Ireland \(e.g. [the Easter Rising](https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/easter-rising)\) and Northern Ireland [\(the Troubles\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) shows failings in the way democracies have been run.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Analysis of empirical evidence suggests that [strong democratic institutions and the onset of civil war are negatively related](https://www.brookings.edu/research/democracy-and-civil-war/).
1.8.1.3. Pro: [Inclusive political processes](https://www.brookings.edu/research/democracy-and-civil-war/) offer potential rebels opportunities to resolve their grievances within the political system and raise the costs of rebellion, thereby removing a key incentive for pursuing armed conflict.
1.8.1.4. Con: While the likelihood of a civil war starting is lower in democratic regimes than in other states, the ability of [ending such conflicts is limited.](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2014/05/20/why-cant-democracies-settle-civil-wars/)
1.8.1.4.1. Pro: Several of the [most protracted](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2014/05/20/why-cant-democracies-settle-civil-wars/) civil wars during the last five decades are found in democratic countries, including Israel/Palestine, Colombia, India, and Northern Ireland.
1.8.1.4.2. Pro: [In democracies](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2014/05/20/why-cant-democracies-settle-civil-wars/), the fear of negative public opinion can prevent political leaders from seeking an end to conflicts. The political costs of being seen as someone backing down and talking to terrorists can be very high.
1.8.1.4.3. Pro: The strong and inflexible institutional structures in democracies can be barriers to finding deals.
1.8.1.4.3.1. Pro: Most democratic constitutions deliberately focus on [checks and balances](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2014/05/20/why-cant-democracies-settle-civil-wars/), making it difficult for government negotiators to offer or accept a compromise that may involve subsequent formal decisions at several levels or over a longer period of time.
1.8.1.4.3.2. Pro: T[ransparency and accountability](http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2014/05/20/why-cant-democracies-settle-civil-wars/) in democracies make it harder to provide rebel groups with selective incentives - money or positions - that may lead them to a peace agreement.
1.8.1.5. Pro: Democracy allows for and has provided prosperity to the general populace.
1.8.1.5.1. Pro: [Democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_and_economic_growth) foster the sort of fast acting governmental regulation and [civil liberties](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/05/democracy-boost-economic-growth/) that makes economies [grow more quickly](http://news.mit.edu/2019/study-democracy-fosters-economic-growth-acemoglu-0307) than other systems.
1.8.1.5.2. Con: Prosperity and democracy are correlated in the present day, but correlation does not equal causation.
1.8.1.5.2.1. Pro: We have a biased view on the success of Democracy from the actions of the United States. They are the leading example of what a democracy is "supposed to look like" in our world, and they have been for the past 242 years. We've correlated the successes of the United States with the governing system it is running under, rather than on the societies and people that have shaped it to what it is today. This might be why prosperity and democracy appear correlated
1.8.1.5.3. Con: Authoritarian regimes such as [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China) are catching up rapidly in economic terms. This suggests prosperity of the general populace is not unique to democracies.
1.8.1.5.4. Con: There are plenty of countries among those with the highest GDP per capita that are anything but democracy, for example Quatar, Singapore, Brunei and Kuwait.
1.8.1.5.4.1. Con: GDP per capita in itself is not an accurate representation of a country's prosperity. In many of the countries mentioned a privileged minority causes the GDP per capita to appear high, while the majority of people live in poverty.
1.8.1.6. Pro: Democracy forces decision-makers to pay attention to the needs of the people to assure that they have their votes.
1.8.1.6.1. Con: Democracy has evolved to candidates pandering to the people they are being elected to by. It's essentially become a popularity contest, where anyone will say anything to get elected. Just look at the 2016 election, where no press was bad press, and the candidate with the "worst press", still managed to win. Once in office, the leader doesn't have to worry about who got them in that position, just the fact that they are there and in control.
1.8.1.6.1.1. Con: This may be a result of not democracy itself but rather the archaic chose one system we use to elect our leaders.
1.8.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: If voters were not required to only vote for one candidate but were instead allowed to vote for as many candidates as they wanted, the 2016 election wouldn't of been a contest between the most hated presidential nominees in US history!
1.8.1.7. Pro: Voting serves as a "release valve" for citizens to express their dissent, which makes it less likely for them to take up arms against the government.
1.8.1.7.1. Con: At the same time, voting might disappoint and anger people who feel like their votes lead to no tangible changes - whereas they might simply accept their powerlessness if they couldn't vote at all.
1.8.1.7.1.1. Con: That could in theory happen, but it appears that when people are angry at votes leading to no tangible changes, what they do is vote for someone else.
1.8.1.7.2. Pro: This is assuming that the outcome of the decision the public votes on, is on par with the majority of citizens voting. This pertains to democracy in an ideal world.
1.8.1.8. Pro: Elections, unless it becomes too visible that they're corrupt and fixed, give a clear indication of who the legitimate successor of the current ruler is, which helps to prevent succession crises that appear in monarchies and dictatorships.
1.8.1.9. Pro: Democracy provides forums where voices of various sections of society can be heard and their concerns addressed appropriately.
1.8.1.9.1. Con: Democracy is not [deliberative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy). Political leaders decide for people and then buy people in through lies, deceit and fear.[\[1\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0275074009356467)
1.8.1.9.1.1. Con: Not all democracies are the same: while some suffer from lies, deceit and fears, others thrive.
1.8.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: In the [democratic Swiss State](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-best-governments-in-the-world.html), the people have the foremost political power, giving them increased opportunities to express their opinion by way of popular voting.
1.8.1.9.2. Con: Democracy, especially as a legislative system, fails to address the needs and important interests of oppressed or historically oppressed individuals.
1.8.1.9.2.1. Pro: Significant civil rights victories in democratic nations have been won in the courts, rather than the legislature.
1.8.1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Same-gender marriage in the U.S., a democratic country, was [legalized nationwide by the federal Supreme Court](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556), not Congress.
1.8.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Same gender marriage in Taiwan, a democratic nation, was declared legal by its [high court](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/24/529841027/taiwans-high-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-is-legal-in-a-first-for-asia); the Parliament merely [created a legal framework](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/17/724222598/taiwans-parliament-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-a-first-in-asia) as mandated two years later.
1.8.1.9.2.1.3. Con: The high court justices' appointment are ratified by legislature, which understands the politics of the appointees.
1.8.1.9.2.2. Con: The three most significant civil rights issues for the oppressed in the US were a product of legislation, not jurisprudence: The end of slavery and granting of citizenship to former slaves, women's suffrage and the Civil Rights Act.
1.8.1.9.3. Pro: Which is why democracy works at a local level. Members of the community can come in and address the major concerns that face the community, and most of the time, these concerns can actually get addressed. On a national level, especially when there are millions of citizens, it gets more difficult to provide the voices of the individual to be heard. Instead the voices of organizations and corporations begin to cover up the quiet voice of the individual, especially if the individual doesn't have $
1.8.1.9.4. Con: Democracy creates the illusion of providing all people a fair hearing for their ideas and concerns. However, usually the wealthy, aristocrats and big business tend to hold sway in society.
1.8.1.9.4.1. Con: Whether the people have a real voice or just the illusion of one is immaterial; either is equally effective at preventing them from taking up arms against their rulers.
1.8.1.9.4.2. Con: Democracy creates the opportunity for people to influence power in their own interest, however those who hold wealth and power have created the illusion that their interests and the people's interests are one and the same.
1.8.1.9.4.3. Pro: The members of the American Congress are much wealthier than the vast majority of American citizens.
1.8.1.9.4.3.1. Pro: As of 2015, more than half of all members of Congress had net worth of [more than one million dollars](http://1,029,505/56,355). That's more than 18 times the net worth of the average American household.
1.8.1.9.4.3.2. Pro: The median net worth of American families has declined by a third between 2007 and 2013. The average member of Congress, at the same time, saw his/her net worth [increase by 20%](http://1,029,505/56,355) over the same time span.
1.9. Con: Modern technology can be used to make democracy work fully as intended -- we now have the tools to address weaknesses of the past.
1.9.1. Pro: Dialogue to create consensus between people, rather than 'parties', can [now be facilitated.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50127713)
1.9.2. Con: Social Media represents an existential threat to democracy, as citizens are quickly misinformed, provoked, and then polarized by a small minority \([10%](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/) of Twitter Users create 80% of Tweets\)
1.9.3. Pro: Email, messaging apps, and social media platforms enable instant and massive participation in surveys, petitions and other collective grassroots efforts.
1.9.4. Pro: Public [transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28behavior%29) is vastly improved by easy online access to information, contributing to more accountable institutions and businesses, and a more confidently informed population.
1.9.5. Pro: [Big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) can be used to analyze massive amounts of information, to uncover and describe socioeconomic and cultural issues with great precision.
1.9.5.1. Con: Unfortunately, there is too much scope to affect the [use and interpretation](https://www.brinknews.com/how-trustworthy-is-big-data/) of data. Big data may be more accurate \(dubious\) but certainly more resilient. However the profession of [framing](https://www.exlservice.com/big-problems-with-big-data-the-case-for-right-data-vs-big-data) and then describing any [analysis](https://www.experfy.com/blog/five-common-biases-in-big-data) is open to self bias or externallly induced bias.. Massive data does not produce [massive truths](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/beware-of-big-data-science-says-it-s-not-as-reliable-as-you-think-1.829538) unless [used properly](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/big-data-ai-bias/).
1.9.6. Pro: Widespread, instant online communication allows people to continually speak directly to power \(government, business and other controlling institutions\), in a high-visibility, non-violent way.
1.9.6.1. Con: The ability to speak to power has been there before, but perhaps slower \([F2F,](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/f2f) Lobbying, Research, Petitions...\). The biggest step change in recent years is the speed and reach of two way conversations with 'power' using online technologies.
1.9.7. Con: Technology companies, who are very often a core element in any 'support' for 'process', are there to earn money. Benevolence, Neutrality, Humanity etc. may be at direct odds with their responsibility to shareholders
1.10. Pro: The open and competitive nature of democracy makes it vulnerable to crippling exploitation.
1.10.1. Pro: The political class in democracies has and continues to identify systemic loopholes, allowing them to game the system.
1.10.1.1. Con: Loopholes can be closed.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: If such loopholes benefit the political class, and the lawmakers, they would not be enacted.
1.10.1.1.2. Pro: The 2009 [expenses scandal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal) in the UK closed a number of loopholes and resulted in criminal prosecution of wrong-doing.
1.10.1.2. Con: This is an argument against certain \(defective\) democracies, not against democracy as a form of government in general.
1.10.1.3. Pro: [Gerrymandering in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States) allows a party to lose the popular vote yet win elections \(the practice has proven resistant to correction, even though the issue is well-known and has been challenged in the courts\).
1.10.1.4. Pro: Voter suppression, involving rule changes and other tactics designed to deter specific groups of voters, are used in prominent democracies: [USA, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression).
1.10.1.4.1. Pro: America is ranked very low for [electoral integrity](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/is-america-a-democracy-if-so-why-does-it-deny-millions-the-vote?fbclid=IwAR1Yd4RZk9rmQNzy9v2ounhCyi1_l5gqauU0dP4lREfzEeRRHsSx7swO7Ys).
1.10.1.5. Con: The [acquiescence of the elites to democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/) is a necessary factor in its emergence and persistence.
1.10.1.6. Pro: One such example in the United States is the [Electoral College](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html), which was originally created by the Framers of the Constitution out of [fear of direct democracy](https://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-reason-for-the-electoral-college/).
1.10.1.6.1. Con: The electoral college is not a "loophole"; presidential elections were not originally intended to be determined by popular vote.
1.10.1.6.2. Con: This would be a loophole in the United States' defined form of Democracy. Democracy, at its core, does not have this concept of an electoral college, nor does it have the concept of a two party system \(a huge part of democracy in the US\). The flawed system that has been made popular by the United States \(which worked when the US was still a developing and rather small country\) contain these large flaws.
1.10.1.6.2.1. Con: After [2000 years of development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy), democratic government should be measured by its best working examples -- available data over pure speculation. .
1.10.1.6.2.2. Pro: Under Article 4 Section 4 is the guarantee of Republic form of government in the United States not a democracy. I do not understand why no one seems to remember the foundation of the Union documents.
1.10.2. Pro: Democracy, by welcoming diversity of views and protecting people's right to dissent, is vulnerable to attack from within in ways that other systems of government are not.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The Nazis created mechanisms to turn the openness and freedom afforded by democracy against it.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: Goebbels openly expressed his intention to [exploit the tools of democracy](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theprodigalgreek.wordpress.com/2013/06/23/as-the-wolf-bursts-into-the-flock-so-we-come/amp/) to undermine it.
1.10.2.1.2. Pro: Nazi propaganda used [a technique called the big lie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie) to undermine concepts of truth.
1.10.2.1.3. Pro: The Nazis [dehumanised](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda) sections of the population through various media.
1.10.2.1.4. Pro: Nazi propaganda [deified](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A627113c9-2175-46d0-9a08-08db0d94e788) Hitler as a messianic figure.
1.10.2.1.5. Pro: The Nazis used in-group and projection bias to encourage subconscious assumptions of shared values and positions, reinforcing a herd mentality, and reducing opposition.
1.10.2.1.6. Con: Irrespective of the universal \(theoretical\) attributes of democracy, the resilience of democratic systems must be analyzed in the respective historical context.
1.10.2.1.6.1. Pro: The particular circumstances in Europe as well as political and legal weaknesses made the Weimar Republic highly vulnerable.
1.10.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: [Weimar](https://www.historyhit.com/principal-weaknesses-of-the-weimar-republic/) was characterized by political instability and discontent: Right wing nationalist and monarchist groups were against the republic, preferring an authoritarian system or empire.
1.10.2.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: [Right-wing supporters](https://www.historyhit.com/principal-weaknesses-of-the-weimar-republic/) committed actions such as the failed Kapp-Luttwitz coup attempt and the Beer Hall Putsch.
1.10.2.1.6.1.2. Pro: [The Weimar Constitution](https://www.historyhit.com/principal-weaknesses-of-the-weimar-republic/) was flawed in particular due its system of proportional representation and Article 48, which gave the president power to issue decrees in ‘emergencies’, something Hitler used to pass new laws without consulting the Reichstag.
1.10.2.1.6.1.2.1. Con: Governments in all democratic systems have special rights or "emergency powers" in the case of emergency \([p.10](https://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-08032017-185031/unrestricted/Rooney.pdf)\).
1.10.2.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: The existence of emergency powers remains an issue [in modern democracies](http://www.publicseminar.org/2019/03/emergency-powers-and-trump-lessons-from-carl-schmitt/).
1.10.2.1.6.1.2.1.2. Con: Emergency powers can be misused.
1.10.2.1.6.1.3. Pro: The governments of Weimar have failed to successfully end the [economic hardship](https://www.historyhit.com/principal-weaknesses-of-the-weimar-republic/) of large parts of the German population.
1.10.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.10.2.3. Pro: Democracies seem ineffective in holding leaders to account when they demonstrate extreme abuses of power.
1.10.2.3.1. Con: Given an election cycle and term limits, it doesn't matter how effectively leader are held to account. What truly matters is if the abuses are correctable.
1.10.2.4. Con: The events of recent years \(Arab Spring in particular\) show that other forms of society post feudalism allow vulnerabilities in their system.
