Discussion Name: Should Turkey be part of the European Union?

1. Turkey should become a member of the European Union.

1.1.1. Pro: Turkey is predicted to be the [12th richest country](https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-to-the-eu-lets-talk-membership/) in the world, with a larger economy than Italy by 2030.
1.1.2. Pro: If Turkey joined, this would disrupt the current balance of power established with the [Lisbon treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon).
1.1.2.1. Con: If Turkey joined, this might trigger a much needed update of the Lisbon treaty towards more cooperative and participatory EU decision making.
1.1.3. Con: Turkey's economy would be a large asset to the EU.

1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.3.3.

1.1.3.5. Pro: Turkey is the EU's [4th largest trading export partner](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/turkey/). Being within the EU would increase the size and power of the EU as a trading bloc.
1.1.3.6. Con: The low cost of labour within Turkey could [encourage companies](http://dergipark.gov.tr/download/article-file/46290) to relocate to Turkey from other EU states, costing EU member states jobs and losses in tax revenue \(p.172\).
1.1.3.7. Con: Migration of low cost workers into the EU from Turkey is likely to have a [depressive effect](http://dergipark.gov.tr/download/article-file/46290) on wages \(p.173\).

1.2.1.2. Pro: Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, stated that Turkey [would not join the EU](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/juncker-and-schulz-say-no-to-turkey-in-last-tv-duel/) while he remained President.
1.2.1.3. Pro: In 2017, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, the Vice President of the European Parliament, [stated](https://www.euronews.com/2017/04/10/turkey-is-no-longer-an-eu-candidate-mep-says) that "nobody believes in Brussels ... that Turkey will eventually join the European Union".
1.2.2. Pro: The citizens of the EU do not want Turkey to join the union.
1.2.2.1. Pro: According to a recent survey, [77% of EU citizens](https://www.politico.eu/article/resistance-against-turkish-eu-membership-highest-in-germany-poll/) do not want Turkey to be allowed to join the union.
1.2.3. Pro: The governments of current EU member states are against Turkey joining the union.

1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The Republic of Cyprus has used [its veto power](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/cyprus-and-the-nato-eu-divide/) [several times](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/turkey-s-relationship-eu-it-s-complicated-summit-trade-migration-cyprus-syria-war) to block EU-Turkish negotiations.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Turkey invaded [occupied a part of the Cyprus island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus) and has refused to acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus as the sole authority on the island.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: If both the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey were in the European Union, it may become easier to resolve the conflict dividing Cyprus into two parts. This would help end [unequal economic development](https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/04/22/economic-convergence-failing-cyprus/) and help reunification of divided families.
1.2.3.2. Pro: French President, Emmanuel Macron, has declared that [Turkey's recent actions should prevent the advancement of talks concerning the possibility of Turkey joining the EU](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42586108).

1.2.5. Con: The governments of several European countries have expressed [support](https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-eu-relations-which-countries-are-for-or-against-turkish-accession/a-40381533) for Turkey joining the EU.

1.3. Con: The European Union should focus on its numerous internal problems before considering any further expansion.
1.3.1. Con: The EU currently has an issue with [its aging population](https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-to-the-eu-lets-talk-membership/). Turkey has the workforce to supply the labour pool Europe needs.

1.3.6.

1.4.3. Pro: Turkey has [developed a network](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/how-turkeys-geopolitical-ambitions-could-change-the-middle-24207) of allies in the Middle East, such as Qatar, which the EU [has been seeking](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/40967/EU%20and%20Qatar%20sign%20a%20Cooperation%20Arrangement) to "enhance bilateral relations" with.

This would put the EU further at odds with Saudi Arabia if Turkey became an EU state.
1.4.3.2. Con: The EU does not need help from Turkey to enhance bilateral relations with Middle Eastern nations.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Qatar and the European Union [already have](https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/28/02/2018/Strategic-ties-between-Qatar-and-EU-strong) close economic and trade relations.

1.4.4.4.2.3.3.2.7.1.1. Pro: Obama’s [failure](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/06/20/opinions/libya-chaos-civilian-deaths-bergen-sims/index.html) in Libya made him reluctant to intervene in Syria.
1.4.4.4.2.3.3.2.8. Con: NATO has displayed tremendous [unity and efficacy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/examples-of-natos-accomplishments-in-recent-years) in its operations countering piracy off of the coast of Somalia.
1.4.4.4.2.3.3.2.9. Con: NATO command is more [streamlined and effective](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/examples-of-natos-accomplishments-in-recent-years) than ever.
1.4.4.4.2.4. Con: Russia has significant influence in Turkey’s immediate neighborhood.
1.4.4.4.2.4.1. Pro: Russia has significant control over the situation in Syria which has major implications for Turkey.
1.4.4.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: Russia has [notably propped up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War) the Assad regime.
1.4.4.4.2.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.1.
1.4.4.4.2.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.
1.4.4.4.3. Pro: Russia has recently offered Turkey [new trade opportunities](https://www.rt.com/business/435978-russia-turkey-ditching-dollar/).
1.4.4.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.2.1.
1.4.4.4.4. Pro: Erdogan and Putin have met at least 11 times since August 2016 to increase relations between the two countries. [Included](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/08/27/in-familiar-dance-turkey-warms-to-russia-as-us-ties-unravel/) in these talks are plans for Russia to build a nuclear power plant in Turkey.
1.4.4.4.5. Pro: Turkey and Russia are [increasing](http://tass.com/politics/1029920) their military cooperation.
1.4.4.4.6. Con: Turkey's relationship with Russia has [deteriorated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34933608) rapidly in the past.
1.4.4.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.2.2.
1.4.4.4.6.2. Pro: Turkey and Russia have a history of military conflict.
1.4.4.4.6.2.1. Pro: Conflicts between the Ottomans and the Russian Empire were [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Russo-Turkish_wars#List_of_conflicts) until the end of the First World War.
1.4.4.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Russia has undergone significant changes, including one of the world's most violent [revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution), making these conflicts an irrelevant thing of the past.
1.4.4.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Turkey is no longer the Ottoman Empire, which had territorial ambitions that conflicted with Russia.
1.4.4.4.7. Pro: [Polls indicate](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2018/09/27/458537/snapshot-turkish-public-opinion-toward-european-union/) that 57% of Turkish citizens are in favor of a lasting alliance with Russia.
1.4.4.4.8. Pro: Both Russia and Turkey stand together in [opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Turkey_relations) to US Sanctions.
1.4.5. Con: The EU and Turkey no longer have a common geopolitical orientation. The long-standing republican tradition of Turkey [established by Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_Reforms) has shifted [towards a theocracy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/25/the-guardian-view-on-erdogans-turkey-illiberal-democrat-takes-power) under the rule of Erdoğan and is no longer compatible with the liberal democratic orientation of the EU.
1.4.6. Pro: Natural gas pipelines, which are of [huge strategic](https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-opens-tanap-pipeline-that-will-bring-azeri-gas-to-europe/a-44192422) importance to the EU, currently run through Turkey.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Ruprecht Polenz, the former chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the German Parliament has [previously said](http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/wp2-2011) ‘the supreme importance of secure energy supplies for our economic development now and in future makes it seem sensible to incorporate Turkey into the EU, and thus make it part of the common energy supply area into which the EU ought to develop" \(4\).
1.4.6.2. Con: The European Commission has called for the EU to go [carbon neutral by 2050](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6543_en.htm). The EU should no longer concern itself with natural gas, the pipelines for which run through Turkey.
1.4.7. Con: Turkey is much less in need of the EU geopolitically than the EU is in need of Turkey.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Turkey has one of the [most powerful](https://www.businessinsider.com/11-most-powerful-militaries-in-the-world-2014-4?r=US&IR=T) militaries in the world.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Turkey has a [strong](http://www.tc-america.org/issues-information/us-turkey-relations-27.htm) relationship with the US, one of the most [powerful](https://www.businessinsider.es/ranked-the-25-most-powerful-nations-on-earth-2018-6?r=UK&IR=T) countries in the world.
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: The US has many military bases in Turkey, some of which house [nuclear missiles](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-11/news/us-nuclear-weapons-turkey-raise-alarm).
1.4.7.2.2. Con: Relations between the US and Turkey are [deteriorating](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/world/europe/turkey-united-states-tensions.html) rapidly.
1.4.7.2.2.1. Pro: [72%](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/11/the-u-s-turkey-relationship-is-worse-off-than-you-think/) of Turks view the US as a major threat to Turkey.
1.4.7.2.2.2. Pro: Turkey recently entered negotiations to purchase a missile system from Russia. This act [greatly angered](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-12/24/c_137694030.htm) the US.
1.4.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.
1.4.7.5. Con: If Turkey ever got in a significant geopolitical disagreement with the EU, it could cause the EU to end the [customs union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union%E2%80%93Turkey_Customs_Union) between the two. Given the [economic benefits](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/08/29/the-eu-and-turkey-need-each-other-could-upgrading-the-customs-union-be-the-key/) this customs union has had for Turkey, the economic costs of losing the geopolitical favour of the EU could be enormous for Turkey.
1.4.8. Pro: Turkey is hugely reliant on the EU for support with the crisis in Syria, particularly in terms of their [refugee agreement](https://www.dw.com/en/the-eu-turkey-refugee-agreement-a-review/a-43028295).
1.4.9. Pro: If Turkey is a member of the EU, the EU will have more influence over the [Bosporus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporus). This will help the EU to exert pressure on and influence Russia.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Indeed the Bosporus access separates the Black sea from Mediterranean Sea. The passage trough this strait can be blocked to Russian military and commercial ships reducing Russia’s influence in Middle East[en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_naval_facility_in_Tartus) and diminishing their power at a general level.
1.4.9.2. Con: Admission to the EU is not a tool to increase the Union's geopolitical power over another country. It is based on [accession criteria](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/accession-criteria_en) alone.
1.5. Pro: Historically, Turkey and its predecessor states were always part of Europe culturally, politically and economically.
1.5.1. Pro: [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople), now Istanbul, was one of the main sources of power for the Roman Empire.
1.5.2. Con: Historical links do not provide a decisive reason to join what is fundamentally a modern political and economic organisation.
1.5.2.1. Con: Establishing that there are historic links between Turkey and the rest of the EU is important. It demonstrates the Turkey and Europe have more commonalities than differences. This helps to counter xenophobic and Islamophobic opposition to Turkey joining the EU.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The [European Coal and Steel Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community) \(ECSC\), an important precursor to the formation of the EU, was founded after World War II for a [very contemporary political reason](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/history/1945-1959_en): integrating the coal and steel industries in Western Europe in order to prevent another war.
1.5.2.3. Pro: The [Maastricht Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty), which created the EU, was [focused on enhancing European political and economic integration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/European-Union). It created a single currency, a unified foreign and security policy, and common citizenship rights.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: There is no fundamental reason why such political and economic integration shouldn't extend to include Turkey.
1.5.3. Pro: The Ottoman Empire was a [major part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) of the European political sphere.
1.6. Con: Turkey is not willing to play by the rules of the EU.
1.6.1. Con: The current ruling political force in Turkey draws some of its political support from rhetoric against [the rules and values of the EU](https://ahvalnews.com/eu-turkey/turkeys-eu-fairy-tale-over).
1.6.2. Pro: There are clearly defined [harmonisation criteria](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/chapters-of-the-acquis_en) which a country must meet in order to be able to join the EU. Turkey is too far from meeting these to be considered a viable candidate.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Turkey is not ready to join the EU. It has completed only [1 of 35 chapters](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/detailed-country-information/turkey_en) on harmonisation.
1.6.3. Pro: EU Treaty rules require that Member States devolve powers to the Union institutions and thus limit their sovereignty.
1.6.4. Con: There are already states in the EU that don't "play by the rules".
1.6.4.1. Pro: The Economist intelligence unit's 2017 index stated that less than [half](https://www.euronews.com/2018/02/01/less-than-half-of-eu-countries-are-fully-democratic-report) of the nations in the European Union are "fully democratic".
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: [Romania](https://www.politico.eu/article/protest-piata-victoriei-bucharest-democracy-under-siege-in-romania/) is one of Europe's least democratic states. There is endemic corruption, attempts to undermine the judiciary; and violence has been used against peaceful protesters.
1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.6.4.3. Con: Having one more state to join them is not going to improve the situation.
1.6.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.
1.6.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.6.5. Pro: Turkey and its leadership do not meet the [democratic standards](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague.html) required of an EU member state.
1.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Turkey's judicial system is [undermined](https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Turkey-Judiciary-in-Peril-Publications-Reports-Fact-Findings-Mission-Reports-2016-ENG.pdf) and incompatible with EU standards.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: There have been purges of the judicial system where corruption or other undesirable qualities have been uncovered.
1.6.5.2.1.1. Pro: In [January 2014](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0L1G220140122), 120 judges and prosecutors were reassigned as part of a corruption inquiry.
1.6.5.2.1.1.1. Con: This was a fraction of the [13,000 judges](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0L1G220140122) working in Turkey.
1.6.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The move [was enough](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0L1G220140122) to put sensitive cases on hold over shaken confidence among judges, meaning it was likely to impact the entire profession.
1.6.5.2.1.2. Pro: Following the failed 2016 coup d'état, [2,745 judges were dismissed](https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/07/16/turkeys-top-judicial-board-hsyk-orders-detention-of-2745-gulen-linked-judges-over-coup-attempt).
1.6.5.2.1.2.1. Con: These judges were largely dismissed because they opposed the political establishment, which is consistent with previous findings that Turkish judges are punished for opposing current political parties.
1.6.5.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: A 1999 report found that Turkish judges who do not act within the interests of the current political establishment are punished by being relocated \([ICJ, 98-99](https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/1999/11/Turkey-independence-judges-and-lawyers-fact-finding-mission-report-1999-eng.pdf)\), violating Principle 2 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary.
1.6.5.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: There have been cases where judges [were dismissed](https://www.rechtersvoorrechters.nl/turkish-executives-last-attack-to-democratic-state-the-judicial-council-is-suspending-680-judges-and-prosecutors-and-will-put-them-on-trail/) for not acting within the interests of the current political party, which the Venice Commission [stated](https://www.venice.coe.int/files/turkish%20declaration%20June%202015.pdf) was "in clear violation of European and universal standards".
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Different political interests have succeeded in having significant influence over the Turkish judicial system in recent decades \([ICJ, pg10](https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Turkey-Judiciary-in-Peril-Publications-Reports-Fact-Findings-Mission-Reports-2016-ENG.pdf)\).
1.6.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.1.2.1.1.
1.6.5.2.2.2. Pro: The recruitment process for judges is heavily politicised, with occurrences of cheating or manipulated marking of examinations, or distribution of questions in advance to select individuals \([ICJ, pg14](https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Turkey-Judiciary-in-Peril-Publications-Reports-Fact-Findings-Mission-Reports-2016-ENG.pdf)\).
1.6.5.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.1.2.1.2.
1.6.5.2.3. Pro: Turkish lawyers are often subject to violence, threats, or prosecution.
1.6.5.2.3.1. Pro: [Tahir Elçi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahir_El%C3%A7i), a human rights lawyer, was assassinated following controversy after stating that the [Kurdistan Workers' Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party) should not be considered a terrorist group.
1.6.5.2.3.2. Pro: In [March 2016](https://lawyersforlawyers.org/en/turkey-police-raid-on-and-arrest-of-9-lawyers/), 9 Turkish lawyers were arrested, the majority of whom were providing legal representation to 46 lawyers who had been arrested in 2011 for "links to a terrorist organisation". The arrests were made "merely based on legitimate professional activities of the lawyers involved".
1.6.5.2.3.3. Pro: The ICJ has expressed concern over the high rates of prosecution of lawyers in Turkey \([pg.21](https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Turkey-Judiciary-in-Peril-Publications-Reports-Fact-Findings-Mission-Reports-2016-ENG.pdf)\).
1.6.5.3. Pro: Turkey practices high levels of censorship in regard to freedom of expression.
1.6.5.3.1. Pro: In [2016](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/president-erdogan-says-freedom-and-democracy-have-no-value-in-turkey-amid-arrests-and-military-a6938266.html), President Erdogan stated freedom and democracy have "no value" in Turkey after imprisoning over 50 activists, politicians and academics who were politically opposed to him.
1.6.5.3.2. Pro: The EU has accused Turkey of [human rights violations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34774624), stating "the authorities' actions curtailing freedom of media are of considerable concern".
1.6.5.3.3. Pro: Turkey has taken multiple steps that impose censorship and curtail freedom of expression online.
1.6.5.3.3.1. Pro: In [2014](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter/turkey-tops-countries-demanding-content-removal-twitter-idUSKBN0LD1P620150209), [2015](http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-leads-in-twitter-censorship-2015-8) and [2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-22/half-of-tweet-removal-requests-come-from-turkey-twitter-says) Turkey submitted the highest volume of removal requests globally on Twitter, making up 52% of removal requests worldwide between 2014-2017. This makes Turkey, by far, the worldwide leader in Twitter censorship.
1.6.5.3.3.2. Pro: Wikipedia, widely regarded as the world's largest database of information, has been blocked [since April 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_of_Wikipedia_in_Turkey) as a page accused Turkey of involvement with terror groups.
1.6.5.3.3.3. Pro: Turkey has banned [Tor](https://turkeyblocks.org/2016/12/18/tor-blocked-in-turkey-vpn-ban/) and [VPNs](https://www.flashrouters.com/blog/2018/04/02/president-erdogan-to-introduce-turkey-vpn-ban/).
1.6.5.3.3.4. Pro: Turkey often temporarily bans social media access following political emergencies, which censors media coverage and permits political parties more control over narrative in their immediate aftermath.
1.6.5.3.3.4.1. Pro: Turkey blocked access to Twitter [in 2014](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26677134) following leaks which allegedly showed evidence of corruption relating to Erdogan.
1.6.5.3.3.4.1.1. Con: The Turkish Constitutional court [ruled the ban illegal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26849941), and it [was lifted](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26873603) afterwards.
1.6.5.3.3.4.2. Pro: [Jean-Claude Juncker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Juncker), President of the [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission), has [stated](http://juncker.epp.eu/sites/default/files/attachments/nodes/en_03_fp.pdf) that "a government that blocks Twitter is certainly not ready for accession".
1.6.5.3.3.4.3. Pro: After detaining 11 Kurdish members of parliament in 2016, Turkey [blocked access](https://turkeyblocks.org/2016/11/04/social-media-shutdown-turkey/) to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube and Skype.
1.6.5.3.3.4.4. Pro: In 2016, Turkey [blocked access](https://turkeyblocks.org/2016/12/23/social-media-shutdowns-turkey-isis-releases-soldier-video/) to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after an ISIS propaganda video was shared online.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Turkey has been criticised for its violation of human rights regarding the Kurdish minority.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: The [UN has accused Turkey](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21342) of "massive destruction, killings and numerous other serious human rights violations" against the Kurdish population between 2015-2016.
1.6.5.4.2. Pro: Turkey has been criticised for the [enforced disappearances](https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11021&lang=EN) of [818 Kurdish individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Turkey#%22Disappearances%22) between 1980-1999, some of which were ruled as violations of the European Convention on Human Rights \(for example, see [Kaya v. Turkey](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/kaya-v-turkey.php); [Çakici v. Turkey](https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/ef9472/pdf/)\).
1.6.5.4.3. Pro: A [report states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Turkey#Unsolved_killings) that between 1987-2001 a total of 2,914 political killings occurred in predominantly Kurdish-populated areas.

1.6.5.5.1. Pro: In Turkey [today](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/10/12/custody/police-torture-and-abductions-turkey), people accused of terrorism or of being linked to the July 2016 attempted coup are at risk of torture in police custody.
1.6.6. Con: Since Turkey can gain many benefits from being a part of the EU, it wil be willing to abide by the EU's terms and conditions.
1.7. Pro: Turkey joining would benefit the EU.
1.7.1. Pro: Turkey's economy is struggling and it would greatly benefit from EU membership.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The Turkish Lira has plummeted in value recently due to lack of [investor confidence](https://www.ft.com/content/98fd03e0-f7cb-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c) in Turkey. Joining the EU would allow Turkey to adopt the Euro which is a much [more stable currency](https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/euro/benefits-euro_en).
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: One the main concerns investors have with investing in Turkey is the high level of [inflation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-economy-inflation/turkish-annual-inflation-falls-in-november-from-15-year-peak-idUSKBN1O20K3) the country has due to the falling value of the Lira.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: US sanctions on Turkey have fueled this lack of confidence, causing the Lira to lose [17%](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/21/turkeys-losing-economic-war-lira-currency-crisis/) of its value in one day.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.
1.7.1.1.4. Con: -> See discussion #9649: The official currency of the European Union \(the euro\) should be abolished.
1.7.1.1.5. Con: If Turkey joined the EU it would be forced to adopt the Euro currency, something which they have [previously stated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-turkey-eu/frustrated-turkey-still-wants-eu-entry-but-maybe-not-euro-idUSBRE91C1E520130213) they do not wish to do.
1.7.1.1.6. Con: If Turkey joined the EU, the Euro would likely become more unstable, negatively impacting all countries using it.
1.7.1.1.7. Pro: According to [Deutsche Bank](https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-lira/turkeys-lira-cheapest-currency-world-deutsche-bank), the Lira is now the world's cheapest currency.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Turkey currently has [large amounts of debt](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/turkey-enters-2019-its-economic-woes-are-never-far-away) and looks likely to go into a recession soon. Being within the EU would allow it to gain a new line of credit from the European Central Bank.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: The European Central Bank has lent large amounts of money to states such as [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland/ecb-lends-489-billion-to-banks-1.889215), [Portugal](https://www.ft.com/content/b8e251a8-75c7-11e0-82c6-00144feabdc0) and [Greece](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/29/eurozone-debt-crisis-ecb-loans-ltro) to help them cope with their recessions.

1.7.1.3. Pro: Unemployment is on the [rise](https://think.ing.com/snaps/Turkey-unemployment-on-the-rise/) within Turkey. Access to the EU would allow for Turkish workers to work in other countries more [easily](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/41/free-movement-of-workers).
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.7.1.4. Con: The Single Market looks set to lose a large trading partner when the [United Kingdom leaves the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit).
1.7.1.4.1. Pro: As part of the Single Market, the UK accounts for around [13% of the EU's trade in goods and services](https://blogs.imf.org/2018/08/10/the-long-term-impact-of-brexit-on-the-european-union/).
1.7.1.4.2. Pro: According to IMF estimates, whatever exit and trade agreement is reached between the UK and EU, [EU economic output will be negatively affected](https://blogs.imf.org/2018/08/10/the-long-term-impact-of-brexit-on-the-european-union/).
1.7.1.4.3. Con: The UK could [still cancel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46428579) its impending exit from the EU.
1.7.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See discussion #10250: Voters in the UK should have a final vote on the Brexit deal.
1.7.1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See discussion #7254: A further referendum should be held on Brexit
1.7.1.5. Con: Turkey's economy may improve after it joins the EU. However, it does not follow from this that the EU is obligated to offer Turkey EU membership.
1.7.1.5.1. Con: If both Turkey and the EU's economies improve following accession, it makes sense to offer Turkey EU membership from an economic point of view.
1.7.1.6. Con: Turkey can join and benefit from the Single Market without fully joining the EU.
1.7.1.6.1. Pro: The [EEA agreement](http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement) allows states like Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland to access the free market without fully joining the EU. Turkey could attempt to join such a deal.
1.7.1.6.2. Pro: Turkey's trade with the EU is already prospering due to their customs union agreement. Full membership is unlikely to cause this trade to increase much more \([pg.35](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1063&context=urceu)\).
1.7.1.7. Con: Turkey would be better off economically outside the Single Market.
1.7.1.7.1. Con: While Turkey has already seen [significant economic benefits from being in a customs union with the EU](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/08/29/the-eu-and-turkey-need-each-other-could-upgrading-the-customs-union-be-the-key/), joining the Single Market would be an upgrade on the current arrangement for Turkey.
1.7.1.7.1.1. Pro: Being inside the Single Market would give Turkey better access to the [world's largest economy and trading block](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/index_en.htm), which is currently ["by far" Turkey's number one import and export partner](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/turkey/index_en.htm).
1.7.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: The Single Market gives access to over [500 million consumers](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods_en).
1.7.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Joining the EU would give Turkey access to the Single Market in services, which is [not included in its current customs union with the EU](https://infacts.org/briefings/turkish-option/).
1.7.1.7.1.2. Pro: Being inside the Single Market could encourage foreign investment in Turkey, which can stimulate economic growth.
1.7.1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Current Single Market members have seen growth in investment due to membership [\(LE Europe, p. 34\)](http://www.amchameu.eu/sites/default/files/amcham_eu_single_market_web.pdf).
1.7.1.7.1.2.2. Pro: If Turkey joined the Single Market, Western Europeans would be able to [create companies](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/services_en) in Turkey. Many Western Europeans would be attracted by this prospect as investors tend to be attracted to [new markets where labour costs are cheap](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/15736/economics/factors-that-affect-foreign-direct-investment-fdi/).
1.7.1.7.1.3. Pro: Under the current EU-Turkey customs union agreement, [any free trade agreements the EU signs with other countries do not extend to Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union%E2%80%93Turkey_Customs_Union). Therefore, the countries the EU has free trade agreements with can export to Turkey tariff-free, while maintaining tariffs on Turkish goods. If Turkey joined the single market, these other countries could no longer apply these tariffs.
1.7.1.7.1.3.1. Con: The same result could come from Turkey [renegotiating the customs arrangement](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/08/29/the-eu-and-turkey-need-each-other-could-upgrading-the-customs-union-be-the-key/) it has with the EU. Initial negotiations to do this [commenced in 2014](http://www.tepav.org.tr/tr/haberler/s/4308).
1.7.1.7.2. Pro: Being inside the Single Market would allow Turkish citizens the [freedom to move to work anywhere in Europe](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/41/free-movement-of-workers). Therefore, if Turkey joins the EU, it may lose many of its most talented workers as [other European countries have higher wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage).
1.7.1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.
1.7.1.7.2.2. Pro: A 2004 study showed that countries that join the EU [risk a "brain drain"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3492668.stm), where their most high-skilled workers move to work elsewhere in the union.
1.7.1.7.2.3. Con: Over time, some of these workers may return to Turkey with new skills that can benefit the Turkish economy.
1.7.1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Turkish workers who have lived in other European countries would learn new languages.
1.7.1.7.2.3.2. Pro: Turkish workers who have lived in other European countries would be [more comfortable](https://www.bunac.org/uk/all-important-transferable-skills) in their communication with other Europeans and likely have [greater cultural awareness](https://www.theiet.org/membership/career/career-options/working-globally/advantages.cfm) when dealing with European clients.
1.7.1.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: This improvement in communication and cultural awareness would likely enhance Turkey's European business connections and lead to more investment in Turkey.
1.7.1.7.2.3.3. Con: 49% of EU citizens who have moved to work in another European country have settled in the other country for more than 10 years [\(European Commission, p. 61\)](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/2017_report_on_intra-eu_labour_mobility.pdf). If Turkish workers followed this trend, many workers would not bring their skills back home for a long time.
1.7.1.7.2.4. Con: The loss of workers to other Single Market countries would likely slow down as the Turkish economy itself catches up with the rest of Europe. This is what [happened in the case of Poland](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7372025.stm).
1.7.1.7.2.5. Con: A significant proportion of money earned by Turkish workers abroad will likely be [sent back](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Personal_remittances_total_inflows_to_the_EU-28,_millions_EUR,_2014-2016.png) to Turkey. This would follow a trend that has occurred since 2004 when other countries joined the EU.
1.7.1.7.2.6. Pro: The number of Turks applying to work in the Netherlands has [doubled](https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-brain-drain/turkeys-brain-drain-netherlands-doubles-two-years-dutch-report) in the last two years. This number is likely to increase more if it is easier to work in such countries.
1.7.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.5.
1.7.1.7.5. Pro: If they were not in the single market, Turkey would be free to negotiate its own trade deals with other countries while still benefiting from its customs union with the EU.
1.7.1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.3.
1.7.1.7.5.2. Pro: Turkey is in an [excellent position](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1063&context=urceu) to engage in further trade with the Middle East, which is expected to become an extremely profitable market \(pg.37\).
1.7.1.7.5.2.1. Pro: Turkey's trade with the Middle East reached [$56.4 billion](https://www.dailysabah.com/economy/2018/04/28/turkeys-trade-with-middle-east-gulf-gains-momentum-despite-crisis-soars-over-22-percent) in 2017.
1.7.1.7.5.2.2. Pro: Turkey plans to [double](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-01/13/c_137740732.htm) its trade volume with Iraq in 2019.
1.7.1.7.5.3. Pro: Turkey is currently [seeking closer ties](http://www.atimes.com/article/turkey-sees-long-term-partner-in-china/) to China.
1.7.1.7.5.4. Pro: Turkey is currently in [trade negotiations](https://www.dailysabah.com/economy/2017/07/20/turkey-thailand-start-free-trade-agreement-negotiations) with Thailand.
1.7.1.7.5.5. Pro: Turkey is currently [expanding](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/best-ahead-in-golden-era-of-turkey-africa-trade-ties/1277826) its trading relationship with Africa.
1.7.1.7.6. Pro: Due to EU protectionism [laws](https://mlexmarketinsight.com/insights-center/editors-picks/brexit/europe/corbyns-protectionism-doesnt-exclude-eu-single-market-membership), Turkey would be unable to offer support in the form of grants or subsidies to its own firms in their time of need.
1.7.1.7.6.1. Pro: Currently Turkey heavily [supports](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-vows-to-keep-credit-channels-open-to-neutralize-economic-attacks-135896) its native industries.
1.7.1.7.7. Pro: Due to their current trade deals, Turkish exports reached an [all time high](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-exports-hit-all-time-high-with-168-billion-in-2018-140256) in 2018.
1.7.1.8. Pro: Joining the EU would increase Turkey's market competition and put pressure on domestic monopolies from EU rivals.
1.7.1.8.1. Pro: A [2003 study](http://www.ekathimerini.com/12803/article/ekathimerini/business/turkey-held-back-by-monopolies-black-economy-study-claims) cites domestic monopolies as one of two main limiting factors of Turkey's economy.
1.7.1.8.1.1. Con: The Turkish economy has changed substantially since 2003. At the time, Turkey was recovering from the [2001 economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Turkish_economic_crisis), whereas has now undergone [another crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_currency_and_debt_crisis,_2018) as of 2018.
1.7.1.8.2. Con: The [Turkish Competition Authority](https://www.rekabet.gov.tr/en/Sayfa/About-us/turkish-competition-authority?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1) have been [proactive](https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-dominance-and-monopolies-review-edition-6/1168407/turkey) in recent years to ensure market monopolies are avoided.
1.7.1.9. Pro: Turkey's economy could benefit from EU policies such as the [Common Agricultural Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy) and [Cohesion Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_policy_of_the_European_Union).
1.7.1.10. Pro: Turkey's slide towards [dictatorship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/turkey-slide-into-dictatorship-ignored) has had a [negative effect](https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-economy/weakness-turkeys-democratic-institutions-affects-its-wealth) on the Turkish economy. Joining the EU would increase investor confidence.
1.7.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.1.10.2. Pro: The actions of the Turkish government have [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/business/west-democracy-turkey-erdogan-financial-crisis.html) confidence in many Turkish institutions, including the central bank.
1.7.1.10.3. Con: Due to the interconnected nature of the EU, investor confidence in the Eurozone can be affected by the actions of [all countries](https://www.ft.com/content/8646f65e-67cd-11e8-b6eb-4acfcfb08c11), increasing the risk to Turkey.
1.7.1.10.4. Pro: The EU is one of the [most popular](https://business.financialpost.com/investing/why-investors-continue-to-favour-europe-despite-global-volatility) places for investment globally.
1.7.1.10.5. Pro: Foreign direct investment in Turkey is [predicted](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/foreign-direct-investment) to continue to decrease in the coming years.
1.7.1.10.6. Con: Turkey still attracts a [high](https://www.dailysabah.com/economy/2018/10/13/turkey-attracts-7b-in-foreign-direct-investment-from-january-to-august) level of foreign direct investment into the country.
1.7.1.10.6.1. Pro: Many large companies including Pepsi-Co are [expanding](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-one-of-safest-countries-in-terms-of-investment-erdogan-140289) their investments into Turkey.
1.7.1.10.7. Pro: Turkey has seen a [22%](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-sees-22-percent-yearly-decline-in-fdi-data-shows-133626) decline in foreign direct investment in 2018.
1.7.1.10.8. Con: There are many [predictions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/08/26/there-is-good-news-for-investors-in-turkey/#5cec4f776743) that Turkey's recent economic decline could be extremely profitable for investors.
1.7.1.11. Pro: Many [economists](https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-economy/turkey-teetering-rim-recession-economist) believe that Turkey is on the brink of a recession.
1.7.1.11.1. Pro: A recent [poll](https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-economy/turkeys-economic-crisis-tops-peoples-concerns-overtaking-terrorism-poll) found that the state of the economy is the issue concerning Turks the most.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.7.3. Pro: The EU currently has a large issue with [Islamophobia](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-rise-of-islamophobia-in-europe-is-being-normalised-by-intellectuals-but-they-are-pushing-at-an-already-open-door-1.736877). Allowing Turkey membership to the EU could [help solve](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-accession-to-eu-will-benefit-muslim-world-eu-ministry-129932) this issue.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Some experts hold that Turkey joining the EU will contribute to the [acceptance of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#Benefits_to_Turkey) in Europe.
1.7.3.2. Con: Perceived or real influence from a Muslim-majority nation in the EU will make [''Eurabia''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurabia) theorists feel justified in their paranoia.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: The threat of making conspiracy theorists feel justified should not influence whether a country should or should not join the European Union.
1.7.3.2.1.1. Con: These people are growing in popularity and political influence. A strenghtening of their argument could very likely lead to a dismanteling of the EU via Eurosceptic party's and even dismanteling of fundamental functions of democracy, as proposed by several such party's right now. Such consequences need to be taken into account.[signs of their political growth](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36130006) [Results of their political sucess](http://theconversation.com/how-viktor-orban-degraded-hungarys-weak-democracy-109046)
1.7.4. Pro: Turkey has an [extremely large military](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=turkey). These resources would greatly help the EU's goal of developing defense capabilities through the formation of [PESCO](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/34226/permanent-structured-cooperation-pesco-factsheet_en).
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.7.6. Pro: Turkey would have significantly more global influence if it joined the EU.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Turkey would have a large influence on the EU's decision making process.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Due to its large population, Turkey would have one of the [largest](http://If Turkey became a member, it would be one of the five largest countries in the EU, be represented in the Parliament strongly, and have a weighted vote in the Council at the same level as Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom .) votes in the European Council and Parliament \(pg.12\).
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: Like all EU members, Turkey would have [veto power](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/eu-and-unanimity-trap) on policies that were against its own interests.
1.7.6.1.3. Pro: Turkey would have a larger say on issues that both it and the EU are currently facing such as the [migrant crisis](https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/our-work/opinions-information-reports/opinions/role-turkey-refugee-crisis).
1.7.6.2. Pro: Turkey would be able to enter trade negotiations as part of the world's [largest trading bloc](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/eu-in-brief_en), giving it more power and leverage.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.
1.7.6.2.2. Con: If Turkey were to join the EU, all trade deals would have to be negotiated as a bloc, giving Turkey less freedom in deciding its own trade deals.
1.7.6.2.2.1. Pro: Due to the EU's [negative relationship](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1063&context=urceu) with the Middle East, it is unlikely that trade deals will occur in the near future \(pg.37\). If Turkey was in the EU, it would also suffer as a result of this relationship.
1.7.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.7.5.2.
1.7.6.2.2.2. Con: The benefit of being part of the EU's significant number of current \(and future\) trade deals outweighs any potential loss in control over negotiating trade deals that would come about from Turkey joining the EU.
1.7.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: The EU has in place [36 free trade agreements](https://cer.eu/in-the-press/eu-has-36-free-trade-deals-non-eu-countries-will-they-roll-over-britain-after-brexit) with [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements#Trade_agreements_in_force) outside the union.
1.7.6.2.2.2.2. Pro: EU free trade agreements with Japan and Singapore will [soon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements#Agreements_signed_but_not_\(provisionally\)_applied) be coming into force.
1.7.6.2.2.2.3. Pro: The EU has [finalised, but not yet signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements#Agreements_signed_but_not_\(provisionally\)_applied), free trade agreements with 23 countries. These include a large group of West African and Eastern African countries.
1.7.6.2.2.2.4. Pro: The EU is [currently negotiating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements#Negotiating) trade deals with a host of other countries, including the USA, Australia and New Zealand.

1.7.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.1.
1.7.6.3.3. Pro: Turkey is already a member of many international organisations that other EU member states are also part of.
1.7.6.3.3.1. Con: Just because a country is a part of similar international organisations does not mean it has any more of a right to join another one.
1.7.6.3.3.2. Pro: Turkey was one of the first members to join the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe) in 1949.
1.7.6.3.3.3. Pro: Turkey was an associate member of the [Western European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Union).
1.7.6.3.3.4. Pro: Turkey is a member of [WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization), as are all member states of the European Union.
1.7.6.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.7.6.3.3.6. Pro: Turkey is a founding member of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations).
1.7.6.3.3.6.1. Con: The United Nations is made up of many states who would not make sense for EU membership.
1.7.6.3.3.6.1.1. Pro: [Syria](http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/founders.shtml) was a founding member of the UN, but its current conflict and geography make it an unlikely EU candidate.
1.7.6.3.3.6.1.1.1. Con: Syria, unlike Turkey, never applied for membership of the EU, nor was there ever any discussion about its potential membership.
1.7.6.3.3.7. Pro: Turkey is a member of the [G20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20).
1.7.6.3.3.7.1. Con: Only 4 of the 19 individual countries that make up the G20 are members of the EU.
1.7.6.3.3.7.1.1. Con: The EU is itself a full member of G20.
1.7.6.4. Con: Turkey would lose its ability to make decisions independently if it was part of the EU, giving it less power internationally.
1.7.6.4.1. Pro: Much of the EU's current foreign policy is [decided](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2012/07/05/big-three-in-eu-foreign-policy-pub-48759) by a very small number of countries.
1.7.6.4.2. Pro: Turkey would be forced to adopt any EU [regulations](https://europa.eu/european-union/eu-law/legal-acts_en) which are enacted.
1.7.6.4.3. Con: If Turkey joined the EU, it would be able to act as part of a union that is, and will continue to be, one of the world's [global superpowers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/13/europe-is-still-a-superpower/).
1.7.6.5. Pro: The EU [Foreign and Security Policy](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/foreign-security-policy_en) allows for the EU to act as a bloc of 28 countries in global affairs.
1.7.6.6. Con: Turkey's current autocratic rule is a human rights disaster [as Amnesty International shows](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/turkey/report-turkey/), and should not increase in influence.
1.7.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.
1.7.7. Pro: The Europeans Union's laws and institutions would provide many benefits to Turkey.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Many international groups have criticised Turkey's [slide towards dictatorship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/turkey-slide-into-dictatorship-ignored). Joining the EU would help make Turkey more democratic.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.5.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: Many of the policies which have been criticised by the international community were [passed by referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/16/erdogan-claims-victory-in-turkish-constitutional-referendum) and are the will of the Turkish people.
1.7.7.1.3. Con: The EU has been unable to stop the [autocratic actions](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/hungary-and-poland-pose-worse-threat-to-eu-than-brexit-1.3628355) of both the Polish and Hungarian governments. It is unclear how they would be successful in the case of Turkey.
1.7.7.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.7.7.1.4. Pro: The EU has many laws and institutions which act as checks and balances on government power.
1.7.7.1.4.1. Pro: The [EU charter of fundamental rights](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) would guarantee Turkish citizens greater rights.
1.7.7.1.4.1.1. Con: The EU is often [unable](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/03/23/safeguarding-democratic-rule-within-the-eu) to guarantee citizens their rights.
1.7.7.1.4.1.2. Con: Turkey is already a member of the [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights#Jurisdiction). This body already attempts to guarantee human rights.
1.7.7.1.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.5.4.
1.7.7.1.4.2. Pro: The EU has set [standards](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/europe-nobel-peace-prize-10-things) on laws, rights and democracy which all member states must adhere to.
1.7.7.1.4.3. Pro: The EU has the power to [sanction](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/67941) members which do not adhere to its rules.
1.7.7.1.4.3.1. Pro: German Foreign Minister [Heiko Maas](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-foreign-minister-issues-sanctions-warning-to-turkey/) indicated that Turkey could face sanctions if it did not scale back on its provocations in the Eastern Mediterranean.
1.7.7.2. Pro: EU environmental [regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/europe-nobel-peace-prize-10-things) have helped improve both the air and water quality of member states.
1.7.7.2.1. Pro: Studies have shown that up to [97%](https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=571) of those living within urban areas in Turkey have been exposed to unsafe levels of air pollution.

1.7.7.3. Con: There is a democratic deficit within the EU which would harm Turkey and its citizens.
1.7.7.3.1. Pro: The EU is seen by many as too [distant and complex](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) which prevents citizens from getting properly involved in the decision making process.
1.7.7.3.2. Pro: Many EU elections suffer from extremely low [voter turnout](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/europes-democratic-deficit-is-getting-worse/371297/).
1.7.7.3.2.1. Con: Many other [countries](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) also suffer from low voter turnout.
1.7.7.3.2.2. Pro: Turnout for European Parliament elections has fallen by [30%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/brexit-eu-democratic-britain) since 1979 in the UK.
1.7.7.3.3. Pro: The European Commission, one of the [most powerful bodies](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-ellery/eu-referendum_b_9514608.html?ec_carp=3638288714171887140) of the EU, is not democratically elected.
1.7.7.3.3.1. Con: The European Commission is [accountable](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/20/eu-democratic-deficit) to the European Parliament.
1.7.7.3.3.2. Pro: Commissioners who preform poorly [cannot](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) be fired.
1.7.7.3.4. Pro: The Court of Justice of the EU regularly [chooses](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-ellery/eu-referendum_b_9514608.html?ec_carp=3638288714171887140) not to uphold the laws and treaties of the EU.
1.7.7.3.5. Con: The Lisbon treaty greatly [increased](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) the power of countries to challenge any EU laws they deem unfair.
1.7.7.3.6. Con: [Studies](https://jcms.ideasoneurope.eu/2018/09/07/how-the-eu-mitigates-a-fundamental-democratic-deficit-of-european-nation-states/) have shown that the EU plays a democracy-enhancing role in countries, particularly for immigrants.
1.7.7.3.7. Con: Major EU decisions are still made by the [European Council](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/20/eu-democratic-deficit). This body is made up of each country's national leaders who all have voting rights proportional to their population.
1.7.7.3.8. Pro: The EU often fails to be [transparent](https://theconversation.com/how-democratic-is-the-european-union-59419) in its decisions, with many decisions made behind closed doors.
1.7.7.3.9. Con: Turkey itself suffers from a [democratic deficit](https://www.openglobalrights.org/turkeys-democratic-deficit-and-the-european-court-of-human-rights/) which has been recently getting worse due to changes to the political system. The EU may not be perfectly democratic, but the requirements of joining may help Turkey overcome some of its own deficit.
1.7.7.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.3.1.
1.7.7.3.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.7.7.3.9.3. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.3.
1.7.7.3.9.4. Pro: The EU is effective at putting pressure on its member states to abide by democracy.
1.7.7.3.9.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.7.7.3.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.7.7.3.9.5. Pro: The EU has a broad record of promoting democracy.
1.7.7.3.9.5.1. Pro: The EU has [had some success](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/01/29/eu-democracy-eastern-partnership/) promoting democracy in the former Soviet countries of Eastern Europe.
1.7.7.3.9.5.2. Pro: The EU has had success promoting democracy in [neighbouring countries](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1465116508089085) that it seems open to offering membership to.
1.7.7.4. Pro: EU law has given consumers of goods and services much [greater rights](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/consumer/ten-eu-benefits-that-consumers-take-for-granted-1.2654950).
1.7.7.5. Pro: Turkish citizens would gain access to many new rights and privileges if made EU citizens.
1.7.7.5.1. Pro: EU citizenship would allow Turkish citizens to study in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
1.7.7.5.1.1. Pro: Tuition in many EU countries \(Denmark, Austria, France, Germany, Greece, etc.\) is [free](https://www.study.eu/article/study-in-europe-for-free-or-low-tuition-fees) for students from EU countries.
1.7.7.5.2. Con: If Turkey was admitted to the EU, Turkish citizens would gain the same rights and privileges that EU citizens have. However, it does not follow from this that the EU is obligated to offer Turkey EU membership.
1.7.7.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.4.1.
1.7.7.5.4. Pro: The EU has many [anti-discrimination laws](https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/know-your-rights/equality/non-discrimination_en) which help protect minority groups and promote gender equality.
1.7.7.5.4.1. Pro: Turkey has large [problems](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32982780) with gender equality.
1.7.7.5.4.1.1. Con: The EU has [problems](https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/work/1424263/sexism-isnt-just-bad-for-women-its-bad-for-democracy/amp/) with gender inequality.
1.7.7.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Mothers](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/eu-gender-inequality.html) in many western European countries continue to have a lower rate of employment, experience underemployment and work fewer hours than women without children, and men.
1.7.7.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: [Women](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/eu-gender-inequality.html) in the EU spend far greater hours in domestic work than men, even when the woman is the main or sole earner.
1.7.7.5.4.1.1.3. Con: Every EU state has been rated in the highest category of [“Very High Human Development”](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GII) by the UNDP gender equality index.
1.7.7.5.4.1.2. Pro: Turkey scores lower than every EU state on the UNDP’s [gender equality index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GII).
1.7.7.5.4.1.3. Con: Turkey is making significant progress to combat gender inequality.
1.7.7.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: The number of women on local municipal councils has [dramatically](https://www.google.com/amp/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/amp/opinion/guven-sak/the-gender-gap-is-narrowing-in-turkey-128532) increased since 2012.
1.7.7.5.4.1.3.1.1. Con: [Projections](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780) show that women’s representation in Parliament could reach 18% in the next election, which is far from adequate.
1.7.7.5.4.1.3.2. Con: [Figures](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780) show that the murders of women have been rising for the last three years.
1.7.7.5.4.1.3.3. Con: Turkey made no progress in reducing domestic violence between 2008 and 2014, according to the [Domestic Violence Against Women Report 2014](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780).
1.7.7.5.4.1.3.4. Pro: The government's [lifting](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780) of a ban on wearing headscarves in state institutions in 2013 has given women more freedom to dress as they like.
1.7.7.5.4.1.3.5. Pro: The EU [praised](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2012/462428/IPOL-FEMM_NT\(2012\)462428_EN.pdf#page16) Turkey’s legal reforms over the past three decades promoting gender equality.
1.7.7.5.4.1.4. Pro: Only 28% of Turkish women participate in the workforce, [compared](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780) with the European Union average of 63%.
1.7.7.5.4.1.5. Pro: Turkey ranks 125 out of 140 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index 2014, published by the [World Economic Forum](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780).
1.7.7.5.4.1.6. Pro: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan [sparked anger last year](http://Beyond the headscarf: Turkey's women struggle for equality http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32982780) when he said "women and men are not equal".
1.7.7.5.4.2. Pro: The EU has enacted many [policies](http://www.genderequality.ie/en/GE/Pages/WP13000060) aiming to combat gender inequality.
1.7.7.5.4.3. Pro: Turkey has large [problems](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/turkey-lbgt-rights-transgender-queer-artists-istanbul-pride-a8693191.html) with its treatment of the LGBT+ community.
1.7.7.5.5. Pro: EU citizenship would allow Turkish citizens to travel around 27 countries freely.
1.7.7.5.5.1. Con: This is problematic. European countries should have the right to decide exactly how many people from Turkey reside in their nation.
1.7.7.5.5.1.1. Con: Being able to travel around the EU doesn't immediately imply residing there as well.
1.7.7.5.5.2. Pro: Since the enactment of [Directive 2004/38/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038) all member states have to ensure that there are no explicit or implicit barriers to the free movement of persons across the EU.
1.7.7.5.6. Pro: EU citizenship would allow Turkish citizens to work in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
1.7.7.5.6.1. Con: Allowing more Turkish citizens to work in the EU would have the effect of [driving down wages](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12063052/Mass-migration-driving-down-wages-offered-to-British-jobseekers.html) for many working class jobs.
1.7.7.5.6.2. Pro: The [free movement](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/41/free-movement-of-workers) of workers is a fundamental freedom protected by the EU.
1.7.7.5.7. Pro: EU citizens have the right to [medical treatment](https://www.giovani.com.cy/news/32-interested-in-a-second-citizenship-here-are-5-benefits-about-the-eu-citizenship-you-probably-didn-t-know) in any EU country by applying for a free European Health Insurance Card. This entitles all EU citizens to the same healthcare as insured local people in that country.
1.7.7.5.7.1. Con: Healthcare systems within much of Europe are already [overloaded](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/21/health-services-overloaded-despite-support-pledges-claims-report) and struggling to cope with demand. Allowing Turkey to join the EU would place additional strain on healthcare resources.
1.8. Pro: There are many Turks already living and working in the European Union, contributing to it economically and culturally.
1.8.1. Con: People of many nationalities live and work in the EU, but this is not a basis for the claim that their countries should be included in the EU.
1.8.2. Pro: Turks are the [largest minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_in_Germany) in Germany, the country considered Europe's [de facto leader](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/28/angela-merkel-germany-elections-eu-europe).
1.8.2.1. Pro: In [1961](https://www.dw.com/en/turkish-guest-workers-transformed-german-society/a-15489210), Turkey and Germany signed a recruitment treaty, with large numbers of unmarried Turkish men moving to Germany who assimilated and remained.
1.8.3. Pro: According to President Erdogan, there are currently [over 6 million Turks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-turkey/eu-will-lose-turkey-if-it-hasnt-joined-by-2023-erdogan-idUSBRE89T1TG20121030) living in Europe.
1.8.4. Pro: If Turkey becomes a member of the EU, even more Turkish people will be able to live within Europe and contribute towards its economy and culture.
1.8.4.1. Con: The prospect of mass immigration is a curious selling point for Turkish accession. [Most people](http://www.euvisions.eu/europeans-immigration-thing/) would view it as a drawback, not an advantage.
1.8.4.2. Con: Should we agree that more immigrants are needed, there is no shortage of countries that could provide them.
1.8.5. Pro: Turks that live in European nations pay [tax](https://www.gov.uk/tax-come-to-uk) to the nations in which they are residing.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Many European nations have [aging populations.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_structure_and_ageing) This places increased strain on the ability of these states to provide [welfare](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10203402/Ageing-population-pushes-welfare-bill-to-crisis-point.html) services for its citizens. If Turkey becomes a member of the EU, more Turkish migrants will be able to move to EU states and pay taxes. This could help to prevent the economic problems caused by an aging population.
1.8.6. Con: Even though Turks contribute to the EU culturally and economically, their country might not be ready to join the EU regardless.
1.9. Con: The religious and cultural identity of Turkey is different from that of all current members of the EU.
1.9.1. Con: Some experts hold that accession of Turkey into the EU will contribute to the [spread of secular western values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#Benefits_to_Turkey) in Turkey.
1.9.2. Con: Adding a country with a different religious and cultural identity to the EU could have positive effects on Europe.
1.9.2.1. Con: In a poll, [only around a third of people](http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/europeans-not-convinced-growing-diversity-is-a-good-thing-divided-on-what-determines-national-identity/) in Sweden \(36%\), the UK \(33%\) and Spain \(31%\) said they thought more diversity made their countries better.
1.9.2.2. Pro: When individuals from different backgrounds [mix](http://accordcoalition.org.uk/2014/01/17/3151/) with each other it helps to decrease prejudice within society.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: There is already a large mixture of different cultures in the EU. In Germany, [15%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany) of the inhabitants are from foreign countries. Even so, between [50 and 70%](http://www.islamophobiaeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GERMANY.pdf) of the population in Europe do not want further immigration of Muslims, and the popularity of far-right parties is on the rise.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Europe is often perceived as a "white Christian club". Allowing Turkey to join the EU would [counter](https://www.euronews.com/2011/10/06/is-the-european-union-a-christian-club) this image, and might improve how the European Union is perceived by non-Western nations.
1.9.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.9.4. Con: Turkish history has been [heavily influenced](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/turkish-secularism-threat-180528131157715.html) by the West. For most of its history Turkey was a secular nation that aimed to minimize the impact of religion in the public sphere.
1.9.5. Con: Some current EU member states, such as Bulgaria, have "indigenous" Muslim minorities. In addition, majority-Muslim Albania is already an official candidate for EU membership. [source](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/albania_en/6953/Albania%20and%20the%20EU)
1.9.6. Con: Many EU member states express already a multicultural and multi religious population. Yet nowadays Turkey is not monolithic sunni turk country, but it also has alevi \(shia\) population around 20%, Kurdish - both sunni and alevi, Atheists, Yews and Christians, even if in small groups, are still present.[Religion in European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union)[Demographics in the European Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union)[Demographics in Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Turkey)[Religions in Turkey. Digging under the 97% islam](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-beliefs-in-turkey.html)
1.9.7. Pro: Joining the EU would restrict Turkey's ability to protect its identity and choose its own path.
1.9.7.1. Con: [78.9%](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-citizens-support-for-eu-membership-on-the-rise-poll-125402) of Turks want to join the EU. This is the path that Turkish citizens want to choose.
1.9.7.2. Pro: Turkey and the EU have been [at odds](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1063&context=urceu) over Turkey's refusal to abandon its Islamic roots.
1.9.7.2.1. Con: A [growing](https://www.dw.com/en/atheism-grows-in-turkey-as-recep-tayyip-erdogan-urges-islam/a-47018029) number of Turks are turning atheist. This is likely to not be an issue for them in the future.
1.9.7.3. Con: Limiting Turkey's ability to restrict political opposition and criticism toward the government would be a great reason to allow Turkey to join.
1.9.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.3.
1.9.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.5.
1.9.7.4. Pro: Joining the EU has been shown to impose restrictions, which is one of the main reasons for Brexit occurring.
1.9.7.4.1. Pro: Ilnur Cevik, President Erdogan's chief adviser, has stated that Brexit is [causing hesitation](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/791807/Turkey-referendum-Europe-EU-Brexit-News-Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-UK-European-Union) among Turkish officials as to whether joining the EU would be beneficial.
1.9.7.4.2. Con: -> See discussion #6246: The United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union.
1.9.7.4.3. Con: -> See discussion #8708: The UK should remain in the EU if a hard Brexit is the only alternative option.
1.9.7.4.4. Pro: -> See discussion #4237: Brexit was a good choice for the UK.
1.9.8. Pro: EU member states are relatively homogeneous both religiously and culturally. Accepting Turkey as a member state would lead to more disagreements within the EU.
1.9.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.
1.9.8.2. Pro: Turkey's population is [98% Muslim](https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005232/http://www.konda.com.tr/html/dosyalar/ghdl%26t_en.pdf), whereas the highest Muslim population in [an EU country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Europe) is Bulgaria [with 7%](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bu.html).
1.9.8.2.1. Con: The European Union [values](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sectors/human-rights-and-governance/democracy-and-human-rights/freedom-religion-or-belief_en) "freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief". Refusing to admit Turkey into the European Union because it is a Muslim nation is contrary to these values.
1.9.8.2.2. Con: Albania, Bosnia, Serbia \(incl. Kosovo\) will soon apply or get membership. These countries have relevant if not predominant Muslim pupulation. Once they will enter this claim will lose his relevancy and prove to be wrong.[Albania accession path to EU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Albania_to_the_European_Union)[Serbia and Kosovo are candidates to EU accession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Serbia_to_the_European_Union)[Bosnia is candidate to EU accession](http://Accession_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_to_the_European_Union)
1.9.8.3. Con: It is not accurate to claim that European nations are 'relatively homogeneous' religiously and culturally.
1.9.8.3.1. Pro: For example, European nations do not have a homogeneous attitude towards [abortion](http://abortion-clinics.eu/abortion-europe/abortion-prohibited/).
1.9.8.3.2. Pro: European nations are not homogeneous with respect to [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union).
1.9.8.3.3. Pro: [Religiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Europe) differs substantially within the European Union.
1.9.8.3.3.1. Pro: Even Christians believers, in the EU, belong and follow several and very different confessions. These differences, over centuries, had a major impact on societies that still persist and is perceivable nowadays.[Christianity in Europe and his cultural influences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Europe).
1.10. Con: Geographically, Turkey is not part of the European region.
1.10.1. Con: Why does that need to be a requirement. We should look to expand the EU wherever a country agrees with us on issues like democracy and human rights etc.
1.10.1.1. Con: One of the things that makes the EU work is a shared sense of cultural identity. Admitting members outside of Europe may erode that identity.
1.10.2. Con: This statement is incorrect as [East Trakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Thrace), meaning a relevant portion of Turkey's soil as well as population, is well known to be in Europe.
1.10.3. Con: Several territories are clearly outside of Europe, but still apart of the European Union, such as [French Guiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana).
1.10.3.1. Con: French Guiana is administratively a territory of France. There is no territory being a stand-alone nation outside of the geographical concept of Europe that is part of the EU.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.3.
