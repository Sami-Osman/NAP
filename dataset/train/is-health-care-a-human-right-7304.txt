Discussion Name: Is health care a human right?

1. Health care should be considered a human right.
1.1. Pro: It is the duty of the state to protect its citizens. One key way they can do this is by providing health care to all.
1.1.1. Con: Direct providing or financing of healthcare by the state will facilitate corruption and artificially increase health insurance costs.
1.1.1.1. Con: Many countries [have public healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care) without corruption, and there is no correlation between[countries with high corruption](https://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview) and healthcare.
1.1.1.2. Con: Directly financing healthcare means health insurance becomes an optional extra for the rich wanting better private care. Therefore increased health insurance costs is not as important as protection of the general populations health.
1.1.1.3. Pro: A free market providing an universal basic income would work better for guaranteeing poor people's health as it wouldn't face these problems.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: UBI + markets opens up the real possibilities that people choose to not get health care or get priced out of it. If we're unwilling to let those people live without treatment, a universal care system removes the perverse incentive to avoid getting care early to save money.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: A UBI would not cover the costs of medical care, as the UBI payout would likely be set just above the cost of living. This would not be anywhere near enough to cover expensive medical procedures.
1.1.1.4. Con: There is evidence to suggest that a [single-payer system](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/upshot/why-single-payer-health-care-saves-money.html?_r=0) allows for negotiations that would actually [drive down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/26/21-graphs-that-show-americas-health-care-prices-are-ludicrous/?utm_term=.6ffd89100d6a) the price of services.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The ACA has directly lead to [vast costs increases](https://ldi.upenn.edu/brief/effects-aca-health-care-cost-containment) across the [US](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Kowalski.pdf), with the average cost increase at about 160%.
1.1.1.5. Con: In Sweden we do have [healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Sweden) that is more or less equal for everyone. Still Sweden is one of the [least corrupt countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) in the world. You find the same thing in our neighbor countries Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Germany. Other examples are Netherlands, Belgium, France with more or less similar systems.
1.1.1.6. Con: The USA has the [most expensive healthcare system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Healthcare_costs_to_GDP_OECD_2015_v1.png), despite not being dictated by the government. A lot of systems in Europe have much lower costs, despite making health care available to everybody.
1.1.1.7. Pro: [The Free Market](https://video.search.yahoo.com/video/play?p=ron+paul+health+care&vid=68042f9f2c4484d5aba8ee0932dbd8c4&turl=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOVP.fQtzo_626aTgxnT3b8q5HwEsDh%26pid%3D15.1%26h%3D225%26w%3D300%26c%3D7%26rs%3D1&rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUWvJNipK6LQ&tit=Ron+Paul+on+National+Health+Care+Reform&c=5&h=225&w=300&l=435&sigr=11b3kr7gm&sigt=117kkl8sv&sigi=12r0a0uga&ct=p&age=1316583120&fr2=p%3As%2Cv%3Av&fr=mcafee&tt=b) provides better healthcare to more people than guaranteed, socialized healthcare. Government bureaucracy only complicates processes which raises costs.
1.1.1.7.1. Con: In one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the USA, [citizens spend more per capital than those citizens of countries with socialized healthcare.](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-start)
1.1.1.7.2. Con: [It was partially the lack of regulations regarding for-profit corporations in the healthcare industry that has allowed insulin, a necessity for the sustainment of life for those individuals who require it, to live.](https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/insulin-overpricing/pressrelease/insulin-overpricing-insulin-manufacturers-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-drug-price-inflation-scheme-and-rico-violations-time-to-break-up-the-insulin-racket) Not just live well, but live period.
1.1.2. Con: Vulnerable citizens can be given support with healthcare without making it a human right.
1.1.2.1. Con: We need human rights for protection when our legal rights are violated by the state, and to encourage justice and fairness within our societies. Making healthcare a human right would mean that citizens have the ability to challenge their state, if that state fails to fulfil their rights.
1.1.3. Pro: In 1948, the UN adopted the Universal Human Rights Declaration. [Article 25](http://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf) \(p. 52\) states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services."
1.1.3.1. Con: Medical care suggests something different from health care. Getting treatment for a life-threatening affliction is not the same as getting annual check-ups. This quote is not specific enough to support the claim that health care is a right.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Healthcare is complicated and made up of several subparts. For example, accessibility to nutritional advice could be considered part of healthcare.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Healthcare is sometimes [defined as](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define%3A+healthcare) "the organized provision of medical care to individuals or a community". This suggests there is little difference between the terms, as healthcare just refers to the provision of medical care.
1.1.3.2. Con: Governments do ensure hospitals are distributed geographically, and emergency services exist to transport one to a hospital. Providing such access to care is not equivalent to providing the care free of charge to everyone.
1.1.4. Con: Duties of the state should be limited to those things that are necessary roles of government. It is not necessary for the state to provide healthcare. People can get that for themselves.
1.1.4.1. Con: If healthcare is prohibitively expensive to the average American, then it becomes the duty of the state to provide it.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Average people can't afford health care, and average people are the ones that pay taxes for government programs. So the government can't afford to provide health care using average people's tax money, either.
1.1.5. Con: It is also the duty of the state to protect all its citizens. Making an open-ended commitment to providing health care for all might sound good today, but it might be a crushing burden on future citizens who have to pay for the health care of an aging population.
1.1.5.1. Con: The World Health organisation \(WHO\) has released a [report](http://www.who.int/whr/2010/en/) which maps the ways that all countries can sustainably achieve universal healthcare.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The 49 "low-income countries" that would find it hardest to adopt universal healthcare have been [given a roadmap](http://www.who.int/whr/2010/10_summary_en.pdf?ua=1) which includes Increasing the efficiency of revenue collection, reprioritising government budgets, innovating financing, and receiving development assistance for health supported by the Millennium Development Goals.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: This report estimates that from [20% to 40% of all health spending is currently wasted through inefficiency](http://www.who.int/whr/2010/10_summary_en.pdf?ua=1), and urges these savings to be pursued instead of cutting funding or leaving some citizens with no care at all.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: This report's recommendations for sustainability are as follows: 1\) Increase the efficiency of revenue collection 2\) Reprioritize government budgets 3\) Innovative financing 4\) Development assistance for health. In short: raise taxes, spend more on healthcare, raise more money, and get money from other nations. Hardly "innovative".
1.1.6. Pro: Being alive is dear to every human being. Hence, there is huge opportunity for exploiting the sick, both poor and rich, by private players. Medical expenses form a major component of the expenditure by poor households in many societies. Hence it is the duty of a Govt or Ruler to ensure the right of life and right against exploitation of its loyal and taxpaying citizens.
1.1.7. Pro: Health of individuals living in a society benefits the greater good of community health.
1.1.7.1. Pro: People who have no money are not isolated from the rest of society - should they fall ill, they threaten the health of their community.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Vaccination can lead to less disease in the population and thus more funds for other goals and prosperity.
1.1.8. Pro: Healthcare is necessary to ensure human survival. It is also kind to help out another fellow human being who is in need of treatment. Therefore, denying health services to a human being is almost the same as harming or killing them.
1.1.9. Con: Providing healthcare to 'vulnerable citizens' is not the same as healthcare to all. [MEDICAID](https://www.medicaid.gov/index.html) is the US program that provides healthcare to the most vulnerable US citizens. [SCHIP](https://www.medicaid.gov/CHIP/index.html) is another program that extends medical coverage to vulnerable youth in the US not covered by regular medicaid. In this way resources are very targeted.
1.1.10. Pro: Denying the right to health care disproportionately discriminates against aged, sick, disabled, and poor citizens.
1.1.10.1. Pro: These groups are less likely to be able to work and more likely to require health care. It is unreasonable to say that because they cannot afford it the state should not look after them.
1.1.10.2. Con: Discrimination claims are dereliction of personal responsibility - it is not someone else's responsibility to ensure your survival, save for the parent-child relationship. Discretionary assistance can be rendered, but it is by no means mandatory.
1.1.10.3. Con: [Just because an action causes more harm to one group than another doesn't make it discriminatory.​](https://www.eoc.org.uk/what-is-discrimination/)
1.1.11. Pro: It is the nature of disease that you are at a disadvantage in resources. It's not right to require the sick to pay for the sick. It's an unfair expectation. It's like asking the poor to solve poverty or the hungry to solve hunger.
1.1.11.1. Con: This assumes that the sick \(or the poor, in your analogy\) are not at fault for their condition. That is not always the case.
1.2. Pro: The [International Bill of Human Rights](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-are-human-rights/what-universal-declaration-human-rights#:~:text=The%20International%20Bill%20of%20Human,Economic%2C%20Social%20and%20Cultural%20Rights) includes [healthcare as a human right](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf).
1.2.1. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights says "[Health is a fundamental human right](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL#:~:text=Health%20is%20a%20fundamental%20human%20right)", that "Functioning public health and health-care facilities" must be "[Available in sufficient quantity](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL#:~:text=particular%20State%20party%3A-,\(a\)Availability,-.%20Functioning%20public%20health)", "[accessible to everyone without discrimination](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL#:~:text=on%20Essential%20Drugs.-,\(b\)Accessibility.,-Health%20facilities%2C%20goods)", "[acceptable](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL#:~:text=treated%20with%20confidentiality.-,\(c\)Acceptability,-.%20All%20health%20facilities)", and of "[Good Quality](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL#:~:text=of%20those%20concerned.-,\(d\)Quality,-.%20As%20well%20as)".
1.2.2. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is [legally binding](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/netherlands-yearbook-of-international-law/article/abs/legal-nature-of-the-rights-granted-by-the-international-covenant-on-economic-social-and-cultural-rights/387194EDB02F6531C47E688FD74C088F) when ratified, and [almost every country ratified it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights#States_not_members_of_the_Covenant).
1.2.2.1. Con: The USA, a major world power, [Signed but did not Ratify](https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/TreatyBodyExternal/Treaty.aspx?Treaty=CESCR&Lang=en) the treaty.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The USA is an outlier as it refuses to ratify many otherwise-globally-accepted treaties such as the [Conventaion against Torture](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/24/united-states-ratification-international-human-rights-treaties#_Optional_Protocol_to), the [Arms Trade Treaty](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-05/news/us-quit-arms-trade-treaty), [Convention on the Rights of the Child](https://www.aclu.org/blog/human-rights/treaty-ratification/theres-only-one-country-hasnt-ratified-convention-childrens), [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities), and even the [treaty on treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties#:~:text=Some%20non%2Dratifying%20parties%2C%20such%20as%20the%20United%20States%2C%20recognize%20parts%20of%20it%20as%20a%20restatement%20of%20customary%20international%20law%20and%20binding%20upon%20them%20as%20such.).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: The USA recognizes parts of some non-ratified treaties as [customary international law](https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/treaty/faqs/70139.htm) and [binding upon them as such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties#:~:text=recognize%20parts%20of%20it%20as%20a%20restatement%20of%20customary%20international%20law%20and%20binding%20upon%20them%20as%20such).
1.2.2.2. Con: [Twenty Four countries and 4 non-UN members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights#States_not_members_of_the_Covenant) have not ratified, which is still substantial.
1.2.3. Pro: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is well-regarded, as evidenced but René Cassin being [awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1968 for his work co-drafting it](https://www.renecassin.org/who-we-are/history/#:~:text=Ren%C3%A9%20Cassin%20was%20a%20French,Nobel%20Peace%20Prize%20in%201968.).
1.3. Pro: Health care is necessary for people to live good and fulfilling lives.
1.3.1. Con: Not everything that gives people more fulfilling lives is necessarily a right.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Sex is necessary for people to live good and fulfilling lives in many cases \(and for the survival of the human race\) - but no one is considering sex to be a human right.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: [Reproductive Rights](https://family.findlaw.com/reproductive-rights/what-are-reproductive-rights-.html) often exist.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court has recognized reproductive rights as personal rights that are deemed "fundamental" and which extend to procreation \([Skinner v. Oklahoma](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/316/535.html)\), contraception \([Eisenstadt v. Baird](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/405/438.html)\), family relationships \([Prince v. Massachusetts](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/321/158.html)\) and child rearing \([Pierce v. Society of Sisters](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/268/510.html)\).
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The UN's [OHCHR includes reproductive rights](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/NHRIHandbook.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwip68yurePcAhWHCsAKHcUOD14QFjACegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw2qzdsnJlfDGIsQ4WGFm9HT&cshid=1533933999149) as human rights.
1.3.1.2. Con: Most things that make a fulfilling life are not necessities, however things that facilitate survival are essential for a fulfilled life at all.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Many people would not even have a life without healthcare.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Sex and offspring both facilitate survival and fulfilling lives. You must insist that they are both rights if you want to claim health care is a right using this argument.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Whilst sex and offspring are necessary for the survival of the human species, it is not necessary for individual survival.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: Under this definition, healthcare would only be a right in the event of curable, fatal diseases.
1.3.2. Pro: Bad health leads to suffering. Suffering is something we should avoid. It is ethically wrong to deny poor people health care, and only give it to those privileged few who can pay. Because that means the absence of suffering is a matter of money instead of morals.
1.3.2.1. Con: Money is not as consequential to the absence of suffering as medical and technological advancements are. Rich people of the past had less access to effective care than poor people today do.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Consequently, yesterday's rich are the early adopters that make today's care more accessible and higher quality.
1.3.2.2. Con: Resources are limited. It is impossible to provide a standard of care for everyone that is equivalent to what wealthy people can afford.
1.3.3. Con: Health care is not necessary for a "good and fulfilling" life, but it can be helpful at times, necessary in some cases, and not of any use in other instances. Health care may be necessary for a long life, but not in all cases. Some applications of health care may undermine one's ability to lead a fulfilling life in exchange for a longer life.
1.3.4. Pro: Human suffering should be eliminated, and the way to do that is healthcare. Healthcare is a basic human right, in order to be productive, the standard line is to have a healthy body to work at it.
1.3.5. Pro: We have the inalienable right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Health care is necessary in order to access these other rights.
1.3.5.1. Con: Health care is not necessary to access these rights. One does not need to consult with a doctor before embarking on their dreams or exercising their freedoms.
1.3.5.2. Con: One's rights extend only as far as they do not impact other people. The government spending too much money on health care may negatively affect one's liberty either through high taxation or failing to adequately provide other government services.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Human rights are inherent and cannot be revoked because they merely "impact other people".
1.3.5.3. Con: You are not entitled to the means required to achieve those things.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: People who steal to pay for health care are not excused from their criminal actions.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: You can be entitled to something without being entitled to take any means necessary to get that thing. Having a right doesn't mean you can do anything you like, and break any law, to exercise that right.
1.3.5.4. Con: Life is a right really. It makes sense when you say that nobody can take your life. But you are responsible to take care of it. Nobody is obligated to take care of your life for you. That's what happen when you have a public health care system: all the population have to pay for someone mistake of a single individual through taxes.
1.3.5.5. Pro: Once your survival depends on 24/7 life support, it is a question of whether you are allowed to live.
1.3.5.6. Con: This claim is a perversion of that phrase. Jefferson meant that nobody should be able to hinder your pursuit of happiness. One's health problems are not caused by someone else, but rather biology and life itself.
1.3.5.7. Pro: One billion people across the world [cannot afford health care](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-who-finance/one-billion-people-cannot-afford-healthcare-who-idUSTRE6AL1GV20101122) and getting medical help pushes close to 100 million people into poverty. If a pandemic affecting a billion people is considered a disaster then saving lives of a billion people who cannot afford to is surely compulsion. right to life is a human right and hence healthcare has to be termed as a human right.
1.3.5.8. Pro: As expressed by Mr. T. Jefferson. "all men .  .  .  are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This nation was founded on the principle that life is a right. Health is required for life, therefore health is a right.
1.3.5.8.1. Pro: Medical conditions can interfere with a person’s ability to access all other human rights. If the poor are denied healthcare for lack of money, they are being denied other human rights for lack of money. That goes against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.3.5.8.2. Con: "Health care" is not "health".
1.3.5.8.2.1. Con: But healthcare is the means to ensure good health, therefore showing a right to health shows a right for the healthcare that enables good health.
1.3.5.8.3. Con: Coercive taxes to maintain a health care system inhibit the right to freedom.
1.3.5.8.3.1. Con: The same can be said for taxes for military spending, education, or public office. No modern society has the right to freedom from taxes.
1.3.5.8.4. Pro: Since without health care people die the UDHR granting the "Right to Life" is currently a hypocrisy.
1.3.6. Con: What's also necessary for a good and fulfilling life is exercise, healthy eating, friends, a sense of purpose. Government exists for the protection of rights in order to pursue these things. It's impractical to expect the government provide these things for people
1.3.7. Pro: Without basic bodily health, being a full, self-determined individual participant in society, regardless of the condition of those facts over which you have no control \(race, circumstances of birth, etc.\) is impossible.
1.3.7.1. Con: E.g. Steven Hawking, Helen Keller, etc. Not exactly paragons of human physiology yet immensely participatory in society.
1.4. Con: Health care should remain a privilege, not a right.
1.4.1. Con: It is not clear that health care should only be a privilege for those who can afford it. Many circumstances out of the control of individuals could lead to situations where they have financial difficulties, and the state should therefore provide health care to all.
1.4.2. Pro: There is not enough healthcare provision for it to be a right. Guaranteeing healthcare for all would decrease the quality of the healthcare.
1.4.3. Con: Health should never be seen as a commodity. Deciding whether one can live or not, purely on his income is a crime against humanity.
1.4.3.1. Con: What if a doctor refused to treat an individual based on their moral quality. Still a "crime against humanity?" It seems that health care is not so much the right people insist exists as it is the right to have government guarantee that health care is paid for, which isn't quite the same thing.
1.4.3.2. Con: Food and shelter is both essential to life and not provided by government, and yet almost nobody freezes or starves to death in the western world simply for want of [food](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/05/figures-show-rise-in-malnutrition-deaths-in-england-and-wales) or [shelter](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-10-08/homelessness-a-national-scandal). Homeless deaths make up less than [0.02%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm) of deaths in the USA.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Water is also essential to life, but in the USA is not a right. Crises such as in [Flint Michigan and others](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/us-crises-water-flint-modesto-fracking/) has led to water poverty affecting nearly [1.6 million people](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcgraw-water-poverty-data-20180322-story.html) in the United States. In 2013 to 2014, waterborne diseases [caused](https://businessconnectworld.com/2018/02/15/critical-facts-waterborne-diseases-us/) 289 cases of illness, 108 hospitalizations, and 17 deaths in the United States.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: In the USA, almost [16 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_in_the_United_States#Children) children lived in food-insecure households in 2012. Childhool hunger causes an "[increase in both physical and psychological health problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_in_the_United_States#cite_note-24)".
1.4.3.3. Con: By your logic, a government financially and logistically incapable of providing universal healthcare, and therefore forced to decide "who lives and who dies" a la triage, would be committing multiple "crimes against humanity."
1.4.3.3.1. Con: That situation would not be a decision based purely on the sick persons means. It would be a decision based on the hospitals means.
1.4.4. Pro: Many things are good and desirable that are labeled as rights. But an inherent right is something we are born with. It is something that if there were no laws or society to enforce them, we would have the moral right to assert for ourselves without infringing on the rights of others. Healthcare is a good thing, but it is not a right. It is something to be sought and something we should seek to provide within reason, but it is not on the same level as, for example, the right to free speech.
1.4.4.1. Con: At the philosophical level of this claim there are no inherent rights at all. All human rights are bestowed by humanity with different definitions selected by humans and groups/cultures/nations.
1.4.4.2. Con: There are many different types of human right. While healthcare is not an inherent right \(also called a negative right\), it would still be an "Economic, Social, and Cultural" right \(also called a positive right\).
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Karel Vasaks [Three generations of human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_generations_of_human_rights) includes these rights as human rights \(second and third generations\).
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: The [UN argues that](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/ESCR/Pages/AreESCRfundamentallydifferentfromcivilandpoliticalrights.aspx) the enjoyment of all human rights is interlinked so categories of rights such as “civil and political rights” or “economic, social and cultural rights” make little sense.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: The parent claim of the claim you are supporting is not saying that there should be a differentiation between rights. It is saying that rights can only be given if they are providable.
1.4.4.2.3. Pro: The idea of separating cultural/social/economic rights from civil/political rights [was only temporary](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/ESCR/Pages/AreESCRfundamentallydifferentfromcivilandpoliticalrights.aspx), as a reaction to east/west differences during the cold war. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights no longer makes any distinction between the types of rights.
1.4.4.2.4. Con: [Economic, social and cultural rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights) are not always considered full human rights. The term 'right' is the subject of [continued philosophical debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-9). While there is consensus that human rights encompasses a [wide variety of rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-twsBritannica-5) such as the right to a fair trial, free speech, or a right to education, there is [disagreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#cite_note-twsStanfordEncyclopedia-1) about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights.
1.4.4.2.4.1. Pro: The most international definition of a human right is that of the UN, which includes Education in it's 1948 [Universal declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)
1.4.4.3. Con: Newborn's rights are dependent upon where on the planet they're born. No one, for example, has the right to food, shelter or healthcare, the society of the culture into which you're born dictates your rights according to the laws of that culture. We decide what rights are and who gets them. No one is born with inherent rights.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: While your place of birth \(and actions of others\) affects the extent that your rights are upheld, everyone [still has natural human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) which are inalienable.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: If one's rights can be completely ignored then the recognition of those things as rights is useless.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: There is no such thing as a natural right. The very theory of natural rights is self-evidently the philosophical work of humans.
1.4.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Many things are the philosophical work of humans, like 'justice', 'love', 'fairness', and they are still accepted and part of our reasoning of the world. If these are accepted as concepts that we use to make decision, then so should the concept of 'rights'.
1.4.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: If philosophically made up concepts like "justice" and "fairness" were truly accepted, there would be no room for debate, as all human beings would virtually be on the same page. Instead, individual opinions and interpretations of those concepts can change dramatically even within the same group \(e.g. a son may find a father's punishment to be "unjust"\).
1.4.4.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Despite variations in interpretation, it is still accepted that justice is an accepted concept. Division around the way to implement a concept does not mean that the concept itself is not accepted.
1.4.4.3.1.2.2. Con: Natural rights 'exist' because they are part of human [language](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/natural--rights), defined and used [in our legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights), [studied by science](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=natural+rights), and are also a part of history, [appearing in ancient greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights#cite_note-1) and "developed in the Middle Ages [by Catholic philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) such as Albert the Great".
1.4.4.3.1.2.2.1. Con: That is mere historical evidence that natural rights are, indeed, the work of people.
1.4.4.4. Pro: A similar example is education. Education for all is a good thing; it is an investment that certainly leads to a more prosperous society; however, it is not an inherent human right, such as freedom from slavery, freedom from torture, freedom to live, speak, and act independently, and a right to a fair trial.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: There is nothing inherent about the right to live, speak, act independently or being given a fair trial more so than the right to education.
1.4.5. Pro: Every country is at different levels of advancement, especially in relation to health care. Everyone within one society may well be due the same level of health care but it is not the duty of one society to expect another to uphold its level of healthcare. This is the case with housing in first world countries vs third world countries, as well as many other areas such as food hygiene, wifi access, policing etc. It is a privilege to those countries that have it, and may be for others one day too.
1.4.6. Con: That's a matter of perspective. The United States is the only western country that does not have universal health care. In most European countries the state sees health care as a human right, not a business.
1.4.6.1. Con: Universal Health Care is just another Govt service, and they manage the cost and what treatments are available to you, and when. You are limited to the choices they decide to offer you, latest and expensive treatments may not be on the menu. It's not a bad approach, but it's a service and not a 'right'.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Right to healthcare does not equate to the right to have the best possible healthcare.
1.4.6.2. Con: [Argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) is a terrible way to decide government policy. Just because a policy is accepted somewhere else is no reason it should be uncritically accepted.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: This is an [argument from fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy). Just because the argument uses a fallacy does not mean that the conclusion is wrong.
1.4.7. Pro: If you can't afford health care, a doctor, treatment, or medicine, you have no right to it.
1.4.7.1. Con: Many other existing human rights also require money, trained paid professionals, infrastructure, a stable state etc.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: The [right to a fair trial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial) is a similar human right that is functioning. It is similar in that it needs trained paid professionals, extensive infrastructure, and public funding.
1.4.7.1.1.1. Pro: This is defined by [the Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights), the [Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), and Article 6 of the [European Convention of Human Rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights).
1.4.7.1.1.2. Con: The right to a fair trial is a negative right, meaning the government shall not infringe upon an individual's access to a fair and speedy trial by a jury of their peers. This right is less about the individual and more about what the government shall not do to said individual.
1.4.7.1.1.2.1. Con: All previous rights could be described as "negative rights".
1.4.7.1.1.2.2. Con: The right to a trial is not just a promise to not infringe on any trial, it is also a promise to provide the trial. This makes it a positive right \(requiring something\) rather than a negative right \(not doing something\).
1.4.7.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The right to a trial is a special protection afforded to people due to the fact that the government is legally allowed to infringe some negative human rights: liberty, freedom of movement, etc. Therefore, it is, technically, a positive right, but it is a different situation.
1.4.7.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Absent this right, defendants could be jailed indefinitely with no trial, or tried without a defense attorney.
1.4.7.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: In the US, the Sixth Amendment [grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) criminal defendants the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury .
1.4.7.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: In the EU the right to a fair trial [includes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_6_%E2%80%93_fair_trial) being provided with a public hearing within reasonable time, adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, and the right to the free assistance of an interpreter.
1.4.7.1.1.2.2.5. Pro: The universal decleration of human rights, applied almost universally, [includes](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) the right to a trial, not just protection from governments infringing on any trial.
1.4.7.1.1.3. Con: This too, is in effect eliminated through Bureaucracy. [More than 90%](https://thelawdictionary.org/article/what-percentage-of-lawsuits-settle-before-trial-what-are-some-statistics-on-personal-injury-settlements/) of the cases never get to a jury, and the prosecutors have enormous leeway in selecting which transgressions they will bring to trial.
1.4.7.1.1.3.1. Con: This doesn't contradict the fact that every defendant has the right to an attorney, state-funded if necessary.
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: The [right to food](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food), [right to housing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_housing), and other [rights to standard of life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_an_adequate_standard_of_living) are [internationally defined and accepted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights), but require labor, money, and effort.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Con: The link to 'right to food' in the above claim explicitly states that "The right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it, or a right to be fed." This is not a human right in the same way that health care is suggested to become a human right.
1.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The right to food is defined by access to "adequate food", as well as being "free from hunger". Healthcare as a human right could be defined in a similar fashion eg "adequate heath care" and being "free from avoidable deaths" \(or "free from reasonably treatable illness" etc..\)
1.4.7.1.2.1.2. Con: The [ICESCR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food#CITEREFCommittee_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights1999) says "the right to adequate food is realised when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, have the physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement." This definition could directly replace "food" with "health care" and work well.
1.4.7.1.3. Con: These rights are different, they are [positive not negative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights), and are [economic, social, and cultural.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights) They are not top level human rights.
1.4.7.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.
1.4.7.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.
1.4.7.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.3.
1.4.7.1.3.4. Con: Even core civil and political rights require money - to secure e. g. fair trial requires training of judges and officers, maintaining judiciary and its infrastructure, establishing law enforcement etc. Similarly negative, not only positive rights require budget e. g. educating state officers about what they are prohibited to do as incompatible with human rights.
1.4.7.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.4.
1.4.7.1.4. Con: These also shouldn't be considered rights. Rights should not impose any obligation on others, they should only require non-interference.
1.4.7.1.5. Pro: The right to vote requires the state to offer every voter suitable means and locations to vote, including election officials and judges.
1.4.7.1.6. Pro: The [right to education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education) is a similar human right which is accepted and functioning. It is similar in that it requires a functioning economy, trained paid professionals, and has a private alternative.
1.4.7.1.6.1. Con: The right to education is a limited right. It generally applies at a certain age and up to a certain level of education. It is not as simple to limit the right to health care.
1.4.7.1.6.1.1. Con: There is no need/reason to limit healthcare for non-elective medical issues.
1.4.7.1.6.1.2. Con: Elective medical issues, for example anything cosmetic, are already limited in most western public healthcare systems.
1.4.7.1.6.1.3. Con: All human rights are limited in some ways. The right to life is limited when the only way to continue your life is to kill someone else. The right to freedom of speech \(opinion and expression\) is limited in many countries if inciting hate crimes, or revealing secrets you legally agreed to keep \(Official Secrets Act, Non-disclosure agreements\).
1.4.7.1.6.2. Pro: The UN [Right To Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights) has been agreed by 166 states, and has been in effect since 1976.
1.4.7.1.6.2.1. Con: "Most \[signatories\] do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights."
1.4.7.1.6.3. Con: Healthcare costs more than Education.
1.4.7.1.6.3.1. Con: Cost should not decide what is a right, but only cause a limit to the extent a right can be upheld.
1.4.7.1.6.3.2. Pro: In the UK, Healthcare [costs](https://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_total_spending_pie_chart) £149.7 billion \(19%\), but Education only costs £85.3 billion \(11%\).
\([USA](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/united_states_total_spending_pie_chart):  22% / 15%\).
1.4.7.2. Con: If people don't have a good health, they can't work, thus they can't pay for good health care either. That puts them at an unfair disadvantage.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: "Fairness" has no place in this discussion, as it is vague and subjective.
1.4.7.3. Pro: There is a vast difference between an entitlement, that a government is expected to provide and rights, that a government is expected to not to violate.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: When a government is expected to provide something \(as opposed to not being allowed to do something\) it is not nessecarily an entitlement, it could be a["Positive" right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights).
1.4.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.4.8. Pro: Health care is a privilege in countries that can afford to give it. If a country has it then the right to the health care goes to the person as a citizen, not as a human, because humans that are not a citizen in that country won't have the right to get access to it.
1.4.8.1. Con: Most countries can afford this right. Countries that choose not to are prioritising other expenditure at the disadvantage of looking after their citizens.
1.4.8.2. Con: There is cooperation between countries, and people are known to go to other countries to get treatments not available in their country. And the same goes the other way around - [health professionals travel to undeveloped countries](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/) to help provide medical aid to people unfortunate enough to not have it readily available.
1.4.9. Con: Regardless of your political ideology, we have advanced our technology to the point where there is no excuse for depriving it. Only our flawed ethics, moral values and fraudulent monetary economy prevent it.
1.4.9.1. Con: The advanced technology has only served to increase the cost, not lessen it. This argument would only make sense if healthcare costs were being constantly reduced.
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: The cost of heath care per capita has been [steadily increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita).
1.4.9.1.1.1. Con: This would suggest that alternatives to capitalism, such as mutual aid, might better serve to ensure access to healthcare for all.
1.4.9.1.2. Con: A good deal of modern medical costs for the hospitals \(not directly by consumers\) is administration needed to handle payments from virtually limitless insurance companies. With a single-payer system, a good deal of gross medical expenses in the US would be shaved off.
1.4.10. Con: The majority of developed nations and a growing proportion of developing nations [already provide universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care). As more countries provide universal health care, the international consensus grows strong enough that health care can be deemed a right.
1.4.10.1. Con: This is an [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum). [Private healthcare finances 36.9% of the medical research](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-06-16/us-leads-world-in-scientific-research-output-but-dominance-shrinking-study) the other countries use to provide their free health care.
1.4.11. Pro: Health is not a human right but the right to live is a human right, so the country should provide what is necessary to save the person's life and put it out of risk of disease to all people in an equal way.
1.4.12. Con: That means survival is a privilege not a right. Treating health care as a privilege suggests people who were dealt a bad hand don't deserve to survive as much as people who were dealt good hands.
1.4.12.1. Con: Strawman: no mention of "deserve", subjective evaluation of worth, was ever brought up in the parent claim.
1.4.13. Pro: The aim should be to increase the amount of healthcare available to the population and to reduce the price they have to pay for it. There is no evidence that declaring healthcare to be a human right makes it more abundant. Therefore, we shouldn't declare it it a human right, and should instead follow an evidence based approach.
1.4.14. Pro: Rights are something inherent in your being, not a good or service to be provided to you at someone else's expense. If someone provides something to you at no expense, that is called a gift or a privilege. Gifts and privileges can be retracted. On the other hand, your rights cannot be retracted or rescinded since you never received them from an outside source. Your rights may be abused and even denied, but you still have that right even if you cannot freely exercise it.
1.4.14.1. Pro: Some inherent rights are the right to life, to worship as you please, to liberty, to pursue your own happiness, to speak freely and to defend yourself. The only limit on them is that you cannot infringe on someone else's right to attain them. Your rights end where someone else's rights begin. If you force someone to give you healthcare, then you have denied them their right to liberty since you would have denied them the ability to refuse to serve you.
1.4.14.2. Pro: Since health care can be provided by the government, they can also retract or even limit that care. That would make it a privilege, not a right.
1.4.15. Pro: The term "human right" is problematic and a purely intellectual construct not echoed in nature.
1.4.15.1. Con: Examples such as Justice, Equality, and Freedom of speech are beneficial for humanity but are not echoed in nature.
1.4.15.1.1. Con: Equality among humans is echoed in nature, hierarchy is a social construct.
1.4.15.1.2. Con: Justice is a product of the supposed natural right to self defense and the right to property.
1.4.15.1.3. Con: Freedom of speech is a derivative of the supposed natural right to freewill.
1.4.15.2. Con: The meaning of "human right" is [well defined](https://www.kialo.com/is-health-care-a-human-right-7304/7304.0=7304.1-7304.47-7304.121-7304.130+7304.96+7304.98) internationally.
1.4.15.2.1. Con: The definition provided by the UN does not make it any less intangible. If the UN were to dissolve tomorrow, the existence of your rights should not change, nor should rights have been non-existent prior to the formation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, nor could it be said that the definition provided by the UN is infallible. If human rights must be defined by a declaration, then they are nothing more than an educated opinion on best practices.
1.4.15.3. Con: Human rights are the things that we, as humans, are entitled to. Such things are echoed in nature as seen in the case of animals living in prides or groups. All animals are responsible for not only their own welfare, but they must also ensure that the other members of the group are well fed, protected, etc. Thus, rights are not merely a "purely intellectual construct" but rather a means of survival which is frequently echoed in nature.
1.4.15.4. Con: Health care is also not "echoed in nature." There is no logical reason to not define who gets access to one human invention \(health care\) by relying on another human invention \(human rights\).
1.5. Pro: Health care being guaranteed as a human right has societal benefits.
1.5.1. Con: It would be difficult to weigh public health as a right against personal autonomy in legal situations.
1.5.1.1. Pro: For example, if health care was a human right, then government might feel obligated to illegalize tobacco, enforce vaccinations, etc. All which intrude on persons' liberties.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: This is a [slippery slope fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope), because there is no more reason for healthcare to trigger excessive prohibition/enforcements than other existing concerns like wanting a healthy population \(so they can work\), or having to pay for existing non-rights driven public healthcare.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Some policies, such as the opt out program in organ donation, are controversial because they treat people as means to an end to improve public health.
1.5.2. Pro: Free treatment facilities for people with substance abuse problems has been linked to lower instances of violent and [financially motivated crimes](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/01/03/new-evidence-that-access-to-health-care-reduces-crime/); denying free health care to the most vulnerable individuals have societal repercussions.
1.5.3. Pro: Universal healthcare can reduce the spread of communicable diseases.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Free medical assistance has been essential in tackling outbreaks, such as [Ebola](https://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/emergencies-disasters-humanitarian-response/ebola-virus-outbreak-in-west-africa-2014-2016).
1.5.3.2. Pro: Just as letting your neighbors' houses burn will eventually cost you your own, allowing viruses and bacteria to spread among the poor unchecked gives those diseases a haven to improve their capabilities
1.5.3.3. Con: Many things can reduce the spread of communicable diseases, including curtailing freedoms.
1.5.4. Pro: Many people suffer poor health and injuries through no fault of their own. They should always be able to receive the necessary health care and treatment.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Many health trends are indicative of [underlying](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108512/) [social issues](https://www.healthynewbornnetwork.org/news-item/is-indias-healthcare-system-failing-premature-babies-even-before-they-are-born/). Providing health care expounds upon the right to social security, and social, economic and cultural help from the government.
1.5.4.2. Con: [A right is what is owed/allowed to people by its society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights) and is subject to what is doable. No one can owe you a treatment if it is impossible to provide. Therefore, there won't be any right if it is not providable in a particular society.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: If food is not readily available in your vicinity, you will not be able to eat. However, that does not imply that you have lost your right to eat - you have simply run out of the resource. Once replenished, you should have access to it. Same goes for medical treatments. Starvation leads to death, just like a medical condition can.
1.5.4.3. Con: Heathcare does not need to be provided by the government for it to be freely available. The markets — businesses — can do that.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: Companies have no motivation to provide *free* healthcare, by definition companies aim for profit. They can very well provide it, but if it is a right we need the state to *guarantee* the terms under which it is provided.
1.5.4.3.2. Con: When healthcare is provided by the private sector, it can still be a human right, it would just be enforced by government regulations.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: But they don't. And they never will, because they can't profit off of that.
1.5.4.4. Con: Suffering poor health and injuries is a consequence of living. These things are not caused by anyone else, and therefore nobody else should be obligated to service/fix those things.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: There are many cases where poor health and injuries can be caused by others, and are not a consequence of just living. Examples could include car crashes where the injured person was not to blame, or an employers poor health and safety causing an employee to suffer an injury/illness.
1.5.4.4.2. Con: The population as a whole is responsible for a number of diseases \(e.g. STD's\). Therefore the population as a whole should be obliged to remedy this.
1.5.4.4.3. Con: Natural disasters are not caused by anyone else. However, society should be obligated to service/fix the damage natural disasters cause. The same goes for illness, natural or otherwise.
1.5.4.5. Con: The above claim is false because 'should' implies 'can'. Unfortunately however, the necessary health care and treatment is not always available.
1.5.4.5.1. Con: In common usage, "should" does not imply "can" and more frequently implies "can't". Usually people say they should be able to do something as a critique of the current system that does not allow them to do so.
1.5.4.5.2. Con: No resource is truly infinite. This includes air, water, and food. The fact that not all of those resources are always readily available doesn't mean that we shouldn't have any rights to them.
1.5.4.6. Con: Morality doesnt play a role in health outcomes. Everyone that is seen at the ER is treated, regardless of their ability to pay immediately. It is up to that individual to pay their debt afterward.
1.5.4.6.1. Con: This will lead to further marginalisation of lower-income groups who will simply be unable to pay for their healthcare. If they require multiple treatments, then they may never be able to pay.
1.5.4.6.2. Con: The ER is a solution to only a tiny proportion of healthcare problems. Many conditions require lifelong management such as diabetes where an admission to the ER and most likely hospital would be seen a a failure to manage the condition appropriately and most cost effectively.
1.5.4.7. Con: We may all agree in this premise, but it does not mean it is a right. Rights should be reserved for natural rights.
1.5.4.8. Con: Health care is a finite resource, with many components, so it cannot be provided to every person equally. This means it cannot be a right.
1.5.4.8.1. Con: "Human right" doesn't mean equal application. It just means guaranteed opportunity for.
1.5.4.8.1.1. Con: This suggests that there isn't a right to health care, merely a right to pursue health care.
1.5.4.8.1.1.1. Con: Or it can suggest the right to health care means you have a right to pursue \(and have guaranteed opportunity to get\) a reasonable level of care. You don't the the right to get the same heath care as someone in another country, but you do have the right to have the best your country can afford to reasonably provide.
1.5.4.8.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.1.
1.5.4.8.3. Pro: Health care is difficult to define.
1.5.4.8.3.1. Con: Almost every country on earth has agreed definitions on the right to health care through the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights art. 12 and several other International human rights treaties. This includes [specific definitions](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf) such as "Safe drinking water/food", "access to essential medicines", and "available, accessible, acceptable and good quality" access to "health services".
1.5.4.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.5.4.8.4. Pro: Fiercely contested components \(e.g. organ donations\) should be offered in terms of clinical suitability and likelihood of improvement, not equally.
1.5.4.8.4.1. Con: If finite resources such as organs are offered where they can have the most positive impact, then it's an exercise of the belief that the whole population's health should be improved. This is very similar to the belief that all humans in the population equally deserve health improvements.
1.5.4.8.5. Con: Healthcare as a finite resource does not mean that it cannot be considered a right. Disproved by water as a finite resource yet the [UN defines right to water as a human right upon which others depend.](http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml)
1.5.4.8.5.1. Con: Because a government body considers something a right does not necessarily make it such.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1. Con: This is not a government body, it is a council with representation of 47 members representing every region in the world. Its [decisions](https://www.right2water.eu/sites/water/files/UNHRC%20Resolution%2015-9.pdf) are the combined knowledge of the most important humans rights body in the world.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1.1. Con: If a council representing every region in the world declares something a human right it doesn't necessarily make it a right even with the combined knowledge of the world.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact is that whatever that council states is unanimously accepted as a right throughout the world. Your opposition towards it is only a mere a opinion.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It can't possibly be accepted unanimously throughout the world.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: They did not poll all 7 billion people on the planet and all 7 billion people did not agree.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even, presuming, the member states' representatives count as "unanimous consent throughout the world", which, again, they absolutely should not, the governments of the nations they represent do not unanimously adhere to the statement of rights so it can't be considered acceptance throughout the world.
1.5.4.8.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: That council's statement is also a mere opinion.
1.5.4.8.5.2. Con: Health care does not occur naturally. If water comes through a pipe or in a bottle you still pay for it.
1.5.4.8.5.2.1. Con: Water is a human right wether it is found naturally, paid for by the bottle, or delivered by pipe. The right to water [includes](http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml) it being Affordable \(less than 3% of household income\), Physically accessible \(delivered to the house, as opposed to having to travel somewhere to acquire it\) and sufficient \(including for washing clothes and hygiene \). Being natural is not a requirement for a human right.
1.5.4.8.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.
1.5.4.8.5.3. Con: It is a lot easier to provide someone with clean water than with quality health care, so this is not a good comparison.
1.5.4.8.6. Con: Food and shelter are finite resources, but generally accepted as basic human rights.
1.5.4.8.6.1. Con: "General acceptance" does not denote truth. There are many cases where people generally accept something but the claims are either unproved or demonstrably false.
1.5.4.8.6.1.1. Con: In this case, it is likely truthful as it is also [internationally legally accepted](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-are-human-rights/what-universal-declaration-human-rights). There are also no known groups advocating for food and shelter to be removed as a human right. This means that it is very likely correct that human beings deserve food and shelter.
1.5.4.8.7. Con: A 'right' is not based on it's cost or availability or material requirements. Many generally accepted rights are limited by real circumstances, but we do not usually accept that something is too expensive to be a right for everyone.
1.5.4.8.7.1. Con: Health care is unique because it is much more expensive than any other necessary good like food or water. It is also not readily available from nature.
1.5.4.8.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.1.6.3.1.
1.5.4.8.7.2. Con: Your definition is correct when applied to [negative rights](http://www.globalization101.org/negative-vs-positive-rights/), you are misapplying it as a positive right to a commodity.
1.5.4.8.8. Con: Many countries \(e.g., most in Europe\) provide healthcare equally to all their citizens funding it with taxes. In this way everyone pays taxes proportionally to what they earn, and everybody gets healthcare. Nobody has to go bankrupt because they can't afford healthcare or medical cost, and the country receives all the money needed to run the healthcare system, which does not "run out" of resources until wages are paid and supplies are bought.
1.5.4.8.8.1. Con: Universal healthcare is not in fact provided equally: time is a huge factor with regards to restricting access and recipients often wait months to receive treatment. See [Canada](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/waiting-your-turn-wait-times-for-health-care-in-canada-2018), [Britain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/europe/uk-national-health-service.html), and [Veteran's Affairs](https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2018/06/04/report-vets-still-face-long-waits-with-va-choice-program/)
1.5.4.8.8.1.1. Con: In countries with a public healthcare system you can still find private doctors and pay them in case you do not wish to wait.
1.5.4.8.9. Pro: Declaring health care to be a human right could either be meaningless if referring to a minimal quality, or ruinous if referring to a high quality. The inability to quantify the exact amount which should be owed to each person makes a right to health care impractical.
1.5.4.8.9.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.8.3.1.
1.5.4.8.9.2. Con: Many other human rights have semi-vague quantifications, and still function well. The specifics can be left to each government.
1.5.4.8.9.2.1. Pro: The human right to education is [only required to be](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) "made generally available", and higher education has to be "equally accessible to all on the basis of merit". Education is a well functioning human right despite the minimum/maximum quantity being unspecified.
1.5.4.8.9.2.2. Pro: The right to work has [no specific qualifications](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) like hours worked or pay, it merely specifies "free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment." and protects from discrimination.
1.5.4.8.9.2.3. Con: A right cannot be vague or it is meaningless.
1.5.4.8.9.2.4. Con: This argument is fallacious as it is predicated on other human rights being accepted as human rights. Further, the "others" are undefined.
1.5.4.8.9.3. Con: Low-quality healthcare is better than none, and high-quality healthcare need not be ruinous \(e.g. many European nations, such as [Luxembourg](https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2016-legatum-prosperity-index-pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=2)\)
1.5.4.8.9.3.1. Con: [Luxembourg](http://fortune.com/2017/11/17/richest-country-in-the-world/) is the number two per-capita wealthiest nation on earth.
1.5.4.8.9.3.2. Con: Employee entitlements \([pensions](https://www.city-journal.org/police-unions-16198.html), healthcare\) for a minuscule government employee/first-responder workforce are destroying government budgets at all levels - city, state, country - as it is. The United States' Veteran's Association [can't even guarantee timely coverage](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/va-hospital-scandal/va-numbers-how-big-it-who-uses-it-n101771) for its retired military personnel. Adding a citizen-wide entitlement like [healthcare](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article217556050.html) would outright bankrupt most governments.
1.5.4.8.10. Con: This is a non sequitur because whether something is available in unlimited quantities does not determine if people have a right to it. We all have a right to live, therefore to breathe even though the amount of air in the atmosphere is finite. The right to live is connected to the right to medical care whether or not the current supply is sufficient for our needs. Rights are not dependent on surpluses or shortages in supply.
1.5.4.8.10.1. Con: This claim proves the underlying infeasibility of proscribing positive rights to a good or service. Availability absolutely dictates access: if it's not there you can't have it. The right to live \(breathe air\) means nothing in an atmospheric vacuum - your "right" to air and healthcare are both meaningless. The right to live is a negative right, meaning the government is encouraged to do nothing to infringe upon it, unless necessary.
1.5.4.8.11. Pro: A right cannot guarantee access to something that cannot be guaranteed to exist. E.g. A living person can have a right to their life, but cannot have a right to a life-sustaining medicine, as medicines from time to time may be inaccessible: they must first be concocted by an inventor, brought into existence by a manufacturer \(assuming the raw materials exist to produce them\), and be made in an abundance and location such that those with "rights" to them can obtain them.
1.5.4.8.12. Pro: It does not make sense to try and provide health care to every person equally, as circumstances differ between people.
1.5.4.8.13. Pro: There is an [insufficient number](https://www.birminghammedicalnews.com/news.php?viewStory=1161) of [health care professionals](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/face-worldwide-shortage-medics-relaxing-visa-caps-nhs-just-sticking/) working an insufficient number of man-hours to provide the level of care desired by universal healthcare advocates. Artificial external measures would be required to encourage/force capable individuals to take up medical careers who otherwise would not.
1.5.4.8.13.1. Con: [Some suggest that the inefficient system currently used is actually the problem](https://hbr.org/2020/03/the-problem-with-u-s-health-care-isnt-a-shortage-of-doctors). Theoretical predictions suggest twice the amount of physicians exist for our population today. But theoretical predictions can't account for issues like inflexible care models, uneven distribution of physicians, and inefficient physician labor. Physician groups who adopt better care models mirror theoretical predictions. The US healthcare system could handle universal care if current healthcare models were updated.
1.5.4.9. Pro: Not all countries are well-developed and have private hospitals/clinics to treat some long-term diseases or tumors at an accessible price, if a quality public healthcare service is offered, both those who can afford it and those who can't will benefit from it.
1.5.4.9.1. Con: There is a difference between an obligation and a human right. You describe the former.
1.5.4.10. Pro: Depending on the illness, some treatments are inexpensive while others are exorbitantly priced. It is therefore logical to spread the costs over a large number of people.
1.5.4.10.1. Con: Expense is subjective and therefore irrelevant with regards to whether or not something should be considered a human right. Either people should have it or they should not.
1.5.4.10.1.1. Con: Rights traditionally haven't been based on providing a service but not barring people from doing something. Free speech doesn't mean providing everyone with their own publishing house, gun rights don't imply that everyone gets a free gun.
1.5.4.10.1.1.1. Con: "Healthcare as a right" is a logical fallacy from the perspective of negative rights: the government cannot deny you free speech, firearms, or healthcare. It is not obligated to provide them - that falls upon the individual.
1.5.4.11. Pro: Poor health may be caused by forces beyond our control such as pollution and environmental stressors. It is society's responsibility to alleviate the suffering caused by those occurrences.
1.5.4.12. Pro: Heart disease, cancer, thyroid disease, and depression are all examples of well-known chronic illnesses. None of this is at the fault of the individual.
1.5.4.12.1. Con: Heart disease and diabetes, along with most common illnesses, are directly related to the [decisions of the person](https://mphprogramslist.com/chronic-disease-a-self-inflicted-pandemic/). Medicating or repairing damage to self inflicted injury should not be a right.
1.5.4.13. Pro: Disease is a weakness that we all share. Therefore we should pool our resources and band together.
1.5.4.13.1. Con: Human psychology is full of weaknesses that lead to behaviors contrary to our health and well-being. Taking collective action to address the behavioral shortcomings of individuals is problematic, but probably necessary if we accept that premise that instances of weakness demand societal intervention.
1.5.4.13.2. Con: Healthier people should not have to pay for the unhealthy choices of those who do not care for themselves. This is taxation of health and subsidy of illness.
1.5.4.13.3. Pro: People that are sick do not choose it this way. It's not a privilege to be treated humanely and with respect, and to receive the necessary treatment for ones condition. It's sometimes difficult for healthy people to understand the impact that being sick carries. Sometimes loss of a career, home, friends and unfortunately even family. We should offer our fullest support to these people in our community, and they inreturn should be cared for at the highest possible level.
1.5.4.13.4. Con: "Should" does not equal "Must". A goal is not the same as a demand. Even in the Communist Manifesto we have the concept of "ability". That applies to society as well as the individual. As our society becomes wealthier, we may become more generous, but generosity is not an obligation, and we often forget the difference.
1.5.5. Con: Depends on the definition of health care. If health care merely means emergency life-sustaining treatment, this has a chance of becoming policy. If health care means anything that improves well-being, the policy would be too broad to employ in policy.
1.5.5.1. Con: [Many countries](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/best-health-care-system-country-bracket.html) already do provide healthcare that improves wellbeing rather than just emergency treatment.
1.5.6. Con: Not all things that benefit society are or should be a right. Health care is one of them.
1.5.7. Pro: Universally available preventive health care is more cost-effective than tertiary treatment. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, including communicable disease, which is beneficial to society as a whole.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Not providing health care to young people increases costs in the long run. If you treat a wound before it infects you can have this person being a constructive member of society again, if you wait until after it infects he might lose his leg and has to live off the State for the rest of his life.
1.5.8. Con: There are no positive benefits for those being forced to pay for the unhealthy or elderly out of force.
1.5.8.1. Con: Those people are still benefitted later if they end up with health conditions that require a great deal of expensive medical care.
1.5.8.2. Con: Health care does not mean only treatment it is prevention as well. Everyone can benefit from prevention no matter what their current health situation is.
1.5.9. Con: Forcing people to buy pay for healthcare via the state, through taxes or other means, has serious negative consequences.
1.5.9.1. Pro: It leads to a state monopoly for all but the richest in society, devoid of competition. If you think the service is terrible, you still have to pay for it and there is nothing you can realistically do to change matters. In a free-market model with price transparency one can go to another service provider if they are getting bad service or paying too much. This creates a competitive advantage for healthcare providers which do a good job, and they thus grow to cover more people.
1.5.9.2. Pro: If one would rather spend their money on living a more comfortable but shorter life, one isn't given this option. Instead, you have to pay for the service of life extension even if you don't particularly want it.
1.5.9.2.1. Con: There is no way to contractually obligate someone to die early rather than accept the health care they didn't pay for. Relatively few people choose suicide over medical treatment, for a "comfortable but shorter life" when ill.
1.5.9.2.1.1. Con: There is no need to contractually obligate someone to die early in a system without universal healthcare.
1.5.9.3. Pro: You may be forced to fund things you are morally opposed to e.g. animal testing, sex changes, abortion.
1.5.9.3.1. Con: This is no different than what happens with any sort of taxes - they fund war and prisons, because that's what our duly elected representatives decided on our behalf.
1.5.9.3.1.1. Con: That doesn't stop it being a negative thing.
1.5.9.4. Pro: A bad government is much more dangerous if they control access to medical services. For example, a racist government could refuse to treat people of a given ethnicity, or more realistically they could refuse to fund treatment of diseases which disproportionately affect people of a given ethnicity.
1.5.9.5. Pro: In a universal system, there will always be long waiting times due to the demand exceeding supply due to the price being zero. This creates opportunity for corruption in whoever controls the waiting lists. e.g. they could be bribed into moving people higher up, they could drop their enemies lower down the list.
1.5.10. Pro: There is a benefit to all for maximum people being healthy. We pay for bad health anyway through lost work, homelessness, contagion and such.The differential goes ever greater when the costs of insurance companies and benefit managers are minimized.
1.5.10.1. Con: Universal healthcare doesn't necesarrily lead to a healthiar population, as it removes the financial incentive for living a healthy lifestyle.
1.5.11. Con: If treated as a civil right, people won't take responsibility for unhealthy behaviors.
1.5.11.1. Con: Even if people pay for it themselves, it does not guarantee the absence of unhealthy behaviors. People that pay are just as likely to have unhealthy behaviors as those who do not pay.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: The objective "to guarantee the absence of unhealthy behaviors" is completely unrealistic. That has never been achieved or even stated as an aim of health care.
1.5.11.1.1.1. Con: That wasn't the point. Their point is that financial burden on the patient wouldn't necessarily make them any less likely to quit unhealthy habits.
1.5.11.2. Pro: Incentives matter. When people face no responsibility for the outcome of their actions their behaviour will reflect this.
1.5.11.2.1. Con: There is a built-in consequence to unhealthy actions - being unhealthy.
1.5.11.3. Pro: Free health care could lead to citizens not caring for their heath because getting ill or injured has little to no financial downside. This leads to a unnecessary strain on whomever pays for the care ie. the government. It would lead to society being worse because of lack of people caring about their heath. If a person can become extremely obese and not pay for the problems created, it would damage society instead of helping it.
1.5.11.3.1. Con: This is a slippery slope argument. Just because there is no financial downside doesn't mean there isn't a physical downside. No one would purposely hurt themselves because they could get healthcare for free. [Universal healthcare is meant to ease the financial burden on someone who is already dealing with a physical burden.](https://www.who.int/health-topics/universal-health-coverage)
1.5.11.4. Con: Even if healthcare were free, people still wouldn't want to spend all their free time at hospitals, and they wouldn't risk injuring themselves \(any more than they already do\) for fear that they'd die before they received treatment.
1.5.11.5. Con: Countries can create [incentives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5016732/) that nudge people towards better life choices. Many countries that provide universal health care already do.
1.5.11.6. Con: There is no evidence to suggest this claim, but [evidence to support the opposite](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2011/07/does_health_coverage_make_people_healthier.html).
1.5.11.6.1. Con: All this shows is that giving some people healthcare at the expense of everyone else increases the health and happiness of those that were selected relative to those who were not. To be fair, the study would have had to have given the control group the same amount of money that was needed to purchase the health insurance.
1.5.12. Pro: A healthy society is a productive society. Providing health care to all will promote/improve our economy.
1.5.12.1. Con: Universal health care would be incredibly costly and detrimental to economy.
1.5.12.1.1. Pro: The US health care cost has been growing and [recently accounted for nearly 20% of the GDP expenditure.](https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-dozen-facts-about-the-economics-of-the-u-s-health-care-system/)
1.5.12.1.2. Con: [Most countries provide universal healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care), showing that any detrimental economic effects are not substantial.
1.5.12.2. Pro: Studies and international health organisations agree that healthcare drives economic growth.
1.5.12.2.1. Pro: A [US study found that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237575/) improving public health care funding improved income, GDP, labor productivity, and an overall better economy.
1.5.12.2.2. Pro: The world Bank claims that [increasing healthcare is beneficial to the economy](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/universalhealthcoverage), and is a "foundational investment in economic growth".
1.5.12.2.3. Pro: The Council of Economic Advisers \(CEA\) [predicts](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/cea/TheEconomicCaseforHealthCareReform/) that a 1.5% increase in healthcare spending would lead to a 2-8% increase in GDP.
1.5.12.3. Pro: The combined economic impact of ill-health currently sits at a [£77.5 billion a year](https://www.consultancy.uk/news/15551/sick-staff-cost-british-firms-77-billion-annually-in-lost-productivity) for the UK economy.
1.5.12.3.1. Con: This is lower than the UKs Health Care budget, of [£145 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending_in_the_United_Kingdom).
1.5.12.4. Pro: Universally available health care results in more preventative measures and lifestyle modification, which is vastly more cost effective and has better outcomes.
1.5.12.4.1. Pro: The World Health Organization \(WHO\) reports that preventative interventions are cost-effective in both the [shorter and longer term](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/278073/Case-Investing-Public-Health.pdf)(The evidence shows that prevention can be cost-effective, provide value for money and\ngive returns on investment in both the short and longer terms. \(p.4\)).
1.5.12.4.2. Pro: Every dollar spent on preventing obesity has a [six-fold return](https://www.oecd.org/health/tackling-obesity-would-boost-economic-and-social-well-being.htm)(Every dollar invested in preventing obesity would generate an economic return of up to six dollars, according to the report.) on investment.
1.5.12.5. Con: While society benefits from the health of its members, and in reassuring people that they will be taken care of, the state should not make promises which it cannot keep. There must be a limit on the amount of assistance provided publicly because state budgets are not infinite.
1.5.12.6. Con: As has been seen around history, a government is the worst provider of this type of services. By giving them the power to run the health industry, a completely inefficient system is created, with very high prices, with dull processes and bureaucracy. Not to mention corruption and monopolies.
1.5.12.6.1. Con: This is not what the [data from WHO](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf) says.
1.5.12.6.2. Con: Universal Healthcare can be cheaper and more efficient than the alternatives.
1.5.12.6.2.1. Pro: US government's spending on healthcare [outstrips UK government spending](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42950587), both in terms of the proportion of its GDP, and in terms of how much it spends per head.
1.5.12.6.3. Con: Healthcare doesn't need to be provided by the government. The government can just act in the best interests of the society and implement regulations on certain sectors that will limit how high will the costs be to receive healthcare. Nothing should be free, however, things should be affordable to everyone, specially something as your life.
1.5.12.7. Con: There are many healthy societies that are not necessarily more productive societies. This seems like a unrealistic generalization especially with America being so unhealthy and so productive.
1.5.12.7.1. Con: This does not invalidate the claim that unhealthy societies will be, by their definition, less productive. Healthy societies are [empirically more productive](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPREMNET/Resources/489960-1338997241035/Growth_Commission_Working_Paper_24_Population_Health_Economic_Growth.pdf).
1.5.12.7.2. Con: By many global standards \(e.g. life expectancy, infant mortality, immunization rate...\), America is not unhealthy.
1.5.12.8. Con: An improved economy is not a characteristic of a human right.
1.5.12.8.1. Con: There is a direct correlation between the improvement of human rights based on a positive economy. Ergo it's not a characteristic but more of a requirement for human rights to exist. [Fragility of Human Rights.](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PROJECTS/Resources/40940-1331068268558/Report_Development_Fragility_Human_Rights.pdf)
1.5.12.9. Pro: Developed countries without universal health care work [inefficiently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445925/). Per capita costs are significantly higher, while health outcomes are no better than in other countries.
1.5.12.9.1. Con: The link doesn't claim this. It just claims that the USA has an inefficient healthcare system.
1.5.12.9.1.1. Con: The US is the [only developed country without universal healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care), so the source showing the US is inefficient can be reasonably extrapolated to apply to general developed countries without universal healthcare.
1.5.12.10. Pro: [Herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) will suffer if the majority of the population is not inoculated.
1.5.12.10.1. Con: Although the statement is true, the concept of herd immunity implies the direct opposite of a human right; rather, a human obligation or societal compulsion to get vaccinated. This is in direct opposition to the underlying freedom associated with inherent human rights.
1.5.12.10.2. Con: There is a substantial difference between providing vaccinations and providing all healhcare.
1.5.12.10.2.1. Pro: [Vaccines are incredibly cost effecient, and likely even profitable for the taxpayer.](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475/en/)
1.5.12.10.2.2. Pro: The vaccination of any given person betters the health of everyone \(by improving herd immunity\). Most procedures do not.
1.6. Con: A right is what is owed/allowed to people by its society. Nothing can be a right in general \(aka human rights\), but only in a particular "ethos" \(context/custom\) and "polis" \(society\).
1.6.1. Con: Rights are things that people are entitled to because of their intrinsic human value. If rights are different across societies, geographical places or time, that means that the value of a human life is variable by those criteria, which is a discriminatory argument. Therefore, to be defined as a right, something must be equally available to all people, at all times.
1.6.2. Pro: Human rights don't exist, but only particular and providable rights in each society - i.e., in a society where healthcare is providable, it will be a right; in a society where a house is providable, it will be a right; the right to life is not applicable at war, or when you are threatened with death, etc.
1.6.2.1. Pro: There are no globally applicable human rights.
1.6.2.2. Con: Just because healthcare is not possible to provide, doesn't mean it's not a human right; human rights are violated all the time, but that doesn't make them any less human rights.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Countries being invaded cannot provide the human right to life to their citizens anymore, but this is not a valid reason to consider the human right to life invalid.
1.6.3. Pro: Unlike other rights, health care has no simple, universal standard to define it. What's "adequate" to one person in one culture or era may be inadequate in another context, and as such devolves into political demagoguery.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.8.3.1.
1.6.4. Con: The word right could be used many ways, but we should use it in the [internationally accepted manner](http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/human-rights/) \(agreed by almost every country\), which is commonly understood as "[inalienable, inherent in all human beings, applicable everywhere, and being the same for everyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights)".
1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.
1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.3.
1.6.4.3. Con: The sources you are providing are referring to a "Human Right as a Right..." without any further explanation, while the parent claim is actually challenging this too vague concept of "Human Right". Moreover, the sources also affirm that [rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights) Hence, the "ethos" \(context/social convention\) must be taken into account.
1.6.5. Pro: A right can only be a natural right, best described as self-evident in the U.S. [Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/document/): "They are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable right."
1.6.5.1. Pro: The U.S. Constitution does not provide for ["Positive Rights"](http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2009/11/16/health-care-and-the-fallacy-of-positive-rights/) such as the right to health care.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.
1.6.5.1.3. Con: The linked article is a liberal right opinion that states these rights should not be granted because it limits economical freedom. It misses the point that human life is more important than private property.
1.6.5.1.3.1. Con: Private property is an expression of life. To deny a right to labors of one's life is no better than denying a right to one's life or liberty.
1.6.5.1.4. Con: If healthcare should indeed be deemed a human right, that may give good reasons for amending the constitution to include it. Thus, it is irrelevant that the current constitution does not include it.
1.6.5.1.5. Pro: Supreme court rulings support this view, that [the Constitution is a charter of negative rather than positive liberties](https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume3/issue2/MacNaughton3U.Pa.J.Const.L.750\(2001\).pdf).
1.6.5.1.6. Con: This implies that human rights are only actual when they are formal legal rights. This totally undermines any principles of universality considering the totally contingent historical and political nature of legal norms \(such as the inclusion of the right to the pursuit of happiness in your constitution in place of the right to estate propounded in Locke - in order to perpetuate slavery within the boundaries of the document\). No legitimate rights theorist would take this seriously.
1.6.5.1.6.1. Con: If a right isn't codified as formal legal right, there is no point to the 'right' beyond having a fun internet debate about it.
1.6.5.1.6.1.1. Con: There are hugely important [International Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) which have had huge effect on the development of society. These are not codified, are consent-based, and do not have methods of enforcement, but are a huge part of international relations between countries.
1.6.5.1.7. Con: An amendment can be made to the US Constitution. It worked for guns.
1.6.6. Con: Almost every human would like the opportunity to be taken care of by professionals if some unexpected health issue arises. The same way almost no human would like to be murdered, or to be denied food/water/shelter in a moment of need. Hence, the right to live by not being killed/starved/sheltered has the same basis as the right to live by being cured of disease.
1.7. Con: Health care cannot be declared a human right because this forces others to provide people with health care through their labor.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.1.1.
1.7.2. Pro: Rights must be equally accessible and equally beneficial for all people, at all places, at all times, because all people are equally valuable. Therefore, something that is available in the 2020s and wasn't, say, in the 1200s, can't be considered a right.
1.7.2.1. Con: Health care has always existed. Maybe not in the same way nor quality, but since humanity exists, there has been health care. Furthermore, as there has been famine through history, isn't there a right to be fed?
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The right to healthcare is [not to any specific form of healthcare but to what is available](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf).
1.7.2.2. Con: The most commonly held definitions of rights e.g. the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, references access for [all people in all places](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/what-universal-declaration-human-rights), but do not reference "all time". There's no declaration, treaty, or law that considers historical availability as a reason for present decisions.
1.7.3. Con: The same can be argued of food, a necessity for all human lives and a human right. Yet no arguments are made for the existence of farmers providing for the rest of humanity.
1.7.3.1. Con: The US has steadily opposed any internationally agreed document that considers food as a human right.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.7.3.2. Con: It is absurd for one to claim that "no arguments are made" about a specific topic, simply because one is not aware of them.
1.7.3.3. Con: It is not inherently true that one needs others to source, obtain, and prepare food \(even though how modern society functions makes it seem otherwise\). Conversely, one must always count on the actions of others in order to receive healthcare.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: One does not require the actions of others to eat a healthy diet and exercise which are two of the most fundamental acts of personal healthcare.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: Education and many other social infrastructure also fall under this category.
1.7.3.4. Pro: The "universal health care is slavery" argument is just a meme and not based on reality. It's logically inconsistent as we would rarely see the same said about all other sectors of required service.
1.7.4. Pro: Free Health Care is an investment into a human population by a government or organisation, it can't be considered an inherent human right, its a line item on someone's budget sheet and dependent on available resources.
1.7.4.1. Con: If it were considered a human right, that would be the reason for including it in the budget. Thus, it's being a part of a budget doesn't preclude it's being a human right.
1.7.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.7.4.3. Pro: If it is practically impossible for a government to provide universal healthcare, it is unfair and counterproductive to enshrine it as a human right.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: If universal healthcare is treated as a human right, then citizens have a right to sue the government for violating that right. This is costly for all parties, and ineffective if the government cannot practically provide such healthcare.
1.7.4.3.2. Con: [Most countries rich and poor already provide universal healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care), showing it is clearly an achievable standard to require and never impossible.
1.7.4.4. Con: Many other human rights are also investments in a countries population - incidentally being an investment does not change whether they are Human Rights or not.
1.7.4.4.1. Pro: One example is [Education](https://www.kialo.com/is-health-care-a-human-right-7304/7304.0=7304.1-7304.47-7304.121+7304.85), which is a Human Right but also a very large investment in the population.
1.7.4.4.2. Pro: Human rights to [food, housing, and standard of life](https://www.kialo.com/is-health-care-a-human-right-7304/7304.0=7304.1-7304.47-7304.121+7304.129) can be seen as an investment in a population, as they are necessary stepping stones for a citizen to become productive in society.
1.7.4.5. Con: Free health care does not exist.
1.7.4.5.1. Con: Free healthcare in this instance is referring to it being free for consumers, rather than having no cost to society as a whole.
1.7.4.6. Con: Not all investments are prudent investments.
1.7.5. Pro: If a sick person has a right to health care and they cannot afford it, then they have a claim on the resources of other people. Without specifying a limit on the amount a sick person is entitled to, in theory such a right could deprive the healthy of all their resources in order to support the treatment of the sick. Since there should be a reasonable limit to one's contribution, health care cannot be an absolute right.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Rights can be loosely defined as things you would be justified in defending with a baseball bat. If you have a cold, you do not have the right to threaten a doctor into treating you.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: That's a way too arbitrary definition.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Statistically, 1% of the population [consistently uses](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/st354/stat354.shtml) up to 20% of the total health care expenditure in the US, and 5% uses almost 50%. This is not a fair distribution of resources.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Healthcare should be apportioned by need rather than each person receiving the same amount.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: Equal distribution is not needed for a human right, only equal opportunity. Vaguely 2.5% of the population uses all judicial expenditure in the UK \(around 400,000 cases were received in [Q4 2017/18](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/623096/ccsq-bulletin-jan-mar-2017.pdf), which could suggest that only 2.5% \(1.6million/65.5million\) annually are causing the expenditure\). This is not an even distribution of cost, but is not a reason to remove the right to trials and justice.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.8.1.
1.7.5.2.2.2. Con: This discussion has nothing to do with health care. Legal proceedings do not threaten the life of their participants, while hunger and medical care do.
1.7.5.3. Con: No right is absolute - one's right to liberty cannot come at the expense of another's, for example.
1.7.5.4. Con: All accepted human rights allow people to make claims on the resources of others. This means we must be prudent in how a right is exercised - it does not mean we discard a right's validity.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: Some human rights are negative rights, meaning that they only require that other people don't negate them. Freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom of association, prohibition of slavery are some examples.
1.7.5.5. Con: When this is applied to the larger public one person alone will not have to bear a huge price toward this cause. Besides, health care is something that everyone needs at some point so the amount you paid for will ultimately help you and your neighbour. The only matter is that it would be in different proportions which can go anyway depending on fate.
1.7.5.6. Con: Human rights aren't national laws, at least in the US. It's an aspirational principle enforced in discourse; and insofar as the access to health - in principle - is an absolutely basic necessity of living a life capable of productivity, financial and otherwise, makes it a worthy end within that lexicon.
1.7.6. Pro: You don't have a right to others labor.
1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.1.
1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.1.
1.7.6.3. Pro: No individual may compel another individual to provide a service to them \(this is called "slavery"\). Health care is a service. Since no individual has authority to enslave others, no individual may delegate that authority to others.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: Public healthcare subsidized operations are not unpaid labor from medical staff. It is labor paid for by the state.
1.7.6.3.1.1. Con: People who enter the public healthcare service are not compelled to do so, they have a negotiated contract that compensates them for their efforts. This proves that the healthcare service provided is not a right \(which can be freely taken\) but a service offered by the state for its citizens.
1.7.6.4. Pro: We have a right to a lawyer \(a trained professional like doctors\), but only for the[right to counsel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_counsel) if the State charges you in criminal court but not in civil courts. Our demands on them are constrained by clientele and circumstances. But if we do this for doctors \(which we need throughout life\) then we create an unconstrained set of demands on a doctor’s labor, and that risks violating their rights as a free-agent worker permanently.
1.7.6.4.1. Con: There is no need for unconstrained demands on doctors, the same way there is no need for unconstrained demands on lawyers. Requesting a nose job from a doctor should not be covered by a human right, but requesting removal of a tumor should be covered. This is similar to how getting a lawyer to sell your house is not covered by your human rights, but instructing a lawyer to defend you on murder charges is covered.
1.7.6.4.2. Con: Doctors go into practice to care for the sick. If they don't want to care for the sick then they have the same right as they currently do to not be a Doctor.
1.7.6.5. Con: A civilized society \(such as ours\) should teach the healthy to care for the sick, the educated to educate those who want to learn, the wealthy to enable others to prosper. These responsibilities of privilege have disappeared. It's unfortunate that this becomes an argument about 'rights'.
1.7.6.5.1. Con: Enforcing one's law upon others is aggression, not teaching.
1.7.6.6. Pro: Healthcare is a human right, but being paid to provide medical services and research also is a human right. You have to be able to pay for it.
1.7.6.6.1. Con: This is not mutually exclusive with it being a human right. The paying could be done with taxes.
1.7.6.6.2. Con: Many accepted Human rights [have conflicts](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199238781.001.0001/acprof-9780199238781-chapter-4) between them.  In a developed nation, the Procedural Right to getting paid could co-exist with the [Substantive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_rights) right to healthcare.
1.7.6.6.3. Con: A thing can be a right, but not be available to all.
The [right to a fair trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Right_to_a_fair_trial) might not be available in some countries due to that countries failings \(war, government collapse\), but it is still a human right. Therefore, saying that there is a cost involved for something does not mean it cannot be a human right.
1.7.6.7. Con: There are instances where we should have a right to other labor. If someone is being assaulted or robbed, they have a right to call for a police officer to assist them. The same should be true with a doctor if their life is threatened or made worse through illness.
1.7.7. Pro: A human right is something society is entitled to provide via a government. If governments are required to provide everyone with health care as a human right, they will have to ensure a supply of health care professionals to meet the demand, and this would entail compulsion of some individuals to train as health care professionals when the supply inevitably drops due to lower wage incentives to practice medicine inherent in government-provided healthcare.
1.7.7.1. Con: Human rights are often defined as inalienable, fundamental rights inherent to all human beings "[regardless of their nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights)". The parent claim might therefore apply to the [legal rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights#Natural_versus_legal) of a government rather than human rights.
1.7.7.2. Con: Not everyone that goes into fields of work do it for the money. People are still passionate about what they do in life and what drives them to do certain things. Careers are one example of doing what you love. Salaries do become attractive to a certain extent but passion is what ultimately drives someone to follow a career path.
1.7.8. Con: People will not be forced to provide health care. Doctors still get paid, it's a matter of eliminating insurance as middle man and not assuming the price for medical care is the "real cost".  The primary driver of healthcare cost is ironically [insurance companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeDOQpfaUc8). Healthcare could be cheaper, be subsidized by the government, and providers can be paid more, at the same time.
1.7.8.1. Con: Subsidies [don't make things cheaper](https://www.machinedesign.com/engineering-education/subsidies-increase-prices).
1.7.8.1.1. Pro: Subsidies drive demand \(artificially\). Higher demand means higher prices, or a reduced supply which also means higher prices for the remaining supply.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand)
1.7.8.1.1.1. Con: Subsidies are normally only applied to items which are considered essential, eg farming and energy. Demand for fuel does not significantly change with price, because people already need to use fuel at a mostly set level. While supply affects the method of making energy \(coal/green/nuclear\) it doesn't significantly affect the end users consumption choices.
1.7.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Non-essential items are also subsidized.
1.7.8.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Airline industry received [subsidies after 9/11](http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/22/rec.airline.deal/).
1.7.8.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The auto industry received [bailouts in 2008](https://www.thebalance.com/auto-industry-bailout-gm-ford-chrysler-3305670).
1.7.8.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The financial industry received bailouts in [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008).
1.7.8.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Savings and Loan banks were [bailed out in 1989](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/06/business/bush-savings-bailout-plan-expected-today.html).
1.7.8.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: [Subsidy Tracker](https://bit.ly/2GpmRBG) has a search engine logging subsidies granted to many non-essential items such as Nike apparel, Entertainment, and auto parts.
1.7.8.2. Con: This scenario simply replaces insurance companies with government. Government is typically less accountable than a competitive private sector. The ideal scenario is to remove as many barriers between people and their health providers.
1.7.8.3. Con: The bureaucracy imparted on the system is driving costs up and ultimately that is the fault of a creeping scope of regulation over the past 60 years.
1.7.8.4. Con: If health care is a right, doctors must be forced to provide health care if they do not do so willingly. That is the nature of a right. If the question is about management of money for health care, we are not talking about rights anymore.
1.7.8.4.1. Con: Nobody is forced to become a doctor. If someone doesn't want to provide health care they are more than welcome to choose another career.
1.7.8.4.2. Con: Doctors are already forced to provide healthcare and have consequences if they [do not provide medical assistance](https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2013/october/duty-of-care/).
1.7.8.4.3. Con: That isn't the nature of a right.
1.7.8.5. Con: In the U.S. that actually happens now and is unconstitutional. Doctors and hospitals are [required by law to accept](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd) indigent patients and care for them. They are not paid for this service. As a result, they must reduce their profit, make other patients pay for it, or take a loss. In any event this violates the 5th amendment of the Constitution ; "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
1.7.8.6. Con: Chargemaster rates can't be compared to products and services outside of a hospital setting because hospitals have overhead costs. The overhead costs from[administrative requirements on hospitals are growing in large part because of extra regulatory burden.](https://www.athenahealth.com/insight/expert-forum-rise-and-rise-healthcare-administrator​)
1.7.9. Con: Taxation is not 'being forced to pay' for specific services. Taxation funds the government; the government chooses, ideally based on its citizens' demands, what to pay for from its coffers.
1.7.9.1. Con: If a person cannot refuse to pay taxes and has no say in how they those taxes are spent, then you are being forced to provide for something you do not want. Consider this. There are five people living in an apartment and they all agree to split the utilities evenly. Three of the people decide they want satellite TV and two don't want it. With a 3/2 split, satellite TV is installed and everyone splits the bill. That is unfair for the two who are forced to pay for something they don't want or use.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: A person does have a say in how taxes are paid. This is through voting for a representative that aligns with what you want. However it is also a democracy, where the majority votes on what is best, and the majority wins. Therefore if 3/5 people vote for satellite TV then it should be decided via the majority.
1.7.9.1.1.1. Con: Majority rule is the equivalent of mob rule. It does not protect the minority. A perfect example of this is slavery. For many many years, the majority of Americans believed that slavery should be legal. Even once [public opinion changed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States), and the slaves were freed, for a long time, a majority of Americans believed that blacks and whites should be kept [segregated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States). The majority doesn't always know what's best and must be careful not to grant benefits to the majority at the expense of the minority.
1.7.9.1.1.2. Con: 3/5 people can also vote in favor of eliminating child sex laws, making it legal to engage in congress with minors. This is but one reason why a pure democracy will not work without controls to protect the minority.
1.7.9.1.1.3. Con: The problem with government is that voting is not refined enough to be representative. You can see this with APPS. Every app you accept has 30 pages of rules you didn't read. Similarly, every law passed is thousands of pages you didn't read, wouldn't understand, and would probably oppose if you understood it.
1.7.10. Pro: If healthcare was not measured by monetary terms and the medical industry was not an industry but a service for betterment of the society then medical care would be a human right but when this same industry gives you the highest profit margin it is not fair to provide it for free.
1.7.10.1. Con: There exist mixed systems, such as [in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany#Public_insurance). Monetary interest persists, yet everyone obtains health care regardless of the income.
1.7.10.2. Con: Everything is measured in monetary terms, even when doing so has a negative impact. We cannot easily change this, since to do so would require modifying some of our most basic tenets, upon which our economy is based.
1.7.11. Pro: Medical professionals have to make a living. Their compensation should be given from those who directly benefit from the service, like the injured.
1.7.11.1. Con: Many people cannot afford the healthcare they need, and should not be expected to go without it for lack of funds.
1.7.12. Con: -> See 1.7.6.6.2.
1.7.13. Pro: Society shouldn't be responsible for paying for other individual's poor health or choices.
1.7.13.1. Con: Society is already responsible in many developed nations, for the health of individual vulnerable groups. Including medicare and medicaid in the US. Ethically speaking, society should aid it's population and economically speaking it might make sense, although it would require a whole private medical industry to dramatically cut earning.
1.7.13.2. Con: It all depends on what society you are thinking of - The Gated Havens with the poor unwashed milling outside, or the inclusive communities. If we are all one society / community then we all support the weaker in society.
1.7.13.3. Pro: Individuals who make decisions throughout their life such as choosing to smoke contribute to the likelihood that they will develop certain diseases later in life. The individual has to take responsibility for this.
1.7.13.3.1. Con: People may be made to compensate for their unhealthy behavior by a clever redistribution. Say, by imposing additional taxation on cigarettes, a state can make smokers effectively pay in advance for their possible smoking-related healthcare costs.
1.7.13.3.1.1. Pro: The tax earned would be a bonus on top of the reduction in damage. A study found that a [20% fat tax](https://www.bmj.com/press-releases/2012/05/14/20-%E2%80%9Cfat-tax%E2%80%9D-needed-improve-population-health), alongside healthy food subsidies, would provide a significant effect on diet-related conditions such as obesity and heart disease. Ring-fencing the tax specifically for healthcare would only increase the effect.
1.7.13.3.2. Con: Many of the "bad" habits that people "choose" aren't really about choice. The manufacturers, advertisers, and retailers who promote, advertise aggressively, and glorify these behaviors have a major responsibility for the poor health of society.
1.7.13.3.2.1. Pro: The fact that your zip code \(you don't choose where to be born\) is a [bigger predictor for health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/zip-code-better-predictor-of-health-than-genetic-code/) than genetics would seem to imply a quantity of randomness.
1.7.13.3.2.2. Con: If susceptibility to addiction \(drugs, alcohol, smoking, gambling, etc\) will be viewed as a disability that government is obligated to support against, such "bad habits" will never be weaned out of society as practitioners are shield from the negative consequences of their actions.
1.7.13.3.3. Con: No individual lives a 100% perfectly healthy lifestyle every single day of his/her life, nor do we definitively know what a perfectly healthy lifestyle is; thus, there is a broad and abstract gradation of responsibility for individual health that has no clear cutoff or linear scale that can be applied to attribute a degree of individual responsibility.
1.7.13.3.4. Con: While some health issues have a personal responsibility aspect \(smoking, substance abuse\) other issues are not under the individual's control \(many cancers, genetic disorders, accidents and injuries, pandemics\). To sustain a society implies a social contract where members support each other. Health care is definitely within that realm. The question is to what degree.
1.7.13.3.4.1. Con: The degree to which there is an expectation for guaranteed health care is at the heart of this overall debate. If everyone has a right to emergency room care, that very well could satisfy the overarching claim. Heart disease, lung cancer, suicide, motor vehicle accidents, and drug overdoses all present behavior-induced health crises which society could minimize through regulating personal liberties as preventive medicine. Government must do this if health care is a right.
1.7.13.3.5. Con: So far, it is almost impossible to affirm that a certain disease is 100% the result of a certain behavior. If a smoker gets sick with lung cancer, we can only say that probably smoke has increased his/her susceptibility, but we have to consider so many collateral aspects that most of the times are ignored. For instance: genetic predisposition, work conditions, environmental status of the place he/she lives, and so on.
1.7.13.4. Con: Existing modern societies all require citizens to pay for other individuals choices. This ranges from paying for policing / prisons, to paying for litter picking / repairing vandalism.
1.7.13.4.1. Con: Situations like these exist, but we should make an effort to minimize them when possible. Particularly when it's a knowing, intentional decision to inflict disproportionate cost on society for an individual's benefit.
1.7.13.4.1.1. Con: Every current society trades some individual freedoms for security. If the example of policing is a traded freedom, then healthcare should be too. We trade away the freedom to commit crimes for the security of being safe from crimes committed against us. Minimising the amount of freedom traded is important; we should minimize societies power to prevent crimes, so that society does not become totalitarian. But that does not mean those freedoms shouldn't be traded at an appropriate level.
1.7.13.4.1.1.1. Con: Crimes are not committed in a vacuum; a victim generally suffers from the actions of a perpetrator. Committing crimes is not a freedom because one person's freedom ends where another person's freedom begins.
1.7.13.4.1.1.2. Con: Even assuming this argument is valid, it is difficult to determine what is an "appropriate level" of trading freedoms.
1.7.13.4.1.1.3. Con: Just because we treat policing in a certain way, that does not mean we should view healthcare similarly.
1.7.13.4.1.2. Con: If desired, a healthcare system could be minimized the same way as policing is. A way to minimize policing is to remove rights from someone if they are convicted of a crime. For example if you steal \(an intentional decision to inflict cost on society for an individuals benefit\) you will have your freedoms restricted through prison and other restrictions. Minimization of healthcare could be achieved similarly, if desired, by reducing a persons right to healthcare for self-inflicted issues.
1.7.13.4.2. Con: Whether something exists or how widespread its practice is at any given point in time is not an indication of its social utility.
1.7.13.4.2.1. Con: However it is a precedent for society being responsible for choices even if they are poor ones, which is the point contested by the claim.
1.7.13.5. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.7.13.6. Con: Selecting out individuals who exhibit 'poor health and choices' is a slippery slope that would have unintended consequences.
1.7.13.6.1. Con: Automatically treating individuals who create an undue demand on the system through poor choices is a slippery slope that would have unintended consequences.
1.7.13.6.1.1. Con: This is not a slippery slope fallacy, as there is nowhere to slide to. If you already treat 100% of people, you cannot start treating 101%. The parent slippery slope argument works because if you are selective and choose to treat 90% of people, that you are then more likely to start treating 89%... then 88%... etc..
1.7.13.6.2. Con: There is no 'selecting' occurring, the service is not provided by the government at all. A government policy that protects an individual from the consequences of their actions does nothing to discourage negative actions. Without personal agency, society absolves the individual all responsibility and creates a perpetual dependency on the state - see San Francisco's [homelessness](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/2018-state-of-homelessness/) [problem](https://sfgov.org/scorecards/safety-net/homeless-population).
1.7.13.7. Pro: If society were paying for health care, then society would naturally take an opinion on what individual behaviors or food choices are acceptable and which should be discouraged. This would undermine people's freedom to live the lives they want.
1.7.13.7.1. Con: People being allowed to chose their health treatment leads to catastrophes such as the recent anti-vax craze and epidemics. No one should be allowed to live the life with the goal/consequence of ruining other people's lives.
1.7.13.8. Pro: If you take better care of yourself, you can afford health care.
1.7.13.8.1. Con: Healthy behavior does not guarantee a good health. Because people are born with diseases that is a matter of inheritance and not choice.
1.7.13.8.2. Con: Health care isn't just about lifestyle. Many people end up with astronomical healthcare bills from accidents and injury.
1.7.13.8.3. Con: There are compounding factors that influence a persons health that are independent of choice, for example, being born into poverty.
1.7.13.8.3.1. Pro: Also accidents, epidemics \(thousands of healthy people died this year from the flu\), and the ultimate equalizer, old age.  We're all going there if we're lucky.
1.7.13.9. Con: Individuals who work full time at minimum wage for an employer who doesn't provide health insurance, usually can't afford coverage. Health care coverage should not be considered a luxury item out of reach for those who earn low wages.
1.7.13.9.1. Con: Government sponsored healthcare would absolve employers of the need to provide better working conditions for their employees, since the cost of health insurance would be shouldered by taxes. Without being directly responsible for that healthcare, there is no reason for a business to incur additional expenses for workplace safety, beyond what is required to meet baseline minimal requirements.
1.7.13.10. Con: The lack of a universal health care is significantly more [expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNla9nyRMmQ) and puts an even heavier burden on individuals than the taxes that would be used to supply everyone with healthcare.
1.7.13.10.1. Con: No amount of health care will offset poor personal decisions at the individual level - e.g. a generation that refuses to brush their teeth, or overindulge in sugar to the point of developing diabetes, will invariably outpace whatever government funding is allocated to the problem.
1.7.13.11. Con: If society does not attempt to fix health issues with officially estimated expenses it will nevertheless suffer the implicit costs of the temporary or definitive disability those issues cause.
1.7.13.11.1. Con: The government's ability to "officially estimate" policy is demonstrably substandard to any free market alternative where the consequences of failure demand providers to pursue cost and time efficiency in order to outpace demand and competitors. The government has no competitor and therefore no incentive to pursue efficiency in cost or effort.
1.7.13.12. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.
1.7.13.13. Con: Actually, since society already tends to subsidize some of the very behaviors and actors that contribute to poor health, \(e.g. [tax cuts to corporations which underpay their workers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2018/01/14/4-hard-facts-about-walmarts-touted-new-11-entry-wage/) and [subsidies to certain industries](http://time.com/4393109/food-subsidies-obesity/) like [sugar](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-spends-4-billion-a-year-subsidizing-stalinist-style-domestic-sugar-production-2018-06-25) and fossil fuels\), society has an obligation to counter this and promote health for everyone.
1.7.13.13.1. Pro: This rings especially true for the impoverished of society. The lower economic stratum may only have the means to buy lower quality food, live in substandard conditions and work harmful jobs. The subsidization of entities that contribute to poor health only makes this section of society more prone to health problems. If such subsidies were avoided, the risk of health complications for the impoverished would be reduced.
1.7.13.14. Pro: Rights always come together with obligations/duties. If you don't fulfill your duty of taking care of your body, you lose the right to the healthcare.
1.7.13.15. Con: Existing modern societies regularly have individuals pay for things they do not use. The argument is similar to the failed argument "I don't drive so I shouldn't pay taxes towards roads".
1.7.13.15.1. Con: The arguments are similar but neither fail because of their similarity. Much of health care is about making good decisions. Both roads and certain medical treatments reward poor decision making. To say both need to be funded “because” avoids responsibility for the bad consequences.
1.8. Pro: The right to health care is an ethical value that should be upheld.
1.8.1. Pro: Even in wars the rights for the opposition to access health care has been recognised more often than not. It was part of the [Geneva Convention](https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/protecting-people-in-armed-conflict/geneva-conventions) and honoured well before that codification.
1.8.2. Pro: If societies understand health as a human right it creates a legal obligation on states to ensure access [to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health).
1.8.3. Con: The right to freely render \(or not render\) services is consistent with the values presented in the Constitution of the United States, which is based on a set of rights that are not adorned by government, but understood to be universal. Therefore, if one must be subjected to de facto enslavement in the service of another's "rights," the "right" of the other can not possibly truly be a right.
1.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.1.
1.8.3.2. Con: If one's health care service is rendered voluntarily for payment through the government \(as it operates in most countries\), it is nothing like enslavement and no one's rights are violated.
