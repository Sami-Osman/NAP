1.1. Con: Finland and Sweden should join a different military alliance, such as the [EU defense pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy).
1.1.1. Pro: There are countries among NATO members that are politically at odds with Sweden and Finland, such as [Turkey](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/13/1098859684/turkeys-president-opposes-finland-sweden-join-nato).
1.2. Con: Sweden and Finland should not have joined NATO, they should be neutral.
1.2.1. Con: According to a recent poll, [more than 50% of Finnish people support joining NATO](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/03/1084112625/neutral-finland-sweden-warm-to-idea-of-nato-membership).
1.2.2. Con: Neutrality only works if everyone respects it and Russia has proved itself to have little or no respect for life, borders, democracy, International Law, Human Rights, free speech or even truth.
1.2.2.1. Con: The neutrality of Sweden and Finland hasn't been attacked yet, therefore, there's no reason why [they shouldn't remain neutral](https://www.eurasiareview.com/07062022-finland-and-sweden-in-nato-disregarding-the-benefits-of-neutrality-oped/).
1.2.2.2. Pro: Russia has conducted various [assassinations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58635137)(Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin have long been alleged to have smeared the military-grade nerve agent Novichok on the handle of former GRU officer Sergei Skripal's front door.\n\nThey believe the group belonged to a team from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. Sergeev has also been linked to other covert activity across Europe.) that violate both individual rights and foreign sovereignty.
1.2.3. Pro: If Sweden and Finland decide to join NATO right now, [it could be problematic](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/sweden-finland-nato-russia-new-problems-1581120) as Russia could understand it as a war declaration.
1.2.4. Pro: Neutrality for Sweden has worked well, making it the European country with [less casualties](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/world-war-two-casualties-by-country) under the World Wars and allowing it to save thousands of \([Jewish](https://www.thankstoscandinavia.org/the-rescues/sweden/)\) refugees.
1.2.5. Pro: [Russia](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23340460.2019.1681014) has never expressed [hostile intents against Sweden or Finland](https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/russia:-no-hostile-intentions-towards-sweden-finland).
1.2.5.1. Con: The Soviet Union invaded Finland in 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II in what is known as the [Winter War or the First Soviet-Finnish war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War).
1.3. Pro: Joining NATO would increase regional integration with the European Union.
1.3.1. Pro: Closer integration with the EU brings [numerous benefits](https://mkik.hu/en/benefits-of-eu-membership) to a country's economy and security.
1.3.2. Con: Finland rejected joining the NATO in the 90s because they didn't want to be part of the regional integration as they argued they [would have been held responsible to defend Estonia](https://icds.ee/en/why-doesnt-finland-want-to-join-nato/)(Former Finnish chief of defence Juhani Kaskeala argued in the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti that Finland didn’t join NATO in the 1990s because it would have been held responsible by the US and UK for defending Estonia.).
1.3.2.1. Con: At that time Estonia wasn't a member of NATO yet. [Since 2004 they are](https://vm.ee/en/estonia-and-nato), so therefore Finland doesn't need to protect Estonia in the case of a war, because NATO would do it.
1.4. Pro: Russia's attack on Ukraine provides a unique opportunity for Sweden and Finland to join NATO.
1.4.1. Pro: [Putin tried to justify the war](https://newsrescue.com/putins-declaration-of-war-on-ukraine-full-text/) against Ukraine by referring to NATO's open door policy to expand East. But instead, sovereign countries have opened their door towards NATO as a response to the aggression by Russia in Ukraine.
1.4.2. Pro: With over [60% of its land forces](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60158694) deployed in and around Ukraine, Russia cannot fight another war at this moment.
1.4.2.1. Con: There are many ways for Russia to fight other wars that don't require land forces, including nuclear weapons and cyberwarfare.
1.4.3. Pro: War and international sanctions may cripple the Russian government, economy and military-industrial complex. Sweden and Finland can act with impunity while Russia is rebuilding.
1.4.4. Con: Sweden and Finland already have a [close relationship](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2022/03/04/finland-and-sweden-may-take-unhurried-route-to-nato-membership/)(Sweden’s and Finland’s relationship with NATO is already substantial. They are two of six Enhanced Opportunity Partners for NATO — a group that also includes Ukraine — which constitutes the closest form of partnership with the alliance.) with NATO, from which they already derive much of the benefits and less of the drawbacks.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Since [Finland joined the Partnership for Peace programme in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland%E2%80%93NATO_relations), it has had formal relations with NATO.

1.4.4.3. Con: Like Sweden and Finland, [Ukraine](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_132726.htm)(As a result of the PII, NATO granted tailor-made “enhanced opportunities” for deeper cooperation with six partners: Australia, Finland, Georgia, Jordan, Sweden and Ukraine.) is also an Enhanced Opportunity Partner for NATO, and yet was still invaded by Russia.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: When Sweden and Finland asked to become members of NATO, they ended [a long modern history of military nonalignment](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/how-could-russia-react-to-finland-sweden-joining-nato.html), which could be seen as a threat to Russia.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: Finland and Ukraine are politically distinct from Russia's point of view; they cannot be compared in terms of risk of invasion.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: Unlike Ukraine, [Finland](https://www.infofinland.fi/en/information-about-finland/basic-information-about-finland/finnish-history)(n August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union agreed that Finland belonged in the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence. During World War II, Finland fought on two occasions against the Soviet Union on the German side. Finland lost both wars, but the Soviet Union never occupied Finland.) was never occupied by the Soviet Union and is not seen, by [Putin](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/2/23/22945781/russia-ukraine-putin-speech-transcript-february-22)(Putin’s clearest answer yet came in a speech delivered on Monday. He believes that Ukraine is an illegitimate country that exists on land that’s historically and rightfully Russian: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” as he puts it.), as a missing part of modern Russia.
1.5. Con: Joining NATO would [aggravate Russia](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/why-arent-sweden-finland-nato-russia-fears-ukraine-nordic-countries-consider-joining-1486283?ico=in-line_link), exposing Sweden and Finland to retaliation.
1.5.1. Pro: Finland and Sweden have received [Russian warnings of retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-12/russian-official-warns-finland-sweden-against-joining-nato) if they join NATO.
1.5.2. Pro: The [Nordic Defence Cooperation \(NORDEFCO\)](https://www.nordefco.org/the-basics-about-nordefco) provides Sweden and Finland with sufficient military strength against Russian aggression.
1.5.3. Pro: NATO will likely intervene if Russia starts a war in the Nordics due to NATO having [close ties with Sweden](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52535.htm) [and Finland](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49594.htm) as well as wanting to prevent further Russian expansionism.
1.5.4. Con: It’d be riskier for Russia to invade Sweden and Finland, because of [Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm)
1.5.4.1. Con: Finland and Sweden have stayed out from NATO due to their [military nonalignment policy](https://www.dw.com/en/war-in-ukraine-will-it-bring-sweden-and-finland-closer-to-joining-nato/a-61003152), it is unlikely Sweden and Finland would now agree with the military policy.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Even though Sweden and Finland remain outside NATO, they have been developing [closer bilateral defense co-operation with the United States and with NATO](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2016-04-01/pro-american-non-alignment-sweden-and-finland-develop-closer).

Con: Finland's strong and agile military can [independently defend its border](https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/03/complex-but-promising-prospects-as-finland-and-sweden.html)(The Finnish and Swedish militaries maintain first-rate capabilities and reputation. The Finnish Defence Forces can muster 280,000 troops within 30 days, with an army capable of independently defending its long border with Russia for an extended period of time. The recent selection of the F-35 as the Finnish air force's next multi-role fighter will continue to solidify the Finnish military as among Europe's most capable.) with Russia.
1.5.5.1. Con: If Finland can independently defend its border with Russia, it wouldn't need to join NATO.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.
1.6. Pro: If Sweden and Finland joined NATO, it would substantially improve NATO's military strength.
1.6.1. Con: If Sweden joined NATO, it would break with Swedish foreign policy goals, as [NATO might undertake military operations of which Sweden disapproves](https://www.eurasiareview.com/07062022-finland-and-sweden-in-nato-disregarding-the-benefits-of-neutrality-oped/).
1.6.2. Pro: Finland's military is well-equipped for [hybrid warfare](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/hybrid-underdog-russia-should-be-scared-finlands-military-innovation-191333)(Russia is supposed to be the master of hybrid warfare, that shapeshifting amalgamation of regular and irregular war.\n\nBut has Russia met its match in little Finland?\n\n“While still a work in progress, recent exercises suggest that the Finnish Army is arguably better positioned to tackle hybrid threats than most of its European counterparts,” says a report by Sweden’s Defense Research Agency.) in a way that other NATO members are not.
1.6.3. Pro: Almost all Finnish men have at least some [military training](https://puolustusvoimat.fi/en/finnish-conscription-system)(Every male Finnish citizen aged 18-60 is liable for military service, and women can apply for military service on a voluntary basis. A person liable for military service must complete either armed or unarmed military service or non-military \(civil\) service. During military service, conscripts receive high-quality military training. After completing military service, they are mustered out into the Finnish Defence Forces’ reserve.) due to compulsory military service.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Finland has [900,000](https://armedforces.eu/compare/country_Sweden_vs_Finland) military reservists.
