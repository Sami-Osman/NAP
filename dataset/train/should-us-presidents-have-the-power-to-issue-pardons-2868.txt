Discussion Name: Should US Presidents Have the Power to Issue Pardons?

1. US presidents should not have the power to issue pardons.
1.1. Pro: Presidential pardons facilitate unethical behavior, including corruption and scandals.
1.1.1. Con: Corruption is widespread throughout the government. Therefore, a broader strategy to tackle government corruption would inevitably mitigate misuse of pardons.
1.1.1.1. Con: Corruption is a social issue that transcends government and is [entrenched within many other spheres](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/anti-corruption/module-4/key-issues/causes-of-public-sector-corruption.html)(Conflict of interest has been defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \(OECD, 2003\) as "a conflict between the public duty and private interest of public officials, in which public officials have private-capacity interests which could improperly influence the performance of their official duties and responsibilities". An example of a conflict of interest includes the "revolving door" situation, in which public officials obtain lucrative posts in the private sector once they leave the public service, with the expectation that they will use their public sector contacts to benefit the private company \(Ferguson, 2017\). The types of "private interests" that could lead to a conflict of interest include objective things like a directorship in a company, but can also include subjective ideological, political and personal interests that may improperly influence public duties \(Ferguson, 2017; Rose-Ackerman, 2014\).). There is no single solution that can effectively end corruption as a whole.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Corruption is a [criminal act](https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-anti-bribery-and-anti-corruption-review/usa)(The US federal government, however, and in particular the US Department of Justice \(DOJ\) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \(FBI\), have special roles in addressing public corruption.\n\nToday, those federal agencies have at their disposal a wide variety of federal public corruption offences, ranging from a very broad federal bribery and gratuity statute \(18 USC Section 201\) to more focused legislation such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 \(FCPA\).) and can, therefore, be investigated and subjected to judicial oversight.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [Department of Justice](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/presidential-pardon-justice-department/index.html)(The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court records unsealed Tuesday in federal court.\n\nThe case is the latest legal twist in the waning days of President Donald Trump's administration after several of his top advisers have been convicted of federal criminal charges and as the possibility rises of Trump giving pardons to those who've been loyal to him.\n\nThe disclosure is in 20 pages of partially redacted documents made public by the DC District Court on Tuesday afternoon. The records show Chief Judge Beryl Howell's review in August of a request from prosecutors to access documents obtained in a search as part of a bribery-for-pardon investigation.) has investigated cases in which there was suspicion that money had been offered as a bribe in exchange for a pardon.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: In recent years, SCOTUS rulings have served to "[rebrand" corruption](https://www.promarket.org/2019/08/08/how-the-supreme-court-is-rebranding-corruption/)(First, they have narrowed the meaning of the word in a series of election law cases that address the constitutionality of various campaign finance laws. In cases like Citizens United v. FEC, which allowed corporations the First Amendment right to spend an unlimited amount of money on political ads, and McCutcheon v. FEC, which allows the rich to support as many congressional candidates as they want with contributions, the Roberts Supreme Court has ruled 5-4 that “corruption” only means quid pro quo exchanges. \[...\] This approach to corruption sets the Roberts Supreme Court apart from other Supreme Courts.) in a way that absolves the political and economic elite of personal culpability. Thus, corruption resulting from pardons may not be adequately checked by judicial oversight.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Federal courts have ruled on tens of thousands of corruption cases, which can be broadly classified into [four categories](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/handful-unlawful-behaviors-led-fraud-and-bribery-account-nearly-all-public)(Every public corruption case is different in the details, but the thousands of corruption convictions in federal courts since the mid-1980s have largely boiled down to four categories of criminal conduct: fraud, bribery, extortion, and conspiracy. \[...\] A comprehensive analysis of nearly 57,000 corruption cases in federal courts spanning 30 years revealed that fraud and bribery dominated the types of conduct underlying criminal cases, accounting for 76% of the lead charges in cases resulting in convictions. Those two unlawful behavior types, combined with extortion and conspiracy, broadly informed the lead charges in virtually all examined corruption convictions in federal courts from 1985 to 2015.): fraud, bribery, extortion, and conspiracy.
1.1.2. Con: The past misuse of pardons does not necessarily mean that the power itself is corrupt.
1.1.2.1. Con: If presidential pardons are instrumental to [corrupt practices](https://www.johntfloyd.com/donald-trump-and-corrupt-pardons/)(Inherent in the power to pardon, either at the federal or state level, is the temptation for corruption—the exchange of a pardon for money, sex, furniture, jewelry, influence, campaign contributions, to family or friends.), then the power itself should be considered as corrupt.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Pardons being instrumental in some cases of corruption does not mean they are inherently corrupt; for example, although phones are instrumental in many crimes, they are not inherently criminal.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Pardons [enable corruption](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/preventing-trump-or-anyone-else-from-pardoning-his-way-to-corruption-85ba7f4a3f96)(The escalation in the use of the pardon to enable corruption is obvious. Bush I pardons Weinberger and his associates to prevent an unseemly trial. Clinton pardons Mark Rich, a campaign donor. Bush II, in an unusual departure, refuses to pardon Scooter Libby, much to the disdain of Dick Cheney at the time. And Trump has turned it into a primary tool of corruption. It is not hard to see the trajectory of where this goes, especially as new people rise into the presidency. Some of them will be even more corrupt and more bold. We must stop this while we can.); there are many instances where corruption would have been curtailed but for a presidential pardon \([p. 1](https://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1528&context=ustlj)(This Article describes troubling pardons granted by Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush. The Article focuses primarily, however, on the clemency granted by President Trump. While thousands of clemency applications remained unresolved, Trump granted clemency to potential witnesses against him, political supporters, personal friends, people with political constituencies, rap stars, abusive law enforcement officers, war\ncriminals, and people whose applications were championed by movie stars, professional athletes, and Fox News commentators.)\).
1.1.2.2. Pro: The presidential power to pardon is essentially neutral. The moral implications of the power are determined by how it is used.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The presidential pardon has often been used for [morally questionable](https://www.insider.com/list-of-most-famous-shocking-presidential-pardons-in-us-history#in-1868-president-andrew-johnson-fully-pardoned-every-soldier-who-fought-for-the-confederate-army-3)(Since the early days of the republic, presidents have been forgiving crimes committed by friends, family members, and public figures. Some have even used the power in an effort to prevent national dispute, and some have been accused of abusing their authority.\n\nThe Constitution's Article II, which lays out the powers of the presidency, gives the executive the "power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment."\n\nFrom Gerald Ford's shocking pardon of Richard Nixon, to Trump's ongoing list, here are some of the most notable pardons in American history.) purposes.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Pardoning certain categories of individuals could have a [positive impact on the justice system](https://www.ibanet.org/article/465431E6-8846-4A89-BA0A-6A8B85E5ED1D)(Perhaps one of the less controversial uses of pardons is to ease burdens on state administration and infrastructure, such as pardoning classes of convicted prisoners or people yet to be charged in order to reduce overcrowding in jails or cut a backlog of arrest warrants. Such pardons may provide a solution \(albeit probably short-term\) to a creaking justice system, while offering some temporary relief to aggrieved citizens.) by clearing administrative backlog, reducing overcrowding in prisons, and quickening the delivery of justice in more serious cases.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The positive impacts of collective pardons may be short-lived, as [many re-offend](https://www.ibanet.org/article/465431E6-8846-4A89-BA0A-6A8B85E5ED1D)(For instance, in 2013, the retiring Czech President Václav Klaus marked 20 years of independence for the Czech Republic by pardoning over 6,000 detainees, nearly a third of the prison population. But soon a significant proportion of these prisoners had re-offended and were back in jail.) and, consequently, re-enter the justice system.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Collective pardons may seem unbiased but they could be a clever ploy to indirectly pardon [high-profile individuals](https://www.ibanet.org/article/465431E6-8846-4A89-BA0A-6A8B85E5ED1D)(This pardon also controversially included a group of high-profile individuals being investigated for corruption and fraud. President Klaus, wary of accusations of bias, protested ‘I did not have a single specific person in front of my eyes when \[preparing\] the amnesty.’ That may or may not be so, but it raises the question of whether such widespread pardons really constitute an effective aid to rehabilitation of prisoners or can be a substitute for a proper parole system.) of interest to the president.
1.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Through the Clemency Initiative, which was instituted by President Obama, commutations were granted to [more than 1500](https://www.justice.gov/archives/pardon/obama-administration-clemency-initiative)(As of January 19, 2017, the President granted commutation of sentence to a total of 1,715 individuals.) non-violent offenders serving unjustifiably harsh sentences, as they were not regarded as threats to society.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: The process by which presidential pardons are granted is [shrouded in secrecy](https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites)(The review of applications for pardons is conducted almost entirely in secret, with the government releasing scant information about those it rejects.), so there is limited scope to assess whether the reason for a rejection is justified. This leaves room for bias.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Pardons are often granted based on subjective standards and criteria, such as [attitude or marital and financial stability](https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites)(ProPublica's review examined what happened after President George W. Bush decided at the beginning of his first term to rely almost entirely on the recommendations made by career lawyers in the Office of the Pardon Attorney.\n\nThe office was given wide latitude to apply subjective standards, including judgments about the "attitude" and the marital and financial stability of applicants. No two pardon cases match up perfectly, but records reveal repeated instances in which white applicants won pardons with transgressions on their records similar to those of blacks and other minorities who were denied.), which automatically disadvantage marginalized communities.
1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Studies have identified substantial ethnic disparity in the approval rate of presidential pardons; racial minorities, particularly African Americans, are significantly [less likely to receive pardons](https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites)(The most striking disparity involved African Americans, who make up 38 percent of the federal prison population and have historically suffered from greater financial and marital instability. Of the nearly 500 cases in ProPublica's sample, 12 percent of whites were pardoned, as were 10 percent of Hispanics.\n\nNone of the 62 African Americans in the random sample received a pardon. To assess the chances of black applicants, ProPublica used the sample to extrapolate the total number of black applicants and compare it with the seven blacks whom Bush pardoned. Allowing for a margin of error, this yielded a pardon rate of between 2 percent and 4 percent.) than their [White counterparts](https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites)(White criminals seeking presidential pardons over the past decade have been nearly four times as likely to succeed as minorities, a ProPublica examination has found.\n\nCurrent and former officials at the White House and Justice Department said they were surprised and dismayed by the racial disparities, which persist even when factors such as the type of crime and sentence are considered.\n...\nOf the nearly 500 cases in ProPublica's sample, 12 percent of whites were pardoned, as were 10 percent of Hispanics.\n\nNone of the 62 African Americans in the random sample received a pardon. To assess the chances of black applicants, ProPublica used the sample to extrapolate the total number of black applicants and compare it with the seven blacks whom Bush pardoned. Allowing for a margin of error, this yielded a pardon rate of between 2 percent and 4 percent.).
1.1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Racial disparity in pardon approval exacerbates the disproportionate number of racial minorities in US prisons \([p. 5](https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Color-of-Justice-Racial-and-Ethnic-Disparity-in-State-Prisons.pdf)(• Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly 5 times the rate of white Americans.\n\n• Nationally, one in 81 Black adults in the U.S. is serving time in state prison. Wisconsin leads the nation in Black imprisonment rates; one of every\n36 Black Wisconsinites is in prison.\n\n• In 12 states, more than half the prison population is Black: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n• Seven states maintain a Black/white disparity larger than 9 to 1: California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Wisconsin.\n\n• Latinx individuals are incarcerated in state prisons at a rate that is 1.3 times the incarceration rate of whites. Ethnic disparities are highest in Massachusetts, which reports an ethnic differential of 4.1:1.)\).
1.1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: Government officials involved in the process of issuing pardons have reported bias [in favor of racial minorities](https://www.propublica.org/article/shades-of-mercy-presidential-forgiveness-heavily-favors-whites)(Adams, the head of the pardons office under Bush, said applicants were not penalized based on race. In fact, Adams went out of his way, he said, to help black applicants.\n\n"People in general more and more feel that it is appropriate to give extra consideration to a member of a minority group," he said.) as an expression of "extra consideration" for members of minority groups.
1.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Despite the right to information being protected under the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act, the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-attorney-foia)(As a general matter, Presidents in recent times have rarely announced their reasons for granting or denying clemency, although the President may choose to do so in a given case. Consistent with long-standing policy, if the President does not issue a public statement concerning his action in a clemency matter, no explanation is provided by the Department of Justice. Moreover, deliberative communications pertaining to agency and presidential decision-making are confidential and not available under existing case law interpreting the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act.) is under no compulsion to provide any explanation for presidential decisions regarding clemency.
1.1.2.2.3.4. Con: To reduce bias and improve transparency, the pardon process could be standardized, such that decisions are made using quantifiable, verifiable, and objective data and statistical methods; it is not necessary to abolish pardons altogether.
1.1.2.2.3.5. Con: Racial bias is pervasive, across various branches of the law enforcement system. Mitigating racial biases in [police investigations](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01846-z)(Government officials, academic researchers and media outlets launched data-collection projects around that time to better understand the frequency of police violence and the risk factors that contribute to it. From these growing data sets come some disturbing findings. About 1,000 civilians are killed each year by law-enforcement officers in the United States. By one estimate, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police during their lifetime. And in another study, Black people who were fatally shot by police seemed to be twice as likely as white people to be unarmed.) and [judicial sentencing](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/)(The source of such disparities is deeper and more systemic than explicit racial discrimination. The United States in effect operates two distinct criminal justice systems: one for wealthy people and another for poor people and people of color. The wealthy can access a vigorous adversary system replete with constitutional protections for defendants. Yet the experiences of poor and minority defendants within the criminal justice system often differ substantially from that model due to a number of factors, each of which contributes to the overrepresentation of such individuals in the system.) will reduce the number of people needing pardons in the first place.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Revoking the power to pardon based on the actions of a corrupt sitting president would deprive more ethical successors of the opportunity to [restore justice to innocent Americans](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/trump-pardon-corrupt-joe-biden-clemency.html)(The United States’ federal prisons are filled with good citizens who have no business being behind bars. It is unfortunate that Trump has overlooked these individuals in favor of his vile cronies. It would be catastrophic if Trump’s actions prevented future presidents from using the pardon power to free the people who actually deserve clemency.) who have been unfairly incarcerated.
1.1.3. Pro: The presidency is constrained [more by norms than by law](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/why-norms-matter-politics-trump-215535/)(One of the crucial lessons of the past year, turns out, is just how much of American politics is governed not by written law, but by norms like these. For instance, the president isn’t required to divest himself of his businesses, but previous occupants of the White House have followed this tradition.). Since norms can be transgressed without repercussions, limits on the executive power to pardon should be enshrined into law.
1.1.3.1. Con: President Obama broke convention when he wore a tan suit for a press briefing on ISIS, eliciting enough criticism for this event to be called the "[Tan Suit Gate](https://newsone.com/3885580/barack-obama-tan-suit-anniversary/)(When Obama wore that tan suit while at a press conference to discuss Ukraine and the Islamic State, right-wing trolls lost their conservative minds! How dare the commander in chief \(whose presidency Republicans and racists alike desperately tried in vain to delegitimize\) not wear a navy or charcoal gray suit, they wondered aloud while basing Obama’s presidentiality on the color of his clothes.\n\nAs soon as Obama took the podium, the conservative Twitterverse had a meltdown over his more summery fashion pick that was shamelessly referred to as “tanghazi,” an unfortunate play on the Libyan city of Benghazi where an American compound was attacked in 2012 by members of Ansar al-Sharia, a militant group of Islamic extremists. During Obama’s speech, there were roughly 6,000 tweets about his choice of suit, and within 24 hours, Twitter exploded with more than 14,000 comments about it, according to Topsy, a social media analytics firm.)." This shows that not even the most trivial of presidential norms can be broken without repercussions.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: President Biden [wore a tan suit on the 7th anniversary](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/biden-wears-tan-suit-almost-exactly-7-years-after-right-wing-media-made-obama-wearing-one-into-a-scandal/articleshow/85109880.cms)(On August 28, 2014 - a date which will live in infamy - President Barack Obama wore a tan suit. Republicans and right-wing media treated it as a massive scandal.\n\nAlmost exactly seven years later, President Joe Biden boldly followed in Obama's footsteps and put on a tan suit.\n\nBiden donned the suit during Obama's birthday week. The former president turned 60 on Wednesday.) of the exact date on which President Obama had previously done so. This proves that the repercussions were not sufficiently alarming to deter a successor from following suit.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: President Obama was [not the first or only president](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/28/tan-suit-scandal-obama-trump/)(Ronald Reagan wore tan suits during his presidency. So did Dwight D. Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. \[...\] In 2014, Time magazine offered a compelling explanation for why the tan suit — specially fitted for Obama by Georges de Paris, the Washington tailor who had outfitted every president from Lyndon B. Johnson onward — commanded such enormous attention. During the first term of his presidency, Obama streamlined his daily routine by whittling down his wardrobe options. “You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,” he told Vanity Fair’s Michael Lewis in a 2012 profile. “I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.”) to wear a tan suit; he was not criticized for breaking presidential norms but for contradicting earlier statements about his wardrobe choices.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: President Obama never wore a tan suit again, even though there is [reason to believe](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/news/a20037/president-obama-last-press-conference-suit/)("Let me start off by saying that I was sorely tempted to wear a tan suit today for my last press conference, but Michelle, whose fashion sense is little better than mine, tells me that's not appropriate in January.") that he would have liked to. This indicates that presidents who break norms are checked by the opposition party and the public.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Many of President Trump's actions, such as [personally profiting](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21725303-six-months-mr-trumps-conflicts-interest-look-even-worse-how-donald-trump-monetising)(“PRETTY close to a laughing stock.” That is Walter Shaub’s verdict on America’s standing in the world, at least from an ethics point of view, under President Donald Trump. Mr Shaub’s view counts: he stepped down this week as head of the Office of Government Ethics, a federal watchdog. \[...\] Mr Shaub believes that Mr Trump has rejected ethical norms embraced by all other administrations since the 1970s. He recommends several changes to federal law, including greater powers for the oversight office and stricter disclosure rules.) from the presidency, were unethical but not criminal. This discrepancy can handicap and frustrate ethics watchdogs, which is why they support codifying norms into federal law.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: President Trump donated his [annual salary of $400,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/trump-donates-his-2019-q4-salary-to-help-combat-coronavirus.html)(This is not the first time Trump has donated his salary to an agency facing an urgent problem. Since taking office, Trump has directed his $400,000 annual salary to a different agency each quarter.) to various federal departments and agencies.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Properties owned by President Trump received [tremendous amounts of money](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-properties-profit-foreign-governments-gop-782260)(ozens of foreign governments, special interest groups and GOP congressional campaign committees spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at President Donald Trump's properties during his first year in office, according to a watchdog report.\n\nA study released Tuesday by the non-profit Public Citizen said that these groups clearly intended to win over the president by helping his business empire profit as he sat in the Oval Office.\n\nAltogether, 64 groups that could present conflicts of interest spent money at Trump locations. Major payments included a Saudi Arabian public relations company spending $270,000 at Trump's Washington, D.C. hotel and more than $305,000 from GOP campaigns at several Trump Organization properties.) from GOP and foreign sources during his presidency.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Presidents implicitly comply with democratic norms when granting pardons; notably, greater public confidence increases the number of pardons issued by a president by exerting an "emboldening effect" \([p. 18](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8961&context=etd)(This confidence in their election will embolden them to pursue an agenda and use their new powers to do just that. Having the certainty of the people and in their own ability to lead will cause these presidents to want to use presidential powers, especially one as unilateral as the pardon power. This option in the presidential toolkit offers them the place to affect positive change and undo perceived wrongdoings.)\).
1.1.4. Con: There are sufficient safeguards in place preventing the misuse of the presidential power to issue pardons.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The president's powers are checked by the [threat of impeachment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S4-1-1/ALDE_00000282/)(Congress's power of impeachment is an important check on the executive and judicial branches, recognized by the Framers as a crucial tool for holding government officers accountable for violations of the law and abuses of power. Congress has most notably employed the impeachment tool against the President and federal judges, but all federal civil officers are subject to removal by impeachment. The Senate has also concluded \(by majority vote\) on various occasions that an official impeached while in office remains subject to trial, conviction, and imposition of the penalty of disqualification even after they leave office. The practice of impeachment makes clear, however, that Members of Congress are not civil officers subject to impeachment and removal.), which can deter potential abuses of executive powers, including the right to pardon.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: A president can be impeached for "[high crimes and misdemeanors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii)(The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.)." As impeachment effectively removes the power to pardon and cannot be undone by a pardon, this threat is likely to mitigate abuse of the pardon power.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The ambiguous phrase "[except in cases of impeachment](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/can-president-trump-issue-pardons-while-impeached-experts-at-odds-1.5266242)(“The conventional wisdom and centuries of treatises and textbooks tell us that when the Constitution says that the president can pardon ‘except in cases of impeachment’ means that the criminal process and the impeachment process are separate, and the president can only pardon crimes,” Brian Kalt, an expert on constitutional law and presidential history, and a law professor at Michigan State University, told CTVNews.ca in an email.\n\n“He can’t stop an impeachment or undo an impeachment conviction, but he can still pardon any related crimes.”)" in Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution has traditionally been interpreted to mean that an impeached president can continue to pardon crimes, except those related to his impeachment.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Not all legal scholars agree that an impeached president loses the right to pardon. Indeed, both [Clinton and Trump issued pardons](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/can-president-trump-issue-pardons-while-impeached-experts-at-odds-1.5266242)(Kalt explains that Trump retains all of his powers until he is convicted or his term ends, meaning, “he can still issue pardons -- whether related to his impeachment or not -- while he is impeached.”\n\nKalt noted that former president Bill Clinton pardoned 34 people between his impeachment on Dec 19, 1998 and his acquittal on Feb 12, 1999.\n\n“Nobody batted an eye at that because, again, the standard reading of the impeachment exception to the pardon power … is uniformly understood and accepted.”\n\nBased on Clinton’s example, Trump could still issue pardons during his final week in office. Prior to his impeachment, he had already discussed issuing pardons for himself and his children, according to a CNN report this week, citing multiple sources. The report noted Trump, his allies and family members who partipated in the rally at the Capitol could potentially face legal exposure following the riots.) after they were impeached.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Impeachments based on pardons are unprecedented because presidents are unlikely to risk pardoning a criminal of such vileness that Congress would be forced to consider drastic action.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: The [threat of impeachment](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55729221)(In the final hours of his presidency, Donald Trump has pardoned 73 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who is facing fraud charges.\n\[...\]\nOpponents accuse him of using his constitutional powers unconventionally, to benefit his friends and close supporters.\n\nThere had been speculation Mr Trump could try to pardon himself or his family members ahead of any possible charges.\n\nIt is unclear whether he has the legal power to do so and there is no precedent of a US leader issuing such a pardon.\n\nHe does face a possible Senate impeachment trial for "incitement to insurrection", although dates have yet to be set for that.) may not necessarily dissuade a corrupt president from granting inappropriate pardons; only three presidents have been impeached, and all of them were [acquitted](https://www.history.com/news/how-many-presidents-impeached)(Only three U.S. presidents have been formally impeached by Congress—Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. One of those presidents, Donald Trump, was impeached twice during his single term. No U.S. president has ever been removed from office through impeachment.\n\[...\]\nAlthough Congress has impeached and removed eight federal officials—all federal judges—no president has ever been found guilty during a Senate impeachment trial. Andrew Johnson came awfully close, though; he barely escaped a guilty verdict by one vote.).
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Impeachment is inherently punitive, as it [damages a president's reputation](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/12/19/impeachment-will-damage-trump-whether-he-is-removed-or-not)(Impeachment is a solemn process that impacts the American nation like no other political issue. At its core, the impeachment of a president is about determining whether that individual is fit to serve in the highest office of the land. \[...\] Ultimately, regardless of what happens in the Senate, Trump will be damaged by the impeachment process. Either he gets acquitted by the Senate after an open trial with witnesses and still carries the label of “impeached”, or he gets acquitted without a fair trial and is seen as politically protected and above the law.) and ensures that future generations look back on him in a negative light. This threat is sufficient to dissuade most presidents from granting egregious pardons.
1.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Corrupt presidents often demonstrate poor risk perception \([p. 10](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331885179_Is_risk-taking_propensity_associated_with_unethical_behaviors_An_experimental_study)(The present study contributed to the extant literature by showing that a person’s risk-taking propensity was positively linked to his or her actual self-serving dishonest behavior.

In this paper, we provide an indication of the possible broad scope of political influence on perceptions of risk and choices by examining politically-related variation in risk perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using novel data on individuals’ search behavior on Google and geospatial mapping data capturing changes in individuals’ daily travel distance and trips to non-essential businesses and service locations, we document a significant divergence in the reactions of areas with high and low Trump vote shares in the 2016 presidential election to local COVID-19 cases. We document a muted response to preliminary COVID-19 cases in high Trump vote share areas.) poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, more robust checks are needed.
1.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: The correlation between inaccurate COVID-19 risk assessment and support of President Trump could feasibly be the result of a third variable, such as digital literacy or religious affiliation \([pp. 19, 29](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acp.3894)(The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by misinformation, politicization of public health, and extreme differences in risk assessment. In two studies, we sought to understand factors that contribute to differences in people's understanding of the virus and associated risks. We found that conservative participants reported higher levels of acceptable risk, have lower risk estimates of activities, and endorsed more misinformation.\n\[...\]\nHere, we have taken preliminary steps towards understanding thecognitive individual differences that may cause people to inaccurately assess risks of COVID-19, engage in risky behaviors, and endorse mis-perceptions. Our findings support the importance of cognitive ability in avoiding misinformation during the current pandemic, and the effect political polarization can have on an individual's perception of medical risk, willingness to accept risk, tendency to believe misinformation, and intention to engage in healthy behaviors.)\).
1.1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: President Trump's tweets about the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected [risk perceptions and compliance](https://www.durham.ac.uk/news-events/latest-news/2021/11/how-trumps-covid-19-tweets-impacted-social-distancing/)(The results demonstrated that tweets and commentary from Donald Trump affected politically red and blue states differently. The tweets’ sentiment negatively affected the public’s tendency to stay at home during the pandemic in 78.6% of Republican counties, but in only 44.7% of Democratic counties.\n\n“Politics in the US has become more polarised, with Democrats and Republicans more ideologically divided than ever. It’s clear this polarisation was evident in the Covid-19 pandemic, and amplified by the former President’s tweets, with the public viewing them via two different political lenses and basing their risk perception on this.” Professor Michael Guo) with stay-at-home orders, particularly among residents of red counties.
1.1.4.1.3.2.3. Pro: [Presidents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/23/first-thing-trump-pardons-cast-controversial-characters)(Donald Trump has approved a wave of pre-Christmas pardons, including disgraced Republican lawmakers, contractors convicted of a massacre in Iraq, and a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials in the Russia investigation.

She was a 21-year-old recent college grad with an unpaid internship in the office of President Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, landed with the help of a family connection. But, as the nation later learned, things happened quickly from that point, as it was that year that she began a relationship with the President that would last about two years and lead to an epoch-shaping scandal.), displaying a general lack of good judgment.
1.1.4.1.3.3. Pro: Impeachment threats are immaterial to presidents who issue pardons during their [last days in office](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/verify-impeachment-does-not-undo-presidential-pardons/507-aaf8978e-5282-4147-ad47-65ca3b7d0458)(In fact, the CRS noted that some have argued impeachment is “useless against a president . . . who grants controversial pardons in the very last hours of his tenure.” Meaning the president can grant whichever pardons they want just before they leave office and nothing can stop them.\n\nAnd there are no other ways to stop a presidential pardon either. A footnote in a 1977 William and Mary Law Review paper said, “the pardon remains effective despite removal of the president for issuing it. Once delivered, a pardon cannot be revoked.” And there’s no evidence that this has changed in the 40 years since it was written.). These cannot be prevented or overturned.
1.1.4.1.3.4. Con: Following each of the [three impeachments](https://time.com/5552679/impeached-presidents/)(Impeachment is very rare in the U.S.’s nearly 250 years of history, and none of the three men to have faced it — Presidents Bill Clinton, Andrew Johnson and Donald Trump — have been removed from office. \(However, after Clinton and Johnson were impeached, both of their parties lost the next Presidential election.\)) recorded in US history, the incumbent's party lost the [following election](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trumps-journey-from-election-defeat-to-acquittal-in-second-impeachment-trial/articleshow/80904573.cms?from=mdr)(Former US president Donald Trump was acquitted Saturday in his second impeachment trial by a Senate vote of 57 to 43, surviving charges that he incited the deadly January 6 assault on the US Capitol by supporters bent on preventing Congress from transferring power to Joe Biden. \[...\] On November 7, Biden is declared the winner after flipping the historically Republican southern state of Georgia.). This suggests that impeachment is political suicide for an incumbent.
1.1.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: This phenomenon extends outside the US; international research has shown that, over the past 30 years, when a leader is removed from office, their party is only reelected about 14% of the time \([p. 2](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2019-10/cliffs-take-100119-v3.pdf)(Impeachment effects last beyond the proceedings, negatively impacting the party in power. We only found 3 cases, or 14% of those included in the database, where the party of a president who left office won the next election.)\).
1.1.4.1.3.4.2. Con: Members of Congress who vote to impeach a president that belongs to the same party can end up [alienating their voter base](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/05/23/unpacked-the-political-risks-of-impeachment/)(In the contemporary context, voters who supported Donald Trump also supported Republican Members of both the House and the Senate. To try to remove the president risks, for many Republicans, alienating the supporters who voted for Donald Trump. \[...\] Failure to collect votes to remove an impeached president in a unified government would cause the voters who supported that president to lash out against the party and the president himself would then lash out against the party in Congress. That is a lose-lose situation for a party under unified control.) and elicit hostility from the incumbent. This can hurt their chance of success in upcoming elections, and deter them from impeaching a president.
1.1.4.1.3.5. Pro: The effects of impeachment on presidential power are too limited to prevent them from issuing controversial pardons.
1.1.4.1.3.5.1. Con: If an impeached president is [convicted](https://www.chandralaw.com/faqs/if-a-president-of-the-united-states-is-impeached-by-the-house-and-convicted-by-the-senate-can-that-now-former-president-run-for-and-become-president-again)(Although that clause in Article II—which addresses the presidential executive branch—is silent on the question of whether an impeached and convicted president may become president again, Article I, Section 3 answers the question squarely:\n\n"Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law."), they are removed from office, barred from holding future office, and subject to criminal prosecution.
1.1.4.1.3.5.2. Pro: Impeachment is unlikely to pose a threat to presidents because their [power to govern](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-process-works/story?id=51202880)(A president can continue governing even after he or she has been impeached by the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump continued to govern after his impeachment in December 2019, and of course, ran for reelection in 2020. After Clinton was impeached on Dec. 19, 1998, he finished out his second term, which ended in January 2001, during which time he was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. While Clinton continued governing, and the impeachment had no legal or official impact, his legacy is marred by the proceeding.) remains unaffected unless they are convicted, and this has [never happened](http://Impeachment is very rare in the U.S.’s nearly 250 years of history, and none of the three men to have faced it — Presidents Bill Clinton, Andrew Johnson and Donald Trump — have been removed from office.)(Impeachment is very rare in the U.S.’s nearly 250 years of history, and none of the three men to have faced it — Presidents Bill Clinton, Andrew Johnson and Donald Trump — have been removed from office. \[...\] Impeachment alone isn’t the only step to take a President out of office, but is actually the first part of a two-pronged process. To impeach an official, the House of Representatives must pass articles of impeachment, which formally accuse the President of misbehavior. Once the House votes to impeach, the Senate must hold a trial to decide if the President should be removed from office.) in US history.
1.1.4.1.3.5.3. Pro: Impeachment does not automatically [disqualify a president](https://www.rd.com/list/things-people-get-wrong-about-impeachment/)(When the Senate votes to convict a president, that doesn’t automatically bar them from running for or holding public office in the future.) from running for office. Thus, in theory, presidents can issue controversial pardons, run for office, and justify the pardons during election campaigns, absolving themselves of responsibility.
1.1.4.2. Con: It is [legally questionable](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/us/politics/a-constitutional-puzzle-can-the-president-be-indicted.html?mcubz=1) whether a sitting president can be indicted and, consequently, prosecuted. This ambiguity could lead presidents to believe that they are effectively immune from consequences for illicit actions.
1.1.4.3. Con: The presidential pardon power is largely [unchecked](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/trump-pardons-limits-unchecked-power.html)(So the pardon power is found in Article II of the Constitution. It is very broadly conferred. It gives the president broad and, with two exceptions, unqualified power to pardon. The exceptions are: One, he’s limited to pardoning federal crimes. He can’t excuse or pardon state crimes. So, for example, Trump has no ability to stop the prosecution in New York, the investigation into the Trump Organization. Second, pardons cannot be used in the context of impeachments, which is no longer relevant, but a president can’t avoid an impeachment by issuing a pardon to someone. Other than that, Article II states no limits. And the Supreme Court has basically stated, for hundreds of years, that the pardon power is very broad and has really countenanced very few, if any, restrictions by Congress on it.); as the Supreme Court has consistently upheld this view, presidents continue to have carte blanche to issue questionable pardons.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Congress or the States can propose a [constitutional amendment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/)(An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the States request one, by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each State for ratification. In modern times, amendments have traditionally specified a time frame in which this must be accomplished, usually a period of several years. Additionally, the Constitution specifies that no amendment can deny a State equal representation in the Senate without that State’s consent.) to limit or remove the president’s power to pardon. This is enough to prevent presidents from misusing this power.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: A constitutional limit could be placed on the number of presidential pardons allowable within each term.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: As there may often be immediate or long-term financial benefits for a president as a result of pardons \([pp. 117-118](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=bclj)(The analysis of rent-seeking and the pardon power will need to be viewed with regard to three different models. The first model will determine the number of pardons that society demands and the effect of oversupplying or undersupplying by the President. The second model will illustrate the societal demand for the services of the President after he leaves the oval office. The third model will show the profits that the President can gain if he "sells" pardons. These models are interrelated and will be discussed together in conjunction\nwith Parker's assumptions.)\), it makes sense to put a cap on these to minimize the opportunity for abuse.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: If the number of pardons were limited, then presidents might save the available pardons for relatives, allies, and themselves.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Through a constitutional amendment, pardons could be made contingent on approval from representatives of all three arms of the government: the Attorney General, the Chief Justice, and the Chairman of the House or Senate Judiciary Committee.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Con: The [Attorney General](https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-frankchurchinstitute/publications/essays/role-attorney-general-reviewing-defending-executive-orders/)(Like other members of the cabinet, the Attorney General is appointed by the president, confirmed by the U.S. Senate and serves at the pleasure of the president.) is appointed by and serves at the leisure of the president, so their approval of proposed pardons would essentially be guaranteed.
1.1.4.4.2.2. Con: Such a requirement would effectively remove the ability of the presidential pardon to act as an executive check on judicial and legislative power.
1.1.4.4.2.3. Pro: There is a long history of support for requiring approval of consequential presidential actions, including pardons; several states argued for this during the Constitutional Convention \([p. 449](https://nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/JLPP-23.2-Bowman.pdf)(In Pennsylvania, one author suggested that the risk of a president protecting himself by pardoning his own traitorous co-conspirators could\nbe ameliorated by attaching to the president a council whose approval\nwould be required for every consequential presidential act, including pardons. The ratifying convention of New York voted to approve the Constitution, but appended a list of recommended amendments, including one requiring congressional approval for pardons for treason.)\).
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: The Constitution can be amended to prohibit the president from pardoning political allies or to make such pardons contingent on congressional approval.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Con: Congress can become politically biased when a majority of the elected representatives share the same political affiliation. Therefore, they may vote to pardon crimes to benefit or please an incumbent president or serve their partisan objectives.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Con: Limiting the presidential pardon based on the type of crime or applicant's relationship with the president would be too resource-intensive to be feasible.
1.1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: The nature of the crime and the applicant's relationship to the president would be irrelevant in most cases. Requiring such information would make pardons less accessible to those who cannot afford the legal help needed to disclose this kind of information \([p. 1](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/file/898541/download)\).
1.1.4.4.3.2.2. Pro: Executive clemency [investigations](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions)(The applicant will be expected to meet the same high standards of character and reputation generally required of all pardon applicants, which are determined by means of a thorough investigation into an applicant’s background by the Federal Bureau of Investigations \(FBI\) and his/her activities since the conviction.) are carried out by FBI agents under the guidance of a Pardon Attorney. Establishing whether a particular instance falls under the proscribed categories would increase the scope and cost of such investigations.
1.1.4.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: As the FBI is part of the [executive](https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/who-is-the-head-of-the-fbi)(The FBI is led by a Director, who is appointed by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate for a term not to exceed 10 years.) branch, it would likely be necessary to move such investigations to a different agency to reduce presidential influence on the investigators, and this will create additional costs.
1.1.4.4.3.2.2.2. Con: The FBI is fully capable of establishing these facts using their standard assessment and investigation procedures \([p. 1](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/FBI%20Investigation%20Fact%20Sheet%202013.pdf)(The FBI conducts several different types of investigations, and each is governed by certain rules, as set out in guidelines issued by the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral. These guidelines have been modified over the last decade to give the FBI broad latitude and authority in conducting investigations.\n\nEven at the assessment stage, where the FBI can initiate an investigation without any indication of terrorist or criminal activity, it can gather a wide\nrange of information. As evidence of a possible national security threat or crime accumulates, the FBI can use more and more intrusive investigative\ntools. The FBI does not have to start with an assessment and work its way up; if it has sufficient information, it can start at the top.)\).
1.1.4.4.3.2.3. Con: Limiting the type of people who are eligible for a pardon would reduce the likelihood of pardons being granted to cronies. This would be more cost-effective than retroactively investigating and prosecuting occurrences of corruption.
1.1.4.4.3.3. Pro: Requiring congressional approval would help identify the impacts of and reasons for presidential pardons, improving transparency.
1.1.4.4.3.4. Pro: At present, the president must obtain [approval from the Senate](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/faq_general.aspx)(The President nominates someone for a vacancy on the Court and the Senate votes to confirm the nominee, which requires a simple majority. In this way, both the Executive and Legislative Branches of the federal government have a voice in the composition of the Supreme Court.) when appointing Supreme Court justices. Approvals for pardons could operate similarly.
1.1.4.4.3.5. Pro: In 2020, the Democrats drafted a bill criminalizing any [quid pro quo pardon](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/democrats-legislation-criminalize-quid-pro-quo-pardons-378037)(The House Judiciary Committee has teed up a bill that would criminalize a presidential pardon offered in exchange for anything of value — such as a witness’ silence — a key addition to legislation already slated for consideration that would empower Congress to investigate potential abuse of the pardon power.\n\nUnder the updated proposal from House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff, a presidential pardon granted — or dangled — to obtain a “thing of value” would be punished under federal bribery laws. The restriction would include not just pardons but commutations — reprieves that reduce prisoners’ prison sentences but maintain their convictions.) granted in exchange for "a thing of value." Enacting such laws would be sufficient to counteract quid pro quo pardons.
1.1.4.4.3.5.1. Con: Even if such laws were to be passed, it is extremely unlikely that they would be enforceable due to the [Supreme Court's interpretation](https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/01/the-supreme-court-and-the-presidents-pardon-power/)(The Supreme Court has made clear that, subject to the exception for impeachment, the president’s power to grant pardons is “unlimited,” with virtually no oversight or limiting role for Congress. \n...\nAnd in Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, the court emphasized that pardons “have not traditionally been the business of courts; as such, they are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial review.”\n\nThe broad and largely unreviewable pardon power outlined in the Supreme Court’s cases means that the president has significant leeway to pardon, for example, family members or close associates such as former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani — although neither Giuliani nor any Trump family members have been charged with any crimes.) of the presidential pardon.
1.1.4.4.3.5.2. Pro: While the Framers of the Constitution appear to have been aware of the [danger posed by quid pro quo pardons](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/01/17/presidential-pardons-settled-law-unsettled-issues-and-a-downside-for-trump/)(One of the most disturbing aspects of the president’s broad power to pardon is that it apparently empowers the president to conspire with others to commit crimes that personally profit him or serve to maintain him illegally in office, since he can assure those who aid in these endeavors that if their perfidy is discovered, he will pardon them for the crimes they have committed. Surely, one might think, the framers did not intend for the pardon power to extend this far. It appears, however, that the drafters of the pardon clause recognized this danger, but did not act to prevent it.), they chose not to expressly forbid them, instead trusting that the ability to amend the Constitution would allow for such a stipulation in the future should it become necessary.
1.1.4.4.4. Con: Politicians have an incentive to turn a blind eye to executive abuses of power if they believe that they or their party's representative stand to gain from similar misuses of power in the future. Therefore, congressional action is not a sufficient check on executive power.
1.1.4.4.5. Con: A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate and a three-fourths majority of state legislatures; since this is a [practical impossibility](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/05/amending-the-constitution-is-much-too-hard-blame-the-founders.html)(In the 220-plus years since ratification of the Constitution, more than 11,000 amendments have been proposed, but only 27 have been enacted. The first 10 amendments were added immediately to appease critics of the Constitution during the ratification debates. The three critical post­–Civil War amendments \(13th, 14th, and 15th\), which expanded individual rights, are also a special case because the Southern states were coerced into ratifying them. From 1870 to today, only 12 amendments have been enacted. And since 1971, only a single amendment has been ratified—a trivial change that prohibits Congress from giving itself a raise that takes effect before the following election—and that ratification took place 203 years after the proposed amendment was submitted to the states in 1789.), presidential pardons should be limited in some other way.
1.1.4.4.6. Con: Several potential amendments to this effect have been introduced as [house resolutions](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hjres8/summary)(A new constitutional amendment proposal would prevent the president — whether Trump or any future president — from pardoning:\n\n-Themselves.\n-Any member of their presidential administration, past or present.\n-Anyone who had worked for their presidential campaign in a paid capacity.\n-Any of 23 specified types of family members, notably \(for the current president at least\) including their child and son-in-law, as well as siblings, parents, grandchildren, spouses, and cousins.\n\nThe proposed constitutional amendment was introduced as House resolution H.J. Res. 8 by Rep. Steve Cohen \(D-TN9\).\n\n\(A similar proposed constitutional amendment which would only prevent a president from pardoning themselves was introduced the same day by Rep. Al Green \(D- TX9\). GovTrack Insider previously wrote about an identical version Rep. Green introduced in 2017.\)) in recent years.
1.1.4.4.6.1. Pro: It has been argued that President Trump's pardons were [more personal](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/18/how-donald-trump-has-tested-the-ethical-limits-of-presidential-pardons/)(Have Trump’s pardons been more political, more personal, than those issued by past presidents?\n\nYes, definitely. Trump actually has not pardoned that many people. They’ve been kind of high-profile, so we’ve heard a lot about them, but compared to previous presidents, there are really not that many. And most of them are either people he knows or people who were, to some degree, public figures — maybe not public figures, necessarily, in the sense of being politically active, but somehow having gotten the attention of the press and, in particular, conservative media.\n\nVery few ordinary people have been pardoned, compared to previous presidents.) than those of his predecessors, leading to renewed controversy and interest in limiting the extent of the pardon power.
1.1.4.4.6.2. Con: The fact that neither Congress nor the States have passed such an amendment indicates that they do not consider presidential pardons to be especially problematic.
1.1.4.5. Pro: The media, which is widely regarded as the [fourth estate or fourth pillar](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-fourth-estate-3368058)(The term "fourth estate" is used to describe the press. Describing journalists and the news outlets for which they work as members of the fourth estate is an acknowledgment of their influence and status among the greatest powers of a nation, the author William Safire once wrote.\n\nThe term goes back centuries when it applied to any unofficial group that wielded public influence, including a mob.) of democracy, holds presidents accountable for their use of executive powers. This is demonstrated by the decline in clemency in recent years \([p. 23](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8961&context=etd)(With the media telegraphing every action, these leaders have to justify their decisions in the public arena and endure the public commentary on their decisions. As Samuel Kernell noted, this strategy of “going public should be appreciated as a strategic adaptation to the information age” \(2007\). There might be acts of clemency that could gain positive press for the president, but “the country’s Founders did not intend for the clemency power to be used as a prize.")\).
1.1.5. Pro: Pardons can be used to elicit or reward unethical or immoral favors or granted in exchange for political contributions.
1.1.5.1. Con: Misuse is a risk with any power bestowed upon the president.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: President Trump has been accused of misusing the [power to issue executive orders](https://apnews.com/article/mark-meadows-donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-foreign-policy-ce86fe1ebcf5ce7b9bf5d556b54b55d5)(Trump has so far issued 33 executive orders this year, though he was a critic of such actions when running for office. He’s on pace to exceed his high of 55 executive orders issued during his first year in office.) to implement questionable policies that could potentially [harm the nation](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/22/trump-presidents-abuse-emergency-powers-congress-rein-in-461293)(Under the National Emergencies Act, the president has near-total discretion to declare a national emergency. Such a declaration in turn unlocks powers contained in more than 100 different provisions of law. \[...\] The consequences of gutting Congress’ role became apparent two years ago, when President Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding for a wall along the southern border. At the time, unlawful border crossings were hovering near a 40-year low, and Congress had already considered and denied Trump’s request for several billion dollars in funding. In a rare bipartisan rebuke, Congress voted twice to terminate the border wall emergency. But it was unable to override Trump’s vetoes, and the declaration remained in place.) \(e.g., declaring an emergency\).
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Unlike pardons, most powers of the presidency are [subject to review](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/checks-and-balances.asp)(Moreover, while the president has veto power, the legislative branch can overturn a president's veto with a two-thirds "supermajority" vote by both houses of Congress. This ensures that the president cannot use his power for personal gain. The executive branch can also declare executive orders, effectively proclaiming how certain laws should be enforced, but the judicial branch can deem these orders to be unconstitutional.) by other branches of the government.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Bill Clinton pardoned [140 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/21/politics/clinton-issues-pardons-clearing-deutch-and-mcdougal-but-not-milken.html)(With just hours to go in his presidency today, Bill Clinton issued pardons to 140 people, including John Deutch, a former director of central intelligence; Henry G. Cisneros, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Susan H. McDougal, a onetime Clinton business partner who was jailed in the Whitewater scandal.\n\nOthers receiving presidential pardons in one of Mr. Clinton's last official acts were his half-brother, Roger, who pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine in Arkansas, and Patricia Hearst Shaw, the heiress who robbed a bank in 1974 after being kidnapped by a small band of political radicals that called itself the Symbionese Liberation Army.) on his last day of office, including family members and former political donors.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: The [Clinton name](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37168505)("It is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history," Mr Trump said in the release. "What they were doing during crooked Hillary's time as secretary of state was wrong then, and it is wrong now."\n\nThe swirls of controversy around the Clinton Foundation have given Mr Trump and his campaign surrogates the opportunity to go on the attack against Mrs Clinton after weeks of unforced errors and sinking poll numbers.\n\nMrs Clinton already suffers from negative ratings for her honesty and integrity in opinion surveys, so many Americans may be predisposed to believe the allegations of improper behaviour while secretary of state are valid.) has been closely linked to corruption, particularly financial corruption. Misuse of the pardon power by one president should not be grounds to revoke the power entirely.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Many of Clinton's pardons were symbolic, in that a number of those he pardoned were [unfairly incarcerated or had already served](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-107shrg76344/html/CHRG-107shrg76344.htm)(President Clinton made a strong statement by commuting the sentences of more than 20 men and women who were serving long prison terms for relatively low-level drug offenses. Several of them had been victims of domestic abuse. \nIn many cases, the sentencing judge and the prosecutor had \nrecommended in favor of clemency. These are compelling cases for Presidential clemency. I hope at some point we can appreciate the injustice being caused by mandatory minimum sentences which take away from Federal judges the discretion that would allow them to consider the circumstances of the cases before them.) a significant proportion of their sentence and had, therefore, paid their debt to society.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: Bill Clinton granted Marc Rich an [11th hour pardon](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-clinton-pardons-analysis-story.html)(President Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich is a saga of secrecy, tenacity, sleight of hand and pressure from Rich's ex-wife and one of her friends, who together have steered millions of dollars to Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's causes and those of fellow Democrats.\n\nWhether it is a story of bribery as well or illegal gifts from abroad is the subject of congressional inquiries and a criminal investigation by the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York.), presumably as payback for financial benefits in the form of bribery or illegal gifts.
1.1.5.2.4. Pro: President Clinton pardoned his [half-brother, Roger](https://www.insider.com/list-of-most-famous-shocking-presidential-pardons-in-us-history#clinton-pardoned-his-half-brother-roger-clinton-in-1984-8)(In what was seen as a pretty clear case of nepotism, Clinton issued a pardon for his half-brother Roger Clinton after he served a year in prison for pleading guilty to cocaine distribution charges.), before leaving office.
1.1.5.3. Con: Most pardons do not reward political allies. Instead, they advance the interests of individual citizens \([p. xvii](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/300116.pdf)(If one had to describe a petitioner in our analysis case files more likely to receive a presidential grant of pardon than others \(and to do so without controlling for other petitioner and evaluation process characteristics\), Table S.2 suggests it would have been a non-Hispanic white male who was a U.S.-born citizen and was in his late twenties when the underlying offense \(a white-collar crime such those involving tax violations, embezzlement, forgeries, or counterfeiting\) was committed.)\).
1.1.5.4. Pro: President Trump's pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was "[a hero to the Trump base](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/08/26/what-authoritarianism-experts-think-of-trumps-decision-to-pardon-joe-arpaio/?utm_term=.292be0c4d961)," has been regarded by many as an [unethical abuse of executive power](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/08/joe-arpaio-sheriff-arizona-donald-trump)(Along the years, Arpaio had ignored a federal judge’s order that barred his law enforcement agency from detaining undocumented immigrants who had not been suspected or accused of crimes – and turning them over for deportation.\n\nIn 2016, the Obama administration’s justice department had announced plans to prosecute Arpaio for criminal contempt of court.\n\nTrump’s 2017 pardon provided relief, and hope for a political rebirth. “He is loved in Arizona,” Trump told reporters of Arpaio days after the pardon. “Sheriff Joe protected our borders. And Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election – an election that he would have won.”\n\nIt did not take long, however, for legal scholars, newspaper editorial boards and historians to pen the rebuke, labeling the pardon an abuse of power, an impeachable offense, unconstitutional, a dog whistle to white supremacists in Trump’s base, cronyism, or any combination of these.).
1.1.5.4.1. Con: Trump and Arpaio were [political bedfellows](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/25/16207446/trump-arpaio-pardon)(Sheriff Arpaio played a key role in validating Donald Trump, whose candidacy was initially seen as a joke, as the champion of hardline immigration policies and the cultural anxieties that came alongside them. Trump’s first truly major campaign rally, in August 2015, was in Phoenix with Arpaio and some of the “Angel Moms” \(mothers of people killed by unauthorized immigrants\) he would continue to co-opt as a candidate and president. Arpaio formally endorsed Trump in January 2016 — before a single primary vote had been cast. He took a gamble, and he won.\n\nSo it makes sense that Trump, who has some apparent loyalty to people who supported him back when he was one of 17 Republican presidential candidates, would think warmly of Arpaio. But the endorsement isn’t really the basis of their simpatico. It’s just an acknowledgment of the political truth that Trump is engaging in exactly the same brand of politics that Arpaio pioneered a decade earlier.), as evidenced by how similarly the two men ran their respective offices. Thus, national support for Trump in the form of a presidential victory, was implicit support for Arpaio, who publicly endorsed him.
1.1.5.4.2. Pro: Pardons are typically granted toward [the end of a presidency](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/18/politics/donald-trump-eleventh-hour-pardons/index.html)(The 11th-hour batch of clemency is in keeping with presidential tradition.\nPresident Barack Obama pardoned or commuted the sentences of 330 individuals on the day before he left office, a record number that went mainly to low level drug offenders serving mandatory sentences. \nPresident George W. Bush was more sparing with his use of pardons and commutations. He commuted the sentences of two border agents as he departed office \(Trump later pardoned them\). But he wrote in his memoir how a rush of requests came to him as he closed out his tenure. \[...\] President George H.W. Bush pardoned a dozen people a day before leaving office. President Ronald Reagan pardoned around 25 people during his final week as president. And President Jimmy Carter, as he departed office, pardoned Pete Yarrow, of the group Peter, Paul and Mary, for an "indecent liberties" offense with a 14-year-old girl.), but Trump pardoned Arpaio at the start of his presidency, and announced the pardon during the media frenzy surrounding Hurricane Harvey. This indicates that Trump had an ulterior political motive which he attempted to bury amidst other news.
1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: The Trump administration frequently utilized the [news cycle](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/opinion/2017/09/16/pardoning-sheriff-arpaio-represents-double-standard/663423001/)(On the eve of Hurricane Harvey making landfall in Texas, President Trump announced that he was going to be issuing a presidential pardon to former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Obviously strategically timed, it appears that he was hoping the devastation from the storm would dominate the news cycle and this controversial action work would get little coverage. I sincerely hope that does not happen, because this pardon is a blatant slap in the face to Latino Americans. Make no mistake about it, President Trump, the supposed "law and order" president, just gave amnesty to a criminal.) to its [political advantage](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trump-responds-scandal-manipulating-news-cycle/578221/)(Much of Trump’s executive time, according to sources close to the president, is spent scanning headlines and “obsessing,” in the words of one former senior White House official, over the stock market. Trump views both as key metrics of his presidency, and enjoys his ability to influence them within moments of hitting “Send Tweet” from the residency. Rather than try to put out existing fires, the sources said, Trump prefers to spark new ones that play to his penchant for showmanship and intrigue.\n\nAs news outlets dropped one troubling story after another this week, Trump did just that.).
1.1.5.4.2.2. Con: President Trump has claimed that he pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio during Hurricane Harvey because he expected television ratings to be [higher.](http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/trump_i_pardoned_joe_arpaio_during_the_hurricane_because_i_assumed_the_ratings_would_be_far_higher)(Trump on Monday afternoon insisted “a lot of people” think pardoning Arpaio “was the right thing to do,” and added, “actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally “ you know, the hurricane was just starting.”) This implies that he did not intend to bury the story amid the hurricane news.
1.1.5.4.3. Pro: Joe Arpaio was charged with violating a federal court order meant to curtail racial discrimination, but President Trump [pardoned him](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html)(Arpaio, who was sheriff in Maricopa County, Arizona, until last year, was found guilty of criminal contempt last month for disregarding a court order in a racial-profiling case. His sentencing had been scheduled for October 5.\n"Not only did \(Arpaio\) abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise," US District Judge Susan Bolton wrote in a July 31 order finding him guilty.) before he could be sentenced.
1.2. Con: Presidential pardons have had no negative national impact to warrant revocation of this power.
1.2.1. Pro: The presidential right to pardon was instituted by the [Founding Fathers](https://time.com/5304514/pardon-power-presidents-history/)(It starts, in part, with Alexander Hamilton, who articulated the rationale for presidential pardons in the Federalist Papers when he wrote in No. 74 that “without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.” So, as with so many things in the American civic structure, the idea is that the pardon provides checks and balances against the judiciary system; there has to be an out somewhere in the system.). Revoking this power would run counter to their vision for the US.
1.2.1.1. Con: The Founding Fathers granted US presidents the power to pardon within a specific political and ideological framework that has been rendered obsolete by changes to the national political landscape. Therefore, the president's power to pardon should be revoked.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The political and ideological framework of the US government is embodied in the [Constitution](https://www.history.com/news/constitution-amendments-changes)(The Founding Fathers intended the document to be flexible in order to fit the changing needs and circumstances of the country. In the words of Virginia delegate Edmund Randolph, one of the five men tasked with drafting the Constitution, the goal was to “insert essential principles only, lest the operations of government should be clogged by rendering those provisions permanent and unalterable, which ought to be accommodated to times and events.”), which the Founding Fathers intentionally left flexible and capable of adapting to changing times.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The founding fathers created pardons as a means to rectify power imbalances in a [non-partisan government](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/civics/political-parties/founding-fathers-political-parties)(They were convinced that political parties \(or factions, as they called them\) would only destroy representative government and that there should be no place for parties in American democracy. But we have since become dependent on political parties. For the past two centuries, they have played a critical role in both the political and governing processes. \[...\] As the Founders discovered, to their dismay, the simple fact was that consensus was impossible to maintain. People simply disagreed about things. Reasonable people held conflicting visions of the common good. Politics was about conflict and division; and elections did produce winners and losers. And as politicians moved toward a more realistic understanding of politics, they discovered that some sort of political organization would facilitate—not destroy—the political process.). However, political parties emerged out of necessity, making pardons ripe for corruption and partisan favoritism.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The Founding Fathers of the US considered the president to be well-positioned to dispense government mercy in a considered manner \([p. 11](https://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/15277/an_absolute_power_or_a_power_absolutely_in_need_of_reform.pdf)(In advocating for the president to have a broad power to bestow mercy onto others, Hamilton assumed the president would act in good faith. He envisioned that the president would exercise the pardon power with “\[h\]umanity and good policy,” and thus “the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed.” Hamilton believed that the president would exercise the pardon power fairly because holding another’s fate in his hands “would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution,” and “the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance, would beget equal circumspection.” Hamilton envisioned the president as an “eligible dispenser of the mercy of government” because the judicial process might err, and “without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would\nwear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.” Thus, the framers designed the pardon power to temper justice with mercy and to serve the public good.)\).
1.2.2. Con: It may be very difficult to measure the actual impacts of a pardon on the country.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Since a pardon removes any incentive for further criminal investigation, the extent of a pardoned crime can easily remain unknown and allow such activity to continue.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: News of a potential pardon for someone involved in elaborate crimes could draw significant media and public attention, helping to hold law enforcement accountable for a thorough investigation.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: If political allies are prosecuted for failing to cooperate in an investigation, the president [can pardon](https://people.howstuffworks.com/presidential-pardon5.htm)(President George H.W. Bush in 1992 pardoned six figures on charges related to the Iran-Contra scandal, in which officials in the Reagan Administration had arranged the sale of missiles to Iran and then used the proceeds to fund a rebel army in Nicaragua. Bush, who had served as Reagan's vice president, had denied any involvement in Iran-Contra during the 1988 presidential election.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton, shortly before leaving office in 2001, pardoned financier Marc Rich and his partner Pincus Green, who fled the U.S. after being indicted on tax evasion and other charges. The FBI subsequently investigated whether the pardon had been influenced by contributions to the Democratic party and the Clinton Presidential Library, but closed the probe in 2005 without filing any charges) them and reduce their punishment.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Some believe that President Trump's [pardon of Paul Manafort](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/23/949820820/trump-pardons-roger-stone-paul-manafort-and-charles-kushner)(President Trump issued dozens more pardons on Wednesday evening to many wealthy and well-connected convicts with ties to his innermost circles, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Republican operative Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of Ivanka Trump.) was intended to obscure a [conspiracy](https://www.justsecurity.org/62174/pardon-furthers-conspiracy-limits-pardon-power/)(Some legal experts believe that former Trump Campaign Chair Paul Manafort’s bizarre behavior, including lying to federal investigators and continuing to provide information to the Trump legal team, are best explained as an effort to secure a pardon in exchange of helping Trump.) involving [unsanctioned foreign lobbying](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/12/702606542/paul-manafort-after-receiving-47-month-sentence-to-learn-punishment-in-d-c-case)(One front of Manafort's legal battle concluded last week in Virginia, where a federal judge sentenced him to 47 months in federal prison and ordered him to pay $25 million in restitution.\n\nA jury there convicted him last year of bank and tax fraud related to consulting and lobbying work he did in Ukraine.\n\nNow he faces sentencing in a second case brought by Mueller's team. Manafort pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges revolving around undeclared foreign lobbying work he did on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian political figures.).
1.2.2.2. Con: Experts in various fields, such as [international relations](http://blogs.shu.edu/journalofdiplomacy/2019/11/the-implications-of-president-trumps-pardon-on-international-law/)(President Trump’s decision to issue these pardons openly invites international courts, such as the International Criminal Court \(ICC\), to try these servicemen under international criminal law. In the cases of Major Golsteyn and Lieutenant Lorance, the crimes occurred in the territory of Afghanistan, a state party to the ICC meaning the conduct falls within the court’s jurisdiction. The ICC’s jurisdiction is limited in that it cannot try individuals if the offenders are already being charged in domestic courts. However, if the investigation or case is not being tried seriously, the ICC has legal jurisdiction to try these individuals. There could be a substantial legal argument made that the clemency given to these individuals constitutes the case to be tried under the ICC’s jurisdiction.), have predicted the potential impacts of presidential pardons. Determining whether the anticipated changes have occurred would serve as a measure of impact.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: International relations are highly complex, and consist of myriad, overlapping issues. It is impossible to isolate the effects of a presidential pardon due to the vast number of [confounding variables](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/instructors/setups2008/exercises/notes/confounding.html)(Confounding variables are those that affect other variables in a way that produces spurious or distorted associations between two variables. That is, they confound the "true" relationship between two variables.\n\nFor example, if we have an association between two variables \(X and Y\), and that association is due entirely to the fact that both X and Y are affected by a third variable \(Z\), then we would say that the association between X and Y is spurious and that it is a result of the effect of a confounding variable \(Z\). Of course, Z may be an confounding variable when it comes to this particular relationship, but it may not be for other relationships.\n\nConfounding variables also can affect two variables that do have some causal connection. For example, if X and Y are associated and also causally related \(for example, if X affects Y\), the association between X and Y may reflect not only their causal connection but also the influence of a third variable \(Z\) that affects both of them.).
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Controversial pardons can elicit [negative reactions](http://blogs.shu.edu/journalofdiplomacy/2019/11/the-implications-of-president-trumps-pardon-on-international-law/)(President Trump’s decision to issue these pardons openly invites international courts, such as the International Criminal Court \(ICC\), to try these servicemen under international criminal law. In the cases of Major Golsteyn and Lieutenant Lorance, the crimes occurred in the territory of Afghanistan, a state party to the ICC meaning the conduct falls within the court’s jurisdiction. The ICC’s jurisdiction is limited in that it cannot try individuals if the offenders are already being charged in domestic courts. However, if the investigation or case is not being tried seriously, the ICC has legal jurisdiction to try these individuals. There could be a substantial legal argument made that the clemency given to these individuals constitutes the case to be tried under the ICC’s jurisdiction.) from other countries and international agencies. These responses can be considered one measure of a pardon's impact on national welfare.
1.2.2.3. Con: Longitudinal and pre-post surveys can be used to assess the impact of [political decisions on public opinion](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120284119)(First, we use data taken at various points over a decade that ask people about the actual issues before the court. This enables us to jointly estimate and track the public’s preferences and the court’s rulings in a way that was previously not possible. We use these data to document the empirical fact that the court’s rulings have shifted over time vis à vis the public, putting the court in a much more conservative position since the appointment of Barrett.). These methodologies allow researchers to determine how pardons influence public perceptions.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Due to the [bandwagon effect](https://theconversation.com/how-political-opinion-polls-affect-voter-behaviour-60554)(In 2013 ReachTEL cited results from a poll asking voters who they thought would win the federal election regardless of their own voting intention. The answer was 74.2% for the Coalition and 25.8% for Labor. Some 3% of Coalition voters thought Labor would win, and 43% of Labor voters thought the Coalition would win.\n\nThese figures are partly indicative of what is called “the bandwagon effect”, where voters who think a particular political party will win the election may end up voting for that party or candidate.), public opinion has a significant impact on voting behaviors; therefore, political stakeholders should be incentivized to examine the real and potential impacts of different kinds of pardons on voters.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Pardons can be [granted at any time](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/family-and-personal/general-legal-matters/legal-guide/what-are-the-rules-for-presidential-pardons)(No, the timing of a pardon does not matter. In Ex parte Garland, the Supreme Court ruled that a president can issue a pardon at any time after commission of a crime.); because research studies require [extensive preparatory work](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/researchdesigns)(In social sciences research, obtaining information relevant to the research problem generally entails specifying the type of evidence needed to test a theory, to evaluate a program, or to accurately describe and assess meaning related to an observable phenomenon.\n\nWith this in mind, a common mistake made by researchers is that they begin their investigations far too early, before they have thought critically about what information is required to address the research problem. Without attending to these design issues beforehand, the overall research problem will not be adequately addressed and any conclusions drawn will run the risk of being weak and unconvincing. As a consequence, the overall validity of the study will be undermined.), pre-post surveys and longitudinal surveys may not be feasible.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Effects like decreased trust in the government are intangible, and the effects of a single action on public perception are difficult to isolate \([pp. 63, 65](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264278219-en.pdf?expires=1658490029&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=DAE14ACDACB3DF8556D944DE5CB8F1C0)(In the case of trust, no unambiguous\ndirect measure is obviously available, but a number of proxies exist. This is the case for measures of interpersonal trust and particularly generalised trust, where a range of both experimental and non-experimental measures of trust can be used to test convergent validity\n\[...\]\nWhile there are more survey data available on trust in institutions than\nis the case for interpersonal trust – thanks to the inclusion of institutional trust measures in the Gallup World Poll, Eurobarometer and Latinobarometer – there is much less information on the convergent validity of institutional trust measures. \[...\] Another complicating factor is that, while for interpersonal trust there is a clear consensus on using generalised trust as the preferred measure of interpersonal trust, institutional trust covers several dimensions, all of which are of interest.)\).
1.2.3. Con: Even if presidential pardons have no negative impact on society, it is still [unethical to pardon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/deontological-ethics)(In deontological ethics an action is considered morally good because of some characteristic of the action itself, not because the product of the action is good. Deontological ethics holds that at least some acts are morally obligatory regardless of their consequences for human welfare.) someone for crimes of which they are guilty.
1.2.3.1. Con: The ethicality of pardons is dependent upon their effects on society rather than an abstract sense of duty or justice.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Pardons allow those who deserve punishment and those who can be sentenced to non-controversial punishments to escape justice.
1.2.4. Pro: Pardons improve the moral standing of a country by protecting citizens who have done something morally correct but technically illegal.
1.2.4.1. Con: When a law is unjust, a jury can decide to make use of [jury nullification](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jury_nullification)(A jury's knowing and deliberate rejection of the evidence or refusal to apply the law either because the jury wants to send a message about some social issue that is larger than the case itself, or because the result dictated by law is contrary to the jury's sense of justice, morality, or fairness. \n\nJury nullification is a discretionary act, and is not a legally sanctioned function of the jury. It is considered to be inconsistent with the jury's duty to return a verdict based solely on the law and the facts of the case. The jury does not have a right to nulification, and counsel is not permitted to present the concept of jury nullification to the jury. However, jury verdicts of acquittal are unassailable even where the verdict is inconsistent with the weight of the evidence and instruction of the law.) by finding the defendant not guilty despite the evidence. This is both a right and a moral responsibility of jurors.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Jury nullification has been used often in US history to acquit otherwise guilty defendants of [controversial crimes](https://www.themarysue.com/what-is-jury-nullification/)(The tactic was famously used during cases related to the Fugitive Slave Act, where northern juries refused to find defendants guilty of aiding the escape of enslaved people. “In refusing to convict for violating an immoral law, these juries \[…\] found they had the innate power to declare that even though a defendant had violated the law, she should not be punished when the law itself violated a deeper principle of justice,” David Hall wrote in a 2020 paper for the University of Tennessee.\n\nJury nullification also became popular again during Prohibition—and it made a huge difference. According to the Washington Post, “As many as 60 percent of juries refused to enforce the Volstead Act, leading to the end of Prohibition.”\n\nThat wasn’t the only time mass nullification had an effect of policy. “Jury nullification led to recognition of battered spouse syndrome, and jury refusal to convict Vietnam War protesters helped bend public policy against that war,” writes the Post.), including aiding fugitive slaves, defying Prohibition, and protesting the Vietnam War.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: The US Constitution guarantees the right to [trial by an impartial jury](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-right-trial-jury.html)(According to the Supreme Court, the jury-trial right applies only when "serious" offenses are at hand—petty offenses don't invoke it. For purposes of this right, a serious offense is one that carries a potential sentence of more than six months' imprisonment. \(Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 \(1970\).\) If the penalty is six months or less, the crime is serious only if the sum of its penalties are weighty enough. The Supreme Court decided in one case that up to six months' incarceration or five years' probation, plus a $5,000 maximum fine weren't enough to make a certain kind of DUI a serious offense.) for any serious offense.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Juries are under no obligation to nullify and are generally not informed of their ability to do so, as nullification is an [unsanctioned](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jury_nullification)(Jury nullification is a discretionary act, and is not a legally sanctioned function of the jury. It is considered to be inconsistent with the jury's duty to return a verdict based solely on the law and the facts of the case. The jury does not have a right to nulification, and counsel is not permitted to present the concept of jury nullification to the jury. However, jury verdicts of acquittal are unassailable even where the verdict is inconsistent with the weight of the evidence and instruction of the law.) use of a jury's power.
1.2.4.2. Con: Morality is [relative](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/)(The truth or falsity of moral judgments, or their justification, is not absolute or universal, but is relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of a group of persons.). Therefore, rights should be protected based on clearly delineated laws, rather than on relative moral standards.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Some people believe low-level drug offenses [should be punished strictly](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9101129/nonviolent-drug-prison)(From President Obama on down, politicians are saying that America needs to stop locking up so many people. And from President Obama on down, they're saying that the way to do that is to reconsider the way we treat nonviolent drug offenders — to stop giving them long sentences, and to offer them alternatives, like drug treatment, so they can deal with the underlying problems that drove them to crime. \[...\] In fact, there's some evidence that if prisoners know that drug addicts get lighter penalties or access to more prison services, they have an incentive to say they're addicted to drugs — even if, by medical standards, they're not.), while others believe they should be decriminalized. Thus, a pardon for a low-level drug offense would be considered just by some and unjust by others.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Some viewed Chelsea Manning's imprisonment as unjust and [supported the commutation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/13/letter-president-obama-support-commutation-chelsea-mannings-sentence)(Manning did not have an opportunity to defend herself on the basis that her disclosures in whole or in part were in the public interest, a serious flaw in US law to which the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression and Access to Information has drawn attention again today. Commuting her sentence will send the message that punishment should always be proportionate, and that the public interest should be considered in all prosecutions of persons who disclose confidential information to the media.) of her sentence.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: The delivery of justice requires establishing a balance between [rightness and fairness](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/justice-and-fairness/)(Justice means giving each person what he or she deserves or, in more traditional terms, giving each person his or her due. Justice and fairness are closely related terms that are often today used interchangeably. There have, however, also been more distinct understandings of the two terms. While justice usually has been used with reference to a standard of rightness, fairness often has been used with regard to an ability to judge without reference to one's feelings or interests; fairness has also been used to refer to the ability to make judgments that are not overly general but that are concrete and specific to a particular case. In any case, a notion of being treated as one deserves is crucial to both justice and fairness.). When enforcing rigid laws takes precedence over considering the relevant facts in each individual case, pardons are needed to balance rightness with fairness.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: By acting as a check against unfair or overly harsh verdicts, presidential pardons afford judges and juries the freedom to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. This facilitates strict but fair law enforcement.
1.2.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Unless pardons are applied equally to all those who are convicted of the same crime under comparable circumstances, then they cannot be considered to be [fair](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/fair)(fair: treating people in a way that does not favor some over others\n\n-He is known as a very fair man.\n-I try to be fair to/with my children.\n-He claims that the competition wasn't fair.).
1.2.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Pardons play a vital role in alleviating injustices caused by the rigid application of laws. In the words of Alexander Hamilton, pardons allow for "[exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed74.asp)(The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance. \[...\] On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men.)."
1.2.4.2.3.2. Con: Courts uphold precedent because, to be perceived as fair and just, the law must be [enforced in a predictable manner](https://law.jrank.org/pages/9325/Precedent.html)(The use of precedent has been justified as providing predictability, stability, fairness, and efficiency in the law. Reliance upon precedent contributes predictability to the law because it provides notice of what a person's rights and obligations are in particular circumstances. A person contemplating an action has the ability to know beforehand the legal outcome.), such that two similar cases receive the same verdict. If this does not happen, public faith in the judiciary will be undermined.
1.2.4.2.3.2.1. Con: Comparisons of similar cases are unlikely to be useful, as the specific characteristics of individual cases can make meaningful comparisons difficult or impossible.
1.2.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: Most criminal cases are [routine matters](https://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-criminal-courts/)(The vast majority of criminal cases are traffic violations. Roughly four out of five court filings are criminal felonies, misdemeanors, or infractions. Unlike felony or misdemeanor charges, which may result in jail or prison sentences, infractions are punishable only by fines. Most infractions are traffic violations, which account for more than 4.6 million filings in California; non-traffic criminal matters numbered less than a million in fiscal year 2013–14.), such as traffic infractions, in which laws are enforced in a relatively predictable way.
1.2.4.2.3.3. Con: Relative circumstances, such as [extenuating and aggravating factors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/extenuating_circumstances)(Extenuating circumstances–also called mitigating factors–are facts or details that are important for fully understanding a situation. With this understanding, the actions a person took in that event might be viewed as less severe, or that person’s culpability in those actions diminished. In a criminal trial, a showing of extenuating circumstances might result in a lower charge or a reduction in punishment, such as a shorter sentence. In civil cases, extenuating circumstances may decrease the amount of damages awarded.\n\nThe alternative to extenuating circumstances are aggravating factors, which might increase punishment in a criminal setting.), significantly influence verdicts and sentences. This is possible only because they are codified into law; this demonstrates that rigid laws are not antithetical to the ideal of relative fairness.
1.2.4.2.3.4. Pro: Courts often follow the maxim, "[hard cases make bad law](https://www.definitions.net/definition/hard+cases+make+bad+law)(Hard cases make bad law is an adage or legal maxim. The phrase means that an extreme case is a poor basis for a general law that would cover a wider range of less extreme cases. In other words, a general law is better drafted for the average circumstance as this will be more common.The original meaning of the phrase concerned cases in which the law had a hard impact on some person whose situation aroused sympathy.)," to avoid setting precedents that might be unfair to future litigants. In such cases, pardons are needed to rectify verdicts that err on the side of unfairness.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Pardons could serve to protect [whistleblowers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whistleblower.asp)(A whistleblower is anyone who has and reports insider knowledge of illegal activities occurring in an organization. Whistleblowers can be employees, suppliers, contractors, clients, or any individual who becomes aware of illegal business activities.) who may violate confidentiality clauses by revealing classified information in an attempt to expose unethical behavior within the government.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Judges often disagree in their interpretations of whistleblowing laws when the disclosure of classified information is involved \([p. 2](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Factsheet%20-%20National%20Security%20Whistleblowing.pdf)(Most notably, the Espionage Act, which was enacted to punish spies and traitors during World War I, prohibits disclosures of national defense information in cases where the person making the disclosure has “reason to believe” it could injure the national defense or give advantage to a foreign country. As recently as 2006, a federal judge interpreted this language to require the government to prove “bad faith” on the part of the defendant. The judges in the cases of John Kiriakou and Bradley Manning, however, disagreed, declaring that the defendant’s subjective intent is irrelevant. Another judge recently threw the case law into even deeper confusion: She held that the government does not even need to demonstrate that the disclosure would be “potentially damaging to the United States or useful to an enemy of the United States.” These rulings further open the door to criminal prosecutions against individuals who meet the statutory definition of whistleblowers.)\). Pardons are necessary to ensure even-handedness in the delivery of justice across similar cases.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Human rights experts, such as UN officials, have explicitly encouraged the US government to [pardon whistleblowers](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/un-expert-urges-pardons-for-other-whistleblowers-after-manning-117011900385_1.html)(Welcoming the commutation of US army officer Chelsea Manning's 35-year sentence for leaking classified military documents to WikiLeaks, a UN human rights expert called on governments to recognise the contributions of whistleblowers and pardon those serving prison sentences.\n\n"There are, however, many whistleblowers who have served the cause of human rights and who are still in prison in many countries throughout the world. It is time to recognise the contribution of whistleblowers to democracy and the rule of law and to stop persecuting them," said Alfred de Zayas, the UN Independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order.\n\nHe called on governments worldwide to put an end to multiple campaigns of "defamation, mobbing and even prosecution of whistleblowers like Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, the Luxleakers Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet and the tax corruption leaker Rafi Rotem.") who have acted in good faith and exercised the right to freedom of expression to ensure government accountability.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: In certain cases, clemency is the only way to ensure the safety of whistleblowers. This was the case with US Army whistleblower [Chelsea Manning](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/17/510307055/president-obama-commutes-chelsea-mannings-prison-sentence)(In one of his last moves in office, President Obama has commuted the 35-year prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Army private who leaked a massive trove of military secrets to WikiLeaks. \[...\] Manning, a transgender woman formerly known as Bradley, had requested clemency from Obama and said her life was at risk in an all-male prison, as we reported. She has admitted to "releasing more than 700,000 documents, including battlefield reports and U.S. embassy cables."), a transgender woman who feared for her life as an inmate in an all-male prison.
1.2.4.3.4. Con: Whistleblowing carries several [significant risks](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/truth-be-told-unpacking-the-risks-of-whistleblowing)(There are social and emotional consequences, and there are also career consequences. A lot of whistleblowers are fired. Some may need to move to another state or another industry to find a job, and they may not find a job at the same level.), which may be particularly pronounced when the [exposed party is the government](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/whistleblowers-in-business/)(Still, whistleblowers are routinely perceived as disloyal to the organization, “so what’s playing out in the federal government is disappointing … but it’s not unusual by any means,” says Schweitzer. “Moral courage is hard, and in the moment it is far easier to be complicit. This is related to a psychological construct termed pluralistic ignorance.). Therefore, receiving a pardon may increase the risk of retaliation for whistleblowers, because of which they may prefer secure incarceration or living in exile.
1.2.4.3.4.1. Pro: There have been instances of [federal whistleblowers](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article259213078.html)(A former Department of Homeland Security whistleblower whose death two years ago spurred a barrage of right-wing conspiracy theories — including from top Congressional Republicans — did, in fact, die by suicide, a California sheriff announced Tuesday. Philip Haney fatally shot himself in the chest Feb. 21, 2020 on a roadside southeast of Sacramento, the Amador County Sheriff’s Office wrote in a detailed statement. \[...\] He’d been depressed in the days before his death, a neighbor said. He even gave away his potted plants.) becoming depressed and, ultimately, killing themselves. These cases underscore the need to ensure that whistleblowers are closely monitored for mental health problems and kept secure.
1.2.4.3.4.2. Con: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has stated that he would prefer to [live in his own country](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/would-prefer-to-live-in-my-own-country-says-nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-1214645)(Despite his extraordinary situation, Snowden described his life as "normal", while adding: "I mean, I would prefer to live in my own country."\n\n"But exile is exile," he said.) rather than in exile. This likely generalizes to all whistleblowers, whose actions are motivated by the desire to [better their country](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/16/is-whistleblowing-worth-prison-or-a-life-in-exile-edward-snowden-talks-to-daniel-ellsberg)(I once read a statement by Ed Snowden that there are things worth dying for. And I read the same thing by Manning, who said she was ready to go to prison or even face a death sentence for what she was doing. And I read those comments and I thought: that is what I felt. That is right. It is worth it. Is it worth someone’s freedom or life to avert a war with North Korea? I would say unhesitatingly: “Yes, of course.” Was it worth Ed Snowden spending his life in exile to do what he did? Was it worth it for Manning, spending seven and a half years in prison? Yes, I think so. And I think they think so. And I think they are right.) at all costs.
1.2.4.3.4.3. Con: Forcing whistleblowers to live in exile would change the US from a country that provides asylum to one that creates a need for asylum. This would damage the image of the US as a country that [values and protects](https://whistleblower.org/in-the-news/huffington-post-american-whistleblowers-prison-and-exile/)(What does this say about the United States government? What does it mean that a US whistleblower must seek asylum abroad because he exposed official lies and surveillance?\n\nThe United States used to be a country where people sought asylum from persecution. \[...\] Between them, Manning and Snowden ripped away the veneer and the rhetoric about freedom and democracy here. They revealed the great breach between what our government says it’s doing and what it really does.\n\nThe country that used to offer asylum is now the country that produces people seeking protection from the American National Security State, which has been steadily growing stronger while the rest of us weren’t paying attention. \[...\]\n\nThe hypocrisy is appalling. The two Americas cannot coexist for long. They are antithetical. A government cannot applaud free speech and repress it at the same time while still preserving legitimacy.) freedom of expression.
1.2.4.3.5. Con: Pardons are not necessary to protect whistleblowers, as government employees are protected under the US [Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989](https://www.findlaw.com/employment/whistleblowers/whistleblower-protection-act-an-overview.html)(For purposes of disclosure and protection from retaliation, the law generally covers current federal employees, former federal employees, and applicants for federal employment.). Greater awareness of this law and access to [expert whistleblower lawyers](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/whistleblowers-in-business/)(“You must contact a knowledgeable whistleblower lawyer, period, before you to go internally, before you go to the SEC — before you tell your wife,” says Kohn. “These laws work. And they don’t have the publicity of others. They run counter to many stereotypes, that whistleblowers are being retaliated against and losing their careers. But under these laws the government has done a fantastic job at protecting identification.”\n\nBut contacting a lawyer, if the company finds out about it, is likely to be interpreted as an escalation of confrontation. In some sectors, confrontation is inevitable, since whistleblowing is mandatory — when a teacher learns of sexual misconduct in a school, for instance. Since 1978, New York City has required city workers to report instances of waste, fraud, abuse, or corruption, lest they face disciplinary action.) are sufficient protections.
1.2.4.4. Con: Unjust laws should be rectified through retroactive decriminalization to legitimize the respective behavior and erase the criminal history of the convicted persons. Pardons reduce the incentive for needed legislative change.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Laws are meant to reflect the collective moral and ethical will, and require more collaborative input than the power to pardon, which rests unchecked on one individual's view and interests.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Laws based on antiquated notions of morality, such as those related to [sexuality](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-05-29-mn-41287-story.html)(Lev Ivanov, a lawyer on the parliamentary Committee on Legislation, was quoted by Gardner’s organization as saying that the Supreme Soviet vote means gay men now in prison under Article 121.1 will be released immediately.\n\nHow many convicted gays are still serving terms is unclear. Rep. Barney Frank \(D-Mass.\), who is gay, visited Moscow last December to lobby for repeal of Article 121.1 and emerged from talks with Justice and Foreign Ministry officials saying the number of prisoners could run into the hundreds.) and [substance use](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Thailand-delists-marijuana-as-narcotic-releases-3-071-inmates)(Also on Thursday, Thailand began freeing 3,071 inmates who had been convicted of cannabis-related crimes. "The Corrections Department has prepared some paperwork in advance in order to facilitate the courts to issue release orders," said Justice Minister Somsak Thepsuthin.), are routinely revoked, leading to the release of inmates who have been sentenced under these laws.
1.2.4.4.2.1. Con: In many cases, the legislature does not make such laws [retroactive](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/every-25-seconds/human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states)(A significant number of states have decriminalized marijuana possession, as described in section XI. For possession of other drugs, some states have implemented reforms reducing drug sentences, though not decriminalizing. These reforms are positive developments, but in many cases they are not retroactive, so thousands of people remain incarcerated, continuing to bear the costs of a felony conviction for actions that the state no longer criminalizes or that it sanctions less severely.\n\nFor example, in 2015 Louisiana amended its marijuana laws to make the first two marijuana possession convictions misdemeanors and the third a felony punishable by up to 2 years. This means that the most Corey Ladd—serving 17 years for half an ounce of marijuana—could now face, given his two prior drug possession felonies, is 4 years. Yet he has not benefited from the new law.), and inmates convicted of now-legal acts remain incarcerated.
1.2.4.4.3. Con: Decriminalization laws and pardons are not mutually exclusive. Everett Klippert, who was imprisoned for being gay, was released following the decriminalization of gay sex in Canada, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau granted him a [full pardon](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/everett-klippert-lgbt-apology-1.4422190)(He introduced a bill that, among other things, called for the decriminalization of private, consensual homosexual acts between people over the age of 21.\n\nIn making his case for the legislation, Trudeau delivered his famous line: "There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation." \(Globe and Mail columnist Martin O'Malley had coined that line earlier in an article spurred by the Klippert case.\)\n\nTrudeau's bill became law in 1969, decriminalizing homosexuality in Canada, but Klippert wasn't released from jail until July 1971. He died in 1996 at the age of 69.\n\nLast year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Klippert would be given a full pardon.) nonetheless.
1.2.4.4.3.1. Con: Pardons are an act of [forgiveness for a criminal act](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pardons.html)(Pardons symbolize forgiveness for the crime, but usually don't wipe out guilt or expunge the conviction.), but Everett Klippert did nothing wrong; he was incarcerated for being gay. Pardoning him was, thus, symptomatic of homophobic government power over the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: In the US, pardons do not imply innocence. Instead, pardons are an expression of forgiveness by the president, implying that the individual has [admitted to the crime](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions)(A pardon is an expression of the President’s forgiveness and ordinarily is granted in recognition of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence. It does not signify innocence.).
1.2.4.4.3.1.2. Con: In Canada, the Royal Prerogative of Mercy does not inherently imply guilt; a [free pardon](https://www.legalline.ca/legal-answers/royal-prerogative-of-mercy-obtaining-a-record-suspension-before-eligibility/)(If the person is innocent, the free pardon recognizes that the conviction was in error and erases both the consequences and the record of conviction.) is given with the understanding that the conviction was erroneous.
1.2.4.4.3.2. Pro: Everett Klippert received a [pardon posthumously](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2016/03/01/trudeau-is-right-to-pardon-everett-klippert-canadas-iconic-gay-offender-editorial.html)(Over the weekend Trudeau’s office confirmed that he intends to recommend that a posthumous pardon be granted to Klippert under the “royal prerogative of mercy.”). This implies that pardons serve purposes beyond reduced punishment; specifically, they serve as political statements about [historical injustices](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/trudeau-lgbtq2-apology-pardon-would-cheer-unlikely-gay-rights-pioneer-says-nephew)(On Tuesday, Trudeau issued the apology for decades of Ottawa’s policies, practises and legislation that discriminated against LGBTQ people, while also confirming $100 million would be paid to victims who’d launched a class-action suit.) and the need for reparative social change.
1.2.4.4.4. Con: The [extenuating or mitigating circumstances](https://pardonandparole.uslegal.com/issuance-and-revocation-of-pardon/)(The executive can commute the punishment or pardon a convict without any judicial proceedings. However, a person under sentence of death must be permitted a hearing, during which the person can produce evidence to establish extenuating or mitigating circumstances that justify the commutation of the death sentence.) that warrant a pardon for one particular individual may not generalize to all individuals convicted under the respective law, so blanket revocations should not be preferred.
1.2.4.4.4.1. Con: Mitigating and extenuating circumstances are taken into [consideration when sentencing](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/mitigating-circumstances-sentencing.html). The fact that these circumstances are reconsidered as relevant and significant to warrant a pardon for one individual but not others is unfair.
1.2.4.5. Pro: President Biden has issued a [small number of pardons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2022/04/28/biden-grants-pardons-and-commutations-to-people-with-marijuana-convictions/?sh=33c4095f2b9c)(One of the pardons was related to non-violent marijuana offenses, and eight people with marijuana-related convictions received commutations. Overall, nine of the people that have been granted clemency were charged with marijuana.\n\nThis is the first time President Biden granted clemency to people with non-violent federal drug convictions on their records.\n\nSince he took office, advocates and lawmakers have pressed the administration to grant pardons to them.\n\nAccording to New York Post, over 2,700 people are in federal prisons for non-violent marijuana offenses.\n\nWhile it's not the mass pardon for people criminalized over marijuana that activists expected, it's a step toward fulfilling a campaign pledge that Biden repeatedly made while running for president.) to people convicted of nonviolent federal marijuana crimes; there is public pressure for him to grant amnesty to the 2,700 federal prisoners convicted of such crimes.
1.2.5. Pro: Pardons have a significant impact on the lives of beneficiaries and little to no impact on others. Given this dynamic, the potential benefits are worth the low risk of unwarranted pardons.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The recidivism rate is substantially lower among those who receive gubernatorial pardons than in other groups \([pp. 2, 7](https://www.plsephilly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PA-Pardon-Recidivism-Study-2008-2018-pv-August-2020.pdf)(The decade of data evaluated in this report document very low recidivism rates among all applicants for pardon and a remarkably low number of crimes subsequently committed that implicate public safety. \n...\nOf the 1,082 people who received pardons, only 1 went on to commit a crime of violence \(0.092%\). The rate was even lower among those denied pardons: only 1 of 1,955 \(0.051%\). If\npublic safety is equated with crimes of violence, there is absolutely no reason for heightened concern regarding the people who have been applying for pardons.\n...\nBy any measure, not just the benchmarks reported above, a recidivism rate of 1.1% in a sample size of over 1000 is very low.)\). This trend likely generalizes to presidential pardons as well.
1.2.5.2. Con: The rate of re-offending is [extremely high among ex-felons](https://www.futurity.org/criminal-history-recidivism-1939502-2/)(A life sentence in many states rarely means offenders will spend a lifetime behind bars. In fact, offenders sentenced for murder served 15 years on average before initial release from state prison, according to a recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report using national-level data.\n\nWhile the report did not look at recidivism, the researchers leading the new study examined data for serious offenders committed to the California Youth Authority \(now the Division of Juvenile Justice\) between 1997 and 1999. They found a prior conviction significantly increased the likelihood for the same offense by the following percentages:\n\n Homicide: 1,467 percent\n Robbery: 294 percent\n Aggravated assault: 200 percent\n Burglary: 148 percent\n Drug sales: 736 percent), particularly those who have been convicted of [serious or violent crimes](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/03/09/seven-things-to-know-about-repeat-offenders)(Offenders convicted of crimes involving guns are far more likely \(68 percent\) to end up being arrested again.). Criminals who are released after receiving a pardon are likely to exhibit a similar behavior pattern.
1.2.6. Con: Presidential pardons for US military personnel [accused of war crimes](https://theconversation.com/trump-and-the-problem-with-pardons-117725)(As a veteran, I was astonished by the recent news that President Trump may be considering pardons for U.S. military members accused or convicted of war crimes. But as a scholar who studies the U.S. military and combat ethics, I understand even more clearly the harmful long-term impact such pardons can have on the military.\n\nMy research, along with my military experience, shows that these pardons can potentially corrode the U.S. military’s culture of ethics and respect for the law of war, with effects lasting for decades.) disincentivize ethical behavior and discipline, threaten national security, and cast the US in a negative light on the global stage.
1.2.6.1. Pro: War crimes are [qualitatively different](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-there-be-war-crime-pardon-exception)(All this means that the decisions for pardoning war crimes should be distinct from those that guide pardons of any other crime in a civilian justice system, or even pardons for another non-war crime offense under the UCMJ. One of the main purposes of pardons is to erase or preclude punishment when the criminalization of behavior is unjust—and in the modern context, this has proved especially true when that behavior carries mandatory minimum punishment. But in the context of a war crime, virtually nobody can say that it is unjust to criminalize the killing of unarmed detainees without due process, and most military crimes carry no mandatory minimum sentence. Such a categorical distinction is reasonable because the pardon’s consequence signals that the president as commander-in-chief has validated, excused or justified the particular conduct that was so highly contextualized in the military combat domain.) from other crimes. Therefore, they should be [excluded from the purview](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-there-be-war-crime-pardon-exception)(First, war crimes \(at the very least those of which Behenna, Lorance and Golsteyn were accused\) implicate the well-known and universally accepted expectations, duties and rights of international law. \[...\] Second, war crimes implicate not just actions deemed criminal by customs, treaties and domestic military law. They also violate core customs, traditions, and standards of conduct and ethics that \(when obeyed\) further positive goals of self-regulation within the profession of arms. \[...\] Third, the president as the military’s commander-in-chief has a different moral, legal and practical standing in relation to both the military offender and the war crime offense itself. \[...\] For all these reasons, presidents ought to restrain their impulses when certain conditions are present. Call it the combat-incidental crime pardon exception.) of presidential pardons.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Pardoning war crimes is in itself a violation of the laws of war and [a war crime](https://www.justsecurity.org/64288/can-a-pardon-be-a-war-crime-when-pardons-themselves-violate-the-laws-of-war/)(President Donald Trump’s inclination to grant pardons to several military and contractor personnel accused or convicted of war crimes may itself be a violation of the laws of war, if not a war crime. In an extraordinary public statement issued Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross \(ICRC\) – an international organization that usually acts through confidential communications with parties to armed conflict – explains the distinction between pardons and amnesties. The ICRC does not comment on specific cases, and in this statement, does not opine on the legality, let alone the possible criminality, of any particular grant of pardon/amnesty. But the fact that the organization chose to weigh in on such a hot button issue suggests how serious a threat such action by President Trump would be to the system of international law.); this implies that war crimes are, by default, unpardonable. Codifying this exception into law should suffice as a mitigation strategy.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Placing limitations on presidential pardons would compromise the broad scope of the power, which is currently limited by only a [few exceptions](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/presidential-pardon-powers-and-limits.html)(The U.S. Constitution states, "The President … shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment." \(U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 1.\) This language gives the president broad pardoning power, with very few limitations. \(Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256 \(1974\).\) Moreover, the pardon power is the president's alone—the president's decision to grant a pardon cannot be overturned by Congress or the courts.).
1.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: Removing the president's ability to pardon war crimes would require an amendment to the US Constitution.
1.2.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Pardons for war crimes violate [international humanitarian law](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/11/1051761)(Underscoring that “victims of gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law have the right to a remedy”, Mr. Colville maintained that the pardon terminating further criminal proceedings in the case of Major Mathew Golsteyn, was “particularly troubling”.\n\nHe elaborated that remedies include equal and effective access to justice, the right to the truth, and to see perpetrators serve punishments proportionate to the seriousness of their conduct, “rather than see them absolved of responsibility”.). Therefore, regardless of practical challenges, the US has a moral imperative to exclude war crimes from the list of pardonable offenses.
1.2.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.5.
1.2.6.1.2.2. Con: Limitations are necessary precisely for the purpose of compromising the unjustifiably broad scope of the power to pardon.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Presidential pardons for war crimes are so unprecedented that they have [elicited negative reactions](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-continues-to-pardon-war-criminals-in-iraq-afghanistan/2088191)(In an extraordinary public statement issued Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross \(ICRC\) – an international organization that usually acts through confidential communications with parties to armed conflict – explains the distinction between pardons and amnesties.

But the fact that the organization chose to weigh in on such a hot button issue suggests how serious a threat such action by President Trump would be to the system of international law. Here’s what’s at stake.) from otherwise silent international agencies. Such events project the US as a violator of international human rights laws and norms.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Military experts have argued that presidential pardons for war crimes disregard the established [chain of command](https://www.justsecurity.org/64288/can-a-pardon-be-a-war-crime-when-pardons-themselves-violate-the-laws-of-war/)(In the first of these essays, a group of retired military leaders go so far as to note that as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, the President, acting in compliance with the U.S. Law of War Manual, “should not interfere with his commanders’ fulfillment of their legal duties when they face strong evidence that their subordinates have breached \[the\] law.”) and override the decisions made by the responsible military authorities.

Con: The president is the [commander-in-chief](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/commander-chief-president)(The Constitution \(Article II, section 2\) specifies that “The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several states, when called into the actual Service of the United States.”) of the armed forces, and is thereby empowered to take action on war crimes.
1.2.6.3.1.1. Con: As the commander-in-chief, the president is responsible for declaring war and, consequently, all war crimes committed by subordinates.

In that sense, pardoning a war criminal of one’s own military appears to be a conflict of interest, broadly understood.) this dual role poses, the president should not rule on such incidents.
1.2.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The president is not responsible for war crimes that are committed by individual soldiers who are [not acting under orders](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-11-what-shall-be-done-with-the-war-criminals-\(1944\)/are-superior-orders-a-legitimate-defense)(You will find in paragraph 347 of the Rules of Land Warfare the following statement: “Individuals of the armed forces will not be punished for these offenses \[violations of the customs and laws of war\] in case they are committed under the orders or sanction of their government or commanders.

1.2.6.3.1.1.2.

Otherwise, he or she can be held responsible for the crimes committed by the subordinates.) to ensure that their subordinates are aware of their humanitarian obligations; failing to hold subordinates accountable for war crimes necessitates that a superior must accept the responsibility for such crimes themself.
1.2.6.3.1.2. Pro: The president does not make decisions about pardons independently; instead, he is advised by a [team of attorneys](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/organization-mission-and-functions-manual-office-pardon-attorney)(For over 125 years, the President has relied on the Attorney General and his or her designees in the Department of Justice in exercising executive clemency power with regard to persons who have committed offenses against the United States. Within the Department, the Office of the Pardon Attorney \(OPA\) is the senior management office assigned to carry out this function, under the direction of the Deputy Attorney General. The long-standing role of Department officials advising the President on clemency matters is reflected in various public record documents dating back to the late 19th century. Moreover, since at least 1898, Presidents have adopted advisory rules to describe their programs for processing clemency applications and their directions to the Attorney General in carrying out the Department’s clemency advisory functions.). Similarly, in the case of war crimes, military authorities can be asked to provide case reports and opinions to ensure that the decision to pardon is well-informed and justified.
1.2.6.3.2. Pro: Commanders are morally and legally obligated to [punish those responsible for war crimes](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule153)(Commanders and other superiors are criminally responsible for war crimes committed by their subordinates if they knew, or had reason to know, that the subordinates were about to commit or were committing such crimes and did not take all necessary and reasonable measures in their power to prevent their commission, or if such crimes had been committed, to punish the persons responsible.). Presidents who pardon offenders absolve not only the offenders but also themselves of this [moral and legal responsibility](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-there-be-war-crime-pardon-exception)(Third, the president as the military’s commander-in-chief has a different moral, legal and practical standing in relation to both the military offender and the war crime offense itself.

While the president is clearly not legally complicit in the wrongful act, his constitutional duties imply a moral responsibility for the enabling context of the wrongful act. In that sense, pardoning a war criminal of one’s own military appears to be a conflict of interest, broadly understood.), making this a particularly egregious act.
1.2.6.4. Con: War crimes are investigated by the [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/the-court)(The Court is participating in a global fight to end impunity, and through international criminal justice, the Court aims to hold those responsible accountable for their crimes and to help prevent these crimes from happening again.), and convicts are detained in facilities [outside their home country](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2003/12/where-do-war-criminals-do-time.html)(In one of eight European countries that have entered into special agreements with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Based in The Hague, the ICTY lacks any incarceration facilities beyond a small detention unit, where defendants awaiting trial are held. And the tribunal is loath to transfer prisoners back to the Balkans, fearing violent retaliation in the prison system there. The solution has been a series of “enforcement of sentences” agreements with nations willing to host the controversial prisoners. Italy was the first to offer its penal services, in 1997, and Finland, Norway, Sweden, Austria, France, Spain, and Denmark later signed on.). Thus, presidential pardons for war crimes bear little significance.

1.2.6.4.2. Pro: While presidents can attempt to intercede on behalf of Americans being tried by another country for war crimes, they are only able to pardon [crimes against the US](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C1-3-1/ALDE_00001132/)(Article II, Section 2, Clause 1\n\nThe President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.).
1.2.6.5. Con: A [war crime](https://www.britannica.com/topic/war-crime)(The term war crime has been difficult to define with precision, and its usage has evolved constantly, particularly since the end of World War I. \[...\] In contrast to earlier definitions, modern definitions are more expansive and criminalize certain behaviours committed by civilians as well as by military personnel.) is notoriously difficult to define. In the event that an armed forces official has been unfairly convicted or sentenced for an act that is arguably not a war crime, a presidential pardon may be the only way correct the record.
1.2.7. Con: [Perceptions of corruption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953622002647)(One such cost consists in the fact that highly corrupt societies experience lower levels of trust in institutions \(Kubbe, 2014; Richey, 2010; Uslaner, 2013\).) erode [public trust](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/)(Two-thirds of adults think other Americans have little or no confidence in the federal government.

1.2.7.2. Con: Low levels of public trust can also be a result of unrealistic expectations that legal powers, loopholes, and norms will never be abused. A decline in trust is only justified if these abuses are not rectified through due process.
1.2.7.3. Pro: During his presidency, Donald Trump issued several pardons that have been [regarded as unethical](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/18/how-donald-trump-has-tested-the-ethical-limits-of-presidential-pardons/). On his last day in office alone, he pardoned several political [allies, friends, and cronies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/us/pardons-trump.html)(Mr. Trump used the power of his office last week to grant clemency to dozens of people, among them his daughter’s father-in-law, his former campaign manager and a longtime friend.

1.2.7.3.1. Pro: The pardons issued by Donald Trump were overwhelmingly for [white-collar crimes](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-worrying-potential-fundamental-economic-impact-of-trumps-pardons-2020-02-19)(The pardons announced by the Trump administration yesterday have one notable thing in common: They are all for "white-collar" crimes such as fraud and corruption. That isn’t unusual. Inevitably, presidents use pardons to free their acquaintances and allies, and fraud and corruption are the crimes of choice of those that move in those circles. At this time in American history, however, the message that sends could be used to sow distrust in capitalism itself.). This can be damaging to a capitalist economy, like the US, because it sends the implicit message that the system is broken and, therefore, untrustworthy.
1.2.7.3.2. Con: Trump used his presidential power to grant pardons [less frequently](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/22/trump-used-his-clemency-power-sparingly-despite-a-raft-of-late-pardons-and-commutations/)(Despite a burst of pardons and commutations in his last hours in office, Donald Trump used his executive clemency power less frequently than nearly every other president since the turn of the 20th century, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Justice Department data.\n\nTrump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in the White House, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. Only two other presidents since 1900 – George W. and George H.W. Bush – granted fewer acts of clemency than Trump.) than most other presidents in history. This underscores his ability to exercise restraint in the use of executive power.
1.2.7.3.2.1. Con: How frequently a president grants pardons is less important than why they choose to do so; a president who chooses to pardon only for self-serving purposes may use their executive power less frequently, but this is still unethical.
1.2.7.3.2.2. Pro: Past presidents had established a "[shabby convention](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/19/us-presidential-pardons-potted-history-donald-trump-white-house)(The exercise of this prerogative has long been a source of argument. In 1795 George Washington amnestied two men who had masterminded the Whiskey Rebellion against a federal tax on alcohol. In the 20th century, Gerald Ford pardoned a disgraced Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal.\n\nFord’s successor, Jimmy Carter, pardoned Vietnam war draft resisters. And in 1992, George HW Bush extended an amnesty to six defendants in the Reagan-era Iran-contra scandal, including the former defence secretary Caspar Weinberger, a move that in effect shut down the investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Clinton was responsible for a particularly egregious pardon. On 20 January 2001 he exonerated the billionaire fugitive Marc Rich, one of 140 pardons issued on his last day in the White House, including one given by Clinton to his brother Roger. \[...\] Trump has yet to reach these kinds of numbers, though his decisions have come under similar criticism.)" of granting pardons for self-serving purposes. Trump could have maximized his use of this established tradition, yet his numbers came nowhere close to those of his predecessors.
1.2.7.3.3. Pro: President Trump often limited the role of the Department of Justice when granting pardons by failing to acknowledge or disregarding the opinions of the [pardon attorney](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trumps-circumvention-justice-department-clemency-process)(It is not news that Trump has disregarded the role usually played by the Office of the Pardon Attorney. The Washington Post reported in February 2020 that White House advisers, led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, had taken “more direct control over pardons and commutations, with President Trump aiming to limit the role of the Justice Department in the clemency process.” And the Post reported just last week that “rather than consult with the Justice Department’s pardon attorney for recommendations, Trump has routinely subverted the process and largely favored political allies and those who are well-connected for clemency.” Lots of evidence, detailed in columns D-G in the chart, indicates that personal contacts with Trump explain a lot of the pardons.).
1.2.7.3.3.1. Con: The current process followed by the [Department of Justice](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trumps-circumvention-justice-department-clemency-process)(Many people think this Justice Department process is broken—that its criteria for clemency are misplaced or too demanding, and that the process takes far too long. Some criminal justice experts have applauded Trump for skirting the pardon attorney to grant clemency in at least a few instances.) is inefficient and, consequently, unfair to petitioners. For this reason, presidents who circumvent this process, including Trump, have been lauded by justice experts.
1.2.7.3.3.2. Con: The president is [empowered to circumvent](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trumps-circumvention-justice-department-clemency-process)(Presidents have the authority to issue pardons without consulting the Justice Department \(or anyone else\). Many prior presidents have circumvented the pardon attorney or significantly altered the process—and there’s nothing necessarily wrong with that.) the process established by the Department of Justice; therefore, Trump was well within his rights to issue pardons without inputs from the pardon attorney.
1.2.7.3.3.2.1. Con: Executive power to independently grant pardons is typically reserved for high-stakes cases that may be particularly [controversial or problematic](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trumps-circumvention-justice-department-clemency-process)(Many prior presidents have circumvented the pardon attorney or significantly altered the process—and there’s nothing necessarily wrong with that. This typically happens, for example, in clemency actions that relate to high-stakes presidential policy decisions, such as Gerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon, or Barack Obama’s clemency initiative \(which in part led the pardon attorney to resign\). Other times, the president circumvents the pardon attorney in more questionable contexts, such as many of Bill Clinton’s last-day self-serving pardons. The aim of the pardon attorney process is to regularize and standardize pardon considerations, especially for cases where the sentence is completed; to ensure integrity in the consideration of pardons; and to protect the White House from being inundated with pardon requests and from issuing unvetted and potentially controversial pardons.). Making this standard practice would compromise the efficiency of the president as well as the justice department.
1.2.7.3.3.2.2. Pro: Former [pardon attorney Deborah Leff's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/03/28/former-administration-pardon-attorney-suggests-broken-system-resignation-letter-obama/82168254/)(The Obama administration instructed Justice Department attorneys to neglect applications for presidential pardons to give priority to the Justice Department's initiative to release low-level offenders from prison, the former pardon attorney said in her resignation letter early this year.\n\nThat inaction was one of several issues that former Pardon Attorney Deborah Leff cited in her letter, which was obtained by USA TODAY after making a Freedom of Information Act request. Leff resigned in January after less than two years as the official responsible for making clemency recommendations for the president.) resignation has been partly attributed to instructions from the Obama administration to ignore presidential petitions. This implies that granting pardons is not only a right but also a responsibility that presidents cannot displace onto the justice department.
1.2.7.3.3.3. Pro: In [about 50% of the cases](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trumps-circumvention-justice-department-clemency-process)(Of 94 grants of clemency made during Trump’s tenure, 41 lacked a petition in the database \(marked “never in database” in the chart\). These include some of the most prominent and controversial grants of clemency, including those issued to Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Charles Kushner and the four Blackwater contractors—Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard. Persons in this category clearly were not recommended by the pardon attorney. This leaves 53 out of 94 cases to be explained. \n\nThere are other cases in which the person granted clemency had a petition in the system, but that petition did not support the clemency granted.), Trump granted pardons to those without a petition in the justice department's database; among the rest, the pardons negated or overrode prior actions recorded for a given petition.
1.2.7.4. Con: Legal powers are not bestowed based on their anticipated impact on public trust in institutions. Therefore, public trust should not determine the validity of pardons.
1.2.7.4.1. Pro: Each government official holds specific powers, which are necessary to perform their duties. Revoking every power that could potentially be misused would significantly limit their ability to effectively serve their purpose.
1.2.7.4.2. Con: Corruption is inherently unethical and [detrimental to national welfare](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/06/fact-sheet-u-s-strategy-on-countering-corruption/). Therefore, regardless of its impact on public trust, corruption, and enabling factors such as unchecked government powers, should be strictly regulated.
1.2.7.5. Pro: Public trust serves as an indicator of the government's ability to act in the best interests of the electorate. Therefore, low trust necessitates reparative government action, such as revocation of abusable powers.
1.2.7.5.1. Pro: Distrust in the government leads to [reduced compliance with the law](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953622002647)(In this rationale, corruption, directly influencing governance, can trigger a mechanism of distrust in institutions, potentially able to reduce compliance with government measures. Indeed, from an individual perspective, citizens who are worried about corruption may tend to reduce the value of perceived benefits associated with government choices. The existence of such a relation has been pointed out by several studies \(e.g. Marien and Hooghe, 2011; Torgler et al., 2007\). This mechanism, among others, can also play a major role in the effectiveness of government policies put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 contagion.). Revoking government powers that can be easily misused may, therefore, prevent a law-and-order crisis.
1.2.7.5.2. Con: Measurements of public trust in the government are not a reliable indicator of government performance \([p. 65](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264278219-en.pdf?expires=1658491453&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=6F53AA6788C4832E4B0D9EBD15BAF9DD)(Bouckaert and Van de Walle \(2003\) review the public administration literature with respect to trust and argue that measures of institutional trust do not adequately capture good governance, although their analysis is more discursive than empirical. Davidov and Coromina take a more empirical approach and use data from four waves of the European Social Survey to test measurement invariance across European countries, in both interpersonal and political trust. While they find limited support for scale invariance for measures of interpersonal trust \(similar to the findings of Reeskens and Hooghe, 2008, who used metric equivalence tests on the trust item in the European Social Survey 2002 and 2004 waves\), the evidence provides less support with respect to measures of political trust.)\).
1.2.7.6. Con: The less faith people have in the government, the more likely they are to become activistic and seek to change the rules of government through democratic means.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: People who have no faith in the government are unlikely to participate in democratic processes and are more likely to participate in [direct action](https://activisthandbook.org/en/tactics/direct-action)(Direct action originated as a political activist term for economic and political acts in which the actors use their power \(e.g. economic or physical\) to directly reach certain goals of interest; in contrast to those actions that appeal to others \(e.g. authorities\); by, for example, revealing an existing problem, using physical violence, highlighting an alternative, or demonstrating a possible solution.\n\nBoth direct action and actions appealing to others can include nonviolent and violent activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed offensive to the action participants.

1.2.8. Pro: Presidential pardons confer serendipitous second-order benefits on the country.
1.2.8.1. Con: Second-order benefits, such as an improved justice system, can be [directly achieved through reform](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/structural-reforms-federal-judiciary/)(There is growing recognition of the need to reform the U.S. judicial system, including the Supreme Court. Scholars, judges, and even some 2020 presidential candidates have suggested everything from expanding the number of judges who sit on the federal bench to imposing term limits on judges. The serious consideration being given to these judicial reform proposals reflects deep concerns about the institution and a recognition that reform is needed.). The nation should not have to rely on a controversial practice for unintended benefits that should already be present in a well-functioning democracy.
1.2.8.2. Pro: Abolishing the pardon power would eliminate the Thanksgiving [turkey pardon tradition](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/pardoning-the-thanksgiving-turkey)(The official "pardoning" of White House turkeys is an interesting White House tradition that has captured the imagination of the public in recent years. It is often stated that to a turkey recorded in an 1865 dispatch by White House reporter Noah Brooks was the origin for the pardoning ceremony.) that has been traced back to the Lincoln administration.
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: President Lincoln pardoned a turkey because his son [pleaded with him](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55064806)(But the idea can be tracked back to Abraham Lincoln - it's believed his son Tad begged him to spare the bird destined for the family table.) to spare the bird. The turkey pardon tradition, therefore, represents an act of compassion toward birds and animals, which is beneficial for animal welfare.
1.2.8.2.1.1. Con: Roasted turkey is delicious and an essential part of the [Thanksgiving tradition](https://www.history.com/topics/thanksgiving/history-of-thanksgiving)(In many American households, the Thanksgiving celebration has lost much of its original religious significance; instead, it now centers on cooking and sharing a bountiful meal with family and friends. Turkey, a Thanksgiving staple so ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have been on offer when the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast in 1621. \n\nToday, however, nearly 90 percent of Americans eat the bird—whether roasted, baked or deep-fried—on Thanksgiving, according to the National Turkey Federation. Other traditional foods include stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. Volunteering is a common Thanksgiving Day activity, and communities often hold food drives and host free dinners for the less fortunate.) for many Americans.
1.2.8.2.1.2. Con: The turkey pardon tradition is a product of [lobbying by the poultry industry](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-history-of-thanksgiving-and-the-presidential-turkey-pardon-explained-7068533/)(Starting in the 1870s, American presidents started receiving turkeys as gifts from different parts of the country, many of which arrived in elaborate crates and costumes, according to the White House website.\n\nIn the 1940s, farmers began sending the birds to the White House as a lobbying effort for the poultry industry.). Upholding this tradition, thus, legitimizes the animal farming industry.
1.2.8.2.1.3. Pro: The turkey pardon tradition is resonant with the importance that various cultures and religions ascribe to [public rituals demonstrating forgiveness](https://theconversation.com/what-is-behind-the-turkey-pardoning-ritual-68412)(The presidential turkey pardon draws on the long traditions of forgiveness in the world’s religions. A very public act of pardoning, as in this case, reminds us about the important role rituals themselves play in society. \[...\] Different religious traditions conceive, articulate and express forgiveness in diverse ways. \[...\] The answer can be found in the role that ritual plays in binding societies. Late 19th-century sociologist Émile Durkheim observed that all rites serve to periodically reaffirm a social group’s identity through its appeal to collective values. By observing even the most common of rituals, the community expresses what is important in its collective life. Even the seemingly inane pardoning of a turkey emphasizes that the idea that public forgiveness is possible.). In this way, this tradition fosters a sense of unity in diversity among Americans.
1.2.8.2.2. Con: The turkey pardon tradition is far too trivial to be a deciding factor in whether the presidential pardon should be abolished, especially because the pardon is granted to an arbitrarily chosen turkey.
1.2.8.2.3. Con: "[Turkey pardon](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/pardon)(A pardon is the use of executive power that exempts the individual to whom it was given from punishment.)" is a misnomer because pardons are issued to those suspected or convicted of committing a crime, specifically, a federal crime. Therefore, a turkey cannot technically be pardoned.
1.2.8.2.4. Pro: The turkey pardon illustrates a key benefit of the pardon power: as the visible head of American democracy, pardons [reinforce an image](https://books.google.com/books?id=HzfQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT28&lpg=PT28&dq=%22turkey%22+%22pardon%22+%22president%27s+image%22&source=bl&ots=lnk57fniOt&sig=ACfU3U1WfWWHniiBSFs4UwFTMF6sB4RK5g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBjeed2Of5AhUDsDEKHZIjDDMQ6AF6BAgWEAM#v=onepage&q=%22turkey%22%20%22pardon%22%20%22president's%20image%22&f=false) of the president as merciful and just.
1.2.8.2.4.1. Pro: The turkey pardon tradition allows the president to engage with the public. In 2020, [a public poll](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55064806)(US President Trump has officially pardoned a Thanksgiving turkey, in the annual White House tradition.\n\nTwo birds, Corn and Cob, were chosen to face a public vote to get the pardon. Corn won, but both of them will be spared the dinner table and retire to Iowa State University.) was conducted to determine which of two turkeys should be spared; the winner was pardoned, but both turkeys were spared as is the custom.
1.2.8.3. Pro: Unethical use of presidential pardons could paradoxically lead to the formulation of a [stronger justice system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/12/22/trump-pardons-congress-investigations-self/)(Paradoxically, it might give a boost to more effective forms of accountability than the criminal justice system — by empowering congressional investigations, in which people pardoned by Trump couldn’t decline to testify. Such investigations then could lead to reforms to prevent future abuses by presidents and their associates. \[...\] But pardoned people are by definition no longer in legal jeopardy for federal offenses, so they can no longer claim any Fifth Amendment privilege in that realm. If they refuse to speak, the legislature can flex its contempt power: At one extreme, this can involve the threat of jail time, but it can also mean daily fines calibrated to the asserted wealth of a reluctant witness. For the Trump family in particular, their zealous defense of the wallet might make them eager to comply.) by necessitating congressional investigations that would disallow corrupt cronies from pleading the Fifth.
1.3. Con: Removing the executive pardon would take away a vital constitutional [check and balance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_powers_0)(By having multiple branches of government, this system helps to ensure that no one branch is more powerful than another. Typically, this system divides the government into three branches: the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Branch. The United States federal government and forty states divide their governments into these three branches.) on the judicial branch.
1.3.1. Con: The executive and legislative branches of the government have several checks on judicial powers, so removing pardons would not lead to a significant imbalance.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Congress checks judicial power by passing laws that are binding on the SCOTUS and challenging judicial actions that are considered to be unconstitutional.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Congress has limited power to challenge judicial verdicts that pertain to the US Constitution; consequently, judicial interpretations can be updated only by [overturning precedent](https://theconversation.com/the-supreme-court-has-overturned-precedent-dozens-of-times-in-the-past-60-years-including-when-it-struck-down-legal-segregation-168052)(The court has also said that its precedents based on constitutional grounds deserve less respect than those in which the court interprets statutes or laws. The reason is that if Congress thinks the court has erred in a matter of interpreting a statute or law, it is relatively easy for them to overturn it by passing a new law. But it’s quite hard to pass a constitutional amendment, so the only real way to update the judicial understanding of the Constitution is to overrule a precedent.), so judicial power is primarily self-checked.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: When Congress passes laws that are deemed unconstitutional, they can be subjected to [judicial review](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judicial_review)(Judicial review is the idea, fundamental to the US system of government, that the actions of the executive and legislative branches of government are subject to review and possible invalidation by the judiciary. Judicial review allows the Supreme Court to take an active role in ensuring that the other branches of government abide by the constitution.) by the SCOTUS and invalidated. Ultimately, therefore, the SCOTUS has more power than Congress.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Congress can pass constitutional amendments, which essentially override judicial rulings and legal precedents.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: In theory, constitutional amendments override court decisions; however, in practice, this is not always the case, as courts often choose to [uphold their own precedents](https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/how-courts-do-and-dont-respond-to-statutory-overrides/)(Even when Congress enacts overrides, courts frequently continue to follow the prior judicial precedent. This is likely due more to information failure than willful disregard of controlling law. Nonetheless, a key aspect of the separation of powers is broken.).
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: When overrides are not implemented within the judiciary, it is typically due to poor information percolation, ambiguity of the text, or similar [methodological limitations](https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/how-courts-do-and-dont-respond-to-statutory-overrides/)(When assessing the viability of precedent, both Westlaw and Lexis consider primarily judicial signals rather than legislative signals; accordingly, it can take several years before a decision is “flagged” as having been affected by later legislation. Even when aware of an override, legal actors sometimes fail to follow the new statutory standard. Luckily, this problem is easy to address. Courts need to start their research with the statutory language itself, rather than a judicial gloss on the statutory language. Sometimes there are difficult interpretive questions regarding the scope of an override, but often it’s just a matter of carefully considering whether the operative language supersedes any aspect of a prior interpretation. By taking this straightforward approach, courts can help ensure that overrides can play their expected role in our tripartite system of government.), rather than lack of respect for the law.
1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Federal judges can be impeached by the House of Representatives pursuant to [Article I of the US Constitution](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/impeachment-and-removal-judges-explainer)(With respect to federal judges, under Article I of the United States Consti­tu­tion, the House of Repres­ent­at­ives has the power to impeach and the Senate the power to hold a trial to determ­ine whether removal is appro­pri­ate.).
1.3.1.2. Con: The pardon represents the only retroactive check on the judicial system.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The judicial system itself applies retroactive checks; the outcome of criminal cases on direct review by the Supreme Court is [retroactively applied](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-3/section-1/retroactivity-of-supreme-court-decisions)(The Court later drew a sharp distinction between criminal cases pending on direct review and cases pending on collateral review. For cases on direct review, “a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a ‘clear break’ with the past.”) to all relevant cases.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: SCOTUS errors [remain in force](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/29/undo-supreme-court-mistakes-00042970)(What happens when the Supreme Court gets it wrong?\n\nMisguided court decisions have altered the path of the nation in sadly demonstrable ways. And the question arises again from the series of sharply divisive rulings by the current court.\n\nThe short answer is: Not much can be done. In the American system, an edict from the high court is almost uniquely without check or balance. When justices err, the people suffer the consequences.) until they are reconsidered by future judges.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: While Congress may [pass new laws](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-9/clause-3/ex-post-facto-laws)(Both federal and state governments are prohibited from enacting ex post facto laws.) or impeach a judge, these actions have no retroactive impact on a verdict that has already been delivered.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The president can influence how laws are enforced. The Obama administration, for example, implemented a policy discouraging the federal prosecution of [recreational marijuana use](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/president-obama-marijuana-users-high-priority-drug-war/story?id=17946783)(President Obama says recreational users of marijuana in states that have legalized the substance should not be a "top priority" of federal law enforcement officials prosecuting the war on drugs.\n\n"We've got bigger fish to fry," Obama said of pot users in Colorado and Washington during an exclusive interview with ABC News' Barbara Walters.\n\n"It would not make sense for us to see a top priority as going after recreational users in states that have determined that it's legal," he said, invoking the same approach taken toward users of medicinal marijuana in 18 states where it's legal.) in states where it had been legalized.
1.3.2. Pro: Pardons act as a check on the judicial branch by allowing the public greater influence over the justice system.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Federal court judges are [appointed for life](https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/about-federal-judges)(Article III of the Constitution governs the appointment, tenure, and payment of Supreme Court justices, and federal circuit and district judges. These judges, often referred to as “Article III judges,” are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nArticle III states that these judges “hold their office during good behavior,” which means they have a lifetime appointment, except under very limited circumstances. Article III judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate.), but the president is elected to a [four-year term](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-presidents-only-serve-two-terms-3367979)(U.S. presidents are limited to serving two elected four-year terms in the White House and as many as two years of another president's term. That means the longest any president could serve is 10 years, though no one has been in the White House that long since Congress passed the constitutional amendment on term limits.). Thus, the pardon serves as an avenue for the electorate to influence the judicial branch.
1.3.2.2. Con: Judges are [nominated by the POTUS](https://www.uscourts.gov/faqs-federal-judges)(Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges, and district court judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate, as stated in the Constitution.) and confirmed by Congress, all of whom are elected by the people, so there are sufficient avenues for the electorate to check judicial power without presidential pardons.
1.3.2.3. Pro: When a vast majority of the electorate considers a court verdict to be unfair, the president can choose to issue a pardon. This is the most immediate and direct means by which the electorate can check judicial power.
1.3.2.4. Con: The will of the people is irrelevant in determining the guilt of a citizen who has committed a federal crime. The court of popular opinion should not influence the adjudication of criminal matters.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Since laws in a democracy are meant to embody the morals and values of society, public opinion is relevant to criminal adjudication \([p. 354](https://cbr.cba.org/index.php/cbr/article/download/2980/2973/2980)(Almost everyone must obey the law almost all the time without thinking "How likely is it that I will get caught?" or "What will it cost me if I am caught?". Almost everyone must feel that the criminal law makes claims to which one ought accede. And, it is not enough to say that people ought to obey the law because it is the law, because it reflects the social will, because social life benefits us all, because of political theories about society, authority or democracy. Such reasons may justify obedience to the law, but they do not motivate people to obey. The criminal law must in some ways embody the values which people have. Only then will they feel that the claims the law makes are ones to which they ought accede.)\).
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: The judicial system should be insulated from public opinion wherever possible to ensure that it embodies [judicial neutrality](https://sites.google.com/site/thepoliticsteacherorg/judicial-neutrality)(The principle that judges should show no political or cultural bias when reaching verdicts, making decisions and deciding on interpretations. It implies that there should be a reasonably representative mixture of members of the judiciary. Judicial impartiality implies, strictly speaking, that judges have no political sympathies or ideological leanings. Impartial judges are therefore political eunuchs.), in accordance with its mandate.
1.3.3. Con: Pardons directly circumvent the [separation of powers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/separation-of-powers)(Such a separation, it has been argued, limits the possibility of arbitrary excesses by government, since the sanction of all three branches is required for the making, executing, and administering of laws.), which prevents overreach by one branch of the government.
1.3.3.1. Con: As the pardon power is reserved exclusively to the executive branch, pardons support rather than undermine the [separation of powers](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/presidential-pardon-powers-and-limits.html)(The Constitution gives the pardon power to the executive branch alone, not the legislative branch \(Congress\) or the judicial branch \(federal courts, including the Supreme Court\). Under the constitutional separation of powers, powers reserved to one branch cannot be infringed upon by another. In other words, just as the president cannot change a law, Congress cannot overturn a presidential pardon. Likewise, the Supreme Court's power to review is limited to constitutional violations \(not politics\).).
1.3.3.2. Pro: Checks and balances are intended to allow each branch of the government to monitor and challenge powers exercised by other branches. However, pardons [cannot be overturned](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/presidential-pardon-powers-and-limits.html)(The pardon power is the president's alone—the president's decision to grant a pardon cannot be overturned by Congress or the courts.), meaning this power remains unchecked.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: This lack of effective checks on the executive branch is not unique to the presidency; for example, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled in ways that fail to provide adequate checks on US [administrative agencies](https://libguides.law.asu.edu/federalagenciesandexecutivebranch/administrativeagencies)(Federal agencies are part of the executive branch of the United States government. They are the means through which the government carries out and enforces law. Under the Administrative Procedures Act of 1946, an "agency" is any federal governmental authority other than Congress, the courts, and the military. The term "agency" is often used to refer to federal departments, sub-departments, and commissions.) \([p. 798](https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1697&context=mulr)(The governmental power wielded by administrative agencies has frequently been subjected to judicial scrutiny under the separation of powers doctrine. The governing principles laid down by the Supreme Court in recent cases have been very accommodating to administrative agencies, upholding their powers in the face of constitutional challenge, and restricting legislative and even executive checks on the exercise of such power. The Supreme Court's deference to agency power is reflected in decisions challenging the transfer of legislative and judicial power to administrative agencies. The Court's general hostility to checks on the exercise of power by administrative agencies is exemplified by decisions reviewing legislative efforts to control agencies and to free them from executive control.)\).
1.3.4. Pro: Pardons [check and balance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_powers_0)(Separation of Powers in the United States is associated with the Checks and Balances system. The Checks and Balances system provides each branch of government with individual powers to check the other branches and prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. For example, Congress has the power to create laws, the President has the power to veto them, and the Supreme Court may declare laws unconstitutional. Congress consists of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives, and can override a Presidential veto with a 2/3 vote in both houses.) judicial power by rectifying miscarriages of justice.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Pardons exemplify a core principle that guides the US legal system, namely, prioritizing protecting the innocent over punishing the guilty \([pp. 413, 415](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/159588435.pdf)(In his learned, engaging and provocative new book, George Thomas argues that a major cause of wrongful convictions in the United States is the adversary system. In his view, the primary goal of the criminal justice system is protecting the innocent, and the adversary system is not designed to achieve that goal.\n\[...\]\n It argues, first, that protecting the innocent is a more fundamental goal-and, on a pragmatic level, a more achievable goal-than accuracy more broadly stated. Second, it argues that innocence protection is more fundamental than autonomy, privacy and protection against the abuse of official power. In the main, autonomy and privacy are second-order values that we provide to all defendants because we "lack the epistemology" that permits us to know in advance which defendants are innocent.)\).
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: If a prior president has abused their power in order to [enact revenge](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/06/21/trump-deployed-government-power-against-enemies-swalwell/7733108002/)(The revelation that Trump’s Justice Department secretly seized phone and email data from his critics, his perceived political enemies and people whose loyalty he doubted – including me – fits a bigger pattern of abusing the rule of law for personal gain. Trump systematically eroded nonpartisan safeguards designed to prevent abuses of power.\n\[...\]\nHis weaponization of law enforcement was straight out of the playbooks of the dictators and despots he idolized, and it remains particularly concerning because he and his supporters believe he could become president again. \n\[...\]\n The Justice Department properly has launched an inspector general’s investigation into this abuse of subpoenas targeting Trump’s political enemies, but that won’t be enough. The inspector general can only compel cooperation from current Justice Department employees, not former Trump administration officials such as William Barr, Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein.) against political opponents, the power to pardon can allow the incoming president to provide relief.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Abuse of one presidential power should not be rectified using another abusable presidential power. Instead, the legal and systemic loopholes that permit such abuses should be identified and rectified.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Dinesh D'Souza was convicted of [campaign finance violations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-facts-history.html)(In 2014, Mr. D’Souza was accused of using straw donors to donate $20,000 to a Republican Senate candidate in New York, exceeding the personal limit of $5,000. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a $30,000 fine and five years of probation, including eight months living under supervision in a “community confinement center” in San Diego.\n\nProsecutors said he enlisted two people to donate $10,000 apiece on behalf of themselves and their spouses to Wendy E. Long, a friend from Dartmouth who lost in a landslide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat. He then reimbursed the donors in cash.), for which people are seldom prosecuted. This was politically motivated, as he was a vocal [critic of the sitting president](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-facts-history.html)(Mr. D’Souza and his lawyer have said that he was politically targeted because of his opposition to President Barack Obama, a claim that Judge Berman called “nonsense.”), Barack Obama, so Trump pardoned him.
1.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Donald Trump has claimed that campaign finance violations are not a crime, but legal experts have rubbished his statements and attributed them to [profound ignorance](https://time.com/5374619/donald-trump-campaign-finance-law-crimes/)(Legal experts were particularly baffled by the breezy way in which Trump said campaign finance violations weren’t a crime, highlighting the lack of knowledge it seems to show about the legal system as a whole. There’s no way a federal judge would let someone plea to something that wasn’t a crime,” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor. “That’s not how it works.”\n\nAdded Hasen: “It’s not only non accurate, it’s nonsensical. Why would you plead guilty to a crime that carries five years in jail if it was not a crime?”). His pardon of D'Souza likely reflects this ignorance.
1.3.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Many others, including [Barack Obama](https://www.liberty.edu/champion/2014/10/dinesh-dsouza-caught-in-crime/)(Suspending the argument over the legitimacy of D’Souza’s sentencing, this debacle displays the double standard that has developed around our political system. Today, the courts have become nothing more than an extension of Washington’s politics.\n\n“It’s a remarkably selective prosecution considering Obama raised millions of dollars under similar circumstances and donors merely faced civil fines while D’Souza is charged with felony violation of federal law,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said. \[...\]\n\nHowever, just as Cruz claimed, none of these cases have ever resulted in punishment as severe as the one D’Souza initially received.\n\nD’Souza said it best himself.\n\n“I am not above the law,” D’Souza said. “No one is. But we don’t want to live in a society where Lady Justice has one eye open and winks at her friends and casts an evil eye at her adversaries.”), have broken campaign finance laws, but they have either not been held accountable for their offenses or have faced only fines. D'Souza's sentence was far too selective, harsh, and hypocritical not to have been politically motivated.
1.3.4.1.1.2.3. Con: Donald Trump pardoned Dinesh D'Souza for evidently [political](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-trump-pardoned-dinesh-dsouzaand-may-pardon-martha-stewart)(D’Souza has long enjoyed a large following as an extreme ideologue and conspiracist; he is infamous for making lunatic accusations against the Clintons and Barack Obama. \[...\] Still, Trump’s pardon allows D’Souza to wallow in his martyrdom at the hands of Obama’s prosecutors—the former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whom Trump fired, brought the case—and the President will reap the credit from D’Souza’s admirers.) reasons: amplifying the voices of those who attack his opponents, [appealing to his voter base](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44319709)(Donald Trump is flexing his pardoning muscles again - and accomplishing several objectives.\n\nFirst of all, the move is sure to thrill right-wing true believers and anger liberals, which is something the president seems to take particular glee in doing. \[...\] The pardon also sends a message that the president is willing to use his powers to absolve those convicted of what he views as political persecution - in line with similar efforts on behalf of anti-immigration Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Bush administration staffer Scooter Libby.), and showing his allies that he has their back even if they are guilty.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Pardons cannot be considered as protecting the innocent because they do not employ any process to differentiate between those who are guilty and those who have been wrongfully convicted.
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: The US legal system is premised on protecting the innocent, and thus requires [clear and convincing evidence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/clear_and_convincing_evidence)(“Clear and convincing evidence” is a medium level burden of proof which must be met for certain convictions/judgments. This standard is a more rigorous to meet than preponderance of the evidence standard, but less rigorous standard to meet than proving evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The clear and convincing evidence standard is employed in both civil and criminal trials.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court in Colorado v. New Mexico, 467 U.S. 310 \(1984\), "clear and convincing” means that the evidence is highly and substantially more likely to be true than untrue. In other words, the fact finder must be convinced that the contention is highly probable.). Without this requirement, people can be unfairly punished.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: There are different kinds of evidence, some of which are [more convincing than others](https://lawrina.com/blog/how-much-evidence-is-needed-to-convict-someone/)(In court cases in the United States, there are generally three standards of proof necessary for a plaintiff or prosecution to prove its case. These are:\n\n1. Reasonable doubt – the highest standard;\n2. Clear and convincing evidence – a high standard and the common standard for civil cases;\n3. The preponderance of the evidence – the lowest standard of evidence needed. This standard is used for some civil cases.); direct evidence, for example, is more convincing than circumstantial evidence. However, a defendant can be found guilty based solely on [circumstantial evidence](https://www.britannica.com/topic/circumstantial-evidence)(The notion that one cannot be convicted on circumstantial evidence is, of course, false. Most criminal convictions are based on circumstantial evidence, although it must be adequate to meet established standards of proof.).
1.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: In many African countries, [mob justice is common](https://www.dw.com/en/mob-justice-in-africa-why-people-take-the-law-into-their-own-hands/a-19238120)(Eric Ponda, DW's correspondent in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa thought he was going to die. Last year, while driving back home after working on a report, a pedestrian suddenly crossed his way, to avoid him, Ponda had to quickly steer his car off the road but while doing so, he caught the left foot of the pedestrian but only mildly. Ponda stopped his car and then all hell broke loose.\n\n"They \[people\] stormed out of their houses and they really wanted to burn the car, they pushed me out of the car and started beating me up," Ponda recalled. The mob went on to steal all his equipment which he had in the car.\n\nLuckily a police car passed by. "That was my salvation. If the police had not passed by, they would have burnt me alive or set my car on fire," the DW correspondent said. "You can not prove who did it," Ponda added. In and around Mombasa, mob justice happens very often.), and people often take the law into their own hands, punishing those whom they believe to be guilty without consideration of the relevant facts. Not prioritizing protection of the innocent could lead to a similar law and order crisis in the US.
1.3.4.1.4. Con: By releasing convicted criminals into the community, pardons put innocent and vulnerable people at risk of victimization.
1.3.4.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.3.4.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.3.4.1.4.3. Pro: Peter Yarrow, who pleaded guilty to [child sex offenses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/05/17/peter-yarrow-carter-pardon-assault/)(She found out from her mother, who read in the newspaper that one of the country’s most famous folk singers, who had admitted to and been convicted of molesting her when she was barely 14, had been pardoned by President Jimmy Carter on his final full day in office in 1981.\n\nIt felt, Winter says now, “like you got sucker-punched in the gut. It’s telling him, ‘It’s okay what you did, just don’t get caught next time,’ if that makes sense.” \[...\] The first time Yarrow publicly apologized for assaulting Winter he did not include her in the list of people to whom he was sorry. The day he was sentenced for taking indecent liberties with a child, he said, “I am deeply sorry. I have hurt myself deeply. I hurt my wife and the people who love me. It was the worst mistake I have ever made.”), was invited to a high school, where he was to be honored.

1.3.4.1.5. Con: Pardons, by definition, do not protect the innocent from wrongful conviction, since accepting a pardon is an [admission of guilt](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/final-presidential-job-approval-ratings)(in Burdick v. United States, 236 U.S. 79 \(1915\), in which the Court explained the implications of acceptance. A pardon, the Court found, “carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.” Indeed, President Gerald Ford cited Burdick extensively in explaining his pardon of Richard Nixon, and at President Ford’s instruction, President Nixon was briefed about the Burdick decision and the implications of accepting the pardon. The defendant “may accept it or not, as he pleases,” and thus the “escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected, preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged transgressor, preferring death even to such certain infamy.”).
1.3.4.1.5.1. Pro: A pardon can be withheld from someone who [denies they are guilty](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pardons.html)(Pardons generally assume the offender is guilty of the underlying offense, and that he or she has been rehabilitated. So, the President or a governor might deny a pardon to an offender who denies guilt. Pardons can be revoked before they're delivered, but not after they are delivered and accepted—unless the offender fraudulently obtained it.).
1.3.4.1.5.2. Con: Whether a pardon inherently implies guilt is a contested issue; there have been a number of cases in which presidents have pardoned people they believed to be [innocent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-presidential-pardons/2018/06/06/18447f84-69ba-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html)(Burdick was about a different issue: the ability to turn down a pardon. The language about imputing and confessing guilt was just an aside — what lawyers call dicta. The court meant that, as a practical matter, because pardons make people look guilty, a recipient might not want to accept one. But pardons have no formal, legal effect of declaring guilt.\n\nIndeed, in rare cases pardons are used to exonerate people. This was Trump’s rationale for posthumously pardoning boxer Jack Johnson, the victim of a racially based railroading in 1913. Ford pardoned Iva Toguri d’Aquino \(World War II’s “Tokyo Rose”\) after “60 Minutes” revealed that she was an innocent victim of prosecutors who suborned perjured testimony in her treason case. President George H.W. Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger because he thought the former defense secretary, indicted in the Iran-contra affair, was a victim of “the criminalization of policy differences.”).
1.3.4.2. Con: Miscarriage of justice can be rectified through several means, so pardons are not necessary.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: In some countries, such as India, courts are empowered to take [suo moto action](https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/tag/miscarriage-of-justice/)(In Popular Muthiah v. State, \(2006\) 7 SCC 296 Supreme Court had observed that “High Court can exercise jurisdiction suo motu in the interest of justice. It can do so while exercising other jurisdictions such as appellate or revisional jurisdiction. No formal application for invoking inherent jurisdiction is necessary. Inherent jurisdiction can be exercised in respect of substantive as well as procedural matters. It can as well be exercised in respect of incidental or supplemental power irrespective of nature of proceedings”.) to rectify miscarriages of justice. Granting US courts similar power would promote self-correction by the judiciary.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Having [redundant](https://applyingresilience.org/en/principle-1/)(Systems with many different components \(e.g species, actors or sources of knowledge\) are generally more resilient than systems with few components. Redundancy provides ‘insurance’ within a system by allowing some components to compensate for the loss or failure of others.) methods and pathways for addressing miscarriages of justice increases the reliability and consistency of the judicial system.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: [Appealing a judicial ruling](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/types-cases/appeals) is one way to review and rectify suspected miscarriages of justice.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: Appeals are [handled within the judicial system](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/types-cases/appeals)(Most appeals are final. The court of appeals decision usually will be the final word in the case, unless it sends the case back to the trial court for additional proceedings, or the parties ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. In some cases the decision may be reviewed en banc, that is, by a larger group of judges \(usually all\) of the court of appeals for the circuit.\n\nA litigant who loses in a federal court of appeals, or in the highest court of a state, may file a petition for a "writ of certiorari," which is a document asking the Supreme Court to review the case. The Supreme Court, however, does not have to grant review. The Court typically will agree to hear a case only when it involves an unusually important legal principle, or when two or more federal appellate courts have interpreted a law differently. There are also a small number of special circumstances in which the Supreme Court is required by law to hear an appeal.) by courts of appeals and, in some cases, by the SCOTUS. This is inconsistent with the principle of checks and balances, as other branches of the government are not involved in this process.
1.3.4.2.3.1.1. Con: While individual appeals are not checked by other branches, there are significant executive and legislative checks on the judiciary. Federal judges, including court of appeals judges and Supreme Court justices, are [appointed](https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/authorized-judgeships/judgeship-appointments-president)(Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges, and district court judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate, as stated in the Constitution.) by the president, must be confirmed by the Senate, and can be [impeached](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/impeachment-and-removal-judges-explainer)(Impeach­ment is a process by which the polit­ical branches of govern­ment — usually the legis­lature — can remove judges from office. Because the impeach­ment power lies primar­ily in the hands of politi­cians, it is at times threatened for partisan reas­ons, but the impeach­ment and removal of judges is in fact rare and usually limited to grave ethical or crim­inal miscon­duct such as perjury, fraud, or conflicts of interest.\n\[...\]\nWith respect to federal judges, under Article I of the United States Consti­tu­tion, the House of Repres­ent­at­ives has the power to impeach and the Senate the power to hold a trial to determ­ine whether removal is appro­pri­ate. The House can impeach a judge with a simple major­ity vote. However, a judge may only be removed from office follow­ing a trial and a vote to convict by a two-thirds major­ity of the Senate.).
1.3.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Allowing the executive branch the opportunity to directly intercede with judicial rulings via pardons protects against judicial corruption by empowering an outside actor.
1.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: Appeals are an appropriate way to address miscarriages of justice, as they are [collaborative](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_related_education_network/how_courts_work/appeals/)(After a case is orally argued or otherwise presented for judgment, the appeals court judges will meet in conference to discuss the case. Appellate courts often issue written decisions, particularly when the decision deals with a new interpretation of the law, establishes a new precedent, etc. At the conference, one judge will be designated to write an opinion. The opinion may go through several drafts before a majority of the court agrees with it. Judges disagreeing with the majority opinion may issue a dissenting opinion. Judges agreeing with the result of a majority decision but disagreeing with the majority's reasoning may file a concurring opinion. Occasionally the appeals court will simply issue an unsigned opinion.). In contrast, pardons allow presidents to unilaterally circumvent the justice process.
1.3.4.3. Con: The justice system exists to adjudicate on legal matters. Presidential pardons circumvent justice by disregarding these determinations, which makes them unfair.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: If enacting new laws is not considered to be disregarding prior judicial determinations, there is no reason why the same reasoning should not be extended to pardons.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: A newly enacted law will dictate each subsequent verdict pronounced by the court. In contrast, a pardon selectively absolves a single person of culpability, while allowing the relevant law to apply to all other people.
1.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: If an act is decriminalized, then those who have previously been convicted of it remain subject to their original sentence. This is unfair \([p. 1](https://m4bl.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Decrim-Drugs-Sex-Work-with-reparations-Policy-Brief.pdf)(Decriminalization must be retroactive so that people currently serving time in jails and prisons can apply to be released, and people with convictions can have their records expunged so that they can be relieved of bars to access to housing, employment,\nhealth care, family, and community.)\), as it continues to hold people criminally responsible for acts that are now legal; pardons are a simple way to rectify this situation.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: A pardon is an [expression of forgiveness](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions)(A pardon is an expression of the President’s forgiveness and ordinarily is granted in recognition of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence.). Therefore, only those who have been wronged should have the moral right to pardon.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: In many states, [statements from the victims](https://www.ruaneattorneys.com/connecticut-criminal/expungement-lawyer/pardon-hearing/role-of-the-victim/)(One aspect of the hearing that tends to worry applicants is the role of the victim in a Connecticut pardon hearing. Victims of crimes that you have been found guilty of have a right to attend the pardon hearing. They also have the right to make a statement.) of a crime are taken into consideration for gubernatorial pardons. The same principle could be applied to presidential pardons.
1.3.4.3.2.2. Con: Relying upon the victims of a crime to pardon an offense would be unfeasible for [victimless crimes](https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/criminal-defense/what-are-some-examples-of-victimless-crimes.html)(A victimless crime is generally an illegal criminal act that does not have an identifiable victim. This generally includes actions that only involve the perpetrator or something voluntary between consenting adults. Victimless crimes are also known as crimes against the state that do not harm society.) or crimes that harm [society at large](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/crimes-against-public-order.html)(A crime against public order, also known as a public safety crime, is a violation which interferes with the normal operations of society. These crimes go against areas of values, norms, or customs, which are shared by the public as a whole.\n\nPublic order crimes do not require identifiable victims. An individual may be charged with a public order crime if their actions or conduct are considered to be harmful to society.).
1.3.4.3.2.3. Con: The ability to morally pardon someone does not imply the power to do so legally; thus, while forgiveness can [influence sentencing](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/magazine/can-forgiveness-play-a-role-in-criminal-justice.html), it does not absolve legal culpability.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: The primary function of the judicial branch is to [decide on cases in accordance with law](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artIII-S1-1/ALDE_00001175/)(Judicial power is the power of a court to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision. It is the right to determine actual controversies arising between diverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper jurisdiction.), rather than to pursue justice in a larger moral sense.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: The judicial branch equally enforces laws that some might consider unjust, for example, prosecution of victimless crimes or otherwise harmless drug offenses.
1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: The [judicial power of review](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/about)(Judicial review is the idea, fundamental to the US system of government, that the actions of the executive and legislative branches of government are subject to review and possible invalidation by the judiciary. Judicial review allows the Supreme Court to take an active role in ensuring that the other branches of government abide by the constitution.) is not concerned with moral justice per se, but rather with the question of whether a law is consistent with the principles of the Constitution.
1.3.4.3.3.3. Con: The preamble to the Constitution lists its purposes, including to "[establish justice](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/preamble)(We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.)." Presidential pardons represent this concern for justice within the judicial system.
1.3.4.4. Pro: The standard "beyond a reasonable doubt" is often quantified as [95% certainty](https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/taking-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt-seriously/)(If certitude \(or certainty\) is thought of as a continuum, “beyond a reasonable doubt” means that the probative force of the evidence of guilt has reached a point very far along a continuum of certainty. If the continuum were to be expressed in numerical terms with the scale of certainty running from 0 to 100, the “near certainty” that Winship and Jackson require for proof beyond a reasonable doubt would probably be reached at least above 90, preferably at 95.) of the defendant's guilt. This means that there is allowance for 5% error in the system.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: Rectifying 5% of [64,000](https://www.ussc.gov/research/data-reports/overview-federal-criminal-cases-fiscal-year-2020)(The United States Sentencing Commission received information on 64,659 federal criminal cases in which the offender was sentenced in fiscal year 2020. Among these cases, 64,565 involved an individual offender and 94 involved a corporation or other “organizational” offender.) annual convictions of federal crimes would require 3,200 pardons, but the president only issues an average of [119](https://ballotpedia.org/Executive_clemency_and_presidential_pardons)(As of July 2022, the annual average number of pardons was 119.5, while the annual average number of commutations was 56.0.) pardons each year. Thus, there are too few pardons to significantly address miscarriages of justice.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: The rate of wrongful convictions is [much lower than 5%](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/10/06/the-u-s-needs-a-federal-commission-on-wrongful-convictions-paper/)(Of the 1,385,258 people in prison for felony convictions in 2019, it is estimated one to five percent—or between 13,853 and 69,263 people—at the end of 2019 were in prison for crimes they did not commit. Yet only 143 were exonerated that year, according to the National Registry of Exonerations \(NRE\).). This figure is expected to decrease, thanks to advances in forensic science \(e.g., [DNA technology](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/embracing-technology-can_b_5405385)(Scientific and technological advances in the last two decades have revolutionized society, and the law enforcement and criminal justice arenas are no exceptions. The police rely more on sophisticated surveillance technology in an era of increased anti-narcotics and counterterrorism efforts; GPS technology allows the rapid dispatch of police closest to an emergency; and advances in forensic science, particularly DNA evidence, have resulted in more accurate convictions and exonerations.)\) and social initiatives such as the [Innocence Project](https://innocenceproject.org/about/)(The Innocence Project works to free the innocent, prevent wrongful convictions, and create fair, compassionate, and equitable systems of justice for everyone. Founded in 1992 by Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, the organization is now an independent nonprofit. Our work is guided by science and grounded in antiracism.).
1.3.4.5. Con: Presidents can only pardon federal offenses; even if presidential pardons were abolished, [gubernatorial pardons](https://pardonandparole.uslegal.com/persons-authorized-grant-pardon/)(A governor has the power to pardon or commute any sentence from the day on which a defendant is imprisoned and at any time thereafter during imprisonment.) would continue to serve as a check on non-federal judicial systems.
1.3.4.5.1. Pro: Only a tiny percentage of cases are heard by federal courts; 99.6% of the annual trials are held in state courts \([p. 1](https://iaals.du.edu/sites/default/files/documents/publications/judge_faq.pdf)(More than 100 million cases are filed each year in state trial courts, while roughly 400,000 cases are filed in\nfederal trial courts.\n\nThere are approximately 30,000 state judges, compared to only 1,700 federal judges.)\).
1.3.4.5.2. Con: Removing the presidential power to pardon may lead to the revocation of other executive powers \(e.g., power to commute a sentence\) and gubernatorial pardon powers, resulting in significantly fewer checks on judicial abuses of power.
1.3.5. Pro: As the SCOTUS becomes increasingly [political](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45632035)(Divisions at the top court are not new, as presidents tend to nominate people with the same ideological positions, but scholars say there was little evidence of partisan division until recently. \[...\] Things changed in 2010, with the retirement of John Paul Stevens, a liberal justice appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975.\n\nSince then, all of the nominations by Democrats have been liberal while all those appointed by Republicans are conservative, the first time in the court's history that ideological positions coincide with party lines, Prof Devins and Prof Baum wrote.\n\n"Today's partisan split, while unprecedented, is likely enduring."), presidential pardons have become a more valuable check and balance on judicial power.
1.3.5.1. Con: As executive politicians, presidents are not guaranteed to possess any judicial expertise. Therefore, their understanding of the legal system may be insufficient to effectively and fairly check or balance judicial power.
1.3.6. Con: Pardons are too statistically insignificant to have any overall effect on the justice system.
1.3.6.1. Con: If pardons are problematic because of their limited use, the appropriate course of action would be to expand this power rather than to remove it.
1.3.6.2. Pro: In the US, at least [three innocent people](https://time.com/wrongly-convicted/)(For the third year in a row the number of exonerations in the United States has hit a record high. A total of 166 wrongly convicted people whose convictions date as far back as 1964 were declared innocent in 2016, according to a report from the National Registry of Exonerations released Tuesday. On average, there are now over three exonerations per week—more than double the rate in 2011.) are exonerated each week. In comparison, pardons are granted to an average of [119 people per year](https://ballotpedia.org/Executive_clemency_and_presidential_pardons)(As of July 2022, the annual average number of pardons was 119.5, while the annual average number of commutations was 56.0.), regardless of culpability. Thus, exonerations are a better means to rectify miscarriages of justice.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: Exoneration of three individuals per week amounts to approximately 156 exonerations per year. This figure is not significantly higher than the average number of pardons granted per year.
1.3.6.2.2. Pro: The rate of exonerations has increased dramatically in recent years, due to increased awareness of the [injustice of wrongful convictions](https://time.com/wrongly-convicted/)(Experts say the increase in rate of exonerations can be explained, in part, by a growing trend of accountability in prosecutorial offices around the country. Twenty-nine counties, including Chicago’s Cook County, Dallas County and Brooklyn’s Kings County have adopted second-look procedures and special review units that are tasked with looking into questionable convictions. \[...\] The review units “reflect a growing recognition of the importance of the problem,” says Samuel Gross, a law professor at the University of Michigan who is co-founder and senior editor of the National Registry. “Many prosecutors, police officers and judges have learned that sending innocent people to prison is a constant risk—not a once-in-a-lifetime novelty.” \[...\] DNA has played a role in roughly a quarter of exonerations since 1989, the year it was first used to clear David Vasquez, who was falsely convicted of murder in Arlington County, Va.) as well as [improvements in forensic technology](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Exoneration-by-Year.aspx), such as DNA testing. Thus, exonerations significantly outpace pardons in rectifying wrongful convictions.
1.3.6.2.3. Pro: A wrongfully convicted and imprisoned person who has been exonerated can [sue for compensation](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/out-of-prison-and-broke-wrongly-convicted-turn-lawsuits-to-cash)(Charles Johnson got his life back when he was released from prison in 2016, after serving 22 years for a crime he didn’t commit. But he was still broke.\n\n“You have to start from scratch,” Johnson said. “From underwear to a bar of soap, you don’t have nothing.”\n\nJohnson did have one item of potential value: A lawsuit.\n\nHe sued the City of Chicago and its police department in 2018, alleging that police coerced Johnson and three others into confessing to a double murder. Prosecutors hid crucial fingerprint evidence that years later proved Johnson’s innocence, according to the suit.\n\nJuries in Chicago, dubbed “the wrongful conviction capital of America,” have handed down verdicts as high as $25 million in similar cases.), which can help them recover from their loss of income while incarcerated. Therefore, this is preferable to pardons, which are not contingent on culpability.
1.3.6.3. Con: Correcting a fraction of judicial errors is still a check on their power. The power to pardon is, therefore, necessary to uphold the principle of checks and balances.
1.4. Pro: Presidential pardons are inconsistent with a democratic system of governance.
1.4.1. Con: [Dissent](https://njsbf.org/2020/11/10/first-amendment-freedoms-allow-for-dissent/)(From the Boston Tea Party in 1773 to the Black Lives Matter Movement today, Americans have met oppression with protest. The Founding Fathers believed strongly in a citizen’s right to express dissent, preserving the right in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.) is essential to a healthy democracy. Pardons can strengthen a democracy by allowing a president to pardon dissenters who have been unfairly punished in an attempt to silence them.
1.4.1.1. Con: Convictions for [dissent and sedition](https://www.indiatoday.in/law/story/how-countries-junked-sedition-law-supreme-court-section-124a-1948152-2022-05-11)(In the USA, some sedition laws have been repealed or made a dead letter. The courts provide a wide protection to free speech.\n\nSections 2381 to 2385 of the US Code deal with treason, sedition and subversive activities advocating overthrow of government. However, the law is rarely enforced to uphold the freedom of speech.) have declined sharply in recent times, as many of the relevant laws have long been repealed. Thus, pardons are not necessary to protect the right to dissent.
1.4.1.2. Pro: President Carter pardoned [hundreds of thousands](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/21/president-carter-pardons-draft-dodgers-jan-21-1977-346493)(On this day in 1977, President Jimmy Carter, in his first full day in office, fulfilled a campaign promise by granting unconditional pardons to hundreds of thousands of men who had evaded the draft during the Vietnam War by fleeing the country or by failing to register with their Selective Service boards.) of US men who evaded being drafted for military service in Vietnam. Through this action, he sent the message that America is a country that can tolerate dissent.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Thomas Jefferson pardoned [David Brown](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-33-02-0209)(Brown’s sentence was the harshest imposed under the Sedition Act. Although he completed his prison term in December 1800, he remained in jail because he could not pay his fine. He sent petitions for pardon to John Adams in July 1800 and February 1801, but was unsuccessful on both occasions \(Smith, Freedom’s Fetters, 257–70\). Apparently unaware of the above pardon, Brown petitioned TJ for his release on 23 Mch., pleading that two years’ imprisonment was punishment enough for “an offence against a Law, which has now no existence, & which never perhaps had the decided approbation of the people over whom it was exercis’d”), an early radical who was convicted under the Sedition Act, which was later found to be [unconstitutional](https://www.britannica.com/event/Alien-and-Sedition-Acts)(With the war threat passing and the Republicans winning control of the federal government in 1800, all the Alien and Sedition Acts expired or were repealed during the next two years, except for the Alien Enemies Act, which remained in effect and was amended in 1918 to include women.).
1.4.2. Pro: In a democracy, one person should not have the power to single-handedly overturn justice.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If Congress does not codify the limits of the pardon power into law, there is little to stop the presidency from devolving into an [autocracy](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/11/15/presidential-pardon-donald-trump-not-good-idea-column/6269871002/)(The Constitution’s framers feared unbridled power and sought to check the presidency in various ways. A self-pardon would sidestep those checks, creating a zone of impunity around presidents that would threaten democracy with autocracy. \n\nThink of it. If presidents could self-pardon, they could rape, steal or murder while in office and be immune from federal prosecution. They could commit treason, conspire with another country to get elected, or take bribes from foreign governments without fear of any criminal punishment. \n\nThe framers believed they could deter presidents from committing crimes by ensuring criminal prosecution if they did. The Constitution makes it clear that impeachment and removal from office would not be a sufficient penalty, specifying that an impeached and removed president “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.”).
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The extent of the presidential power to pardon is codified in US law, specifically, under [Article II, Sec. 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii)(\[...\] he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.) of the US Constitution.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: A head of state with the absolute power to pardon themself for crimes, including [those of which they are convicted](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449816/russia-controversy-donald-trump-presidential-pardon-power-congressional-impeachment)(Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution grants the president the unqualified power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Legally, the president may pardon whomever he wants, whenever he wants, for whatever reason he wants, for any and all violations of federal law. \(He has no power to grant pardons for state-law violations.\) He may pardon crooks, cronies, and co-conspirators in his own corruption.\n\nAnd, though it goes against every principle of natural justice and the traditions of the law, he may even pardon himself.\n\nThe only limitation set forth in the Constitution is that the president cannot pardon an impeachment conviction.), is one of the hallmarks of a dictatorship, so self-pardons should be banned.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: No US president has ever attempted to [self-pardon](http://observertoday.com/news/page-one/2021/08/state-senator-wants-to-prevent-governors-from-pardoning-themselves/)(No U.S. president has ever pardoned themselves, though Presidents Richard Nixon and Donald Trump openly discussed the idea.), which indicates that this is not a major concern.
1.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Presidents may not feel the need to issue self-pardons, because history assures them that every [impeachment](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-andrew-johnson-presidents-b1789514.html)(Only three presidents in US history have been impeached by the House, including President Trump in 2019, but they were all acquitted by the Senate in the subsequent trials.) will eventually be followed by an acquittal.
1.4.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: President Nixon considered a [self-pardon](https://www.observertoday.com/news/page-one/2021/08/state-senator-wants-to-prevent-governors-from-pardoning-themselves/)(No U.S. president has ever pardoned themselves, though Presidents Richard Nixon and Donald Trump openly discussed the idea. A legal memo written in 1974 by the federal Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel days before Nixon resigned argued a president could not self-pardon under the logic that no one can judge their own case.), which he later abandoned due to contrary legal advice. This demonstrates that the legality of self-pardons is contentious.
1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Many believe that, rather than risking the uncertain outcome of a self-pardon, Nixon made a [quid pro quo deal](https://www.britannica.com/event/Watergate-Scandal/Pardon-and-aftermath)(By the time of the pardon, enough Americans had become convinced that Nixon \(named by the Watergate grand jury as an “un-indicted co-conspirator”\) was guilty of crimes and that Ford had pardoned him as quid pro quo for becoming president that the approval rating of the otherwise popular new president collapsed overnight.) with his chosen successor, Ford: the presidency in exchange for a pardon.
1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Ford justified his pardon of Nixon as an attempt to move beyond the scandal and [reunify the country](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-explains-his-pardon-of-nixon-to-congress)(When he assumed office on August 9, 1974, Ford, referring to the Watergate scandal, announced that America’s “long national nightmare” was over. There were no historical or legal precedents to guide Ford in the matter of Nixon’s pending indictment, but after much thought, he decided to give Nixon a full pardon for all offenses against the United States in order to put the tragic and disruptive scandal behind all concerned. Ford justified this decision by claiming that a long, drawn-out trial would only have further polarized the public.).
1.4.2.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: When President Nixon resigned following the Watergate scandal, Vice President Gerald Ford assumed office and [pardoned his predecessor](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/pardoning-nixon)(President Richard Nixon named Gerald Ford his vice president in 1973 after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew. A year later, Nixon himself resigned the presidency and Gerald Ford became the 38th President of the United States. Nixon had resigned as increasing evidence connected him to a burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. The enormous scandal quickly took the name of the building in which the crime took place, the Watergate. Ford wanted the country to move past the turmoil of the Watergate scandal and focus instead on important issues facing the nation, such as unemployment, inflation, and conflict. In an attempt to move the country forward, Ford decided to grant Nixon a full pardon—absolving the former president of any crimes associated with his time in the Oval Office.) fully and unconditionally, setting a dangerous precedent that enables misuse of executive power.
1.4.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Amid the Nixon self-pardon controversy, the Justice Department Office of Legal Council issued a legal memorandum stating that the president could not pardon himself \([p. 370](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1974/08/31/op-olc-supp-v001-p0370_0.pdf)("Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself")\).
1.4.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Since the US Constitution does not prohibit self-pardons, the judiciary has no basis for regarding self-pardons as unconstitutional unless an amendment prohibiting them is ratified. As such, the judicial branch does not effectively check this executive power.
1.4.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Experts differ in their interpretation of the Framers' silence on self-pardons: [presumed validity vs. presumed invalidity](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/explaining-the-presidential-self-pardon-debate)(The exact question of self-pardoning wasn’t directly addressed at the Convention. "As such, arguments derived from the intent of the Framers are speculative at best," Kalt said. "There are two likely possibilities: Self-pardons either were not considered, or their invalidity was silently presumed. A third possibility, that self-pardons were presumed valid, is less likely."\n\nKalt believed on precedent that the President doesn’t have self-pardoning powers.” The intent of the Framers, the words and themes of the Constitution they created, and the wisdom of the judges that have interpreted it all point to the same conclusion: Presidents cannot pardon themselves,” he concluded.\n\nBut Judge Richard Posner, another widely cited legal authority, said in a 1999 book about the Clinton impeachment that the question was left open by the Founders. “It has generally been inferred from the breadth of the constitutional language that the president can indeed pardon himself,” Posner argued.). Until the original intent is retrospectively elucidated through legislation, their constitutionality will remain debatable.
1.4.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: Since a self-pardon has never been attempted, their [constitutionality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/12/22/trump-pardons-congress-investigations-self/)(Trump can flirt with the idea only because the Constitution’s drafters didn’t think to address the possibility that a president would pardon himself. \(Article II speaks in general terms of a power to pardon “Offenses against the United States.”\) The topic was not directly discussed in either the Philadelphia Convention or the ratification debates. The framers believed that ambiguities in the Constitution would be resolved by amending its text, but amendments require supermajorities in both houses of Congress and the states — clearly out of reach in these days of acute partisan polarization.\n\nSo it would be up to the courts to decide whether a self-pardon was legitimate.) remains debatable. As such, any exercise of a self-pardon would likely be challenged in court, ensuring a judicial check on executive power.
1.4.2.1.2.1.4.1. Con: If self-pardons were unconstitutional, a ruling to this effect would have already been codified into law. The fact that this issue remains debatable means that the option to attempt a self-pardon remains available to the president.
1.4.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: When President Trump raised the possibility of a self-pardon, the [US Supreme Court did not comment](https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/01/the-supreme-court-and-the-presidents-pardon-power/)(The Supreme Court has not weighed in on the question whether Trump can pardon himself.) on whether such an action would be unconstitutional. This indicates that there is a lack of precedent for considering self-pardons constitutionally valid or invalid.
1.4.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: When Justice Barrett was nominated by President Trump to serve as a [SCOTUS judge](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-president-pardon-trump-b1039510.html)(Ms Barrett on Wednesday refused to say whether a president could pardon himself if he were charged with a crime because there is no case law on that topic and it’s something that could hypothetically come before her on the high court.\n\n“It’s not one in which I can offer a view,” she said in response to a question from Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont.), she refused to comment on the constitutionality of self-pardons.
1.4.2.1.2.1.4.2.2. Con: The SCOTUS can only rule on cases or laws that are [brought before it](https://www.theclassroom.com/three-wings-government-13664.html)(It is important to note that the Supreme Court can only rule on actual cases, which limits its power as it cannot give opinions on issues not brought before the court.), and cannot proactively issue rulings.
1.4.2.1.2.2. Con: The belief that the presidential power to pardon is absolute is misguided. When a pardon violates criminal laws, [federal prosecutors and Congress](https://www.justsecurity.org/73976/pardongate-2-0-prosecutors-and-congress-investigated-clintons-pardons-the-same-should-happen-to-trump/)(President Donald Trump apparently holds the misguided belief that his pardon power is “absolute.” But while the pardon power is expansive in scope, that power is nevertheless constrained by the Constitution and federal criminal laws, including anti-bribery and obstruction laws. To a lesser extent, the pardon power has also been constrained by a historic abidance to its noble purpose—bestowing grace and mercy in the face of injustice—and past presidents’ general refusal to abuse the power as a tool for self-gain. However, when a president’s pardon potentially violates the law or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the power, both federal prosecutors and Congress can and should step in.) are empowered to take action.
1.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: Dictatorial heads of state have taken steps to ensure that they and their families have [legal immunity](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/ny-vladimir-putin-signs-bill-presidents-pardon-prosecution-immunity-20201223-qo3pel676bhizgszr2opuucu5i-story.html)(The legislation also means former presidents and their families would not have to answer to law enforcement or allow searches of their persons or properties. Under current Russian law, a president is immune from prosecution related to activities conducted while in office, but can reportedly be tried for treason or crimes deemed grave by the courts.\n\nThe Guardian reports that the legislation Putin rubber-stamped this week includes a lifetime seat in Russia’s senate, which would grant him immunity from those charges as well.) for past actions and future wrongdoings.
1.4.2.1.2.4. Pro: [President Nixon](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/attytood/When-the-president-does-it-that-means-it-is-not-illegal.html)("When the president does it, that means it is not illegal," Nixon told his interviewer. Those words were largely seen by the American public -- which continued to hold the ex-president in low esteem -- as a symbol of his unbowed arrogance. Most citizens still wanted to believe that no American citizen, not even the president, is above the law. Folks clung to this idea even though the actual evidence was mixed: People boasted that "the system worked" when Nixon was forced to resign, on the brink of certain impeachment -- but the pardon that was issued to Nixon by then-president Gerald Ford weeks later suggested that presidential justice remains elusive.), who once [considered a self-pardon](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-history-of-the-pardon-power)(Richard Nixon did consider a self-pardon in 1974. At that time, the Justice Department produced a memorandum that concluded the president did not have the constitutional power to issue a self-pardon.), famously stated, "When the president does it, that means it is not illegal," implying that presidents are above the law. However, in a democracy, [no one is above the law](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/no-president-is-above-the-law)(Yes, Congress has a constitutional obligation to impeach the President when he violates the law. But lawyers for previous presidents have used this constitutional duty to argue that the only way the President can be held accountable for criminal behavior is through impeachment.\n\nThis argument hasn’t always been accepted by the federal government, and it’s been criticized by scores of constitutional experts, but it’s still the official policy of the Department of Justice.\n\nThat policy, first advanced in an opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel during Watergate and backed up by an additional memo in 2000, is why Robert Mueller couldn’t indict President Trump for obstruction of justice.\n\nCongress should make it clear that the President can be held accountable for violating the law, just like everyone else.).
1.4.2.1.2.5. Con: A ban on self-pardons would be futile, due to the existence of [legal workarounds](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/explaining-the-presidential-self-pardon-debate)(But just before Nixon’s resignation, the Justice Department Office of Legal Council issued its own memo on the subject, on August 5, 1974. “Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself,” said Mary C. Lawton, Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\nThat didn’t mean that a President couldn't find a way to receive a pardon and continue in office. “A different approach to the pardoning problem could be taken under Section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the President declared that he was temporarily unable to perform the duties of his office, the Vice President would become Acting President and as such he could pardon the President. Thereafter the President could either resign or resume the duties of his office,” Lawton said.). Following resignation or removal from office, the vice-president, who assumes office as president, can simply pardon their predecessor.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1. Con: An incumbent who pardons an impeached president may be perceived as corrupt by the general public, resulting in [the loss of future elections](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/pardoning-nixon)(In an attempt to move the country forward, Ford decided to grant Nixon a full pardon—absolving the former president of any crimes associated with his time in the Oval Office. Ford faced the reality that his controversial decision would elicit negative public and political responses and likely cost him votes in the 1976 presidential election.). Thus, in tandem with the threat of impeachment, the electorate holds presidents accountable.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Pardoning impeached President Nixon likely cost President Gerald Ford the [presidential election in 1976](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nixon-pardon-defined-ford-presidency/)(On a September Sunday in 1974, President Ford told the nation it was time to "shut and seal this book" of Watergate by pardoning his predecessor, Richard Nixon.\n\nFord's stunning announcement may also have sealed his political fate, since the nation's only president never elected to nationwide office — a Republican — lost the 1976 election to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Many said the unpopular pardon was a cause of Ford's defeat.), because this exercise of executive power was unpopular among the electorate.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.2. Con: Ford's pardon of Nixon was the only pardon granted to a president in US history. This unprecedented event cannot, therefore, be used to draw a general conclusion that pardoning an impeached president will lead to losses in future elections.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Unlike every other president in US history, [Gerald Ford was not elected](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/gerald-fords-unique-role-in-american-history)(Ford took the oath of office on August 9, 1974, after Richard Nixon’s resignation amid the Watergate scandal. Ford became the first, and so far the only, person to become President without winning a general election for President or Vice President.), but selected, to assume office. His loss in the 1976 elections may simply reflect the fact that he was not elected by popular choice in the first place.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.2.2. Con: Ford's pardon of Nixon was controversial and divisive, [even among Republicans](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/20/richard-nixon-pardon-gerald-ford-donald-rumsfeld-excerpt-218402/)(Ford’s bold, continuing efforts to pull his administration out of the Watergate thicket was a lingering frustration for him, particularly in that his new administration faced so many pressing national concerns—foreign crises, arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union and a sluggish economy that had begun to worsen. But he had already made the decision that would place an indelible mark on his presidential legacy, a sacrifice that risked his own future in order to salvage the nation from one of the most painful and divisive periods in our history. Yet as hard as Ford tried to exorcise the ghost of Watergate, it would continue to linger for the rest of his presidency.). Therefore, a prudent desire to avoid similar personal, political, and electoral ramifications may be precisely what motivates presidents to avoid repeating history.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.2.3. Pro: 1976 was a "[great year to let the other party win](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-dec-31-op-chait31-story.html)(Carter was a mediocre president, and he came into office under terrible conditions -- stagflation, an energy crisis, the wake of a losing war -- under which no president could have succeeded. His inevitable failure paved the way for Americans to elect Ronald Reagan. And after Reagan, a new orthodoxy took hold in the Republican Party that celebrated deficit-financed tax cuts, ultra-nationalistic foreign policy and a cynical culture war.\n\nIf Ford had managed to win in 1976, it would have been Republicans who were saddled with the stagflation mess. And a Democrat probably would have won the presidency in 1980 and presided over the expansion that followed. \[...\]\n\nSo we can now see that 1976 was a great year to let the other party win. With the passions of Watergate running high, the election seemed really important, but it probably had negative importance: Democrats lost by winning.)" due to the poor state of the country that the successor would inherit and need to manage. Thus, neither candidate may have been strongly motivated to win the election.
1.4.2.1.2.5.2. Pro: Impeachment has [no retroactive effect](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/verify-impeachment-does-not-undo-presidential-pardons/507-aaf8978e-5282-4147-ad47-65ca3b7d0458)(So, a pardoned person will remain pardoned even if a president is impeached and convicted. Once the paperwork is complete and the person is officially pardoned by the president, there is no precedent for undoing it.) on prior pardons. Thus, a president can both pardon a criminal crony and be pardoned by the incumbent, resulting in a dual circumvention of justice.
1.4.2.1.2.6. Con: The ability of the head of state to pardon themself is [a necessary but not a sufficient condition](https://academy4sc.org/video/necessary-vs-sufficient-under-the-right-conditions/)(First, let’s look at a necessary condition. A primary qualification for jury duty in Massachusetts is being at least eighteen years old. Therefore, if someone is serving on a jury in a Massachusetts court, you know that they are at least eighteen years old since this age minimum is a necessary condition for serving jury duty in that state. Being eighteen is not sufficient alone to serve on a jury, though, since jurors must also be free of conflicting interests in the attendant case.\n\nNow let’s consider a sufficient condition. Kicking a soccer ball into the net is sufficient for scoring a goal since a goal is defined by the ball crossing the goal line and going into the net via a legal touch. By that definition, the necessary condition for scoring a goal is that the ball crosses the goal line. Kicking the ball into the net is not necessary for scoring a goal, though, because you could also use your head to score.) of dictatorship.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Even within democratic systems, laws that grant undue power to the executive branch undermine the proper [function of democracy](https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/04/tyranny-american-political-discourse-shaun-rieley-timeless.html)(Hence the rise of legislation that cedes the undue discretionary power to the executive branch—which governs by fiat—leaving the legislative branch to play a role in oversight, rather than making true law.\n\nHas tyranny come to the United States, then? There is, it seems, a strong case to be made that we are at least creeping ever closer. For if the rule of law is undermined, political rule will then be, by definition, tyrannical.) and tend towards [tyranny](https://theconversation.com/why-tyranny-could-be-the-inevitable-outcome-of-democracy-126158)(Plato, one of the earliest thinkers and writers about democracy, predicted that letting people govern themselves would eventually lead the masses to support the rule of tyrants.\n\nWhen I tell my college-level philosophy students that in about 380 B.C. he asked “does not tyranny spring from democracy,” they’re sometimes surprised, thinking it’s a shocking connection.\n...\nDemagogues’ manipulation of the Athenian people left a legacy of instability, bloodshed and genocidal warfare, described in Thucydides’ history.\n\nThat record is why Socrates – before being sentenced to death by democratic vote – chastised the Athenian democracy for its elevation of popular opinion at the expense of truth. Greece’s bloody history is also why Plato associated democracy with tyranny in Book VIII of “The Republic.” It was a democracy without constraint against the worst impulses of the majority.).
1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: Pardons have existed since the [founding of the US](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-history-of-the-pardon-power), yet the country has not abandoned its democratic institutions for tyrannical alternatives. This is proof that such fears are unfounded.
1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: Pardons which have no legal or moral basis and require no explanation are too powerful to be considered safe in a society governed by its people.
1.4.2.2. Con: Presidential pardons mitigate the risk of judicial tyranny by ensuring that federal court verdicts and [common law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/common_law)(Common law is law that is derived from judicial decisions instead of from statutes. American courts originally fashioned common law rules based on English common law until the American legal system was sufficiently mature to create common law rules either from direct precedent or by analogy to comparable areas of decided law.\n...\nThough most common law is found at the state level, there is a limited body of federal common law--that is, rules created and applied by federal courts absent any controlling federal statute. In the 2020 Supreme Court opinion Rodriguez v. FDIC, a unanimous Court quoted an earlier decision to explain that federal "common lawmaking must be 'necessary to protect uniquely federal interests'" in striking down a federal common law rule addressing the distribution of corporate tax refunds.) are consistent with underlying norms and shared values among citizens.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Presidents have, at times, granted pardons completely at odds with social norms and values, such as pardoning [convicted terrorists](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/final_faln_rpt2.htm)(In the case of the clemency offer to the sixteen FALN and Macheteros terrorists, the President has yet to provide a full and accurate explanation of his actions. The many inconsistencies between fact and the President’s public positions create a presumption of impropriety. The President purposefully misrepresented facts, or facts were withheld from him. Either possibility is unacceptable.\n\[...\]\nThe Committee also finds that the offer of clemency to unrepentant terrorists who have done nothing to discourage violence or solve unsolved crimes diminishes our moral authority in the fight against international terrorism. The appearance that the United States is willing to undercut its own legal system in response to political pressure is an unfortunate precedent.).
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Federal judges are not elected, so they are less subject to the effects of [popular opinion](https://www.ushistory.org/gov/9e.asp)(Not everyone agrees on how much power the judicial branch should have. After all, federal judges and justices are appointed, not elected. As most Americans believe in democracy, shouldn't elected officials run the country?\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps American government would be fairer if judges had even more power. Because they do not have to worry about reelection, they are relieved of the outside pressure of public opinion.\n\[...\]\nSupporters of judicial restraint point out that appointed judges are immune to public opinion, and if they abandon their role as careful and cautious interpreters of the Constitution, they become unelected legislators. According to Justice Antonin Scalia, "The Constitution is not an empty bottle....It is like a statute, and the meaning doesn't change."); judicial precedent can easily stand at odds with broader social opinion about an issue. In such cases, a president can step in to ensure that the public will is represented.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Court verdicts are based on democratically-enacted legislation, which presidents override when they pardon someone.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Since court verdicts enforce laws that are enacted by legislators acting as representatives of the public, such laws represent the [will of the people](https://books.google.com/books?id=vuNmzv8L4IgC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=%22laws+represent+the+will+of+the+people%22&source=bl&ots=rqPwh_iqD5&sig=ACfU3U3Cshn8uyEVNx2E6Q7ZjKdUfn61uw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ8Izru4f6AhV-AzQIHYBUB-sQ6AF6BAgaEAM#v=onepage&q=%22laws%20represent%20the%20will%20of%20the%20people%22&f=false).
1.4.2.3.2. Con: Presidents are elected through a democratic process. Thus, the collective will of the electorate empowers presidents to wield the pardon power to address matters under federal jurisdiction.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Con: The president is appointed by the [electoral college](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-does-the-electoral-college-work)(American voters go to the polls on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November, but the ballots that they cast do not directly elect the president. Instead, the will of the voters is reflected in the actions of state electors. These electors are selected by political parties at the state level and in many cases are bound by law to vote in a way that is consistent with the results of the popular vote. In 48 states, electoral votes are apportioned on a winner-takes-all basis, while Maine and Nebraska allocate electoral votes by congressional district, with two additional votes reserved for the statewide winner.), rather than by popular vote.
1.4.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The electoral college is [fundamentally undemocratic](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/12315574/electoral-college-explained-presidential-elections-2016)(The electoral college is, essentially, a vestigial structure — a leftover from a bygone era in which the founding fathers specifically did not want a nationwide vote of the American people to choose their next president.\n\nInstead, the framers gave a small, lucky group of people called the “electors” the power to make that choice. These would be some upstanding citizens chosen by the various states, who would make up their own minds on who should be the president \(they’d have to vote on the same day in their respective home states, to make it tougher for them to coordinate with each other\).). The Founding Fathers believed that the power to elect the president should not be in the hands of the citizens, but a select few.
1.4.2.3.2.1.2. Con: In 54 of the 59 presidential elections to date, the elected president also won [the popular vote](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/5-46-presidents-came-office-without-winning-national-popular-vote).
1.4.2.3.2.1.3. Con: Electors in each state are expected to vote in line with the [will of the majority](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-does-the-electoral-college-work)(These electors are selected by political parties at the state level and in many cases are bound by law to vote in a way that is consistent with the results of the popular vote.) of the people in their respective state; therefore, it is not incorrect to say that citizens elect their president.
1.4.2.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Electors overwhelmingly vote in line with their party; there have only been 165 [faithless electors](https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_electors)(Overwhelmingly, electors in the Electoral College have faithfully voted for their party’s presidential and vice presidential nominees. However, occasionally they do not. Electors who cast a vote for someone other than their party’s nominee are often called “faithless electors.”\n\[...\]\nAltogether, there have been 23,507 electoral votes counted across 58 presidential elections. Only 90 electors have cast “deviant” votes, not ordinary votes for the presidential nominee of the elector’s political party. \n\[...\]\nThere have also been 75 incidents of electors casting faithful votes for president but casting some sort of deviant vote for vice president. No such incident has ever changed the outcome for vice president. These are described more fully below. \[...\] Combining these shows that a total of 165 electors have cast deviant votes of some sort, either for either president or vice president or both.) in US history, and they have never affected the outcome of an election.
1.4.2.3.2.1.3.2. Con: The possibility of electors voting against their own party renders the electoral college fundamentally undemocratic. This can be contrasted with elections in countries like the UK, which follow the [first-past-the-post system](https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/daily/2017/06/02/news/here-are-the-key-differences-between-uk-and-us-elections-1043294/)(The UK uses a First Past The Post electoral system where the country is divided into 650 voting counties, called constituencies, each represented by a corresponding Member of Parliament \(MP\).\n\nOn polling day, voters place an X next to their choice and the candidate with the most votes at the end of the night’s count is then instated as that constituency’s MP.\n\nThe party with the most elected MPs is then left to form the ruling Government \(the Executive\) and that party’s leader becomes prime minister. \[...\] In America, presidents are decided by the electoral college system whereby every vote for a particular presidential hopeful actually goes to a group of people known as “electors” – each of whom belongs to a particular party and pledges to vote for that party’s candidate.\n\nEach state is represented by a different number of electors, depending on the size of that state’s population.).
1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: The president and vice president are the only representatives who are elected by the entire country, so they have the broadest possible mandate to exercise authority.
1.4.2.3.2.3. Con: The president may not always choose to pardon in line with [the will of the nation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/chinews-mtblog-2007-03-pardons_are_not_popular-story.html)(The Gallup Organization, reopening its archives, has found that "the public has generally opposed high-profile presidential pardons in the recent past.'' In the long-run, they may prove less harmful, however. "The evidence is more mixed,'' Gallup reports, "as to how the pardons affect the president's image in the years after they have been issued.''\n\nAmericans opposed three big pardons, Gallup says: President Gerald Ford 's pardon of former president Richard Nixon, President George H. W. Bush's pardon of former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and President Bill Clinton's pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich. Opposition to these pardons also "had an immediate impact on the public's overall assessment of Ford and Clinton,'' Gallup's Frank Newport and Joseph Carroll report. "Ford's job approval ratings fell sharply and Clinton's favorable ratings fell dramatically in the short term.''). In such instances, pardons do not represent the will of the electorate.
1.4.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The fact that the president is elected by the collective will of the nation does not bind him or her to make every decision in accordance with the will of the nation. The electorate understands this when they cast their vote.
1.4.2.3.2.3.1.1. Con: The fact that a president must be popular to secure re-election discourages them from issuing unpopular pardons.
1.4.2.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Presidents are [often re-elected](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/09/politics/btn-second-term-presidents/index.html) despite [low approval ratings](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/final-presidential-job-approval-ratings) and popularity.
1.4.2.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: An unpopular pardon will not inherently negate the will of the electorate, who have agreed to a four-year presidency barring impeachable offenses.
1.4.2.3.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: A number of presidents have had [disapproval ratings over 50%](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/final-presidential-job-approval-ratings) yet completed their term in office.
1.4.2.3.2.3.2. Pro: A vast majority of Americans [oppose self-pardons](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/most-americans-oppose-presidential-self-pardons-poll-finds)(By a wide margin, Americans believe Trump is wrong: 85 percent think it would be unacceptable for presidents to pardon themselves if charged with a crime, and 76 percent think Congress should take steps to remove a president from office if they did so.) and [pardons for political allies](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/434756-poll-76-percent-of-americans-oppose-trump-pardoning-former/)(Seventy-six percent of voters contacted for the March 16-17 survey said they opposed Trump extending executive pardons to his former political aides. Only 24 percent said they would approve of the pardons.) and endorse removal of the president from office for such misuses of executive power.
1.4.2.4. Con: In many federal cases, a [single District Judge](https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/federal-courts)(The district courts are the general trial courts of the federal court system. Each district court has at least one United States District Judge, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a life term. District courts handle trials within the federal court system – both civil and criminal. The districts are the same as those for the U.S. Attorneys, and the U.S. Attorney is the primary prosecutor for the federal government in his or her respective area.\n\nDistrict court judges are responsible for managing the court and supervising the court’s employees. They are able to continue to serve so long as they maintain “good behavior,” and they can be impeached and removed by Congress. There are over 670 district court judges nationwide.) dispenses justice; there is no particular reason why their decisions should not be singlehandedly overturned.
1.4.3. Con: The president's right to pardon is consistent with widely agreed-upon international norms governing executive powers.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Pardon powers are consistent with the executive branch's responsibility to [carry out and enforce the law](https://www.usa.gov/branches-of-government)(The executive branch carries out and enforces laws. It includes the president, vice president, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.).
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The executive branch has the power to [issue executive orders](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/)(Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.), which are essentially laws and cannot be overturned by the legislative branch.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Pardons, by definition, allow presidents to make exceptions to the law; this is inconsistent with their remit to enforce the law.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: In [Ex parte Garland](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/333/)(The power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon the President is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. The power is not subject to legislative control.\n\nA pardon reaches the punishment prescribed for an offence and the guilt of the offender. If granted before conviction, it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities consequent upon conviction from attaching; if granted after conviction, it removes the penalties and disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights. It gives him a new credit and capacity. There is only this limitation to its operation: it does not restore offices forfeited, or property of interests vested in others in consequence of the conviction and judgment.), the SCOTUS ruled that pardons can be granted at any time, even prior to conviction. This could disincentivize the investigation, discovery, and documentation of criminal activity, thereby hindering law enforcement.
1.4.3.2. Con: The presidential power to pardon is an anachronistic artifact of [royal pardons](https://www.ibanet.org/article/465431E6-8846-4A89-BA0A-6A8B85E5ED1D)(The pardon flourished in medieval Europe as a tool of the monarch, though even by that time it had enjoyed a lengthy history, including use in antiquity by the Greeks. During the 18th century, the Royal prerogative of mercy was used to fill gaps in the legal system \(such as the absence of a defence of insanity\), as well as being an important instrument in the pacification of civil strife. As Justice Robert Sharpe, a judge of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, says: ‘the traditional view was that pardons were a safety valve that allowed for consideration of mercy and compassion in cases where the law failed to reflect understandable human frailties and where it would be dangerous or inappropriate for the law do to so formally.’), such as the [royal prerogative of mercy](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice-points/the-royal-prerogative-of-mercy/5052062.article)(In the English tradition, the RPM is one of the historic royal prerogatives reserved to the British monarch, in which she can grant pardons to persons convicted of criminal offences. The original use of the RPM arose as a result of the imposition of the death sentence; the RPM then being used to commute such a sentence to a less draconian form of punishment. Today, it can be used to change any sentence or penalty imposed upon a person.) enjoyed by the British monarch. This type of monarchic practice runs counter to the principles of democracy.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: [Constitutional monarchies](https://www.royal.uk/role-monarchy)(In a monarchy, a king or queen is Head of State. The British Monarchy is known as a constitutional monarchy. This means that, while The Sovereign is Head of State, the ability to make and pass legislation resides with an elected Parliament.\n\nAlthough The Sovereign no longer has a political or executive role, he or she continues to play an important part in the life of the nation.\n\nAs Head of State, The Monarch undertakes constitutional and representational duties which have developed over one thousand years of history. In addition to these State duties, The Monarch has a less formal role as 'Head of Nation'. The Sovereign acts as a focus for national identity, unity and pride; gives a sense of stability and continuity; officially recognises success and excellence; and supports the ideal of voluntary service.), such as Great Britain, meaningfully integrate monarchic and democratic principles of governance. Pardons can similarly be conceptualized as an integration of monarchic power into a democratic system.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: A monarch is [above the law](https://britishheritage.com/royals/queen-elizabeth-murder)(Should Queen Elizabeth ever commit a crime, the term 'sovereign immunity' will really come to the fore. Sovereign immunity means that as head of the state Queen Elizabeth 'cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution'.\n\nAs well as this, the Queen also benefits from diplomatic immunity, meaning she can commit a crime just about anywhere in the world and get away with it!\n\nThe sovereign immunity that the Queen benefits from even goes so far as to ensure that she cannot be subject to any civil proceedings, so she can't be sued.\n\nAs well as this she cannot be interviewed by the police and would never have to testify in court should that be her wish.\n\nThe Queen's word in the United Kingdom is law. She could conceivably walk into any shop in the whole of Britain and loot the place should she wish. Simply put, the Queen is above all authority and must surely be one of the most powerful people on earth for that fact alone.), so it makes sense for a king or queen to have the power to forgive someone who breaks the law. In contrast, a president is [not above the law](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/supreme-court-correctly-rules-that-trump-is-not-above-the-law)(Donald Trump, who often behaves as though he has never read the Constitution, received an important civics lesson from the Supreme Court yesterday when it ruled in two cases involving his personal financial records, including tax returns that he has long sought to conceal, that there is an important difference between being president and king. As the Supreme Court emphatically – and on this point, unanimously – reminded us all, the president may occupy the highest office in the land, but he is not above the law.), so they should not be allowed to override the law.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: Liberal constitutionalism recognizes the importance of the sovereign being able to make an exception to the law \([pp. 11-12](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=207103102008006127087027002087081077015002001000090086121025065112086092029100095091030096049125038001052020080097030103126006046002046043009065010116078097122099049080048111077089108093112102097105102114126127103127066105093025090122117113112110007&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)(Finally, both the exception and the pardon—like the other attributes of sovereignty—partake of theological roots. According to Schmitt, “\[t\]he exception in jurisprudence is analogous to the miracle in theology.” \[...\] The pardon itself, as an act of free gift, or grace, is likewise associated with the sovereignty of a Christian\ngod, whose mercy displays a power even greater than that of judgement.)\).
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The president is intended to function as an officer rather than as a sovereign \([p. 89](https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/89-93_Online.pdf)(The phrase “faithful execution” itself appears both in the clause requiring that the President “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”4 and in the constitutional oath of office by which the President must proclaim that “I do solemnly swear \(or affirm\) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.” Faithful Execution and Article II carefully traces the source of that language, finding that it emerges not from rhetoric surrounding the king, but\ninstead from requirements placed upon mid-level officers. \n Fundamentally, Faithful Execution and Article II supports a vision of the\npresidency that emphasizes its status as an office and rejects the residues\nof sovereignty.)\) and is entitled to rule by the will of the people rather than the [grace of God](https://www.britannica.com/topic/divine-right-of-kings)(A political doctrine in defense of monarchical absolutism, which asserted that kings derived their authority from God and could not therefore be held accountable for their actions by any earthly authority such as a parliament. Originating in Europe, the divine-right theory can be traced to the medieval conception of God’s award of temporal power to the political ruler, paralleling the award of spiritual power to the church. By the 16th and 17th centuries, however, the new national monarchs were asserting their authority in matters of both church and state.). Therefore, the presidential power to pardon should be limited.
1.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Following international norms confers diplomatic advantages. Therefore, unless pardons become problematic, there is no reason for the US to abolish them.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Presidents can offer to pardon foreign nationals who have been convicted of federal crimes to gain diplomatic leverage.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: The president should not be allowed to pardon non-US citizens; the Constitution is intended to protect the rights of citizens.
1.4.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The US Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution as extending the [same rights and protections](https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/t-he-constitutional-rights-of-noncitizens/)(Immigration restrictionists sometimes claim that noncitizens have no rights under the Constitution, and that the US government is therefore free to deal with them in whatever way it wants. At least as a general rule, this claim is simply false.\nNoncitizens undeniably have a wide range of rights under the Constitution. Indeed, within the borders of the United States, they have most of the same rights as citizens do, and longstanding Supreme Court precedent bans most state laws discriminating against noncitizens. There is little if any serious controversy among experts over this matter.) to anyone within US borders.
1.4.3.4.1.1.2. Con: The US Constitution outlines a few [limits on pardon powers](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-2/clause-1/scope-of-the-pardon-power)(The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.), but none of them pertain to citizenship or national origin. Any limitation to this effect would, therefore, be unconstitutional.
1.4.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: The Department of Justice restricts deportees from [applying for pardons](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/06/02/groups-urge-president-biden-include-immigration-pardon-process)(Currently, people who have been deported are told they cannot even apply for a pardon, even if a pardon is the only relief that would allow them to return home.), possibly because this would mean allowing those with a criminal history to re-enter the country. This norm should be codified into law.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Pro: Pardons can be a valuable tool in negotiations involving defense, national security, or foreign policy.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: In the past, pardons have been granted to [immigrants and foreign nationals](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/woman-in-hawaii-receives-rare-obama-pardon-088342)(Obama pardoned An Na Peng of Honolulu for her 1996 conviction on a single felony charge of conspiracy to defraud the Immigration and Nautraliztion Service. \[...\]\n\nPeng, a Chinese citizen, apparently sought the pardon to avoid the possibility of being deported. She’s the mother of two children, one of whom is autistic, according to court records. \[...\] The last presidential pardon known to have been granted to affect immigration status was given by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office in 2001 to Mansour Azizkhani, an Iranian national and Alabama businessman who was convicted of bank loan fraud in 1984. Prior to the pardon, he faced the possibility of deportation to Iran.) who were at risk of being deported for their offenses. Such pardons would likely be perceived positively by their host countries, resulting in improved inter-country relations.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: Immigration rights activists believe that pardons are often the only way to rectify racial biases in the enforcement of criminal law and [prevent or reverse deportation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/06/02/groups-urge-president-biden-include-immigration-pardon-process)(We write to urge President Biden to consider immigration consequences while exercising his power in two ways: first, by pardoning immigrants with deportable convictions in order to spare them from removal; and second, by ensuring that those who receive clemency also receive an exercise of discretion to ensure that clemency is not rendered meaningless through immigration detention and/or deportation. \[...\]), thereby allowing them to be reunited with their families.
1.4.3.4.2.2. Con: Many immigrants plead guilty to [crimes they did not commit](https://documentedny.com/2021/09/01/cuomo-pardoned-this-woman-but-the-process-is-still-a-mystery/)(At the age of 16, she was out with friends when another person in the group attempted to rob someone, she said. Though Valdez maintains she was not involved in the robbery directly, she was charged because she was present as the situation unfolded, she said.\n\nValdez, who has a green card, could not afford a reliable lawyer to help her, she said, and didn’t have enough knowledge of the law at the time to comprehend how a guilty plea would affect her life and immigration status later in life.\n\n“If I would have thought that that would have followed me all the way down here, I would have fought that day,” she said about the conviction. “If we would have known a little more about the law, I would have never plead guilty for it. That never would have happened.”) due to limited access to legal counsel and poor legal knowledge. Improved legal literacy and accessibility would, therefore, reduce the need for such retroactive fixes in the form of pardons.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: A number of the pardons issued by President Trump involved crimes with international implications and could be considered violations of [international law](https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2021/01/louis-beres-trump-pardons-international-law/)(Despite obvious and substantial interpenetrations of US law, natural law and international law, the United States Constitution is unambiguous on this crucial separation: A president’s power to pardon does not extend to violations of international law. \n\[...\]\nThe Law of Nations, or international law, is federal common law. Inter alia, the constitutionality of federal subject matter jurisdiction on such important matters is established at Articles III and VI of the Constitution, and also in actions involving US treaty violations. In essence, per Judge Edwards in Tel-Oren, actions involving violations of international law arise under US law because the Law of Nations “is an integral part of the laws of this country.”\n\nHave any of Donald J. Trump’s late 2020 pardons concerned violations of international law? If “yes,” these presidential grants of immunity were ipso facto unlawful. To be sure, an affirmative response is plainly unassailable.).
1.4.3.5. Pro: National leaders routinely exercise their power to pardon to maintain [social peace and stability](https://www.ibanet.org/article/465431E6-8846-4A89-BA0A-6A8B85E5ED1D)(It is not unusual for pardons to be granted in the interests of the future good of a nation, especially one recovering from internal strife, such as Lebanon or South Africa. Collective pardons \(or amnesties\) may be extended to those committing crimes in a national conflict. \[...\] In such cases, the peace and stability of the country are judged to be of greater public benefit than the punishment of an individual. \[...\]\n\nPardons may also be used to pre-empt conflict by dissipating tensions within a society. In early 2018, the President of Egypt issued a pardon via Twitter to over 300 people, many of whom were arrested for taking part in ‘unauthorised protests’ against the government. In another instance, on assuming the throne in 2016, the King of Thailand pardoned up to 150,000 prisoners by either shortening their sentences or sanctioning their immediate release, including those jailed for insulting the royal family.), as the former is considered a small price to pay for the benefits of the latter.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Improper use of the pardon power is destabilizing to the principles of democracy \([p. iii](https://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/41463/ZacharyBaker2021.pdf?sequence=3)(Trump’s pardons are rhetorical rituals that use tropes and metaphors to persuade audiences to support clemency in ways that are complicit with structural violence and detrimental to democracy. Three rhetorical strategies are identified: first, manipulation of the spheres of argument to alter audience expectations and evaluative criteria, second, counter-allegation to perform a ritual of masculine victimhood that coopts the voice and position of marginalized social groups, and third, subject construction under the trope of\nwhiteness in the service of narratives of racial insecurity.)\).
1.4.3.5.2. Pro: President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers who participated in the Civil War in an attempt to [resolve animosity](https://medium.com/la-biblioth%C3%A8que/the-day-u-s-president-andrew-johnson-granted-full-pardon-to-former-confederate-men-a751d7f7982b)(On Dec.25, 1868, President Andrew Johnson issued a “Christmas Amnesty” proclamation pardoning Confederates for treason.\n\nHe wanted to end any bitterness between the North and the South.\n\nEven though numerous Confederates soldiers had been pardoned in 1865, some high ranking officials were still in legal jeopardy.) between the North and the South.
1.4.3.5.2.1. Pro: As the tide of the war turned against the Confederacy, the Confederate generals, officers, and soldiers may have been more inclined to [surrender](https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2015/spring/cw-surrenders.html)(While it was the most significant surrender to take place during the Civil War, Gen. Robert E. Lee, the Confederacy's most respected commander, surrendered only his Army of Northern Virginia to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nSeveral other Confederate forces—some large units, some small—had yet to surrender before President Andrew Johnson could declare that the Civil War was officially over.\n\nThe Grant-Lee agreement served not only as a signal that the South had lost the war but also as a model for the rest of the surrenders that followed.\n\nAfter Richmond fell and Davis fled, Confederate commanders were on their own to surrender their commands to Union forces. Surrenders, paroles, and amnesty for many Confederate combatants would take place over the next several months and into 1866 throughout the South and border states.) due to the promise of clemency included in President Lincoln's earlier [Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction](http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/procamn.htm)(I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves...).
1.4.3.5.3. Pro: The vast amount of political and legal maneuvering that is involved in attaining the presidency can itself become an ongoing source of political strife. Pardons can allow a president to defuse some of these tensions and focus on governing.
1.4.4. Pro: In the eyes of the law, [all are equal](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx)("EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW" - These words, written above the main entrance to the Supreme Court Building, express the ultimate responsibility of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court is the highest tribunal in the Nation for all cases and controversies arising under the Constitution or the laws of the United States. As the final arbiter of the law, the Court is charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law and, thereby, also functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution.). Pardons undermine this [core democratic principle](https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/principles-of-democracy/44151)(It is not only important but necessary that all people are treated equally in a democracy. This means that they are not discriminated against because of their ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights – for example, equal access to the voting booth. And when it does come time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same – your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That’s the most fundamental element of equality in a democracy.), as they imply that some people should not be punished for the same crimes for which others have been punished.
1.4.4.1. Con: While, in theory, all may be equal in the eyes of the law, this is [not always true](https://theconversation.com/why-leaders-breaking-rules-is-a-far-more-serious-attack-on-our-liberty-than-lockdown-itself-139405)(If those who hold power are able break the law with impunity, then the liberty of all citizens is compromised. They would be in the same position as a slave, as they would be subject to whatever whim happened to catch the fancy of those with power.) in practice. Pardons are, therefore, no different in this regard.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: There is a difference between the law inadvertently falling short of impartiality and the president selectively exempting some individuals from legal consequences.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: The rich and powerful often [get away with crimes](https://www.forensicscolleges.com/blog/follow-the-money/white-collar-prison)(The FBI estimates that white collar crime costs the US economy over $300 billion per year. But practically no one who helped create the 2008 economic crisis went to jail. The criminal justice system has systemic flaws that disproportionately punish the poor and reward the rich.\n\nA bevy of factors play into this disparity, but mainly manifest themselves in discrepancies in bail, discrepancies in sentencing, and discrepancies in incarceration.). Notably, access to expensive defense lawyers undermines the rule of law, since their ability to successfully help wealthy clients avoid conviction is beyond the financial means of most people.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The president cannot review every conviction, so the opportunity to receive a pardon is not equally available to everyone.
1.4.5. Con: The US is a [constitutional democracy](https://www.civiced.org/lesson-plans/constitutional-democracy)(Democracy is government of, by, and for the people. It is government of a community in which all citizens, rather than favored individuals or groups, have the right and opportunity to participate. In a democracy, the people are sovereign. The people are the ultimate source of authority.\n\nIn a CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY the authority of the majority is limited by legal and institutional means so that the rights of individuals and minorities are respected. This is the form of democracy practiced in Germany, Israel, Japan, the United States, and other countries.) or, more accurately, [constitutional federal republic](https://ar.usembassy.gov/education-culture/irc/u-s-government/)(While often categorized as a democracy, the United States is more accurately defined as a constitutional federal republic. What does this mean? “Constitutional” refers to the fact that government in the United States is based on a Constitution which is the supreme law of the United States. The Constitution not only provides the framework for how the federal and state governments are structured, but also places significant limits on their powers. “Federal” means that there is both a national government and governments of the 50 states. A “republic” is a form of government in which the people hold power, but elect representatives to exercise that power.). The Constitution upon which the state is founded gives the president the power to pardon.
1.4.5.1. Con: The Constitution was [written in 1787](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Constitution-of-the-United-States-of-America)(The Constitution was written during the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by 55 delegates to a Constitutional Convention that was called ostensibly to amend the Articles of Confederation \(1781–89\), the country’s first written constitution.), so some of its contents may be outdated or irrelevant. The Constitution should be amended to reflect the changing needs and ethos of contemporary America.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: The Founding Fathers wanted to [balance government power in favor of the states](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-federalism-3321880)(In the United States, the Constitution grants certain powers to both the U.S. government and the state governments.\n\nThe Founding Fathers wanted more power for the individual states and less for the federal government, a practice that endured until World War II. That "layer cake" method of dual federalism was replaced when state and national governments entered a more cooperative "marble cake" approach called cooperative federalism.\n\nSince then, a new federalism initiated by presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan has returned some powers back to states through federal grants.), so most offenses were addressed by state rather than federal laws. Thus, the power to pardon originally had limited scope for misuse, as there were few federal offenses.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The US Constitution lists only [three federal crimes](https://www.heritage.org/the-constitution/commentary/the-constitution-and-crime)(Another sign that we have lost our sense of the Constitution lies in the phenomenon of "overcriminalization." Put simply, government is making too many criminal laws, creating traps for people who are doing their best to be law-abiding citizens. Consider: The Constitution itself identifies only three federal crimes - piracy, counterfeiting, and treason.\n\nWhen the First Congress enacted the original Crimes Act in 1790, it stipulated only 17 federal crimes. Today, Congress own research service can't even count all the federal crimes on the books. Our best estimate is that the federal code now delineates more than 4,500 federal crimes. And federal regulations create tens of thousands more. Our Founding Fathers would recognize relatively few of these offenses as crimes.), but the number of federal crimes and regulatory violations have since grown so exponentially that they have warranted [legislative action](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/count-the-crimes-the-federal-law-books-then-cut-them)(According to best estimates—and estimates are all we have—there are about 4,500 federal crimes in the United States Code, and more than 300,000 federal crimes dispersed throughout federal regulations. \[...\] The Department of Justice once tried to count the number of federal crimes and failed, ultimately throwing up its hands in frustration and coming up with only a rough estimate.\n\nThat means that even the people charged with enforcing federal law and prosecuting those who break it don’t know how many federal crimes exist. \[...\] The Count Crimes to Cut Act, introduced June 18, would finally force the federal government to do just that. The bill would require the attorney general to provide Congress with a list of all crimes in the United States Code within one year.). Such overcriminalization is antithetical to the spirit of the Constitution.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: In the [Great Debate](https://www.constitutionfacts.com/us-articles-of-confederation/the-great-debate/)(There were two sides to the Great Debate: the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. The Federalists wanted to ratify the Constitution, the Anti-Federalists did not. \n\[...\]\nLed by Alexander Hamilton, albeit secretly at first, the Federalists were the first political party of the United States. They supported the Constitution, and attempted to convince the States to ratify the document. \n\[...\]\nIn the ratification debate, the Anti-Federalists opposed to the Constitution. They complained that the new system threatened liberties, and failed to protect individual rights. The Anti-Federalists weren't exactly a united group, but instead involved many elements.\n\nOne faction opposed the Constitution because they thought stronger government threatened the sovereignty of the states. Others argued that a new centralized government would have all the characteristics of the despotism of Great Britain they had fought so hard to remove themselves from.) over the proportion of power to be held by the federal and state governments, the supporters of the Constitution were Federalists and thus supported centralized over localized power.
1.4.5.1.1.3. Con: Many states confer the [right to pardon](https://pardonandparole.uslegal.com/persons-authorized-grant-pardon/)(However in most states in the U.S., the power to pardon is vested in the state’s governor. A governor has the power to pardon or commute any sentence from the day on which a defendant is imprisoned and at any time thereafter during imprisonment\[iii\], to effect an inmate’s release, make conditional pardons effective, but does not have the power to grant pardon in cases of impeachment\[iv\]. A governor’s pardoning power is protected from legislative action, except in cases where the constitution permits such an intrusion. Likewise the governor’s pardoning power is in no way dependent upon any act or acts of a board of prison terms and paroles, or other governmental branch or entity which is empowered to make recommendations or certify the rehabilitation of the applicant\[v\].) on the governor, and many state constitutions [predate the US Constitution](https://www.ncsl.org/blog/2017/11/17/your-states-constitution-the-peoples-document.aspx)(The first state constitutions were adopted in 1776 by Delaware, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.). Thus, presidential and gubernatorial pardon powers collectively underscore the broad range of offenses that are subject to executive oversight.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: The Constitution bestows upon Congress the power to [pass amendments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/)(The founders also specified a process by which the Constitution may be amended, and since its ratification, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. In order to prevent arbitrary changes, the process for making amendments is quite onerous. An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the States request one, by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each State for ratification. In modern times, amendments have traditionally specified a time frame in which this must be accomplished, usually a period of several years. Additionally, the Constitution specifies that no amendment can deny a State equal representation in the Senate without that State’s consent.). This implies that the Founding Fathers considered the document to be neither inerrant nor timeless.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: The process of passing a [constitutional amendment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/)(In order to prevent arbitrary changes, the process for making amendments is quite onerous.) has been made particularly arduous so as to prevent Congress from making arbitrary, trivial, or contentious changes.
1.4.5.1.2.2. Pro: The Constitution contains [exploitable errors of omission and commission](https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/09/17/constitutions-biggest-flaw-protecting-slavery/)(The preamble describes the core values that the Constitution seeks to achieve: democratic government, effective governance, justice and liberty. The preamble reminds us that the Constitution is created by “we the people.” The people are sovereign. \[...\] There is one key value not mentioned in the preamble: equality. This omission should not be surprising for a Constitution that protected and institutionalized slavery and that protected only the rights of white men.), so it should be possible to remedy these. Given how easily pardon powers can be exploited, removing or regulating this power would be justified.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: The presidential pardon power has not become outdated or irrelevant; instead, it has become unpopular due to repeated abuse. [Preventing such abuse](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-prevent-abuse-presidents-pardon-power)(Short of amend­ing the Consti­tu­tion, Congress could limit the pardon power legis­lat­ively. One bill, the Protect­ing Our Demo­cracy Act, would require the Justice Depart­ment and the pres­id­ent to provide Congress mater­i­als pertain­ing to a pardoned indi­vidu­al’s prosec­u­tion and pardon. The bill would also make it clear that pardons could not be doled out in exchange for bribes. Another provi­sion would outlaw self-pardons. \[...\] Another bill would require the pres­id­ent to publish the issue date, recip­i­ent, and full text of each pardon or reprieve. Such legis­la­tion would bring public atten­tion and poten­tial condem­na­tion for ill-considered grants.) through legislation would, therefore, be sufficient.
