Discussion Name: Should the Electoral College be abolished?

1. The Electoral College should be abolished.
1.1. Con: The Electoral College reduces the probability that electoral mechanisms fail.
1.1.1. Con: Since the electors are usually allocated under a winner-take-all system, potential meddlers only need to sway small numbers of votes in order to have a large impact.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In those states \(under [FPTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) with at least one third party candidate\) a candidate could even win with less than 50% of the vote.
1.1.1.2. Con: The same problem is present in a national popular vote election, which is still winner-take-all for the position of president.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: If most within-state elections are not close, but the popular vote is close, then the outcome is much easier to interfere with.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Splitting one winner-takes-all election \(the popular vote\) into a bunch of smaller winner-takes-all elections makes it much easier to change the outcome.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Consider a hypothetical US with three states, each of which is split 51%-49%. In order to change the outcome of the popular vote, a malevolent actor would need to change the votes of 1% of the population. But in order to change the results under an Electoral College system, the actor would only need to change 1% of the population of two of the states or only 2/3 as many votes as under the popular vote system.
1.1.2. Pro: Because the structure of the Electoral College is so [decentralized](https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/em/annex/electoral-management-case-studies/the-united-states-decentralized-to-the-point-of), it virtually eliminates the possibility of election manipulation at the ballot box.
1.1.2.1. Con: The [ballot box can be manipulated](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016f-81ca-d64c-a9ff-d5da22d70000) readily along the way, at any of thousands of points where paper ballots are moving or inadequately-designed electronic systems are used.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Electoral College magnifies these failures by amplifying votes for the victor in any given state, even for states which split electoral votes.
1.1.2.2. Pro: An effort to manipulate elections through dishonest means is less likely to succeed while the Electoral College is in place, as criminal activity would be required at multiple locations, and would require more actors than if there was just one central election process.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Electoral College makes it very difficult to steal elections. Illegal ballots must be cast in the right states and even precincts in order to impact the outcome of the election.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The Electoral College allows manipulation efforts to be focused on the elections that will have an actual impact on the overall result.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Given that this would require an analysis of where the greatest actual impact would be, this would be more complicated than simply dumping votes into the system.
1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Voter fraud attacks with the Electoral College must occur in the states that all the eyes are on. WIthout the Electoral College, the attack could be anywhere in the system.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The importance the Electoral College places on swing states means voter fraud can be implemented more meaningfully at smaller scales in said states.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Under a popular vote any "illegal votes" would be substantially diluted by legal ones.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Under a popular vote, any illegal vote cast at any location directly affects the outcome of the presidential election, making it much harder to maintain the integrity of elections.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The Electoral College makes widespread voter fraud less impactful, thereby discouraging it.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: When the focus is on swing states, there are fewer states that are important or unpredictable \(as opposed to popular vote, where fraudulent votes in one state will "carry over" to other states\). Thus, election officials can focus on preventing fraud in those specific states as opposed to hard-red or hard-blue states, where the election officials [are also likely less bipartisan](http://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/report/destroying-the-electoral-college-the-anti-federalist-national-popular).
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: New Hampshire [is considered a swing state](http://nhpr.org/post/how-nh-went-deep-red-swing-state-over-course-few-elections#stream/0), yet this did not stop there from being [fervent \(unproven\) accusations](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/11/new-hampshire-voter-fraud-fight-takes-new-turn.html).
1.1.2.3.2. Con: The Electoral College makes voter fraud far more effective in swing states.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.3.
1.1.3. Con: The Electoral College exacerbates the effects of voter suppression because no matter how many or few vote in the state, the [elective power of the state is the same](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/electoral-college).
1.1.3.1. Con: Voter suppression is usually [targeted at people from the other party](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/23/659784277/republican-voter-suppression-efforts-are-targeting-minorities-journalist-says?t=1618147891706), so it is equally effective whether in an Electoral College or popular vote system.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Even voter suppression that is highly targeted at one party will usually end up suppressing some votes from the other party as [collateral damage](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/republican-partys-irrational-war-voting-rights/618314/).
1.1.3.2. Pro: Neither the Electoral College nor the popular vote penalizes [voter suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression), but the Electoral College amplifies its effects, which the popular vote does not.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The Electoral College gave an advantage to slave holding states because the number of electors was based on population, in which slave states counted [every 5 slaves as 3 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise), rather than using a popular vote which would have only taken into account voting citizens.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: An argument based on a historical circumstance doesn't hold any weight in a modern setting where the circumstances are completely different and the argued impact is void. All citizens are now able to vote. The [3/5 compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise) has no significance today.
1.1.3.4. Con: The Constitution \([14th amendment, 2nd section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\) allows the representation of states to be reduced where citizens are denied their right to vote. All it needs is for that part of the Constitution to be enforced.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: It is never enforced because data on [voter suppression](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/digital-disinformation-and-vote-suppression) is insufficient to apply that clause.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: It is unlikely that governments will want to antagonize states by reducing their vote share in the Electoral College, particularly if it would cost them votes in a general election.
1.1.3.5. Pro: If only one person were allowed to vote in California their one vote would still choose 55 out of 535 electors, thus giving that one voter over 10% of the total electing power, even though the voting rights of the rest of the state had been restricted/suppressed.
1.1.4. Pro: The Electoral College protects us from the "[tumult and disorder](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp)" of an election in which the entire nation chooses the president directly.
1.1.4.1. Con: Though most modern democracies use a party-elected prime minister, there are other democracies that directly elect their presidents \([South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_South_Korea), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Mexico#Executive_branch)\) without descending into disorder.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: The system in Mexico leads to elected leaders with less than 40% of the popular vote; creating much [civil unrest](https://www.fairvote.org/mexico-s-divisive-presidential-election-system-2).
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Mexico has had a stable [transfer of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_Mexico#Modern_Mexico_\(1934%E2%80%93present\)) every six years since 1934.
1.1.4.2. Con: The contested [election of Hayes in 1876](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1876_United_States_presidential_election) and the resulting [Compromise of 1877](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877) generated great political strife, nearly reigniting the Civil War and resulting in the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.
1.1.4.3. Pro: If the presidency were determined by popular vote, in the event of a very close election, a recount would be too enormous of an undertaking.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: [Close elections](https://www.britannica.com/list/5-remarkably-close-us-presidential-elections) are not uncommon and recounts could happen frequently.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Of the [past 10 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin), half were within a 5% margin in the popular vote.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Con: The purpose of a voting system is to accurately evaluate the will of the people, [not to avoid recounts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-recount-explainer-idUSKBN27Q38K). Avoiding recounts at the expense of accuracy is a reversal of priorities.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: If counting the votes is possible to begin with, recounting them is also possible. The cost and effort of a recount is tiny compared to the huge costs of selecting the wrong president.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: If a recount is required, it would work the same way it did in [Florida in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida), with each individual municipality recounting their portion, with election monitors on hand.
1.1.4.3.2.2. Con: Recounts are usually [paid for](https://ballotpedia.org/Who_pays_for_recounts_and_contested_elections%3F_\(2020\))(The costs of the election contest are borne generally by the petitioner and the defendant.) by the challenging party. In the event of a nationwide recount, candidates may not have enough money to cover all the costs, potentially resulting in an erroneous outcome.
1.1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Washington state's 2004 gubernatorial race recount cost only [$1,160,000](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2010/recountbrief1pdf.pdf). Even if this was applied to all fifty states, that is still a [fraction](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/cost-of-becoming-president/) of what candidates spend on their campaigns.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: In the Electoral College, there is no reason to recount states with large margins of victory. With the popular vote, recounting any state could affect the result, so close races could require nationwide efforts.
1.1.4.4. Pro: The Electoral College [protects elections](https://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-reason-for-the-electoral-college/) from the capricious and easily swayed nature of public opinion.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: [Federalist Paper 68](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp) explains that Hamilton did not trust the public with choosing the president. Instead, the president would be chosen by “a small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass”, as they would be “most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.”
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Federalist No. 68 explains that it was believed that "[electing the president directly, without the intermediate step of the electors, might lead to instability](https://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/summary-essay-68)."
1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Hamilton believed that one of the inherent weaknesses in a government based on the will of the people is the potential for [mob rule](https://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/summary-essay-68).
1.1.4.4.1.3. Con: Federalist No. 68 was written in 1788. The nature of the political parties, the demographics of America and the nature of the office of the president have changed. The American electoral system should be changed to reflect contemporary society.
1.1.4.4.1.3.1. Pro: The Federalist Papers [are not a part of US law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers#Opposition_to_the_Bill_of_Rights). They are instead merely the opinions of Madison, Jay, and Hamilton.
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.1. Con: They are the opinions of three of the key Founding Fathers, two of which were very active participants in the Constitutional Convention. Therefore, their opinions carry significant authority when it comes to interpreting the Constitution.
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: [The Constitution is a living document](https://thewire.in/government/constitution-living-document), which was meant to be changed over time. Justifying the continued use of the Electoral College should not be limited to the initial justification for the Electoral College.
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.2. Con: The Federalist Papers have been cited many times by the Supreme Court as indications of the intent of parts of the Constitution, showing that they have authority in such matters.
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The Federalist is cited many times in the opinion for [HINES v. DAVIDOWITZ](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/312/52.html).
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: In [CALDER v. BULL](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/3/386.html) the author of the Federalist is cited as a source and praised "for his extensive and accurate knowledge of the true principles of Government."
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: The Federalist is used as support many times in [M'CULLOCH v. STATE](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/17/316.html).
1.1.4.4.1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: Although the federalist papers are great, [the times and US government change, and the federalist papers may not always be correct when applied to the modern US](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/17/316.html)(Chief Justice John Marshall, in the opinion for M'CULLOCH v. STATE, said of the Federalist Papers that "no tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit; but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government, a right to judge of their correctness must be retained...".).
1.1.4.4.1.3.2. Pro: In the current system, the people do not “choose those they trust to elect the president.” Most do not know who their electors are. Electors are generally expected to ratify the popular vote of their state, rather than act as "free agents", as envisioned by Hamilton.
1.1.4.4.1.4. Con: In practice, the 'small number of persons' is tied either legally, politically, or customarily to voting with the popular vote of their electorate. Hence, it is irrelevant if the electors 'possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated matters'.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: Dealing with [volatile public opinion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331282494_Opinion_Polls_and_Volatile_Electorates_Problems_and_Issues_in_Polling_European_Societies) is part of living in a democracy.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Democratic principles demand that when public opinion changes, political leaders change their behaviour to reflect the public's new position.
1.1.4.4.2.2. Pro: Trying to protect elections from the uneducated and easily swayed masses is a rather arrogant way to guarantee "authenticity" of results.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: [Public opinion volatility](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.dartmouth.edu/dist/9/280/files/2016/10/Volatility.Simple.v8.pdf) is more likely to be violently manipulated in smaller samples \(swing states\) than larger ones \(nation at large\). \(p.1\)
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: By basing the election results on both the opinions of states and individuals, the Electoral College balances rapid swings in public opinion with a less volatile input from state governments.
1.1.4.4.4.1. Con: State governments are not involved in the Electoral College. Electors are usually [chosen](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/electors) from a state's political party.
1.1.4.4.4.2. Pro: The Electoral College incentivizes politicians to attempt to sway public opinion. Some organizations [argue](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation)(State winner-take-all statutes adversely affect governance. 'Battleground' states receive 7% more federal grants than 'spectator' states, twice as many presidential disaster declarations, more Superfund enforcement exemptions, and more No Child Left Behind law exemptions.) that this leads to far more effective policymaking.
1.1.4.4.4.2.1. Con: This kind of behavior would not be improved by removing the Electoral College. It would just shift to catering towards large population centers.
1.1.4.4.5. Con: The mechanisms through which the Electoral College intended to provide obstacles to corruption and manipulation of presidential elections are no longer effective today.
1.1.4.4.5.1. Con: The change from free electors in early America to electors bound to their states' results today does protect the country from sudden changes of public opinion between election day in November and the day the electoral college meets [in December](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/roles.html).
1.1.4.4.5.1.1. Con: Just as a person cannot change their vote after they cast their ballot, sudden change in public opinion cannot change the result of an election already decided. The Electoral College is no longer an independent and deliberative body.
1.1.4.4.5.2. Pro: [Several states](https://tropicsofmeta.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/how-do-different-states-allocate-their-electoral-votes/) require by law that their electors vote according to the state popular vote. This undermines the independence the Founding Fathers intended the Electoral College to have.
1.1.4.4.5.2.1. Con: The independence of the Electoral College was, according to the Founding Fathers, [intended](https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention) to be exercised to prevent unsuitable candidates from taking office. This independence has not been used in practice and history. As such there is no reason to defend it over that purpose.
1.1.4.4.5.2.2. Pro: The change to the statewide winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes [began in the early 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College#Evolution_to_the_general_ticket)s. [Madison](https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023) and [Hamilton](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp) were staunchly against this change.
1.1.4.4.6. Pro: The Electoral College forces new movements and ideologies to build their power more democratically, rather than allowing them to take power due to temporary enthusiasm.
1.1.4.4.6.1. Pro: If a particular ideology sweeps part of the country, it must appeal to a broad spectrum of the full nation's population and develop partnerships with other related groups to be able to elect a president.
1.1.4.5. Con: The Electoral College victories under [Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_George_W._Bush#First_inauguration) and [Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Donald_Trump#Inauguration_protests) have caused tumult and disorder.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: It does not protect us from "tumult and disorder" since, as used today, it merely is a system of rounding votes to the nearest whole state.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Electors were [intended to be free to deliberate](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp) for whom they would vote. Today they are merely a proxy for the votes of their respective states' populations.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: According to [Article II](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-ii)(The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.) of the US Constitution, the Electoral College only determines the president if a majority can be reached. In cases of plurality, the president is elected by the Senate from the top 5 candidates.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: The Electoral College victory of Joe Biden didn't prevent an [attempted violent overthrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol) of the US government on January 6, 2021.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: The only connection between January 6 insurrection and the Electoral College is the date, because the Electoral College counts were to be certified on that day. Otherwise the insurrection is unrelated to the Electoral College.
1.1.4.5.3. Con: The Electoral College [victory of Bush](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) didn't result in civil strife, as a court case settled the matter.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Con: Civil strife refers to people's reaction to the results, not how orderly the process was.
1.1.4.5.3.2. Con: The sense of [injustice and disempowerment felt by many who opposed Bush](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/22/worlddispatch.martinkettle) was one factor in the increasing polarisation of the nation.
1.1.4.5.3.2.1. Pro: Bush's fragile majority, in turn, encouraged the [Republican party to strengthen that polarisation to hold on to power.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2012/06/04/partisan-polarization-surges-in-bush-obama-years/) This traded long-term stability for short-term political gain.
1.1.4.5.3.2.2. Con: Modern polarization began to occur in the [1970s, and truly broke down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/02/13/polarization-in-congress-has-risen-sharply-where-is-it-going-next/?utm_term=.f8f71b5c25ed) during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. While Bush's election only made it worse, it's incorrect to say this is the root cause of our current level of polarization.
1.1.4.5.3.3. Con: There was plenty of civil strife leading up to the outcome, especially the [Brooks Brothers riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot), in which polling officials stopped their recount early, due to violence from the riots.
1.1.4.5.3.4. Con: There were [significant protests at George W. Bush's inauguration](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206144300/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/20/protest.wrap/index.html).
1.1.4.6. Con: Modern technology makes choosing the president directly more feasible and less likely to result in "tumult and disorder".
1.1.5. Con: Since there are only [538 electors](https://www.euronews.com/2020/11/03/us-election-what-is-the-electoral-college-and-how-does-it-work) as opposed to hundreds of millions of voters, it is far easier to influence the vote of the electors than it is to influence the vote of the populace.
1.1.5.1. Con: [In 33 states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector), electors are required to vote for the winner of their state's election, though some of those states do not have a means of enforcing this.
1.1.5.2. Pro: There have been [recent demands for electors to switch their votes](https://fortune.com/2020/11/04/2020-election-results-faithless-electors-electoral-college-trump-biden-270/). Social media makes faithless electors a viable possibility in states, with only minor consequences.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: There has always been a potential for faithless electors, but they are incredibly rare and [have never changed the outcome of a presidential election](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/11/06/faithless-electors-outcome-2020-election-presidential-colorado/). The vast majority of the time, they vote as their state voted.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: There can be real consequences for faithless electors. In some states, they are bound by law and could be fined if they're faithless. [In some cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector#2016), their electoral vote is automatically void if they vote for someone other than the intended.
1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Electors are almost always [party loyalists in their home states](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-09/2020-supreme-court-review-4_whittington.pdf). If they are faithless, they will lose all influence within their party. \(p.82\)
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: In the 2016 election, there was a [concerted campaign](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/democrats-electoral-college-faithless-trump-231731) by the Democrats to persuade electors to defect and change the election outcome.
1.1.5.3. Con: Influencing educated and politically literate individuals is very difficult.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: It is easier to convince large groups of a population passively interested in politics than politicians who are also electors.
1.1.5.4. Con: It is far [easier to subvert the popular vote](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sd-utbg-electoral-college-president-20170113-story.html) than it is to subvert the Electoral College because it has transparencies that voting stations do not.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Electors are pledged to vote [for a candidate based on the popular vote in their state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector). Who they are pledged to vote for is public record. They are not allowed to be influenced.
1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: [29 states](http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=967) already have some form of requirement that their Electoral College delegates mirror the election within the state. Delegates are unlikely to vote contrary to their state's election, and if they did, they would likely quickly be corrected.
1.1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Public pressure would prevent any given elector from being bribed. If an elector votes for anyone other than whom they are pledged to vote for, the public will know it. If they were bribed to do so, it would be very easy to track that bribe down.
1.1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: [Faithless electors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_electors_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election) still happen which shows that public pressure is not sufficient to prevent them.
1.1.5.4.1.2.1.1. Con: States already have the authority to remedy any problem posed by faithless electors through statute. About half of states already have [laws](https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws) involving pledges, penalties or other procedures to prevent faithless electors.
1.1.5.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Despite loud and powerful demands that electors abandon Trump and alter the outcome of the election, electors were overwhelmingly faithful in 2016.
1.1.5.4.1.3.1. Con: The 2016 presidential race had a record number of elector defections. The number of [defections was higher for Clinton than for President Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/19/us/elections/electoral-college-results.html).
1.1.5.4.1.4. Con: Electors are still able to default on their promise to represent, and they sometimes do.
1.1.5.4.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.
1.1.6. Pro: Without the Electoral College, any question about the legitimacy of the election would cause a nationwide recount instead of keeping the votes encapsulated to the states.
1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.1.6.2. Con: Popular votes are already kept by each state and each district. Any issues with legitimacy would be dealt with in the same way as it is now.
1.1.6.3. Con: The legitimacy of the [2020 election was questioned](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54724960) despite the existence of the Electoral College.
1.2. Con: The Electoral College empowers states as political units, which supports [the system of federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States)(Federalism in the United States is the constitutional division of power between U.S. state governments and the federal government of the United States.) that is important to US governance.
1.2.1. Con: The president represents all US citizens and almost never a particular state.
1.2.1.1. Con: The Electoral College was created to [prevent the office of president](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/danger-attacks-electoral-college/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=%7B%7Bad.name%7D%7D&fbclid=IwAR3_tMiz0PkUav1ySsqWMYbRzDJdCXhh3eDsN5_YhQxNFF3T35gu_7fted4) from being beholden to the majority or to the elected state representatives.
1.2.1.2. Pro: While senators or representatives only represent the people in one state or district, the US President is in charge of the welfare "[of the entire nation](https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/three-branches/executive-branch)."
1.2.2. Pro: The Electoral College works to reduce the influence of densely populated areas and give [fair power to smaller states](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/in-defense-of-the-electoral-college).
1.2.2.1. Con: Rural areas are already significantly over-represented in the Senate and slightly so in the House.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The allocation of two Senate seats per state, no matter the population, already adequately serves as a leveling agent among states.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Allocating two senators per state acts as a partial balancing factor in the legislative process. However, if there isn't a similar remedy \(such as the Electoral College\) in the presidential election process, large states would completely dominate the selection of the executive and would, thus, largely control executive power.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The Senate equalizes states' representation, the House represents individual communities, and the president represents all states. Thus, a popular vote is the only justifiable method of election.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: [The Senate is the branch designed to give states equal votes](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Constitution_Senate.htm). The House is meant to represent population counts per state. The president is meant to represent everyone, not merely particular states
1.2.2.2. Con: The Electoral College actually gives less influence to small states. Candidates won't expend the same time and money to states with very few votes when they could be campaigning in very large states.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Voters in Montana, for example, are not as important to them as voters in say, California. Therefore they get less attention to their opinions and needs than voters in larger states. With direct elections a voter in Montana becomes as important as a voter in California.
1.2.2.3. Con: Dividing the population and their influence based on geography can be seen as undemocratic.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: States are [arbitrary boundaries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/29/how-the-electoral-college-gerrymanders-the-presidential-vote/) to draw for purposes of rural/urban representation.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: States are not arbitrary boundaries. They are the sovereign constituents of a constitutional federation. The states created the United States.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: The reason for state boundary locations and count was typically [regional disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States), geography, and/or political issues like slavery that have long since mutated to not match the original boundaries. The intention of states was never about crooking rural/urban representation.
1.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: If states borders were different, the [elections could have a different result](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/electoral-college-new-states-2016-election/).
1.2.2.3.2. Con: The Electoral College supports democratic ideals, as states receive more or fewer votes as their population fluctuates.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Each [state has its own government with independent laws and values](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-politicalscience/chapter/federalism-in-the-constitution/). It is therefore not a matter of a unified national citizenry divided by arbitrary geographic lines.
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: The Electoral College places voting power in land rather than in individuals; it is a relic of the injustices in the US when power was directly related to land ownership.
1.2.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.3.5. Pro: If the population was divided by religion, sexuality or education, and each group was given more or less value as voters, that would also be undemocratic.
1.2.2.3.6. Pro: People should not be penalized for where they choose to live. All votes should carry equal weight when counted for the same race.
1.2.2.3.6.1. Con: If all votes carried the same weight, dense population centers would not only receive the most attention in election cycles, they would also monopolize the candidates.
1.2.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: Campaign funds are finite and if more rural states don't have the power of population to attract the candidates, they would have no reason to visit. It would be unfair to suggest that those people don't deserve the same attention as large cities.
1.2.2.3.6.2. Pro: The practical effect of an Electoral College in modern times does not provide equal power to multiple voices. [It provides unequal power to some voices on the basis of geographic location](https://archive3.fairvote.org/reforms/national-popular-vote/the-electoral-college/problems-with-the-electoral-college/).
1.2.2.3.6.2.1. Pro: People living in densely populated areas deserve as much voting power as anyone else.
1.2.2.3.6.3. Pro: Since the president represents the entire population of the country, all citizens should have equal say in their election.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1. Pro: Any election where the option with the most votes does not win is unfair.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1. Con: "Unfair" is a subjective term and the term "fair" can have many equally valid definitions when applied to elections. Whether or not the Electoral College results are "fair" depends entirely upon one's definition of the term.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: It is not objectively clear which type of winner is the fairest to voters: the [Utilitarian Winner](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Utilitarian_winner), [Majority Winner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_criterion), or [Condorcet Winner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method).
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Condorcet Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) is a system whereby the candidate with the most broad appeal is declared the winner. In some cases, a candidate with fewer total first rank votes can win because they have more consistent lower ranked votes.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Condorcet method chooses the leader that would win in a 1v1 election against each other candidate. Due to the [Condorcet Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox), sometimes this is not possible to reach. Thus, under the Condorcet Method, there is no guarantee of the emergence of one consensus candidate.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Nonpartisan blanket primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary) using a proportional method followed by general elections using a [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) will identify the common consensus candidate. This incorporates all votes into the final selection and represents the electorate as a whole, rather than exclusively representing some plurality.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.2. Con: It does not follow from the fact that 'fairness' is a disputed concept that we should therefore not find a system that is better.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.2. Con: 'One person, one vote' is particularly dangerous in countries with several significant minority groups, where the majority can simply vote against their interests.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Switzerland](https://mises.org/wire/why-one-man-one-vote-doesnt-work), for example, takes anti-majoritarian measures to ensure the interests of different religious, national, and cultural groups are all represented.
1.2.2.3.6.3.1.3. Pro: Among major democracies, [proportional representation \(PR\)](https://www.fairvote.org/research_electoralsystems_world) systems are the most common way to elect legislatures.
1.2.2.3.6.3.2. Con: The Founding Fathers could easily have made the president be chosen by popular vote, but did not.
1.2.2.3.6.3.2.1. Con: Had the Founding Fathers chosen the popular vote as the method of election, southerners as a voting body would have been greatly outnumbered because a large portion of their population \(slaves\) were not allowed to vote. Hence why they chose an indirect method that [weighted](https://time.com/4558510/electoral-college-history-slavery/) southern votes based on population.
1.2.2.3.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: The Founding Fathers were under tremendous pressure to get the [Constitution ratified](https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention), and this would not have happened if small states felt disenfranchised by election protocol. The Electoral College was an imperfect compromise like many other policies at the time.
1.2.2.3.6.3.3. Con: The president's legal responsibility is to represent the collective will of the states as expressed through the Electoral College, not the population of the country.
1.2.2.3.6.3.3.1. Pro: The president is also responsible for the [execution and enforcement of the laws created by Congress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/).
1.2.2.3.6.3.3.2. Con: The president's legal responsibility is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. If the Electoral College is abolished, his or her responsibility will change accordingly.
1.2.2.3.6.3.3.2.1. Pro: [Article II Section III](https://constitutionallawreporter.com/article-02-section-03/) of the Constitution mentions no responsibility of the president to represent any entities' will other than that of the Constitution and its laws.
1.2.2.3.6.3.3.3. Con: States and territories mean nothing without the people who inhabit them. Sovereignty lies ultimately with the people: [the Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) begins with the words "We, the People", not the states.
1.2.2.3.6.3.4. Pro: There are plenty of geographically elected officials, from mayors, sheriffs, state senators, Congressmen, Governors, and Senators. The president should represent all the people
1.2.2.3.6.3.5. Con: The president represents the head of the republic, not US democracy. As such, they must represent all the different voices and experiences that make up the whole of the country.
1.2.2.3.6.3.5.1. Pro: Minorities \(people of color\) in this country would never have been given a voice if it wasn't for the Electoral College.
1.2.2.3.6.3.5.1.1. Con: The Electoral College does not and was never meant to give racial minorities a voice. It was partly created to [empower slave states](https://time.com/4558510/electoral-college-history-slavery/), which had fewer eligible voters than others.
1.2.2.3.6.3.5.2. Con: A Republic has the people elect people to represent them in various offices. Senators, representatives \(federal and state level\) and governors are all elected by a popular vote. This does not change the republican form of government.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Without the Electoral College, densely populated areas will dominate the country.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: If candidates ignore rural voters and anger them, rural voters can make their presence felt in the following elections. If their collective presence isn't enough to matter that's unfortunate for them, but that also means there is a larger group with different priorities/desires. That is democracy, majority rules.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: [Mass media and social media](https://www.cu-citizenaccess.org/2018/07/analysis-news-coverage-of-rural-america/) make it easier than ever before to reach rural voters, making them a more attractive target to influence, since they wield more power than urban voters.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Con: Mass media and social media targeting rural voters would not be needed, as the rural vote would not be required. Candidates need only focus on the high-density urban areas.
1.2.2.4.3. Con: With the popular vote, each person votes as they will. The fact that they are concentrated in one geographic area does not change this, so high population density areas dominating less densely populated areas makes no sense.
1.2.2.4.4. Pro: The Electoral College was instituted to protect against the event that a few densely populated states may hold a majority over the rest of the nation, thereby creating a situation where candidates only campaign in and win a few states, not appeal to the nation as a whole.
1.2.2.4.4.1. Con: [Small states are already ignored](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/small-states-are-ignored-because-current-state-state-winner-take-all-method-awarding-electoral-votes) because none are battleground states. Under a national popular vote every vote would count equally no matter the state.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: The Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small group of [swing states](https://www.history.com/news/swing-states-presidential-elections) rather than the country as a whole.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1. Con: The Electoral College serves as a moderating influence on presidential elections. Absent the Electoral College, there would be a strong incentive for candidates to pander to their base in an effort to "run up the score" in deeply partisan areas.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: In [both recent cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote) where the Electoral College overruled the popular vote, the Electoral College winner held more extreme views than the popular vote winner.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In both elections, the candidate received a large percentage of the vote, meaning their views likely represented a large number of voters.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is only in a very close election that the Electoral College would give the election to the candidate with fewer popular votes and in the case of a close election it insures that the winner has more broad based support.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: At the time, [Hilary Clinton](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38254946) had received more votes than any other candidate in history, except for Barack Obama’s win in 2008.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.3. Con: A review of the [primary and general election campaigns of Donald Trump](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320765800_An_Analysis_of_the_2016_Presidential_US_Republican_Presidential_Primary_Election) shows he pandered almost exclusively to his base and yet he won the Electoral College.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The “Mexicans are rapists” and phrases like “[America First,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/14/donald-trumps-new-favorite-slogan-has-a-nazi-friendly-history/?utm_term=.7ca95ba9cb61)” which was used by American Nazi sympathizers in the 1930s and 1940s, aren’t mainstream at all.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Trump refused to criticize his endorsement by [David Duke](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/05/488802494/former-kkk-leader-david-duke-says-of-course-trump-voters-are-his-voters) so as to thrill his “Alt-Right” base.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4. Pro: The two-party system causes both parties to vie for 'the center' of the electorate, forcing each party to moderate and converge over time.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The Electoral College limits the benefit of running up the score with the base and [forces a more broad-based](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/supreme-court-electoral-college-ruling-states-can-force-electors-to-abide-by-popular-vote.html) appeal in swing states, where voters tend to be more centrist.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: States like North Carolina, Florida, and Pennsylvania are [swing states but are also have some of the most partisan voters](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/swing-voters-and-elastic-states/).
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: If a party fails to moderate \(i.e. it is too far left or right\), it will lose the presidential election, and moderates within the party will be empowered.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.3. Con: In reality, the Democrats have [shifted farther left](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/) and the Republicans have [shifted farther right](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-has-changed-dramatically-since-george-h-w-bush-ran-it/) over the past several decades.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.4. Con: This assumes that voters across the "spectrum" are all willing to vote for whomever is "closest" to their preferences on some key issues. For example, it assumes that a moderate voter would be willing to vote for an average Republican over a far-left Democrat, and that a far-right voter would vote for a moderate right candidate. However, given that voting takes some time and thought, many would-be voters may simply not vote at all if neither candidate is sufficiently close to their preferences.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.2. Con: It is not the Electoral College itself that elevates the swing states. It is the choice of almost all states to apportion electors via a "winner-take-all" system. If most states chose to use a proportional system for apportioning electors, this would solve the problem.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Swing states only have their status because they [could flip either way](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/30/929402220/these-states-could-flip-from-red-to-blue-during-the-2020-election).
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.2.2. Con: The states choose to apportion this way because it gives them more power than states that split their votes. Unless proportional distribution is mandated for all, states will continue to have incentive to use winner take all.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3. Pro: The Electoral College alienates, and often [disenfranchises](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5143969_The_Electoral_College_and_Voter_Participation_Evidence_on_Two_Hypotheses_Using_Results_from_the_1996_Presidential_Election), minority voters in ['safe' states](https://theconversation.com/us-election-six-swing-states-likely-to-decide-who-is-the-next-president-148135). These votes could be meaningful and impactful in a popular vote system.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.1. Con: [Swing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state)(In American politics, the term swing state \(or battleground state\) refers to any state that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican presidential candidate by a swing in votes.) tend to change over time. Only [18 states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states#Table_of_presidential_elections_by_states_since_1972) \(plus Washington DC\) have voted for the same party in each election over the past 30 years.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The fact that it changes over time does not diminish the fact that, at any given point in time, candidates from either side know that they have states where the outcome is essentially a given, so they focus on swing states.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The candidates have to be sensitive to the needs of the current swing states. Without the Electoral College, they would only ever have to worry about the needs of Los Angeles, New York, and Ft. Lauderdale, and the only way to challenge or change this would be to decrease the population in one city or somehow make a new high population city.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Voters are not required to stay in a 'safe state'. They can move.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Voters living in safe states may choose to become more involved in the political process.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.2.2. Con: It is often not feasible for low-income citizens to move to a new state, meaning they do not have equal voting power in the context of this argument.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.2.3. Con: Family ties tend to keep people local. This is one of the reasons people don't leave their hometowns in search of employment elsewhere.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.3. Con: Without the Electoral College, a direct voting system would alienate the minority voters in the whole country.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Removing the Electoral College would not improve the situation because when votes are counted at the state level it gives more influence, not less.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: It is likely that many voters will feel like their vote counts for less in comparison to the entire country voting, compared to just one state.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.3.3. Con: This is only true if switching to a simple plurality system \(such as a national popular vote\). But an alternative voting method, such as [Approval Voting](https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/) or [Instant Runoff Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting), would allow every voter to contribute to the outcome.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.4. Pro: Under a proportional system, current 'safe' states would be fertile grounds for campaigns, which can motivate voters to turn out.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.5. Pro: Voters in states where the party they oppose dominates may feel as though their vote does not matter.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: Many voters in more homogeneous or late-voting West coast states [don't vote](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/) because they don't think their vote makes any difference.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.6. Pro: Voters in states where their preferred party dominates may feel as though they do not need to vote to get the outcome they desire.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.4. Con: [Swing states have politically diverse populations](https://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/1012/how-do-people-lean-politically-in-pivotal-swing-states.html) who may change their mind based on the specifics of an election. It is good that such populations determine the outcomes of elections.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Swing states aren't the fault of the Electoral College alone. Politicians understand, for example, the voting tendencies of Californians, and know they can count on partisanship there, making California a low priority campaign stop.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: If the Electoral College didn't exist, California would still not be a major campaign destination as election day draws near. The undecided votes will still be in "swing states", and so politicians must campaign there.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.4.2. Con: While, as a call to action, this has some validity, as an argument against the 'swing state' problem caused by the electoral college, it is essentially a 'blaming the victim' argument.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.5. Con: This is because of political demographics, not because of the Electoral College. As political demographics change, where campaigns are focused changes as well.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.1.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.5.2. Con: While the problem of 'swing states' is not intrinsic to the Electoral College, it is a problem that has been caused by the Electoral College. The fact that states are seen as voting blocks has a distinct effect on how our elections play out. It is a problem, as it focuses attention on a \(relatively\) small group of voters who have power to change the outcome of the election. Whether or not those states change from year to year does not change that it is a problem.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.5.3. Pro: Swing states gain and lose this status due to [many factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state#Determining_swing_states). A new swing state can emerge at any time, just as a any swing state can lose this status at any time.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6. Pro: A national popular vote would allow and encourage candidates to build coalitions across the country as every vote would count equally.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.1. Con: The Electoral College already allows for coalitions to form across the country. For example, in the 2008 presidential election, it was evident that [Obama won with a coalition](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05poll.html) of urban dwellers, women, suburbanites, non-white voters, and blue-collar voters.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2. Pro: When elections are effectively determined by the outcome in just a handful of states, there is an incentive for candidates to spend the most time there, as opposed to in states that always vote one way.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.1. Con: The same would be true with an national popular vote election, but it would just be the bigger states, like New York, California and Texas, with that influence.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.2. Pro: 120 million people voted in the 2016 election, but it was effectively decided by 107,000 votes in just [three states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/swing-state-margins/), making votes in these states more valuable.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3. Pro: A small number of swing states get almost all the attention from the candidates. [94%](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/campaign-events-2016) of all campaign events in 2016 were in just 12 states.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.1. Con: To do otherwise would be 'preaching to the choir'. Presidential campaigns are already very expensive. Spending lots of money to woo voters in a state that reliably votes a certain way wastes money. Wasting money is bad.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Two-thirds of the 2016 presidential campaign events [were in just six states,](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/campaign-events-2016) of which North Carolina is the most rural one, with still over [60% of the population living in urban areas](https://priceonomics.com/the-most-urbanized-states-in-america/).
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.3. Con: With the internet and mass media, the political messaging individual voters receive is no longer a function of the state in which they live.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.3.1. Con: [In-person campaign stops](http://www.gmu.edu/schools/chss/economics/icesworkingpapers.gmu.edu/pdf/1031.pdf) by candidates have a powerful psychological effect that is not present in TV and radio coverage of such events.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.3.2. Pro: A candidate's every word is scrutinized and analyzed by the media, regardless of where it is said.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.3.3. Con: Campaign events are more than just physical visits. They are an indication of a candidate's concern for a particular state.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.3.4. Con: The Electoral College handles federal elections. People who are are worried about what a politician is going to do for their state should be more interested in their state representative that goes to Congress.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.4. Pro: Citizens of very small states have an outsized impact compared to citizens of large states. Iowa voters get much more attention and concern than California voters.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.4.1. Con: Iowa has an outsized impact because it has one of the earliest primaries, making most candidates focus on it. In general elections, its significance falls to that of most non-swing states.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.2.4.2. Pro: California receives little attention during the campaign, even though the Democrats have little chance of winning without it.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.6.3. Pro: Coalitions would lead to a candidate reflecting policies more widely supported, as every vote won over will improve the candidate's chances of winning.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.7. Con: The general election is only one stage of the election process. Swing states get less attention during earlier stages.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.7.1. Con: If a state only matters during the primary, then the voters of that state effectively only get to choose between candidates of a single party, after which the winner-take-all system essentially promises their votes to that winner.
1.2.2.4.4.1.1.7.2. Pro: Smaller states like [Iowa](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/11/27/first-in-the-nation-the-all-important-early-states-of-iowa-and-new-hampshire/) often get much more attention early in the primary process.
1.2.2.4.4.1.2. Pro: Out of the 13 smallest states in the U.S., [New Hampshire is the only swing state](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/section_9.4).
1.2.2.4.5. Pro: A country is about more than just the people living in it. It's also about the resources that enable those people to live and carry on an existence. The Electoral College protects areas with important resources from being ignored by people in densely populated areas.
1.2.2.4.6. Pro: A large portion of the US population lives in a few densely populated areas.
1.2.2.4.6.1. Pro: Abolishing the Electoral College would cause candidates to reduce the focus of their campaign, as 51% of the US population lives in only [146 counties](https://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-the-united-states-lives-in-these-counties-2013-9) out of 3,242 counties in the US. \(4.5%\) Campaigns would likely target the top 200, meaning their campaign would focus on a geographic 6% of America.
1.2.2.4.6.1.1. Con: This claim ignores the fact that the top 200 counties includes a county from almost every state, so this would require a candidate to campaign across the entire country, an improvement from the current situation.
1.2.2.4.6.1.1.1. Con: They would have to campaign across the country, but only in urban areas. They could ignore all the people in rural areas. And, currently, we have a bigger urban/rural political divide than any of our geographical divides.
1.2.2.4.6.1.1.2. Con: They campaign across the entire country since the swing states are distributed all throughout the country.
1.2.2.4.6.1.2. Pro: If candidates ignore the non-swing states they expect to carry, before long "those" will be swing states, too. In contrast, a straight majority allows rural areas and "fly-over" states to be shut out of power entirely. That creates a dangerous situation.
1.2.2.4.6.1.2.1. Con: This claim makes the incorrect assumption that places vote as one. Whether discussing urban or suburban or rural, political and personal beliefs and values are varied. Just because a left wing candidate takes most of a major urban area doesn't mean that they get all of the votes from that area. The needs of rural individuals would still be important to anyone hoping to win.
1.2.2.4.6.1.2.2. Con: Fly-over states are not shut out of power entirely. They have representatives in the House and Senate that will not be affected if the Electoral College is changed or abolished.
1.2.2.4.6.1.3. Con: People vote, not geographic areas. The fairest system gives equal weight to the votes of individual people, not individual geographic areas.
1.2.2.4.6.1.3.1. Con: Grouping rich and poor together by region helps combat regionalism and prevent caste systems.
1.2.2.4.6.2. Pro: According to The World Bank, only [18%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?locations=US) of the US population lives in rural areas.
1.2.2.4.6.2.1. Con: The subject context was urban populations, and this point dealt only with rural populations, not suburban populations, so the data is incomplete in the context of the subject claim.
1.2.2.4.6.3. Con: If a candidate managed to get 100% support in all of [the 100 largest cities in America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population#United_States), they would lose with only 20% of the vote.
1.2.2.4.6.3.1. Con: We should not assume candidates would solely focus on densely populated areas. Even if they did, the [MSAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_statistical_areas) \(Metropolitan Statistical Areas\) and their populations include suburbs, which candidates would effectively target if they focused on the 100 largest cities. That includes significantly more than 20% of the voting population.
1.2.2.4.6.4. Pro: The [top five urban areas](https://www.thoughtco.com/largest-metropolitan-areas-1435135) have a combined population of more than 60 million. That is about 20% of the country. Campaigning in only 5 areas and reaching 20% of the populace allows candidates to ignore large swaths of the country.
1.2.2.4.6.4.1. Con: Of those urban areas only about 24 million are registered voters, nor do they vote unanimously for a single candidate. Candidates will need more than urban centers to win an election.
1.2.2.4.6.4.1.1. Con: Candidates would need more than those five urban centers to win an election, but that does not extend to needing more than just urban areas. There are a whole lot more people in densely-populated areas by definition.
1.2.2.4.6.4.2. Pro: Without the Electoral College, it would only take four states to win the presidency by simple majority vote, [California](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2016/comm/voting_age_population/cb16-tps58_voting_california-social.html), [Florida](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2016/comm/voting_age_population/cb16-tps40_voting_florida-social.html), [New York](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2016/comm/voting_age_population/cb16-tps49_voting_ny-social.html), and [Texas](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2016/comm/voting_age_population/cb16-tps25_voting_texas-social.html). This would relegate campaign events to an ever smaller group of areas as population density increases in many areas such as along the California coast and the megalopolis of the greater New York City area from DC to Baltimore
1.2.2.4.6.4.2.1. Con: This is fallacious reasoning based upon thinking perpetuated by the Electoral College. If we get rid of the Electoral College then 'New York' will not vote. Each person IN New York will have a vote. The vote of 'Florida' will not be what we care about, it will be the votes of each Floridian.
1.2.2.4.7. Pro: Under a majority vote system, candidates will run on policies that benefit high population states and will ignore smaller states.
1.2.2.4.7.1. Con: Under a popular vote, state boundaries would be completely irrelevant to the winner of the election.
1.2.2.4.8. Pro: The Electoral College makes the power of states more important than the power of a city. Each state has a say, rather than things being dictated by the biggest cities.
1.2.2.4.8.1. Con: The Electoral College problem is that it allows candidates to treat certain areas as blocks with their interests in mind, so they don't have to care about minority interests.
1.2.2.4.8.1.1. Pro: Big cities are filled with people with different viewpoints. A candidate getting 55% of the vote in one of them still has 45% against, which proves that winning a particular place doesn't mean that all the votes have been won.
1.2.2.4.9. Con: Rather than equalizing, the Electoral College gives lesser populated areas disproportionately more power, and they can dominate the country in the same way.
1.2.2.4.9.1. Pro: In a democracy, domination by a selected minority \(in this case rural areas\) is not necessarily preferable, and most likely worse, than domination by the majority.
1.2.2.4.10. Pro: The Electoral College is able to represent [rural interests](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/05/23/killing-electoral-college-means-rural-americans-would-be-serfs-column/3770424002/) that would otherwise go entirely unexpressed at the national level. Abolishing the Electoral College would leave vast swaths of the country politically disenfranchised.
1.2.2.4.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.1.
1.2.2.4.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.6.1.
1.2.2.4.10.3. Con: The interests of rural states are already expressed through equal representation in the US Senate. The Electoral College was never intended to provide increased rural representation in presidential elections, as those interests are accounted for in Congress.
1.2.2.4.10.4. Con: The Electoral College does not currently focus the attention of candidates in rural areas. The electoral college focuses [candidates on swing states](https://citizenstakeaction.org/why-fix-the-electoral-college/), which are not typically rural states.
1.2.2.4.10.4.1. Pro: Pennsylvania is a swing state. It has both rural and urban areas. But it’s often lumped in with the “[coastal elites](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Coastal%20Elite)” by conservatives who mean it to be disparaging. But Harrisburg is the capital in the western part of the state, which is the rural half, and the state government is dominated by conservatives. Candidates usually visit both the big cities and the rural areas throughout a campaign.
1.2.2.4.10.4.2. Con: That states with highest ranking population centers all tend to vote the same way also highlights the importance of the Electoral College.
1.2.2.4.10.4.3. Con: The original point \(that candidates would focus too much on population-dense areas in a popular vote system\) still stands. Candidates focus on states with many college votes that are also likely to flip between one party or another \(such as Ohio or Florida\), as opposed to populous urban areas where a candidate can reach more people. The existence of swing states proves that the Electoral College is working as intended.
1.2.2.4.10.5. Con: The Electoral College has little impact on the policies implemented for or against rural areas and small states.
1.2.2.4.10.5.1. Pro: The House of Representatives is the mechanism by which states' needs are represented. The Electoral College has no effect on that institution and therefore will not affect the representation of the states.
1.2.2.4.10.5.2. Pro: Candidates already focus on the most populous parts of the country, only visiting rural areas during primaries. Removing the Electoral College would not change this.
1.2.2.4.10.5.2.1. Pro: Rural voters have plenty of geographically elected officials, such as mayors, city or county councils, sheriffs, congressmen and senators to rely upon.
1.2.2.4.10.5.2.2. Pro: It matters little, in this respect, if there is an Electoral College. Candidates will put their resources where the most people are. It would be a waste of money to hold a rally in rural farmland when you can communicate with far more people in a large community.
1.2.2.4.10.5.3. Pro: Since many rural states are considered 'safe seats', these states see their representation diminished, as presidents receive no electoral benefits for catering policy to their needs.
1.2.2.4.10.5.3.1. Pro: Candidates are going to focus on areas where victory is possible, but not guaranteed. Time and resources spent in an area that consistently votes for your party would be better spent in an undecided region.
1.2.2.4.10.6. Pro: About 63% of the US population lives in cities, which make up only [3.5%](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-33.html) of the total American land area.
1.2.2.4.10.6.1. Con: It's impossible for a presidential candidate to visit every county. The Electoral College doesn't diversify, it just changes which counties are visited.
1.2.2.4.10.6.2. Con: The Electoral College creates "[swing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state)," which are far more imbalanced than the the 50% of the country living in certain counties. Without the Electoral College, candidates still have to appeal to 50% of voters overall, compared to just 50% of swing state voters.
1.2.2.4.10.6.3. Pro: 97% of the country’s land mass is rural and [19.3% of the population lives there](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/rural-america.html), which shows the importance of protecting rural interests.
1.2.2.4.10.6.4. Con: This is not a problem, because this is proportionate representation. If a state has half the number of voters, it should have half the amount of impact.
1.2.2.4.10.6.4.1. Con: [California, Texas, and New York are all very populous states](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/CA,FL,NY,TX/PST045219), but their problems and issues are very different from not only each other but also from states like Alaska, Wyoming, and Nebraska. The Electoral College makes sure that even states with smaller populations have a voice.
1.2.2.4.10.7. Con: A common argument for the Electoral College is that it protects minorities like people in rural states, but it only elects the president.
1.2.2.4.10.7.1. Pro: The Electoral College can't create any sort of balance, or even things out. It is basically binary, it can either completely ignore the will of the minority, or completely ignore the will of the majority, which is not better.
1.2.2.5. Pro: By living in the same geographical area, the people of that area will all have some similar concerns. If those concerns conflict with concerns of less populated areas then there must be some mechanism to make sure that the more densely populated areas' interests do not always take precedence.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: [Cultures vary as a function of distance.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/cultural-distance) The goal of the Electoral College is to preserve and speak for the various cultures of the US. It does not exist to represent the popular and possibly viral culture of the time. The Electoral College promotes diversity and prevents hostile culture takeovers.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Large population areas could force low population areas to pay for social choices [they don't agree with](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2017-07-07/why-cities-and-rural-areas-have-such-different-politics). \(e.g. Sanctuary Cities, abortion on demand in the 9th month, free education, free health care\).
1.2.2.5.1.2. Con: At [no point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College#Background) in its formation or history was the Electoral College designed or intended to "preserve culture".
1.2.2.5.2. Con: Rural voters' special interests can harmfully capture mainstream politics.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: A system that [gives greater representation to rural areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/upshot/as-american-as-apple-pie-the-rural-votes-disproportionate-slice-of-power.html) could be skewed by whatever prevalent [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) exists in those areas, which tends to give [conservatism an edge in](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/upshot/america-political-divide-urban-rural.html) an Electoral College system.
1.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: One example is [farm subsidies](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/agriculture/subsidies), which cost a lot of taxpayer money and do not further any real needs \(to produce food more efficiently for example\). Being able to debate this instead of living with it due to the excessive influence of rural voters would be good.
1.2.2.5.3. Con: The president is charged with representing all citizens and he or she does not make law, therefore it is not important that less populated political entities should have more voice in choosing the president. The [laws that will most directly affect states are made in Congress](https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/how-our-laws-are-made).
1.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: The Congress is the mechanism by which the needs of the less populated areas are represented.
1.2.2.5.3.2. Con: The president does have some power to directly affect states by executive orders and by directing federal agencies.
1.2.2.5.4. Con: Being a member of a natural minority with shared interests is not a sufficient reason to have one's vote weighted more heavily than that of someone from the marjority.
1.2.2.5.5. Pro: Because the U.S. is so [geographically and culturally diverse](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/activity/cultural-diversity-united-states/), it needs these protections from the Electoral College to protect the rights of smaller states that would be totally ignored without it.
1.2.2.5.5.1. Con: This claim assumes that densely populated areas and smaller states have completely divergent interests and that densely populated areas around the country are monolithic in their interests. Neither is true.
1.2.2.5.5.2. Pro: The Electoral College only really alters votes to establish a bare minimum amount of influence for each state, so that states like [Wyoming will always have at least 3 votes out of 538.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/)
1.2.2.5.6. Con: [Democratic republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_republic) are not a simple majority rule. Thus neither group will always have precedence over the other.
1.2.2.5.7. Con: Concerns of individual geographical areas are mainly addressed in local municipal government, not national government or national elections.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Smaller states have a slightly disproportionate number of electors because electors given to a state are equal to the number of representatives plus two for their senators. Since even the tiniest state gets two senators, the Electoral College gives a disproportional advantage to smaller states.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: Giving a disproportionate number of electors to small states is unfairly privileging them, not giving them fair power.
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: If state electoral representation was directly proportional to population, then their votes would be drowned out by the votes of the more populous states.
1.2.2.6.3. Pro: If state electoral representation was directly proportional to population, then states who wanted more voice could cheat by importing voters from other countries through immigration.
1.2.2.6.3.1. Con: The number of people that would need to be "imported" and the amount of effort put into this far outweigh the minor gains in representation.
1.2.2.6.3.1.1. Con: Importing voters could swing a close vote.
1.2.2.6.3.2. Con: All people have their own opinion of who to vote for, so immigrants who come to the United States and vote in elections wouldn't affect the outcomes very much.
1.2.2.6.3.2.1. Con: The state controls who is allowed to immigrate legally. This can be abused to favor immigrants with a [specific ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_restrictions_on_naturalization_in_U.S._law).
1.2.2.6.3.2.2. Con: Given the backlog of individuals seeking legal immigration, it's possible for states to coerce immigrants by allowing them to enter on condition of a pledge to vote a certain way.
1.2.2.6.3.2.2.1. Con: Voter coercion is [illegal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/594) and any such policy would almost certainly be immediately overturned.
1.2.2.7. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.2.
1.2.2.8. Con: Areas do not vote, nor are they promised representation under democracy. It is the people who ought to have influence.
1.2.2.8.1. Con: The United States is a union of States, and [the States are promised representation in the Electoral College](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/electoralcoll.htm). The people are not promised any representation in the Electoral College, as it was built to be elected by state legislatures, not the people.
1.2.2.8.2. Pro: The Electoral College gives more consideration to the space between people than to the people themselves.
1.2.3. Pro: As independent political units, each state has the opportunity to experiment with and use whichever voting method they want. If the Electoral College were abolished, all states would likely be forced to adopt the same voting method.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Maine [recently adopted](https://reason.com/2020/09/23/maine-becomes-first-state-to-try-ranked-choice-voting-for-president/) Instant Runoff Voting for presidential elections.
1.2.3.2. Pro: [Maine and Nebraska](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-do-maine-and-nebraska-split-their-electoral-votes-180976219/) changed their election process to award their electoral votes via the congressional district method.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Instead of the winner-take-all system, they adopted the “[congressional district method](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-do-maine-and-nebraska-split-their-electoral-votes-180976219/).”
1.2.3.2.2. Con: The two states not using winner-take-all use winner by congressional district, which makes the election of electors very vulnerable to [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)(It s a practice intended to establish an unfair political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts, which is most commonly used in first-past-the-post electoral systems.), an issue avoided by a nationwide popular vote.
1.2.3.3. Con: Plurality voting has been justified as "[the simplest and most cost-effective method for identifying a victor in a democracy](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/os-government2e/chapter/the-two-party-system/)."
1.2.3.3.1. Con: The linked page fails to define "cost-effective" with respect to determining the winner of an election.
1.2.4. Con: States are already represented as political units through their allocation of senators and representatives.
1.2.4.1. Con: Originally, the House of Representatives was supposed to represent the people, while senators were supposed to represent the States, but the [17th Amendment](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Direct_Election_Senators.htm) separated the link between the Senate and the States.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: This distinction is between the State's legislature and the people's direct vote. Either way, states still enjoy healthy representation. The Electoral College is a separate, stylistic choice on how to choose a President.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: There is no representation for [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) except for the Electoral College.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Government power in the US is greatly [devolved](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-devolution-revolution-why-congress-is-shifting-a-lot-of-power-to-the-wrong-levels/), meaning state governors have immense power over citizens.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: The US Constitution put in place checks and balances in all three branches to prevent the over-powered control of one branch. State representatives are for the legislative branch; the Electoral College is for the executive branch.
1.2.5. Con: In highlighting states as political actors, the Electoral College [violates the individual's status as a political unit](https://theconversation.com/the-electoral-college-system-isnt-one-person-one-vote-150342).
1.2.5.1. Pro: The Electoral College empowers the state at the expense of individual voters by removing them from direct participation.
1.2.5.2. Pro: [The U.S. is a constitutional republic made up of 50 individual states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States); the general election for president is not a single election but 50 separate elections that must be won.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: If anything, the individual states should be forced to adopt a similar system to allow for equal representation among their residents instead of the current winner take all models.
1.2.5.3. Con: The individual is encouraged to recognize that they are a part of their state first, and the country second.
1.2.6. Pro: The Electoral College is a meaningful and natural institution in a country that is first and foremost a [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic) - a union that needs to respect the voice of all of its states.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The Electoral College was established to ensure that none of the individual states that agreed to join the [United States would lose out on having their interests represented](https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention).
1.2.6.1.1. Con: The [interests of the states are represented in the Senate](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Constitution_Senate.htm), where all states are equal regardless of population.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: Although [California has a population approximating the total of the smallest 20 states](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/11/us/politics/small-state-advantage.html), in the Senate, such states outnumber California in representation 40-2.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: [The Senate](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Origins_AdviceConsent.htm) plays a unique role as a check on both the President and the House and by extension the popular majority.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: With the proliferation of [executive orders](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders) handed down by the president, there is little legislation that requires bipartisan support, that is passing through both houses.
1.2.6.1.2.2. Con: [The Senate balances out the legislative representation](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Origins_Development.htm). The president is the executive power and having a balanced representation is also important in that branch. The Electoral College while not totally fair is more fair to represent large areas and diverse needs.
1.2.6.1.2.3. Pro: All cabinet and judicial appointments must be approved by the Senate; all treaties must receive the consent of two-thirds of the Senate; and, of course, [all legislation must pass through both the House and Senate.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-legislative-branch/)
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: Since the US is a huge country with no uniform interests, it's important to [give multiple voices equal power](https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-united-states-get-rid-of-the-electoral-college/the-electoral-college-serves-the-interests-of-all-people) despite the principles of pure democracy in order for the country to survive as a coherent whole.
1.2.6.2. Con: The [federal aspect of the United States is now much weaker](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/08/how-the-constitutions-federalist-framework-is-being-tested-by-covid-19/) than it was in the 19th century. The president holds far more power than the states do, so it no longer makes sense to have states elect the president.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: [The weakening of the federal nature of the US](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-19/coronavirus-pandemic-shows-challenges-of-u-s-federalism) gives more reason to preserve what remains.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: Because [federalism weakens democratic representation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440509_Does_Federalism_Weaken_Democratic_Representation_in_the_United_States) in the United States, it is slowly losing strength.
1.2.6.3. Con: Federalism was created when people moved very little and one's state or county played a larger role in their identity and interests.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Today, most Americans [move very frequently](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-times-the-average-person-moves/), making borders between states more inconsequential.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: Federalism was created to ensure that [power was shared by the national and state governments](https://www.ushistory.org/gov/3.asp).
1.2.6.4. Pro: The Electoral College aims to dampen pure majoritarian democracy by enshrining protection for minority populations.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: The Electoral College allowed [many states to shift to state-wide elections so party-controlled state legislatures could ascertain a partisan advantage \(p. 5-10\)](http://www.every-vote-equal.com/sites/default/files/everyvoteequal-4th-ed-2013-02-21.pdf).
1.2.6.4.2. Con: The Electoral College is not a fundamental part of America's federalism. Instead, it came to be largely through heated debate and compromise.
1.2.6.4.2.1. Pro: How the president was to be elected changed various times in 1787, having 30 votes over 22 days of discussion. It was eventually undecided and ultimately delegated to the states to choose electors \([p. 68](http://www.every-vote-equal.com/sites/default/files/everyvoteequal-4th-ed-2013-02-21.pdf)\).
1.2.6.4.2.2. Con: The Electoral College is a fundamental part of the US' federalism because it ensures that the elected President becomes an [officer of the states](https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=honors).
1.2.6.4.3. Pro: The Electoral College allows states to operate as miniature [sovereign republics](https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/letters/2018/09/19/The-Electoral-College-shows-the-sovereignty-of-the-states/stories/201809190060), exist as counterweights to the national government and prevent the nationwide consolidation of factional power.
1.2.6.4.3.1. Con: Because the Electoral College allows states to operate as sovereign republics, the electoral integrity of some states, like [California, Oklahoma, and Mississippi](https://theconversation.com/american-elections-ranked-worst-among-western-democracies-heres-why-56485) has demonstrated noticeable shortfalls compared to others.
1.2.6.4.3.2. Pro: Abolishing the Electoral College would imply that states have no sovereignty in the face of the federal government, empowering the federal government to the detriment of local and state representation.
1.2.6.4.3.2.1. Pro: The capacity of states to act as responsible sovereign entities has been eroded tremendously. The last remaining place where states are able to exert sovereignty is through the back door of the Electoral College.
1.2.6.4.3.2.1.1. Con: The [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States) defines the role and function of the Federal Government and was approved by all states upon adoption and any new states upon inclusion in the nation. It is not a "back door."
1.2.6.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: The [incorporation doctrine](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/incorporation_doctrine) is the doctrine through which the Bill of Rights are applied to states, where prior to the doctrine, the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government and federal court cases.
1.2.6.4.3.3. Pro: This function of the Electoral College helps [preserve liberty](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/in-defense-of-the-electoral-college), the chief goal of republican institutions.
1.2.6.5. Pro: If the Electoral College was dumped and direct presidential elections instituted, it would require [elections at the Federal level](https://apnews.com/article/federal-government-role-elections-392a5567755549336fe91132b9fd5908), something that has never existed in the U.S. to date.
1.2.6.5.1. Con: Federal elections would allow the country to [standardize voting rules](https://ballotpedia.org/Why_do_states_have_different_election_rules%3F_\(2020\)) for all, diminishing problems related to voter suppression.
1.2.6.5.2. Pro: A direct presidential election could [undermine the Federal system](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/minority-view-on-the-direct-popular-election-of-the-president/) by removing the states from the electoral process.
1.3. Pro: The Electoral College system results in unfair outcomes for voters.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.
1.3.3. Pro: The Electoral College allocates the [weight of a citizen's vote unequally](https://equalcitizens.us/equal-votes/), based on their state and region, which violates the principle that all men are created equal.
1.3.3.1. Con: This stems from the fact the [rural and urban interests rarely coincide](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/electoral-college-trump-argentina-malaysia-japan-clinton/512153/), in fact, they usually conflict with each other.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Partisan affiliation seems to get shaped by [people’s proximity to a city](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/02/the-divide-between-us-urban-rural-political-differences-rooted-in-geography/).
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: [Rural areas](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/) tend to have a [higher concentration of Republicans](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/) and urban areas tend to identify as Democrats.
1.3.3.2. Con: The Electoral College accounts for the fact that one voter who lives in one state will know better how to run things in their state than a million voters in the big city in a different state.
1.3.3.3. Pro: The Electoral College defies the principle of equality of voters: [one person, one vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man,_one_vote).
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Because electoral votes are determined by Congresspersons + Senators, all states get at least 3 and states such as Wyoming and North Dakota \(population [582,000](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/wyoming/population) and [765,000](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/north-dakota/population), respectively\), get the same 2 Senators as California \([39.4 million](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/california/population), and New York [19.3 million](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/new-york/population) respectively\). So, electoral votes per population are 1 per 716,000 and 1 per 622,600 in Ca. and NY, while 1 per 194,000 and 1 per 255,000 in Wyoming and N. Dakota, respectively.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: Each voter within each state has the equal right to influence the presidential election within their state. That's one person, one vote.
1.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: States elect the US president, not individuals.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.3.
1.3.3.3.4. Pro: The Supreme Court has ruled that 'one person, one vote' applies to voting for [state legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims), local government, and [House of Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesberry_v._Sanders) elections. It should apply to general elections.
1.3.3.3.4.1. Con: It does, but the general population doesn't elect the president. The popular vote in the state only chooses the slate of electors for that state. Those electors choose the president and one person, one vote does apply to that college of electors.
1.3.3.3.5. Pro: The Electoral College causes the votes of some citizens to have substantially more power to select a president than those of other citizens.
1.3.3.3.5.1. Con: The Congress has two houses to apply two different balances of power: in the House, power is distributed proportionally to state population; in the Senate, power is distributed per state and inherently gives low-population states a disproportionate balance of power.
1.3.3.3.5.2. Con: The voting power is not bound to a person, but to a place. Therefore everyone has the same voting power, because everyone is allowed to move.
1.3.3.3.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.3.2.2.
1.3.3.3.5.2.2. Con: The potential to increase or decrease your voting power does not make voting power equal.
1.3.3.3.5.3. Con: The imbalance of electing power built into the Electoral College is intentional, it represents a way to empower residents of smaller states by keeping meaningful sovereignty and differentiation among the states. Large states wield enormous power in other contexts.
1.3.3.3.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2. Con: The extra representation of smaller states is inappropriate when applied to election of president.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.1. Pro: [State identity](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-080812-144642) is no longer as important to citizens as it once was. Most citizens now consider themselves Americans first and state citizens second.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: The idea of the United States as our primary allegiance as citizens is far more foremost in the minds of citizens today than it was in the 1700s. There is no reason to think that the average person today thinks of their state when casting their vote for president.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.2. Pro: The interests of states as entities are represented in both the Senate and the House, which together have power in many ways superior to that of the president. The interests of states as entities do not also need to be represented in the election of a president.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.3. Pro: The disproportionate number of representatives given to smaller states is because the interests of the state as a whole might be underrepresented if the representatives were chosen strictly based on population. But the president represents all citizens, not all states, so one person one vote is a more appropriate model.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.4. Con: If we believe that states have local cultures that vary from state to state, then different weights given to different states' voters could potentially promote election by a broader diversity of cultures or ideologies, not just of larger like-minded populations.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.4.1. Con: Cultures vary significantly within states too, but this variation is not reflected in the current Electoral College system.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.5. Con: If we take seriously the idea that we are a federation of states, then certainly the extra power held by states with large populations is just as warping as the extra power held by states with small populations \(relatively\). It's a compromise between the two, and without assuming which one is correct, we can't say it's inappropriate.
1.3.3.3.5.3.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.5.3.2.1.1.
1.3.3.3.5.3.3. Con: How something was intended doesn't matter.  We have to look at how it functions now.
1.3.3.3.5.3.3.1. Con: How it was intended speaks to whether or not it should be reformed back to it's original intended manner of working, rather than abolished.
1.3.3.3.5.3.4. Pro: The number of electors is equal to the number of members of Congress. Congress was set up as a balance between the interests of the states themselves, and the interests of the people within those states.
1.3.3.3.5.3.4.1. Con: The balance between states themselves and the people of those states that is built into congress is due to there being two houses, the Senate representing the state and the House of Representatives representing the people. Both must agree to pass a law. No such mechanism is carried over into the Electoral College just by basing the number of electors on the total number of senators and representatives.
1.3.3.3.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: There is no distinction between electors allotted to match the number of representatives and those allotted to match the number of senators.
1.3.3.3.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: The votes of all electors count equally. None have the ability to invalidate the votes of others the way that the Senate can invalidate the votes of the House and visa-versa.
1.3.3.3.5.3.4.2. Con: As the number of electors is based on the number of representatives and senators, which is based upon the state's population, small states still have virtually no impact on the electoral outcome.
1.3.3.3.5.4. Con: The Electoral College may unfairly weight votes, but this has no relevance to the fairness of the outcomes. If all states voted unanimously, the outcome would have to be called fair regardless of how weight is distributed.
1.3.3.3.5.5. Pro: The 14th Amendment establishes [equal protection under the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause). Citizens in larger states do not have equal power to those in smaller states in a presidential election.
1.3.3.3.5.5.1. Con: Every voter has equal standing to participate in their state's process for assigning electoral votes. That is sufficient equality to meet the legal requirements of the 14th Amendment.
1.3.3.3.6. Con: If every vote was equal, California would dominate the presidency, meaning the executive would be beholden to California's needs at the expense of the remaining states.
1.3.3.3.6.1. Con: There exist a variety of views in California just as there are in every state. A popular vote gives every voter in every state a voice.
1.3.3.3.6.2. Con: If every vote were equal, California would only control [12%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+california+%2F+population+of+US+to+percent) of the votes for president.
1.3.3.3.6.2.1. Con: Even with only 12% of the votes, as a state, California would be able to exert significantly more influence over smaller states than it does presently.
1.3.3.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: 12% vote control would equal the combined control of the bottom 22 states by population and DC.
1.3.3.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: In 9 of the last 10 [presidential elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin), the margin of victory in the popular vote was less than 10 percentage points, Reagan's second election being the exception.
1.3.3.3.6.2.1.3. Con: California wouldn't then, nor does it currently, exert influence over smaller states.
1.3.3.3.6.2.1.4. Con: About [20% of Californians lean Republican](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-california-voting-history/). Thus during a presidential election, the Republican candidate would gain about 4% support from California, as opposed to the 0 electoral votes under the Electoral College and [general ticket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_\(United_States\)#Evolution_to_the_general_ticket).
1.3.3.3.6.3. Pro: The needs of California voters are not the same as the needs of the voters of other states. A solution popular and workable in California may be totally unsuitable for Virginia.
1.3.3.3.7. Pro: The Electoral College is not proportional to the actual populations of states anymore. So although a state may only have three electoral votes, the amount of voters in the state per electoral vote is way less than in high population states, thus, those voters are disproportionately powerful.
1.3.3.3.7.1. Pro: Furthermore, small states with minimal electoral votes are for the most part, dependent on larger states for aide, yet harbor a hatred for said large states. This leads to the current situation.
1.3.4. Pro: The Electoral College is not an adequate form of democracy, as electors in many states can vote differently than the result of the election.
1.3.4.1. Pro: One person's vote can not only be less valuable \(because [the weight of their vote depends on their geographic location](https://www.fairvote.org/the_electoral_college#how_the_electoral_college_works_today)\) but can also be given to a party opposite the one that the person's state voted for.
1.3.4.2. Con: Faithless electors are [rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector#List_of_faithless_electors) and have never altered the outcome of a presidential election.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.
1.3.4.3. Con: Electing representatives that, in turn, elect office-holders is a form of democracy. This is how US senators were elected for the country's first century, and how political parties decide who becomes their [presidential nominee today](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/elections/presidential-election-process/political-primaries-how-are-candidates-nominated/).
1.3.5. Pro: Alternative election methods would produce fairer outcomes.
1.3.5.1. Pro: A [highly-representative electoral system that selects by consensus](https://www.nordicmodelusa.org/policy/government-and-representation/elections/presidential-elections/) can enhance total representation.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Changing presidential elections to a popular vote would give states an incentive to increase voter turnout and restore voting rights to more people to increase their state's influence on the presidential election.
1.3.5.3. Pro: [Ranked Choice Voting](http://www.fairvote.org/rcv#rcvbenefits), which allows voters to rank candidates in order of their support, may be a fairer way of doing elections.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: The vast majority of the divergence from the will of the majority is due to how most states allocate their electoral votes, not an issue with the Electoral College itself.
1.3.5.3.2. Pro: Ranked Choice Voting has a higher [voter satisfaction efficiency](http://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSE/) than simple majority systems like the Electoral College.
1.3.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.10.
1.3.6. Pro: Many states use a [winner-takes-all system](https://ballotpedia.org/Winner-take-all)(Winner-take-all or winner-takes-all is an electoral system in which a single political party or group can elect every office within a given district or jurisdiction.) where a candidate could get 51% of the vote, but all of the Electoral College vote.
1.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.6.2. Con: The concern stems from how most states choose to allocate their electoral votes \(winner-takes-all\), not in the Electoral College process itself.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The winner-take-all system can be altered without abolishing the Electoral College.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: States have little incentive to do away with their winner-take-all allocation of electors, as it tends to maximize the influence of their constituents' majority preference.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Doing away with the Electoral College would open up the ability to adopt a popular vote that would eliminate the above-mentioned effect.
1.3.6.2.1.1.2. Pro: A small shift in support for a candidate in a swing state can result in [a massive swing in electoral votes in winner-take-all systems](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/oct/30/electoral-college-explained-how-biden-faces-an-uphill-battle-in-the-us-election). As such, candidates are more likely to address issues specific to that state's constituents, possibly even at the expense of other states, in order to shift the plurality in their favor.
1.3.6.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Such favoritism is less likely in a distributive state, as the shift in support will only proportionally shift electoral votes. States wish to maximize influence.
1.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.5.2.2.
1.3.6.4. Pro: The winner-takes-all system creates tons of wasted votes. Every single vote for the losing candidate is worthless \(the same as if those people never voted at all\) and every vote over the majority for the winning candidate is unnecessary and thus wasted.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: The winner-take-all nature of the electoral college deters citizens from participating in the political process, because it leads to situations where one vote won't change the outcome on the state level, thus rendering the votes of people outside swing states essentially meaningless.
1.3.6.4.2.1. Con: Every vote counts because it’s added to the collective votes.
1.3.6.4.2.1.1. Con: The votes are not added to the nation's collective votes, they're added to the state's collective votes.
1.3.6.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: If the state is 90% Republican and 10% Democratic, all the votes go Republican. If it is 51% Republican and 49% Democratic, all the votes go Republican. If your state goes Republican, and you are a Democrat, your votes are consumed by the Electoral College, and your voting power goes to the person you voted against.
1.3.6.4.2.1.2. Pro: Which seats are considered 'safe' changes quite frequently.
1.3.6.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Georgia, up until recently, was considered a safe Republican seat. However, Georgia voters had voted for Democratic Presidential candidates as recently as [1992](https://www.270towin.com/states/Georgia).
1.3.6.4.2.2. Con: If that is an issue against the Electoral College, then we would also need to do away with a lot of state non-presidential elections, since they can also be viewed as "all or nothing" depending upon the proportions of people in one party.
1.3.6.4.2.2.1. Con: There is a movement for proportional representation, which would decrease the all or nothing problem at the state and local level.
1.3.6.4.2.2.2. Con: It is not valid to say that we should not deal with a problem on one level because it exists on multiple levels.
1.3.6.4.2.2.3. Con: Rather than "doing away with an election" because it behaves in an all or nothing manner, the voting method used for such elections should be changed to amend the undesired "all or nothing" situations.
1.3.6.4.2.2.4. Pro: Winners of state elections in [California](https://ballotpedia.org/Electoral_systems_in_California)(In California, state legislators \(including senators and representatives\) are elected via plurality vote in single-winner contests.\nState executives \(governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, controller, secretary of state, and treasurer\) are elected via plurality vote in single-winner contests.\nUnited States Senators and United States Representatives are also elected via plurality vote in single-winner contests.) are also portioned by simple plurality in a single winner system.
1.3.6.4.2.3. Pro: The electoral college discourages voting in areas where elections are not close. In a district that's 60-40, effectively 40% of the votes don't count.
1.3.6.4.2.3.1. Pro: By the doctrine of wasted votes, where all votes for a losing party, and all votes above what was required for the winning party to win, 60% of the votes in this given scenario are wasted.
1.3.6.4.2.4. Pro: Because the Electoral College happens halfway through the voting process, dissenters are actually counted for the people they oppose.
1.3.6.4.2.4.1. Con: That is true, but it's not the Electoral College that does that. States decide how to apportion their electoral votes. Some states split them by percentage of the vote. Most do winner-takes-all, since they tend to be dominated by one party that wants to shut out the other party, but that decision is, as it should be, made at the state level.
1.3.6.4.2.4.1.1. Con: It is not intrinsic to the electoral process that this must occur, but it is the electoral process that allows states to decide to do this. It is one of the many problems with the Electoral College, and while this one could, theoretically, be fixed, the problem does currently exist because of the Electoral College system.
1.3.6.4.2.4.2. Pro: For example, the voting power of Michigan is calculated based at least partly on its population. So someone living in Michigan contributes, to some small extent, to the power of their electoral college, which means that though they might vote for candidate A, if candidate B takes the state, the voter's influence is given to the person they opposed.
1.3.6.4.2.5. Con: Voting is always a matter of taking the round-off somewhere. If Party X gets 51% of the vote, Party Y voters cannot change the outcome. Or, consider the case of representatives of each district voting in Congress. They are behaving mathematically like an electoral college, taking the majority opinion from each district. The objection here is not just about the electoral college but the nature of democracy.
1.3.6.4.2.5.1. Con: The electoral college introduces rounding errors only in the rare case of states that apportion their electors proportionally. For states where all of the electors go to the winner the error is far worse than rounding. In those states the minority votes are completely obliterated.
1.3.6.4.2.5.1.1. Con: This does not refute the claim above. In the case of winner-take-all districts of any sort, House members for instance, minority votes are "completely obliterated". We can easily have a situation where most voters are X but most representatives are Y. The electoral college taking the round-off by making states winner-take-all is the same mechanism with the same effect, a single voice for a physical/political area.
1.3.6.4.2.5.2. Con: The above example is not about the nature of democracy, but of the voting methods currently used to represent the opinions of the people.
1.3.6.4.2.6. Con: People who don't feel their state represents their interests can move to another state.
1.3.6.4.2.6.1. Con: Some people may not have the option of moving if their job or family is tied to a specific location.
1.3.6.4.2.7. Con: Its purpose is to allow middle states fair representation versus east/west coast populations. City dwellers versus rural dwellers have an equal voice.
1.3.6.4.3. Pro: The Electoral College nullifies the votes of individuals that disagree with the majority of their state.
1.3.6.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.3.6.4.3.2. Pro: In [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election), Clinton received 60% of the popular vote in New York but won all 29 electoral votes. That's 12 unearned electoral votes from NY, which is enough to negate the electoral votes from several smaller states, not to mention the 40% of New Yorkers whose vote was rendered irrelevant.
1.3.6.4.3.3. Con: In any election to a single-seat, all the votes for anyone besides the winner are rendered irrelevant. That some votes are rendered irrelevant does not draw a distinction between the Electoral College and any other election system.
1.3.7. Con: Greater than proportional representation for small states seeks fairness in a way the popular vote does not.
1.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3.7.2. Pro: The Electoral College is how the Founding Fathers compromised on a process that would be most fair to most voters, by giving equal voice to every voter in every state, based on population, as measured by the number of representatives in Congress.
1.3.7.3. Con: States do not have uniform density, so in many cases, the densely populated urban areas still can control all the electoral votes for a certain state.
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: The Electoral College confines this effect to one state rather than the whole country.
1.3.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.4.2.6.
1.3.8. Pro: The possibility of a candidate winning the election but losing the popular vote undermines the [perceived legitimacy of the victory](https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/api-gateway/apsa/assets/orp/resource/item/603a9a7c47a4c0453abaa58b/original/the-effect-of-electoral-inversions-on-democratic-legitimacy-evidence-from-the-united-states.pdf).
1.3.8.1. Pro: The popular vote takes advantage of the [wisdom of crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds) so that the best candidate is chosen for the job.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: The ["wisdom of the crowds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds) is a hypothetical, unscientific phenomena that can in no capacity be a factor in reforming the electoral system of any state.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Democracy is driven by the concept of [rule by the majority.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule)(Majority rule is a decision rule that selects alternatives which have a majority, that is, more than half the votes. It is the binary decision rule used most often in influential decision-making bodies, including all the legislatures of democratic nations.) A system where a candidate is chosen by the minority is not a true democracy.
1.3.8.2.1. Con: The United States is a [constitutional republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic), not a democracy.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Con: A constitutional republic is a [form of government​](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_republic) based on democracy, which is a [system of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy).
1.3.8.2.1.2. Pro: The Electoral College, as manifested in the US Constitution, is an amalgam of republicanism and parliamentarianism with a check to not let either override the will of an overwhelming majority of the popular vote.
1.3.8.2.1.2.1. Pro: The Electoral College is comprised of the same number of electors as there are senators and representatives in the 50 US states, making the balance of powers electing the president roughly equal to the average balance of power in the Senate and House.
1.3.8.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that the votes are divided up the same way does not prove or even suggest that it must be a good way to divide it up.
1.3.8.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Even if we were to assume that the current system for electing the legislative branch was exactly what it should be to represent the various states, the presidential election is to put someone in office who represents the country as the whole. As such, it makes sense to set up a system where the person elected represents most of the people in the country.
1.3.8.2.1.2.2. Con: The idea that the U.S. should be a republic is an outdated concept. It is as absurd to group people into voting blocks based upon what state they happen to reside in, and adjust the power of their votes on that basis, as it would be to have people vote based upon which religion they subscribe to and adjust the values of those blocks.
1.3.8.2.1.3. Pro: The US is a republic of independent states as intended by the Founding Fathers, and the Electoral College is designed to represent the independence of the States.
1.3.8.2.1.3.1. Con: The US was a republic of independent states. Over time it's moved closer and closer to becoming a democracy, and largely for the greater good.
1.3.8.2.1.4. Pro: The United States was never intended to be a direct democracy. In the early days, senators were [not directly elected in states](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=58) \(they were elected by state legislatures\), and, in most states, only male landowners were franchised to vote.
1.3.8.2.1.4.1. Con: Choosing the president by popular vote would not make the US a direct democracy.  It would continue to be a representative democracy.
1.3.8.2.2. Pro: Winning more votes should win you an election, even if they come from a few states. Doing otherwise makes the votes of people in those states mean less than those in others.
1.3.8.3. Pro: Currently it is possible to win the presidential election with only [22% of the popular vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k&t=258s) if you win the right states. Even if unlikely, this is a possible and permitted outcome of the system and is a sign of a broken democracy.
1.3.8.3.1. Con: The video in the parent claim is based on a lot of faulty reasoning. That exceedingly unlikely outcome is only \(theoretically\) possibly because of how states award their electoral votes. That is not a problem with the electoral college itself, but with how states allocate outcomes.
1.3.9. Con: The Electoral College helps prevent a [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).
1.3.9.1. Pro: Democracies fail because of [tyranny of the majority](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1520111?seq=1). The Electoral College, divided sovereignty, and state legislature election of Senators are protections against this.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: The Electoral College only protects one minority: those living in less populous states. It does not protect minority religion voters, minority racial groups, or minority educated groups.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Con: Regional boundaries are physical, definable, and testable. Religion, sexual preferences, race, etc. are mutable and subjective, making it harder to create objective boundaries between them.
1.3.9.1.1.2. Pro: The Electoral College effectively says that one's location is the only defined minority status worthy of protection.
1.3.9.1.2. Con: The best way to [defend from tyranny is an educated populace](https://www.timbertrainingcenter.com/what-does-wez/c716e9-thomas-jefferson-quotes-on-tyranny) and to create a government that prevents a tyrant from acting, not by changing the Electoral College.
1.3.9.1.3. Pro: The Electoral College exists for the same reasons we have the Senate, the [Filibuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate), and [Supermajorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States): winning more votes shouldn't win you an election if all those votes are in a few states.
1.3.9.1.3.1. Pro: The Constitution gives the states, instead of the individuals, the [right to choose the president](https://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/electoral-college-protects-all-americans-against-the-tyranny-of-the-majority).
1.3.9.1.3.2. Con: [The tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority)(The tyranny of the majority \(or tyranny of the masses\) is an inherent weakness to majority rule in which the majority of an electorate pursues exclusively its own objectives at the expense of those of the minority factions.) applies to the legislature, not the executive, therefore examples utilizing senate, filibuster, and super-majorities are irrelevant.
1.3.9.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.8.2.
1.3.9.2. Pro: In a strict democracy, there is a strong danger of the 'tyranny of the majority', in which the needs of the minority on any given topic [tend to be ignored](https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/in-democracy-minorities-are-ignored-and-the-voters-are-ignorant/). The Electoral College is needed to mitigate this danger.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: All of the safeguards against the tyranny of the majority remain in place in the other two branches of the government. The Electoral College is about electing a single office, not representing various groups against each other.
1.3.9.2.2. Con: The Electoral College has certified the results of the majority for all but [five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote) US elections, and yet this never produced any 'tyranny' in America.
1.3.9.2.3. Pro: Removing the Electoral College would allow further encroachment by the federal government into local decision-making.
1.3.9.3. Con: [Tyranny of the minority](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024687?seq=1) is just as bad as tyranny of the majority.
1.3.9.3.1. Pro: The electoral college does not end tyranny of the majority; it replaces it with tyranny of the minority by letting them choose the president instead. The bill of rights is used to protect minority rights by preventing laws or policies that harm rights even if the people support it. This prevents tyranny of the majority from being a large problem in the US. Instead, the electoral college simply allows a president to undermine the will of the people without cause or proof of minority harm.
1.3.9.4. Con: -> See 1.3.9.2.2.
1.3.9.5. Con: The Electoral College only protects a very specific minority. People in sparsely populated states like Wyoming. It actually encourages this minority to impose their beliefs on other minorities like gays living in California.
1.3.10. Con: In [91% of cases](https://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/), there has been no contradiction between the results of the Electoral College and popular vote results.
1.3.10.1. Con: When the Electoral College produces the same outcome as a popular vote, it cannot be said to be superior. When it produces a different outcome, it must be inferior as the difference can only be attributed to arbitrary geographical factors.
1.3.10.1.1. Con: If the framers wanted the popular voice, they wouldn't have added the Electoral College to the system. The reason it's there is because it sometimes produces results that are different from the popular vote.
1.3.10.2. Con: Without the Electoral College, there would be no such contradiction: whoever wins the popular vote becomes the president.
1.3.10.3. Con: That means that 9% of American presidents were voted into office without winning over the majority of voters.
1.3.10.4. Con: That's not entirely accurate. Based on the [12th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxii) a majority is needed for a victory. [About a third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin) of presidential elections didn't have a popular majority winner, only a popular plurality. Without the electoral college those would be passed on to congress. It could result in fewer not more elections chosen by the people unless the 12th amendment is also changed.
1.4. Con: The Electoral College should be reformed, rather than abolished.
1.4.1. Pro: It will likely be impossible to abolish the Electoral College.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Abolishing the Electoral College would require the very states whose influence would be reduced to ratify a [Constitutional amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_abolition_amendment) to make the change. This is unlikely to happen.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: [The National Popular Vote Insterstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) has the power to override the Electoral College and award the state elector votes to the winner of the national popular vote without an act of congress.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would require 270 electoral votes-worth of states to pass legislation since states are given the right to choose how electors are chosen, [and there are less than 270 swing state electoral votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state#:~:text=If%20current%20trends%20from%20the,%2C%20Michigan%2C%20Pennsylvania%2C%20and%20Wisconsin), so this could be achieved without swing states complying.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Even if swing states would be necessary, [some already have passed legislation in one and two chambers, and in Colorado it's even on the ballot in 2020.](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state-status)
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: [Abolishing the Electoral College](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/22/705627996/abolishing-the-electoral-college-would-be-more-complicated-than-it-may-seem) would take a Constitutional amendment, [which would require](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution) the votes of two-thirds of the U.S. House of Representatives, two-thirds of the Senate, and three-fourths of the states.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Changing the Constitution is not the only way to functionally remove the Electoral College.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: If states holding a majority of the electoral vote decided that their votes automatically went to the national popular vote winner, the Electoral College would functionally be defunct.
1.4.1.2. Con: Since the Bill of Rights, the Constitution has been [amended more times to correct for election flaws](https://law.tamu.libguides.com/c.php?g=513904&p=3510977) than for any other reason. 11/17 amendments were centered on election-based flaws.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Abolishing the Electoral College is a highly contentious political issue: only [23%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/320744/americans-support-abolishing-electoral-college.aspx) of Republicans support the change.
1.4.2. Con: Given the condition of the Electoral College, the reforms it needs would be practically identical to abolishing it and replacing it with a more just system.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.4.3. Pro: [Representation in the House](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/31/u-s-population-keeps-growing-but-house-of-representatives-is-same-size-as-in-taft-era/) has not increased in over a hundred years. By adding 216 seats and automatically adding new electors to the Electoral College, it could become fairer for all states.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In 1929, Congress, by statute, [limited the number of representatives in the House to 435](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/The-Permanent-Apportionment-Act-of-1929/). Instead, we should return to the Constitutional provision of the number of citizens per representatives.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Increasing the number of representatives significantly would likely decrease the efficiency of the legislature, with more people seeking to speak and longer votes.
1.4.3.2. Con: Making the Electoral College 'fairer to states' might be better than what we do now, but it is a distant second to making it equal for all citizens.
1.4.3.3. Pro: [Denmark](https://data.ipu.org/content/denmark?chamber_id=13376) has one representative for every 31,000 people. [The UK](https://data.ipu.org/content/united-kingdom?chamber_id=13511) has one per 100,000. By contrast, the [US electoral college](https://data.ipu.org/content/united-states-america?chamber_id=13387) only has one per 600,000 people.
1.4.4. Pro: Allocating electors proportionally to the population of each state would help ensure equal representation of voters.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Using [proportional popular vote](https://www.tremr.com/Wolfe2018/proportional-popular-vote) and [ranked-choice voting](http://www.fairvote.org/rcv#rcvbenefits) would make the Electoral College more representative.
1.4.4.2. Con: If states moved to a proportional system for awarding of Electoral College votes, frequently no candidate would receive the [absolute majority](https://www.bustle.com/articles/191376-how-many-electoral-votes-is-an-absolute-majority-the-number-changes-as-years-pass) required in the Electoral College.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: This would throw more elections to the House for resolution of the presidency and to the Senate for the vice president.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: This would only be an issue if a third party candidate managed to secure enough electoral votes to prevent a main candidate from passing 270 votes.
1.4.4.3. Con: Proportional representation unduly hurts [minority voices](https://www.readcube.com/articles/10.22146%2Fpcd.25722). The US system is strong because it values minority voices.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: [Proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) not only allows for both Democrats and Republicans to be represented, but also other parties that normally do not make the cut in the current system.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: If a minority is the majority in one state, they carry the state electors. A minority spread thinly across the country will not carry any states, nor electors. A minority can gain a voice by grouping together.
1.4.4.4. Pro: The Electoral College could be reformed by having all states use [proportional allocation](https://electoralcollegereform.weebly.com/proportional-allocation.html#)(Proportional representation \(PR\) characterizes electoral systems in which divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body.) of electoral votes, rather than "winner-takes-all".
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: If the people within a state wish for their electoral votes to be cast to reflect that state's population's vote, they have the power to do that.
1.4.4.4.1.1. Con: The fact that the states can decide how to use the Electoral College, and that many of them could make it work better does not mean that it would be any better than direct election.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Under proportional allocation of electors, the gains from winning more than 50% of the vote from a swing state are greatly reduced.
1.4.4.4.3. Con: States decide their own allocation of electors, so any state that switches from winner-takes-all to proportional representation will be disadvantaging itself.
1.4.4.4.3.1. Con: Such legislation could be passed federally, forcing all states to do it, without abolishing the Electoral College.
1.4.4.4.3.2. Pro: Any such reform would have to be an interstate pact or federal law.
1.4.4.4.3.3. Pro: Electors are allocated by state legislatures, which are controlled by the majority party. If a state legislature changes their state to proportional vote, the majority party is hurting its own chances in the national election.
1.4.4.4.3.3.1. Con: The electors are not chosen by the state legislature, they are chosen by the party. Every party with a candidate running, must build a 'slate' of electors in each state. If their candidate wins that state, that slate becomes the electors for the state.
1.4.4.4.4. Con: This reform would still leave voters in underpopulated states valued higher than those in overpopulated states.
1.4.4.4.4.1. Con: While proportional allocation of electors would not provide purely proportional representation of population, it would be an improvement towards more proportional representation as compared to the current system.
1.4.5. Pro: The Electoral College could be abolished if enough states agreed to the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact).
1.4.5.1. Pro: A direct abolition of the Electoral College would make it difficult to have alternative voting systems. However, the [NPV state compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), if worded appropriately, can allow for states to experiment with alternate voting systems.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: [The US should adopt a better voting system \(for single-winner elections\).](https://www.kialo.com/the-us-should-adopt-a-better-voting-system-for-single-winner-elections-4650)
1.4.5.2. Con: An Interstate Compact requires the assent of Congress: [Art I, Sec 10, Para 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei)("No state shall, without the consent of Congress...enter into any agreement or compact with another state."). This would require the approval of either 51 or 60 Senators depending on the use of the filibuster, and those Senators would be voting to reduce the influence of their states.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: The Constitution allows each state the authority of how they assign their electoral votes. States can decide to award all of their Electoral College votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote and they do not need to enter into any agreement with any other states.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Each state can decide to allocate its votes this way independently of the other states. Therefore, no approval from the Senate would be required.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: This is true for a compact that supersedes power from the federal government, but not in the case of the Electoral College. This particular compact will [not require](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fPQfe0dkP8&list=PLGbqlTjpDNNb20jhhWxYi77SkAEOeTeBm) congressional support.
1.4.5.2.3. Pro: The US Constitution creates a system that moves slowly and deliberates over every action. This kind of change is too quick to be good for the nation.
1.4.5.3. Con: If the NPVIC is adopted, the only system remaining to prevent the tyranny of the majority is the '[faithless elector'](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-11-06/faithless-electors-safe-harbor-date-electoral-college) system.
1.4.5.4. Con: NPVIC is not an act of Congress and thus has no power to modify or remove the Electoral College.
1.4.5.5. Pro: Under the [National Popular Vote Interstate compact](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation), states are already signing on to make their own popular vote be the official one.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: Less populous states are not motivated to participate in a [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact). The point of the Electoral College is to protect their influence over the executive branch.
1.4.5.5.1.1. Con: If the compact were changed so that it only counted the states in the compact, then once it would get to 270, all states would be practically [forced to join before the next election](https://www.kialo.com/if-the-compact-were-changed-so-that-it-only-counted-the-states-in-the-compact-then-once-it-got-270-all-states-would-be-2469.1380?path=2469.0~2469.1-2469.599_2469.1153-2469.1357_2469.3463-2469.1365-2469.1380&active=-2469.1380&action=edit).
1.4.5.5.1.2. Con: The claim that "small states won't join" is unfounded, because [Rhode Island](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state/ri), [Hawaii](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state/hi), and [Vermont](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state/vt) already have.
1.4.5.5.2. Pro: Once enough states have signed on to guarantee at least [270 electors will follow the popular vote in their states,](https://center-forward.org/the-electoral-college-getting-to-270/) then by default the popular vote will supplant the Electoral College organically, without changing the Constitution.
1.5. Pro: The Electoral College discriminates against smaller parties participating in the selection of the president, [perpetuating a two-party system](https://www2.law.temple.edu/lppp/electoral-college-two-party-system/).
1.5.1. Pro: The Electoral College grants one vote per elector and requires a majority to determine a winner. Apprehension to handing the election over to the House of Representatives if a majority is not achieved naturally drives voters to limit election choices.
1.5.1.1. Con: It is primarily the fact that 48 states award their electoral vote winner-takes-all that disadvantages smaller parties, not the Electoral College itself.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: Looking historically, the majority requirement within the Electoral College itself is more detrimental to small parties.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: People selecting electors from fringe parties risk throwing the presidental election to the House, where each state receives a single, equal vote, leading to an even less democratic result.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: If various [proportional allocation methods were used](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/13319/who-would-have-won-the-presidency-if-all-states-electors-were-allocated-proport?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa), third-party candidates would have received more electoral votes than they did.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: The source does not support the claim because they specifically focus on one election where the third-party candidates received very little attention compared to the two major parties. For this to be valid, it must be applied to many elections over time, especially ones where third-party candidates received a significant percentage of the vote.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Voters are more likely to choose an [inferior candidate to ensure another a representative from their party is elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#Bush,_Gore,_and_Nader_\(2000_U.S._presidential_election\)).
1.5.2. Con: Other democracies, [like the UK](https://www.redbrick.me/the-reality-of-democracy-the-two-party-system/), are dominated by two parties. Thus, the Electoral College does not strengthen or perpetuate a two-party system.
1.5.3. Con: Other features of American politics cause [the entrenchment of the two-party system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/12/what-happens-an-entrenched-two-party-system-when-one-party-undermines-system/), not the Electoral College.
1.5.3.1. Pro: It is the [winner-take-all character of US elections](http://archive.fairvote.org/index.php?page=2100) in general which is responsible for the two-party system, not the Electoral College.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Proportional democracies tend to be multiparty systems, and winner-take-all systems are [typically two-party systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law).
1.5.3.1.2. Con: Canada's winner-take-all system has [more than three parties](https://thecanadaguide.com/government/political-parties/).
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: The winner-take-all laws that have been passed in [most states](http://www.irpe.org/sites/default/files/history-of-winner-take-all-v7-2017-4-22.pdf) are what eliminate third parties.
1.5.3.2. Pro: [Third parties](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/america-isnt-really-set-up-for-third-party-presidential-bids/) require a popular vote of at least 10% to be recognized as valid for participation. This is unrelated to the Electoral College.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: The populace recognizes third parties as spoilers under the Electoral College's [Simple Plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting#List_of_current_FPTP_countries) system. Hence, achieving that 10% threshold is incredibly difficult.
1.5.3.3. Con: The Electoral College system gives a third-party candidate more opportunities to negatively impact the voting process than a direct election does.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: If a third-party nominee won enough states to prevent either major party candidate from winning the 270 electoral votes needed for a majority, the House of Representatives would decide the outcome. That’s hardly a [recipe for stability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-electoral-college/2012/11/02/2d45c526-1f85-11e2-afca-58c2f5789c5d_story.html?utm_term=.9cc18e490ec1).
1.5.3.4. Pro: [Gerrymandering](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/what-is-gerrymandering.html) is very common in the US and allows leading parties to entrench their control for future elections.
1.5.3.5. Con: While other such entrenching norms should also be challenged, abolishing the Electoral College would represent a change with implications for every state and voter.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Other factors, such as the expense and effort of a campaign, limit the number of candidates and would not be eliminated by removing the Electoral College.
1.5.3.6.1. Con: Expense does not limit the number of candidates. It is the winner-take-all structure that forces coalitions to form before the election rather than after, as in parliamentary systems.
1.5.3.6.2. Pro: The 2020 US presidential election cost nearly [$14 billion](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/election-us-2020-54696386) and required resources that few institutions besides the Democrat and Republican parties could muster.
1.5.3.6.3. Con: There are already many candidates for president each year. 1,779 candidates filed [statements for candidacy](http://classic.fec.gov/data/Form2Filer.do?format=html) for president in the 2016 election cycle. We only hear about the major ones, and there's no reason that filter would change if reforms were made to the Electoral College system.
1.5.4. Pro: Simple majority is used on the national level for counting Electoral College votes, while [simple plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) is used on the state level \(in almost all states\) for determining the allocation of a state's Electoral College votes. Simple majority and simple plurality both hinder the electoral success of third parties.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Under [plurality voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting), the leading candidate is elected independently of having reached a majority of votes, which can discriminate against smaller parties.
1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.5.4.3. Pro: According to [Duverger's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law), single-ballot plurality-rule elections tend to favor a two-party system.
1.5.5. Con: A [two-party system](https://theconversation.com/the-two-party-system-is-here-to-stay-132423) is not inherently bad.
1.5.5.1. Con: Two-party systems lead to increased [polarization](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/23/21075960/polarization-parties-ranked-choice-voting-proportional-representation) and vilification of people with opposing political viewpoints.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: In a two-party system, all political sentiments are channeled towards opposing the other party, rather than elevating one's own party above all others, as would be the case in a [multi-party system](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/19/us-democracy-two-party-system-replace-multiparty-republican-democrat/).
1.5.5.1.2. Con: Bitter, divisive politics are not inherent to two-party systems; plenty of [other factors](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/) cause this, which is why divisive politics occurs in countries with multi-party systems.
1.5.5.1.2.1. Pro: Distrust among the populace \(e.g. along class/race/geography lines\), government designs which fail to balance power among government branches, and a lack of honest/moral media can cause division.
1.5.5.2. Con: A two-party system as entrenched as the American leads to [division](http://blogs.shu.edu/journalofdiplomacy/2021/02/curbing-division-and-derision-why-the-two-party-system-in-the-u-s-must-go/) and the ability for the two parties to completely put all government movement on hold if they choose to.
1.5.5.3. Con: Political parties tend to perform better when faced with robust competition from many opponents.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: India has [dozens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_India) of political parties, yet their political system is [mired](https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report-IND-2020.html#pos16) in inefficiencies and other problems.
1.5.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.
1.5.5.5. Con: The two-party system reduces the number of ideas and preferences that can be represented in politics.
1.5.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.5.5.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.
1.5.5.5.3. Con: There exists a great degree of variation within both major US political parties.
1.5.5.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.4.3.
1.5.5.6. Pro: Under a [popular vote](https://act.represent.us/sign/electoral-college/), the US would be swamped with candidates. Every group with an ideological or major policy interest would field a candidate, hoping that their candidate would win a plurality and become the president.
1.5.5.6.1. Con: Every group with an ideological or major policy interest fielding a candidate would be a good development, not a bad one.
1.5.5.6.1.1. Pro: Under a free society we should encourage more candidates to participate. There is no optimum or ideal number of candidates.
1.5.5.6.2. Con: The possibility of many more candidates suddenly running is not possible in the way described in the parent claim. Candidates for president might get approval in their own state to run, and therefore will be on that ballot, but they need to pass [certain requirements](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates) to be able to run state-by-state before they are allowed on that state's ballot.
1.5.5.6.3. Pro: Having a large number of candidates means there is a lot of media focus given to people who are unlikely to become president. This takes time away from important policy debates and the candidates that have more realistic possibilities.
1.5.5.6.3.1. Con: There is little discussion of policy in the Electoral College system currently. Therefore, it's unlikely removing the Electoral College could lower issue coverage by a consequential amount.
1.5.5.6.3.1.1. Pro: The 'Big Three' networks gave [32 minutes](http://tyndallreport.com/comment/20/5778/) of airtime to policy issues in 2016.
1.5.5.6.4. Con: -> See 1.5.3.6.3.
1.5.5.7. Pro: Parties enable clear [ideological branding](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540283) in a confusing marketplace of ideas.
1.5.5.7.1. Pro: Ideological branding helps organize policies into broad ideals \(e.g. "smaller government," "social justice"\) that allow the overall brand can be evaluated, rather than each individual policy.
1.5.5.7.2. Con: Such branding risks oversimplifying complex and interconnected issues.
1.6. Pro: The Electoral College no longer works as it was intended by the Founding Fathers. The fact that it no longer serves this purpose suggests that it is no longer necessary.
1.6.1. Con: The Electoral College works as it was intended by the Founding Fathers; our interpretation of the Electoral College is what has changed.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The Electoral College was designed to [ensure the selection of the executive](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp) was done fairly among the whole of the states. Electors are numbered based on congressional representation so all states get two electors for their senate seats and the same number as their congressional delegation.
1.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.1.1.
1.6.1.3. Con: The preferences and priorities of current people are more important than those of the Founding Fathers.
1.6.1.4. Con: Not all of the original intent has been altered. A state's representation in the College being equal to its representation in Congress has remained unchanged since the Founders' Days.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: The functional intent of a thing is not summed up by the extent of a single part. A bicycle with one spinning wheel is not functioning as intended, despite the fact that the good wheel is.
1.6.2. Con: The Electoral College reflects the Founding Father's intention that [the states have primacy over the Federal Government](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about). We elect presidents state by state, not individually.
1.6.2.1. Con: A key reason for the Electoral College was the fear that each state would vote for a local favorite and no national figure would emerge. This was shown to be false in the [first competitive election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1788%E2%80%9389_United_States_presidential_election).
1.6.3. Pro: The Electoral College was made to assuage the [slave-owning states](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/democracy-governance/history-electoral-college-and-our-national) where the citizenry \(then only land-owning white men\) was very small.
1.6.3.1. Pro: A main problem solved at the Constitutional Convention was inducing slave states, wary of domination by abolitionist-oriented, population states, to ratify.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The moment the Constitution was ratified, that main purpose was fulfilled, and after the [reconstruction amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments), the Electoral College did more harm than good.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: The [2nd Amendment](https://medium.com/the-new-leader/debunking-the-mythic-origin-of-the-second-amendment-bfe06dc06946), [3/5 Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise), [and the Electoral College](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/electoral-college-slavery-constitution) were all solutions that gave lower-populated slave states more power than their \(white\) populations merited.
1.6.3.2. Pro: '[One person, one vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man,_one_vote)' is now completely accepted and has been given to all genders and races. If this belief was completely accepted at the country's inception, there would be no Electoral College.
1.6.3.3. Con: [Slavery](https://lawliberty.org/no-the-electoral-college-was-not-about-slavery/) did not have a strong influence in the creation of the Electoral College. Instead, the aim was to allow for an "establishment of a temporary body of citizens who could make an enlightened choice for President but who would then dissolve back into the populace."
1.6.4. Pro: The framers of the Constitution didn't account for the [extreme disparity in population density](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2020/05/06/geographic-disparity-in-the-u-s-population).
1.6.4.1. Pro: The Electoral College does not work as it was intended, because of the [Permanent Aportionment Act](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/The-Permanent-Apportionment-Act-of-1929/) that restricts the House of Representatives to 435 seats.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Even if the Electoral College no longer accomplishes its initial purpose, it might still serve other valuable purposes.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: When the Electoral College was created, the ratio of populations of the most populous state \(New York\) and the least populous state \(Rhode Island\) was 4 to 1. It is now 80 \([California](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA)\) to 1 \([Wyoming](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/WY)\).
1.6.4.2. Pro: Currently, [over 80%](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/ua-facts.html) of the population lives in urban areas. As such, the president can not be beholden to such a small portion of the rural population.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The minority can keep their weighted vote in the Senate where they can still override a veto.
1.6.4.4. Con: The balance between Senate representation and the population was embodied in the [original Great Compromise](http://www.benjaminforest.info/Docs/Forest-Reform%20of%20the%20US%20Senate.pdf). \(p.2\)
1.6.4.5. Con: The Founding Fathers decided that each state would be entitled to [two Senators to be appointed by the state legislators](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44696-7_1) in order to account for the disparity in population density.
1.6.5. Pro: The Founding Fathers wanted [one representative per 30,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment). Right now that number is 1 [representative for more than 700,000 people in California and 500,000 people in Wyoming](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/55/why-435/). And that number is continuously increasing because the number of representatives has been fixed for more than a century.
1.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.6.5.2. Pro: The [US constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) in Article 1 Section 2 states the 30,000 number as the minimum people for one representative. So while the constitution does not state the maximum the founding fathers found the intent important enough to put in the constitution.
1.6.5.3. Pro: George Washington was strongly against 1 representative for 40,000 people and [implored the constitutional convention](https://www.nationalreview.com/2001/01/george-will-called-me-idiot-jonah-goldberg/) to raise the number of representatives to have 1 for every 30,000 people.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Reducing the number of representatives from the original intent of the founders is creating multiple issues leading to the erosion of democracy.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: There is a disconnect between the representatives and their constituents.
1.6.5.4.1.1. Pro: Congress has an [approval rating of below 40%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx) and an [incumbent has a re-election rate of 98%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_stagnation_in_the_United_States).
1.6.5.4.2. Pro: The cost of political campaigns has increased because every candidate has to reach a far higher number of people.
1.6.5.4.3. Pro: The representatives don't represent the general demographics in terms of wealth and social standing.
1.6.5.4.3.1. Pro: While [8% of the US population](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/more-than-8-percent-of-american-adults-are-millionaires-heres-how-they-got-wealthy.html) has a net worth greater than a million more than [50% of the congress has a net worth more than a million dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth).
1.6.5.4.4. Pro: Fewer representatives and the need for more political campaigns makes lobbying and bribery more tenable.
1.6.5.4.5. Pro: It is easier to [disenfranchise people through Gerrymandering](https://time.com/5423623/house-representatives-number-seats/) with fewer larger districts.
1.6.5.4.6. Con: Keeping the number of representatives at one for 30,000 will create 10,000 representatives and will make it difficult to organize and be effective.
1.6.6. Con: The Electoral College is [part of the Constitution](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Electoral-College/Electoral-College/) and serves as a historical monument from the US' founding, which is a legitimate reason to keep it.
1.6.6.1. Con: The Constitution isn’t a monument, it is a document that sets requirements for how the US government functions.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: Leaving the Electoral College in place, as the law of the land, for historical purposes isn’t necessary. An amendment to abolish the Electoral College would not delete any original text, it would be an addition.
1.6.6.1.1.1. Pro: In the same way, the Amendments that created and revoked prohibition are both still in the text of the Constitution and made no [changes to the 1787 original text](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/five-interesting-facts-about-prohibitions-end-in-1933).
1.6.6.2. Con: The argument that the Electoral College is somehow sacred because the Founding Fathers thought it up, and thus it is untouchable, is absurd, ahistorical, and offensive.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: The belief that a person might know more than the framers, can be seen as egotistical and unsupported.
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: The Founding Fathers added [slavery into the Constitution](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Founding-Fathers-and-Slavery-1269536), which with time became flawed and was amended.
1.6.6.2.2.1. Con: The claim that slavery is written into the Constitution is patently false. The Constitution did not abolish it, but it never condoned it, instead, it [was left to the states to determine it individually.](https://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/the-constitution-and-slavery)
1.6.6.3. Con: The Constitution is a practical document that allows for [amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution) when society finds consensus for change.
1.6.6.3.1. Pro: The Constitution was changed to mandate the [direct election of senators](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=58).
1.6.6.3.2. Con: The Constitution should seldom be considered a [vessel for change](https://www.history.com/news/constitution-amendments-changes), where the proposed changes need to be tested out over many years in other areas before solidified in the Constitution to avoid reactionary movements.
1.6.6.3.2.1. Con: [Amending the Constitution](https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/amending-the-u-s-constitution.aspx) is an extremely difficult [process](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution) for this reason. First, an amendment must be proposed by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress or by two-thirds of State legislatures calling for a constitutional convention. After that, three-fourths, or 38 of 50, states must ratify the proposed amendment.
1.6.6.3.2.2. Pro: Electoral College reform can be tried out with the national popular vote interstate compact. If enough states feel it is not working as intended it would only require withdrawal of a few to revert.
1.6.6.3.3. Con: The Constitution should also be respected and should not be so easily compromised. It serves to [codify certain foundational principles](https://home.ubalt.edu/shapiro/rights_course/Chapter1text.htm) defining this land and should not be rewritten so nonchalantly simply because a few people are dissatisfied with it.
1.6.6.3.3.1. Con: The fact that the [constitutional amendment process is so difficult](https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/three-branches/amendment-process) means that any amendment abolishing the Electoral College will be made after extensive debate and consideration.
1.6.6.3.4. Con: The keyword is "consensus". In the current political climate of bipolar opposition in the US government, such consensus does not exist and likely never will.
1.6.6.3.4.1. Pro: [Bipartisan moves are rare](https://www.ibanet.org/Article/NewDetail.aspx?ArticleUid=E94392C8-B881-495C-A11F-8DB1B210C929) and demand a level of effort that such non-pressing reform cannot inspire.
1.6.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.5.2.
1.6.8. Pro: The original purpose of the Electoral College was to prevent an uninformed populace from making an uninformed decision. That is no longer necessary.
1.6.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6.8.2. Pro: The [Electoral College](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/history) was established prior to the advent of mass media. Nowadays, the populace has access to plenty of information through mass media and is more informed.
1.6.8.2.1. Con: '[Low information voters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/07/low-information-voters-are-a-crucial-part-of-trumps-support/)' were a critical factor in the 2016 US Presidential election cycle.
1.6.8.2.2. Pro: The Electoral College was created in part due to [transportation and communications limitations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306068883_The_Purpose_Structure_and_Limitations_of_the_Electoral_College). Instant communication technology makes this reason for the electoral college obsolete. \(p.101\)
1.6.8.2.3. Con: Mass media [manipulates voters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899825618301507) rather than informing them.
1.6.8.2.3.1. Pro: The rise of social media as a news source has been accompanied by an [increase in misinformation](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37846860). Therefore, the information it gives voters does not invalidate the Founder's argument.
1.6.8.2.3.2. Con: Even if mass media could manipulate voters, [media pluralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_pluralism)(Media pluralism defines the state of having a plurality of voices, opinions and analyses on media system \(internal pluralism\) or the coexistence of different and diverse types of medias and media support.) ensures that citizens have different sources of information.
1.6.8.3. Pro: Our contemporary notion of [democracy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy) does not see the intelligence or information of voters as a relevant variable in determining how elections should work.
1.6.8.3.1. Pro: The current hegemonic concept of democracy is different to that which existed in the 18th century and [prioritizes the will of voters](http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/conferences/democracy/session2.html) over parties. That should be reflected in the electoral system.
1.6.8.3.2. Pro: All people, independent of the information at their disposal, should have the [right to vote](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/studyguides/votingrights.html) and have their vote matter.
1.6.8.3.3. Con: The age of a political system does not change how it functions.
1.6.8.3.4. Con: The fact that the political system was designed in the 18th century is irrelevant because it has [been modified numerous times](https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm?utm_content=buffer05951) since its original inception via constitutional amendments.
1.6.8.4. Con: Currently, the voices that prevail in politics are not the most educated but the [most vocal and best funded](https://www.apsanet.org/portals/54/Files/Memos/voicememo.pdf): therefore, honoring the intentions of the Electoral College are more important than ever. \(p.3\)
1.6.8.5. Pro: Part of the original intent of the Electoral College was to override the will of the people if the people choose a clearly unqualified candidate. In [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election), not only did this not work, [it did the exact opposite](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-electoral-college-was-meant-to-stop-men-like-trump-from-being-president/508310/).
1.6.8.5.1. Pro: The end product of the Electoral College in the 2016 election was to seat a president whom many felt was objectively unqualified.
1.6.8.5.1.1. Pro: In the election of 2016, the Electoral College went to the candidate that [lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election) the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.
1.6.8.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.4.1.1.1.2.1.
1.6.8.5.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #6079: Donald Trump was a good president.
1.6.8.5.2. Pro: The Electoral College was originally established as a method by which the passions of the electorate could be defused by statesman.
1.6.8.5.3. Con: Donald Trump wasn't seen as an unqualified candidate and as a result, he won [states worth 306 electoral votes](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/upshot/why-trump-had-an-edge-in-the-electoral-college.html) to 232 from states won by Hillary Clinton
1.6.9. Con: As evidenced by the [electoral map](https://www.270towin.com/), the Electoral College prevents the election of a candidate with little national appeal and works exactly as the framers of the Constitution wanted.
1.6.9.1. Con: The Electoral College does not support national 'appeal', as national would imply winning the popular vote. This has [repeatedly resulted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote) in the less nationally popular candidate winning. The Electoral College supports state appeal and is subject to districting lines that are subject to gerrymandering.
1.6.9.2. Con: The Electoral College allows one to win the presidency by appealing to only those voters in sparsely populated states and completely ignore the vast majority of American citizens.
1.6.9.2.1. Con: Winning by appealing to the voters in sparsely populated states requires one's message to have broader appeal to a wider variety of voters.
1.6.9.2.2. Pro: A campaign's message will become increasingly narrow to appeal to a less diverse group of what essentially become super-voters.
1.6.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
