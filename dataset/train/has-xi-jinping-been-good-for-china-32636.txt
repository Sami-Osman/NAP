Discussion Name: Has Xi Jinping been good for China?

1. Xi Jinping has been good for China.
1.1. Con: Xi Jinping's actions threaten the security of China.
1.1.1. Pro: The sudden encroachment of China into Hong Kong's political affairs has threatened China's relationship with the island.
1.1.1.1. Pro: There is concern that the protests in Hong Kong may [set a precedent](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions) and potentially spread to mainland China.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is unlikely as [Beijing is able to control and supress any dissent in the mainland more effectively.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/chinese-riot-police-fire-teargas-and-beat-up-protesters-in-guangdong-province)
1.1.1.2. Pro: There is [increasing concern](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/if-china-cracks-down-on-hong-kong-the-world-has-few-options.html) in Beijing that the Hong Kong crisis undermines China's attempt to project strength and stability.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The ability to defend China in the face of dissent shows that the CCP remains a strong and capable source of leadership.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The 1997 [handover agreement](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/15/asia/hong-kong-protests-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) of Hong Kong promised the city special freedoms of press, speech, and assembly for 50 years before the island was incorporated into mainland China. However China's attempts to speed up this process and break this agreement has lead to wide spread anti-China protests across the island.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: China has undermined this agreement by pushing the [2019 extradition bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html), which would restrict Hong Kong's special freedoms before the 2047 deadline. This has sparked large protests in Hong Kong.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The CCP has increasingly encroach on Hong Kong's legal freedoms by abducting [booksellers and a Chinese-born billionaire](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html), undermining Hong Kong's independent legal process.
1.1.1.4. Con: Hong Kong is part of China and this strained relationship is more like an internal affair, maybe similar to Scottish-English relations.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Scotland has sought [greater independence](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/special-features/2014/09/140912-scotland-united-kingdom-independence-referendum-culture/) from England and the wider UK, similar to Hong Kong.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Many people in Scotland feel that they would be [better governed](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/special-features/2014/09/140912-scotland-united-kingdom-independence-referendum-culture/) by their own people and not by England, which is similar to Hong Kong's feelings about China.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Attempts to infringe on Hong Kong's independence by the mainland have been met with [serious protests](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121814/hong-kong-vs-china-understand-differences.asp) in Hong Kong.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Scotland has a [distinct culture and history](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/special-features/2014/09/140912-scotland-united-kingdom-independence-referendum-culture/) that is unique to England's, similar to Hong Kong and China.
1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Scotland has [kept](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/special-features/2014/09/140912-scotland-united-kingdom-independence-referendum-culture/) its own cultural traditions, just like [Hong Kong](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121814/hong-kong-vs-china-understand-differences.asp).
1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Scotland has its own parliament and has [some control](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/special-features/2014/09/140912-scotland-united-kingdom-independence-referendum-culture/) over its policies, like Hong Kong.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Hong Kong has [certain political and legal freedoms](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/china/hong-kong/articles/6-major-differences-between-hong-kong-and-mainland-china/) that are unavailable to those on the mainland, such as the freedom of expression and an independent judiciary.
1.1.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Whilst Xi Jinping is the Chief of State in both China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong is a [limited democracy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121814/hong-kong-vs-china-understand-differences.asp) with its own Chief Executive unlike the mainland.
1.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: The fact that Hong Kong was a British colony during the 20th century whilst mainland China was independent has resulted in the two having [very different cultures.](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/china/hong-kong/articles/6-major-differences-between-hong-kong-and-mainland-china/)
1.1.1.4.2.4. Con: Hong Kong's culture is primarily Chinese.
1.1.1.4.2.5. Con: China is a multi cultural society.
1.1.2. Con: China won't be threatened because of its nuclear capabilities.
1.1.2.1. Con: Nuclear deterrence would not work because China is willing to lose more lives than the US can tolerate.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Mao spoke about how he would [sacrifice many lives](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/arts/mao-the-unknown-story.html) for the sake of global revolution.
1.1.2.2. Con: China is currently hampered in their second-strike capabilities because their submarines cannot roam freely given that the US controls which vessels leave the first-island chain.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The [Underground Great Wall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Great_Wall_of_China) provides for second strike capabilities, which ensures that a country is able to respond to retaliate against a nuclear attack.
1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Nuclear weapons prevent war through [deterrence](https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/nuclear-deterrence).
1.1.2.5. Con: China engaged in direct conflict with the US in the Korean War when only the US had nuclear weapons.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: The Chinese did not engage in direct conflict with the US during the Korean War. They merely sent supporting troops.
1.1.2.6. Con: Powers can still engage in proxy wars.
1.1.2.7. Con: [Limited warfare](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-strategic-and-operational-dynamics-of-limited-war) is an option.
1.1.3. Pro: China is part of an [ongoing conflict](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/16/beijings-south-china-sea-aggression-is-a-warning-to-taiwan/) with multiple states in the South China Sea.
1.1.3.1. Con: Conflict in the South China Sea does not equate to a security threat because of the disparity in capabilities between China and its Southeast Asian neighbours.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Taiwan, alongside a bloc of [powerful Western nations](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/four-powerful-countries-plan-resistance-china-disputed-asian-sea) including the US, have the military capabilities to challenge Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: China is [building islands](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/navy-commander-china-bullying-southeast-asian-neighbours-191214012935057.html) and military bases in disputed areas to flex their military capabilities.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: China has taken steps to [modernise their navy](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-naval-modernization/) and thus ensure they are able to have a strong maritime presence.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Xi Jinping has stated that islands in the South China Sea [have been China's for a long time](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-south-china-sea-singapore.html) and that other nations should respect their territorial claim. Other nations [disagree](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1217974/south-china-sea-vietnam-beijing-xi-jinping-spt).
1.1.3.3. Pro: This conflict may lead to a global or regional military confrontation.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: China has demonstrated a commitment to defending the waters and airspace surrounding the islands they are building. Chinese sailors, soldiers and pilots [may easily come into contact with Washington's](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/showdown-how-us-china-war-could-start-south-china-sea-61182) freedom of navigation patrols in those waters. Too heavy a response and any small issue could escalate into a military conflict.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: Even though the conflict may escalate, it is unlikely that this means a large-scale military confrontation.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Due to the geographical distance between the US and China, it is unlikely that there would be a large-scale military conflict.
1.1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: US forces could be bolstered through allied forces in the region.
1.1.3.3.2.1.2. Con: Obama's ['Pivot to Asia'](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/03/the-legacy-of-obamas-pivot-to-asia/) involved relocating the military to increase US presence in and nearby the region.
1.1.3.3.2.1.3. Con: In a world where the forms of warfare are evolving, it is easy to imagine a situation where chemical or digital means are used as the primary means of offence.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: China's decision to focus on [modernising the navy](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-naval-modernization/) is an implicit recognition that conflict is likely to be overwhelmingly maritime.
1.1.3.3.4. Con: Individual conflicts are rarely the reason and more of a trigger when states go to war.
1.1.3.4. Con: China has been in this conflict long before Xi came to power. It was not his actions that caused the conflict.
1.1.4. Con: Xi has strengthened China's defense sector.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The defence budget has kept [increasing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China) under Xi, helping to strengthen China's security.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The most stable international order is one where there exists a balance of power. By increasing China's defence budget, Xi is ensuring that China is trying to match the capabilities of other great powers and are able to avoid violent conflict.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: China has developed the capabilities to be [the second pole in a bipolar international system](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2018-04-16/return-bipolarity-world-politics-china-united-states-and) alongside the United States.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: BoP systems failed in the past, like the Concert of Europe.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: For [Waltz](https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/essentials-of-international-relations5/ch/04/summary.aspx), a bipolar system was more stable than a multipolar one because there is a clear difference between the power held by two poles when compared to other state actors.
1.1.4.1.1.4. Pro: Under a system of anarchy, states are responsible for their own self-preservation. [Preventing any one state](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/08/whos-afraid-of-a-balance-of-power/) from gaining too much power by balancing against that state, helps maintain their autonomy and preserve their status as a sovereign entity.
1.1.4.1.1.5. Con: Balance of power systems fail when a rising power upsets the balance. Rising China is doing just that.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: This may suggest that even if there is violent conflict, China would be well equipped to defend itself.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: Only a [hegemon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hegemony) like the United States can guarantee that they are safe in the international order. This occurs because the hegemon occupies a dominant position vis à vis all other states. China, even with its current defence budget, is not a hegemon.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: In 2019, China had the [largest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264443/the-worlds-largest-armies-based-on-active-force-level/) active duty military force in the world.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: China's increased defence spending undermines their security by [encouraging other powers to increase their own defence spending](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2135802/asian-arms-race-stoked-chinas-booming-defence-budget-analysts) and creating the conditions for a regional or global arms race.
1.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Neo-realists understand that there is always a chance of misinterpreting the intentions of another actor or overreacting to another actor's actions. This is because the same action may be interpreted as either offensive or defensive.
1.1.4.1.4.2. Con: No country apart from the US would have the economic capabilities to respond to increased military spending from China.
1.1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: China is [overpowered](https://chinapower.csis.org/military-spending/#toc-1) compared to many of its smaller neighbours already. If China were to increase military spending, this will not cause their neighbours to increase their budgets.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The Russian army, which possesses greater practical military experience than China, is [helping](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/russia-to-help-china-develop-an-early-warning-system/) improve China's security and defense.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Russia is assisting China in the development of an [Early Warning System](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/russia-to-help-china-develop-an-early-warning-system/).
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Russia is sharing its expertise by inviting China to join events such as Russia’s “[Tsentr 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/17/russia-conducts-tsentr-2019-military-exercises-with-china-and-india.html)” massive military drills.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: 3200 Chinese troops [trained alongside](https://carnegie.ru/2018/09/24/why-russia-and-china-are-strengthening-security-ties-pub-77333) the Russians during Vostok-2018, Russia's largest military exercise such the fall of the USSR.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Xi has [accelerated](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-xi/) the People's Liberation Army’s \(PLA\) shift to naval power from a traditionally land-based force.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: China now possesses the world’s [biggest navy](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a27532437/china-now-has-more-warships-than-the-us/), with more than 300 warships.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Xi has [restructured](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-xi/) the PLA to make it less bureaucratic and more effective.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.1.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Xi has been systematically [rooting out](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1850147/rooting-out-pla-corruption-helping-xi-jinping-build-his) corruption in the PLA.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: Given the [lack of transparency](https://thediplomat.com/2015/01/is-corruption-within-the-pla-diminishing-chinas-military-preparedness/) regarding the PLA, it is difficult to assess any claim of improved effectiveness.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: The Central Military Commission, which oversees the armed forces, has been [reduced](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2117004/xi-jinping-rolls-out-leaner-top-line-chinas-military) to a 7-member group instead of an 11-member one.
1.1.4.4.5. Pro: Xi has [diffused power](https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/why-chinas-central-military-commission-got-downsized/) within the PLA by reorganizing its four General Departments into 15 smaller departments, and creating two separate chains of command.
1.1.4.4.6. Con: Xi is using restructuring as an excuse to further [consolidate his power](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-defence/chinas-xi-restructures-military-consolidates-control-idUSKBN17L0D8).
1.2. Con: Xi Jinping has consolidated authoritarianism in China.
1.2.1. Con: By being in office for very long, Xi provides stability.
1.2.2. Con: The leadership in China is more representative of its people than the US.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Political family dynasties are more common in the US.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: [The Bush family](https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-most-influential-political-families-ranked-adams-clintons-kennedys-bushes-2018-12?r=US&IR=T#1-the-bushes-1) produced two presidents, a senator and a governor.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The [Kennedy family](https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-most-influential-political-families-ranked-adams-clintons-kennedys-bushes-2018-12?r=US&IR=T#2-the-kennedys-2) has produced one president and a number of representatives, ambassadors and senators.
1.2.2.2. Pro: US presidents tend to be from the upper echelons of society.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Wealth is a major qualifying factor for the presidency in the US.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: This is because wealth gives individuals [access to other rich people](https://www.npr.org/sections/theprotojournalist/2013/09/06/218848157/quick-question-can-only-the-rich-be-president) who fund presidential campaigns, which are [hugely expensive.](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/cost-of-becoming-president/)
1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the 2016 campaign, Trump and Clinton spent a combined [$1.16 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/cost-of-becoming-president/).
1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: This is because usually, the candidate that spends the most money on their campaign [tends to win](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/cost-of-becoming-president/).
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Being wealth is also an important factor for the presidency, as it not only gives individuals the status to seek high offices, but also the [extra time necessary](https://www.npr.org/sections/theprotojournalist/2013/09/06/218848157/quick-question-can-only-the-rich-be-president) for an all-consuming quest freedom from other concerns.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The [last modern US president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_net_worth) that was not a millionaire was Harry Truman in 1945.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Donald Trump is the billionaire head of a [global business empire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/oct/04/few-us-politicians-working-class).
1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: Barack Obama was worth an estimated [$3.7 million](https://www.thoughtco.com/do-presidents-have-to-be-rich-3367614) at the time of his election in 2008.
1.2.2.2.2.3. Pro: Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood actor turned Republican politician, was worth [$4 million](https://www.thoughtco.com/do-presidents-have-to-be-rich-3367614) when he was elected to the White House in 1980.
1.2.2.2.2.4. Pro: Although J.F. Kennedy never inherited his family estate, which was worth nearly $2 billion, his own personal net worth at the time of his presidency was roughly [$10 million.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_net_worth)
1.2.2.2.2.5. Con: Bill Clinton only earned [$35,000](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/may/07/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-we-had-lowest-net-worth-any-president/) as the governor of Arkansas prior to his presidency, and depended on his wife Hillary to be the breadwinner of the family.
1.2.2.2.2.6. Pro: By contrast, the average annual income of a full-time salaried worker in the United State was [$46,800.](https://qz.com/1723454/this-is-how-long-an-average-us-worker-needs-to-become-a-billionaire/)
1.2.2.3. Pro: Xi's life is similar to that of many Chinese. He suffered under Mao, was arrested by the government as a deserter in his youth, and sent to a labour camp.
1.2.3. Con: Chinese are [travelling abroad in greater numbers than before](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/rise-of-the-chinese-tourist/?). This undermines authoritarian indoctrination by providing more exposure to alternative political cultures.
1.2.4. Pro: Under Xi Jinping the country has seen a number of civil society crackdowns including: the Uyghur genocide, the 709 crackdown, the Hong Kong national security law, Inner Mongolia riots, and mass arrests of political opponents.
1.2.5. Con: As China continues to develop economically, [authoritarian structures will breakdown](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/why-east-asia-including-china-will-turn-democratic-within-a-generation/251824/) and China will democratize.
1.2.5.1. Con: Singapore is an exception to this rule, showing it is possible to avoid authoritarian breakdown. China has [learnt from the Singaporean experience](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2095310/has-china-outgrown-its-need-singapore-role-model) in constructing their own development model, suggesting they could have a similar experience.
1.2.5.2. Con: It seems unlikely that China will cease to be a one-party state.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: All political opposition to Xi has been punished and censored, making the emergence of alternate candidates and political parties extremely unlikely.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: Thousands of party members have been [imprisoned](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2133251/xi-jinpings-anti-graft-drive-has-caught-so-many) on corruption charges to ensure only the faithful remain to serve Xi.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: [Zhou Yongkang](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/11/chinas-former-security-chief-given-life-sentence-for-corruption), a key adversary of Chinese president Xi Jinping and a senior Communist party official, was given a life sentence.
1.2.5.2.1.3. Pro: [Lou Jewei](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/3006516/xi-jinpings-intolerance-dissent-within-government-heightens), an outspoken critic of Xi's policies, was replaced.
1.2.5.2.1.4. Pro: The Party's new [Disciplinary Regulations](http://The Party's new Disciplinary Regulations disincentivize political criticism through the threat of expulsion) disincentivize political criticism through the threat of expulsion.
1.2.5.2.1.5. Pro: Xi has [purged](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-41730948) and jailed those elements of the Communist Party who plotted against him.
1.2.5.3. Pro: The argument [generally suggests](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2009-03-01/how-development-leads-democracy) that economic development creates a large middle class who will demand civil and political liberties and ultimately a Western-type democracy.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Recent analysis [suggests](https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/democracy-and-human-rights-are-in-retreat-in-south-east-asia-here-s-why-20190405-p51b6b.html) that democracy is [in retreat](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat) in many countries. This would suggest that economic development does not inevitably lead to democracy.
1.2.5.4. Con: The examples of democratization cited in the link - Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan - all have very problematic and not meaningfully participatory democracies.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Japan is functionally a [one-party](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-18/japan-is-a-one-party-state-again-and-voters-are-fine-with-that) state.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Con: Just because people vote in the same party for long periods of time doesn't necessarily mean that it is not a true and functioning democracy.
1.2.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: It may well just be that voters believe that one candidate of a particular party fulfils the role of elected representative better than other prospective candidates who are part of other parties.
1.2.5.4.1.2. Con: Opposition parties have won elections in Japan, such as the [Japan New Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Japanese_general_election) in 1993 and the [Democratic Party of Japan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-18/japan-is-a-one-party-state-again-and-voters-are-fine-with-that) from 2009-2012. This suggests that Japanese voters do have choices over which party to vote for.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: South Korea places significant restrictions on the freedoms of [speech and political association](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/south-korea) enjoyed by its citizenry.
1.2.6. Con: Chinese citizens are not opposed to authoritarianism.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Many Chinese citizens [believe](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-many-chinese-dont-want-freedom) that a Western-style democracy would produce “social disorder”.
1.2.6.2. Pro: [Stability and social cohesion](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-many-chinese-dont-want-freedom) are of the utmost importance to Chinese citizens. Xi's leadership channels these values.
1.2.6.3. Con: Many Chinese citizens are afraid of voicing their dissent.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Many activists and dissidents, from university students to movie actors, have ["disappeared".](https://thediplomat.com/2018/12/the-people-china-disappeared-in-2018/)
1.2.6.3.2. Pro: At least [500](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/24/crackdown-activists-china-nascent-civil-society-pu-zhiquaing) human rights activists and dissidents have been arrested and sentenced to prison since Xi's rise to power.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Authoritarianism does not always have the same negative connotations in Asia as it does in the West as authoritarian regimes have produced a number of strong and successful states across Asia.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: Despite [imprisoning opponents and suppressing dissent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/lee-kuan-yews-legacy-of-authoritarian-pragmatism-will-serve-singapore-well), Singapore is considered a contemporary [gold standard](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2134754/xi-jinping-president-beyond-2023-may-be-good-china-though) for governance thanks to founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: Former Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is often considered the [driving force](https://www.ft.com/content/839ccb0c-e439-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad) behind China's ascent to becoming a global power.
1.2.6.5. Pro: Many in China consider Xi Jinping to be a good leader, despite his authoritarian rule.
1.2.6.5.1. Pro: When he spoke of the [Chinese dream](https://time.com/4986999/xi-jinping-china-19th-congress-ccp/) he provided a source of self-identification for the people of China.
1.2.6.5.2. Pro: According to [research](https://chinapower.csis.org/can-xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-succeed/) from Pew Research Center, a non-partisan think tank, Xi Jinping is a popular leader.
1.2.6.5.3. Pro: According to a [survey](https://thediplomat.com/2014/12/the-worlds-most-popular-leader-chinas-president-xi/), Xi Jinping had the highest approval rating, both at home and abroad. He had a domestic approval rating of 9 out of 10.
1.2.7. Con: China experiences protests. This suggests that there is still resistance to authoritarianism.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Lu Yuyu and Li Tingyu, two activists, recorded the occurrence of more than [70,000](https://www.economist.com/china/2018/10/04/why-protests-are-so-common-in-china) protests in 2013-2016.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: Many of the protests [are against Japan](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/world/asia/anti-japanese-protests-over-disputed-islands-continue-in-china.html) and not against the government.
1.2.7.2. Con: China has been experiencing mass protests since before Xi took office. In 2010, an average of [500](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/how-china-stays-stable-despite-500-protests-every-day/250940/) protests a day occurred.
1.2.7.3. Con: A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319403729_Social_Unrest_in_China_A_bird's_eye_perspective) found that protests in China are widespread but tend to occur seasonally and involve less than 30 participants \(p. 2\). This is hardly significant resistance.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: It was also found that while small, these protests were still significant enough that protestors turned to violence to make their stand \(p. 24\).
1.2.7.4. Con: Protests are not always in response to authoritarianism. Many democratic countries also have to deal with mass protests.
1.2.7.4.1. Pro: Of the protests that China experiences, [very few](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319403729_Social_Unrest_in_China_A_bird's_eye_perspective) protests are related to the protection of civil or political rights \(p. 6\).
1.2.7.5. Pro: The Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin \(CLB\) recorded [2,773](https://clb.org.hk/en/content/strikes-and-protests-china%E2%80%99s-workers-soar-record-heights-2015) strikes and protests in China in 2015, more than twice that of a year earlier.
1.2.8. Pro: Xi has been concentrating political power in his own hands.
1.2.8.1. Pro: The [abolition](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/11/17106242/china-xi-jinping-president-for-life) of the presidential term limit will make it so that Xi can stay in power for as long as he desires.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: The presidential term limits were part of a [wider wave of 'liberal' reforms](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/11/592694991/china-removes-presidential-term-limits-enabling-xi-jinping-to-rule-indefinitely) under Deng Xioaping, now being reversed under Xi Jinping.
1.2.8.1.2. Pro: The presidential limit [intended](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/14/593155818/why-abolishing-chinas-presidential-term-limits-is-such-a-big-deal) to show that while a hereditary monarch rules for life, a president in democratic China does not. Abolishing the presidential term limit marks a move away from liberal thinking.
1.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.2.8.3. Pro: Xi is the most powerful Chinese leader since [Mao Zedong](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-41730948).
1.2.8.3.1. Con: The biggest power vacuum since the [death of Chairmen Mao](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1976/sep/10/china.johngittings1) will occur once Xi dies which will lead to a scramble for power.
1.2.8.3.2. Pro: '[Xi Jinping Thought](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-41730948)' has officially been incorporated into the Chinese constitution.
1.2.8.3.2.1. Pro: Xi is the only ruler, aside from Mao, to secure a reference in the constitution while still in power.
1.2.8.3.2.2. Pro: Because Xi \(and his ideology\) has been embedded in the Constitution, even rivals within the Communist Party cannot challenge him. A challenge to Xi has been equated to a challenge to the Communist Party and China herself.
1.2.8.4. Pro: The introduction of the ['social credit' system](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) has allowed Xi to restrict the travel and other rights of critics.
1.2.8.5. Con: Xi's concentration of power comes with a [greater responsibility](https://theconversation.com/xi-jinpings-grip-on-power-is-absolute-but-there-are-new-threats-to-his-chinese-dream-118921) towards the Chinese people. If Xi fails to meet these expectations, it is clearer now that he is to blame. This may ultimately lead to the loss of power entirely.
1.2.8.6. Con: This concentration of power may [provide stability and efficiency](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2138122/xi-jinping-must-use-concentrated-power-good-people) for China.
1.2.8.6.1. Pro: The concentration of power allows Xi to [eliminate some potential sources](https://theconversation.com/xi-jinping-the-good-emperor-32395) of resistance to his anti-corruption drive, which will ensure greater efficiency for China in the long-term.
1.2.8.7. Con: Concentrating power may allow Xi to implement necessary but unpopular reforms without have to worry about passing them through Congress first.
1.2.8.7.1. Pro: China is [increasingly concerned](https://theconversation.com/china-is-positioned-to-lead-on-climate-change-as-the-us-rolls-back-its-policies-114897) about taking action on pollution and climate change. The fact that Xi will not have to answer to popular opinion or Congress may allow him to implement the necessary but unpopular policies to tackle this.
1.2.8.8. Con: China's politics are [notoriously opaque](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-all-its-heft-chinas-economy-is-a-black-box-1440467253), making it hard to hold politicians accountable for their decisions. Concentrating power into one individual, Xi Jinping, makes it easier for both Chinese citizens and international actors to better hold China accountable.
1.2.8.9. Pro: When political leaders concentrate power, this can create serious long-term issues for the country.
1.2.8.9.1. Pro: A leader who controls political power so thoroughly will leave a power vacuum in China upon his death, which in turn could leave China vulnerable.
1.2.8.9.1.1. Pro: When Mao, who Xi is often compared to, died, he left the country [vulnerable](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/mao-chairman-china-dead).
1.2.8.9.1.1.1. Pro: Because Mao had failed to mark a clear successor, his death caused a [power vacuum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/mao-chairman-china-dead) in Beijing.
1.2.8.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: Mao's death sparked a [clash](https://alphahistory.com/chineserevolution/gang-of-four/) between the radical 'Gang of Four' and the more moderate bloc of Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2. Pro: There was no one, and no apparatus left to allow for continuity in policies, which is [a marker](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1651112/continuity-of-policies-the-key) for stability.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: After Mao's death, a completely new "[reform and opening up](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/29/asia-pacific/politics-diplomacy-asia-pacific/one-party-rule-communist-party-runs-china/)" policy was adopted by Deng Xiaoping.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Hua Guofeng, who wished to uphold Mao's policies, was [forced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hua/china-lays-to-rest-maos-chosen-successor-hua-guofeng-idUSPEK8158120080831) to step down by Deng Xiaoping in order to open China up.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Deng Xiaoping, usually credited for enacting this policy, [ruthlessly suppressed](https://education.seattlepi.com/impact-deng-xiaoping-history-china-5311.html) those who criticized and protested against his rule.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The [Tiananmen Square Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests), where as many as several thousand people died, occurred under Deng.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: The propagation of this policy involved [tolerating corruption](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/bao-tong-how-deng-xiaoping-helped-create-a-corrupt-china.html), the consequences of which are still felt by China today.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Deng’s new policies saw party members and their families, who were best positioned to take advantage of the new opportunities available due to the opening of China's economy, [quickly getting rich](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/bao-tong-how-deng-xiaoping-helped-create-a-corrupt-china.html) at the cost of others.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Although Deng allowed for greater economic freedom in China, businesses were expected to [pay bribes](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/bao-tong-how-deng-xiaoping-helped-create-a-corrupt-china.html) to party officials to ensure their support.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Deng's reform policies saw [national assets transferred](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/bao-tong-how-deng-xiaoping-helped-create-a-corrupt-china.html) to party elites. As a result, the descendants of the party’s founding revolutionary generation still control much of China’s wealth.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.4. Con: This policy [is responsible](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201812/19/WS5c19f320a3107d4c3a001ab4.html) for China's prosperity today and was worth the cost of transition.
1.2.8.9.1.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, China's share of global GDP has risen from 1.8% to [15.2%](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201812/19/WS5c19f320a3107d4c3a001ab4.html).
1.2.8.9.1.2. Pro: This is because concentrating power into one individual for a long period of times makes it [harder for a country](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/03/06/xi) to cultivate and train new leaders to replace them when they die.
1.2.8.9.1.3. Pro: This is because a power vacuum can lead to [intense political infighting](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/when-dictators-die/) between potential successors that can plunge the country into chaos.
1.2.8.9.2. Pro: Traditionally, regimes governed by 'strong men' - where political power is highly concentrated in the hands of an individual - tend to be [more at risk](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/when-dictators-die/) of instability following the leader's death.
1.2.9. Pro: Xi has created a sophisticated and successful propaganda campaign in China.
1.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.2.9.2. Pro: Xi has begun indoctrinating Chinese citizens to reduce the risk of challengers to his regime. He has called for courses that "[promote support](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3002243/xi-jinping-tells-chinese-teachers-help-nurture-support-communist)" for the Communist Party Rule in primary schools and universities alike.
1.2.9.3. Pro: Xinhua news agency is a state-owned news organisation with more than [170 foreign and 31 domestic bureaus.](https://www.readex.com/content/propaganda-and-chinese-press)
1.2.9.4. Pro: Xi has been using promotional videos in order to foster a positive image of the party within China.
1.2.9.4.1. Pro: "[How Leaders Are Made](https://theconversation.com/chinese-propaganda-goes-tech-savvy-to-reach-a-new-generation-119642)" is a short video that features Xi as a hardworking and legitimate politician by comparing him to Western leaders.
1.2.9.4.2. Pro: ["I Am A Chinese Citizen](https://theconversation.com/chinese-propaganda-goes-tech-savvy-to-reach-a-new-generation-119642)" attempts to rebrand the party as an organization comprising of unsung heroes.
1.2.9.4.3. Pro: The CCP video "[I am a Chinese Soldier](https://theconversation.com/chinese-propaganda-goes-tech-savvy-to-reach-a-new-generation-119642)" attempts to imbue patriotism and to reassert the need for the party.
1.2.9.4.4. Pro: Previously, most Chinese had [begun to associate](https://macropolo.org/analysis/in-xi-we-trust/) the CCP with crony capitalism, corruption, and an overall incompetent body.
1.2.9.5. Pro: In [February 2016](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/how-effective-is-ccp-propaganda/), Xi announced new media policies that mandated all party media to reflect the party’s will and to safeguard the party's unity and authority.
1.2.9.6. Con: [Surveys indicate](https://thediplomat.com/2013/06/government-for-the-people-in-china/) that support for Xi's government has declined and so the propaganda campaign has not been "successful".
1.2.9.7. Con: The presence of [organised protests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/chinese-riot-police-fire-teargas-and-beat-up-protesters-in-guangdong-province) and [re-education camps](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-50511063) suggest that citizens hold views contrary to those promoted by the government using propaganda.
1.2.10. Pro: Authoritarian rule has been bad for the people of China.
1.2.10.1. Con: The track record of [economic development under authoritarian tiles](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2018-04-16/autocracy-chinese-characteristics) suggests that the people benefited since they are not living in poverty anymore.
1.2.10.2. Pro: The consolidation of authoritarian rule has resulted in China coming under significant [international scrutiny.](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/hong-kong/article/2188418/beijing-must-learn-live-international-scrutiny)
1.2.10.3. Con: Chinese citizens [do not place](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2185438/china-has-no-use-democracy-it-needs-strong) the same degree of importance on individual rights and freedoms as most Western countries.
1.2.10.4. Pro: Authoritarianism is bad for the Chinese [economy](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8916609/china-economy-crash).
1.2.10.4.1. Pro: China needs to [gear its economy](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8916609/china-economy-crash) away from selling exports and towards selling to domestic Chinese consumers, which would require moving wealth from the state towards Chinese households - a measure which is unlikely to take place under an authoritarian state.
1.2.10.4.1.1. Pro: China's export-oriented model of growth was only viable as long as its economy [was weaker](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8916609/china-economy-crash) than its buyers. With recent shifts in global economy, this method of growth no longer remains viable.
1.2.10.4.1.1.1. Pro: The gap between China and the West's economies shrank massively after the [2008](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8916609/china-economy-crash) financial crisis.
1.2.10.4.1.1.2. Pro: China's export-based economic model is premised on [low costs of production](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8916609/china-economy-crash), which are changing rapidly as wages rise due to the growth in the Chinese economy.
1.2.10.5. Con: The people of China have also suffered under democratic rule.
1.2.10.5.1. Pro: The Kuomintang party's rule was plagued with [corruption and nepotism](https://china-journal.org/2018/02/26/why-did-chiang-kai-shek-lose-china-the-guomindang-regime-and-the-victory-of-the-chinese-communist-party/).
1.2.10.5.2. Pro: The Kuomintang's iniquitous tax system, unequal land distribution, and high interest rates [burdened the poorest](https://china-journal.org/2018/02/26/why-did-chiang-kai-shek-lose-china-the-guomindang-regime-and-the-victory-of-the-chinese-communist-party/) in society.
1.2.10.5.2.1. Pro: Landlords would have their names removed from records or bribe tax collectors to evade paying taxes, which only [further shifted](https://china-journal.org/2018/02/26/why-did-chiang-kai-shek-lose-china-the-guomindang-regime-and-the-victory-of-the-chinese-communist-party/) the tax burden onto the poor.
1.2.10.6. Pro: Under the rule of Xi Jinping, many people living in China now lack fundamental freedoms.
1.2.10.6.1. Con: Seeing as Chinese people are more concerned with the [negative consequences that come with too much freedom](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-many-chinese-dont-want-freedom), they may not view Xi's rule as a bad thing.
1.2.10.6.2. Con: Freedom allows people to make bad decisions.
1.2.10.6.3. Pro: Uighur Muslims and ethnic Kazakhs have been placed in mass ["re-education"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-muslims-detention-camp-uighur-xinjiang-reeducation-latest-graduates-a9238851.html) camps in Xinjiang.
1.2.10.6.3.1. Pro: [Torture and punishment](https://theweek.com/articles/877024/inside-chinas-reeducation-camps) are commonplace within these "re-education" camps.
1.2.10.6.4. Pro: In the Kaifeng municipality of Henan, the local Jewish community has [reportedly](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) begun to experience government restrictions on religious activity.
1.2.11. Pro: Under Xi Jinping, people's freedoms are increasingly being infringed upon.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Xi has enforced massive censorship programs to consolidate authoritarianism in China.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: The existence of [Liu Xiaobo](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40403811), a prominent critic of Chinese rules, has effectively been [wiped out](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40656483) by censorship, preventing citizens from hearing of his calls to reform the government.
1.2.11.1.2. Pro: Since the extension of the presidential term, censorship has become [increasingly extensive](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43198404) to prevent criticism of the regime. Phrases as simple as "I don't agree" and "re-election" have been banned.
1.2.11.1.2.1. Pro: Images of Winnie the Pooh, who was being used by social media users to represent Xi, have been [blocked](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-40627855).
1.2.11.1.2.2. Pro: Xi is [heading](https://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1437031/chinese-worried-about-more-censorship-xi-jinping-heads-new-web) a new panel overseeing internet security and information technology development, which is likely to continue this trend of increased censorship.
1.2.11.1.3. Pro: The "[Chinese firewall](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown)" carefully controls the internet and access to information.
1.2.11.1.4. Pro: The stocks of many Chinese internet security companies [spiked](https://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1437031/chinese-worried-about-more-censorship-xi-jinping-heads-new-web) in response to Xi's announcement of increased censorship.
1.2.11.2. Pro: Under Xi Jinping, China has and continues to develop [mass surveillance programmes.](https://time.com/5735411/china-surveillance-privacy-issues/)
1.2.11.2.1. Con: In China, privacy is [not viewed](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-china-chinese-people-dont-care-about-privacy-2018-6) as sacred. The mass surveillance programs do not infringe upon people's freedoms and little objection has been raised to them.
1.2.11.3. Pro: Under Xi, foreign journalists have begun to face an [increasing amount](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/business/china-foreign-media-pen-america.html) of restrictions.
1.2.11.3.1. Pro: A French journalist who wrote an article that was critical of Beijing's policy toward Muslim Uighers [was expelled](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-35181299) from China. This is the first time since 2012 that such an incident has occurred.
1.2.11.3.2. Pro: According to a survey, [55](http://55 percent of respondents to its 2018 reporting conditions survey said they believed conditions deteriorated last year, the largest proportion since 2011.)% of foreign journalists believe that conditions have deteriorated in 2018 \(relative to 2017\), the largest proportion since 2011.
1.3. Pro: Xi Jinping’s internal policies are improving the lives of Chinese people.
1.3.1. Pro: Xi Jinping has attempted to root out corruption in the CCP which is a serious issue for the country.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Shortly after taking power in November 2012, Xi rapidly implemented a [wide reaching](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/10/asia/xi-jinping-corruption-campaign-intl-hnk/index.html) anti-corruption campaign that targeted both high and low ranking party officials.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: More than [1 million](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/10/asia/xi-jinping-corruption-campaign-intl-hnk/index.html) Chinese government officials have been punished since the campaign began.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Those targeted by Xi's [anti-corruption campaign](https://www.fpri.org/article/2018/08/xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-the-hidden-motives-of-a-modern-day-mao/) include army generals, 35 members of the party's internal disciplinary body as well as senior officials, such as the former Chinese president's chief of staff.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: The number of officials punished for discipline violations [more than doubled](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-corruption-paradox-11572600605) between 2011 and 2015.
1.3.1.2. Con: Critics have accused Xi of using the campaign against corruption to [bolster his standing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-corruption-paradox-11572600605) and consolidate power.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.1.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Seeing as Xi Jinping can currently depend on [great loyalty and unity](https://www.fpri.org/article/2018/08/xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-the-hidden-motives-of-a-modern-day-mao/) from the Chinese Congress, there would be little need for Xi to use this campaign to further bolster his position.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Corruption has been a [prevalent part](https://www.fpri.org/article/2018/08/xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-the-hidden-motives-of-a-modern-day-mao/) of Chinese government for decades.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: There has traditionally been an issue of party officials in China's provinces [racking up debt](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41746705) launching expensive and unnecessary investments. This is something that Xi has attempted to clamp down on.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: In 2000, roughly [£400 million](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/china-attacks-its-tumour-of-corruption-1.237118) was embezzled by officials from money reserved for the resettlement of 2 million displaced people.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: This deeply rooted corruption [contributes](https://chinapower.csis.org/can-xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-succeed/) to income inequality in China.
1.3.1.4. Con: In order to truly tackle corruption, China would have to strengthen the rule of law, downsize the government and liberalise the press, all policies that are [currently not being implemented.](https://chinapower.csis.org/can-xi-jinpings-anti-corruption-campaign-succeed/)
1.3.1.5. Pro: Corruption has serious repercussions for the citizens of China.
1.3.1.5.1. Pro: In 2007, the direct cost of corruption in China was estimated to be as much as [$86 billion](https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=19628) each year.
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: The indirect costs of corruption may be [even worse.](https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=19628) Corruption has both undermined social stability and contributed to the deterioration of social services, the rising cost of health care, housing, and education for everyday Chinese citizens.
1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Resources lost to corruption could be used for other purposes that are more beneficial for the citizens of China.
1.3.1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.1.
1.3.1.5.3.2. Pro: Over [170,000](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-02-21/half-a-million-party-members-penalized-for-corruption-in-2018-101382151.html) individuals were disciplined in 2018 alone for the misappropriation of poverty alleviation resources.
1.3.1.5.3.3. Pro: Roughly [10%](https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=19628) of China's government spending, contracts, and transactions is estimated to be used as kickbacks and bribes, or simply stolen.
1.3.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: This is money that could be better used tackling some of the many [pressing social issues](https://www.coresponsibility.com/top-concerns-chinese-davos/) facing China, such as environmental damage and struggling social programs.
1.3.1.5.4. Con: Corruption can help maintain order in society.
1.3.1.5.4.1. Pro: A functional government that is able to maintain stability is ultimately better for citizens, even if you acknowledge the downsides.
1.3.1.5.4.2. Pro: Electoral corruption can help guarantee that a single political party that is able to govern effectively comes into power.
1.3.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Corrupt electoral processes would allow a single party to dominate the legislature, thereby preventing political gridlock.
1.3.1.5.4.3. Pro: Giving money to leaders in important institutions such as the army and police can prevent the outbreak of rebellion and ensure that these institutions continue to play their respective roles.
1.3.1.5.4.4. Con: Corruption only benefits the rich and well-connected, leaving all others who can't afford to pay bribes vulnerable.
1.3.1.5.4.5. Con: Corruption can cause massive instability by inciting public outcry.
1.3.1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Corruption can [undermine](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/varios/corruption-when-not-tackled-can-lead-to-instability-disorder-imf-says/50000269-3220303) economic growth in a country, which can fuel outrage amongst citizens.
1.3.1.5.4.5.1.1. Pro: In the United States, corruption [reduces](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41483665.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A06ace868854d9d1ab8131935f357ef05) the growth of output per worker, which impacts the growth of the overall economy \(p. 377\).
1.3.1.5.4.5.2. Pro: Corruption makes citizens feel like they are being cheated. This increases their desire to take action against the government they elected to protect themselves from such acts.
1.3.1.5.4.5.3. Pro: Corruption creates distrust of the government.
1.3.1.5.5. Con: [Corruption can be good for the economy,](https://fortune.com/2014/08/07/corruption-economic-benefits/) which may have positive effects for citizens due to the logic behind trickle down economics.
1.3.1.5.5.1. Con: Generally, empirical data shows [otherwise](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012215/how-corruption-affects-emerging-economies.asp). According to the World Bank, the average income in countries with a high level of corruption is roughly a third of countries with low levels of corruption.
1.3.2. Pro: Xi Jinping has taken significant strides to deal with poverty in China.
1.3.2.1. Pro: In 2019 alone, [$19 billion](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-03/05/c_137869443.htm) has been invested on a variety of poverty-alleviating projects and initiatives across the country.
1.3.2.2. Pro: [775,000 officials](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-03/05/c_137869443.htm) were dispatched to rural areas in 2016 to aid poverty relief efforts.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Officials who fail to address concerns within their jurisdictions are punished and can [even be removed](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/asia/poverty-alleviation-2020-xi-jinping-intl/index.html) from their position.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.3.2.
1.3.2.4. Pro: China's [poverty rate](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201902/22/WS5c6f86a5a3106c65c34ead2a.html) has dropped from 10.2 to 1.7 percent over the past six years.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: [12.4 million](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/24/c_136311122.htm) people were brought above the poverty line in 2016.
1.3.2.5. Con: This is not particularly unique to Xi - China has raised over [850 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_China) people out of poverty since the 1980s.
1.3.2.6. Con: This single-minded focus on eradicating poverty through boosting the economy has been found to be lowering [air and water quality](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/asia/poverty-alleviation-2020-xi-jinping-intl/index.html) in certain regions.
1.3.2.7. Con: The only major anti-poverty strides have been made in China's rapidly diminishing rural landscape - [urban poverty](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/asia/poverty-alleviation-2020-xi-jinping-intl/index.html) is largely being ignored.
1.3.2.8. Pro: The growing prosperity of the Chinese people has resulted in [a larger middle class.](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/5yearscorecard/2017-09/18/content_32147461.htm)
1.3.3. Pro: Xi has developed China's infrastructure.
1.3.3.1. Pro: An average of [200,000 km](http://www.china.org.cn/business/2018-12/27/content_74317727.htm) of rural roads have been built or renovated each year in China between 2013 and 2018.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Improving infrastructure is an important aspect of a country's modernization because it allows goods and people to move efficiently from one place to another, which can help streamline production and help stimulate the national economy.
1.3.3.3. Con: This increase in investment spending may come at a high cost.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: China is spending more on [economic infrastructure](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html) annually than North America and Western Europe combined.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge alone is likely to cost China [US$19 billion.](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html)
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Evidence [suggests](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html) that over half of the infrastructure investments in China made in the last three decades have a larger cost than the benefits they generate.
1.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: Studies suggest that [75% of China's investment](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html) projects suffer cost over-runs.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Pro: These projects often [struggle to generate](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html) enough revenue to pay back the high startup cost.
1.3.3.4. Con: Seeing as these infrastructure projects are [often not profitable](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html), their development can weaken China's economy.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: By investing in these unprofitable projects, China weakens its economy by [creating more debt](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html) for it to pay back.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: Studies estimate that, in 2014, infrastructure cost overruns equate to approximately [1/3 of China's US$28.2 trillon debt.](https://review.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Why-Chinas-infrastructure-investment-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good.html)
1.3.4. Con: For some Chinese people, life has gotten worse due to Xi Jinping's policies.

1.3.4.2. Pro: There has been a [clampdown](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) on religious organisations deemed to not be under state control.
1.3.5. Con: Respect for human rights and rule of law has [deteriorated considerably](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) during Xi's term as President.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Despite China promising to enshrine financial fair play and judicial independence when they joined the WTO 15 years ago, China has [failed to implement](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) substantive legal reforms.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Xi's anti-corruption campaign has been accused of using [torture and coerced confessions](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) on those subject to CCP disciplinary investigations.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: The U.N. Committee against Torture [concluded](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24866&LangID=E) that China had failed to eliminate torture, enforced disappearances, deaths in custody, and numerous other forms of ill-treatment in detention.
1.3.6. Con: Xi has sought to repress civil society in China.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Internal [CCP documents](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) reveal efforts by Xi to quash civil society in China.
1.3.6.2. Pro: In 2016, the Beijing Zhongze Women's Legal Counselling and Services Centre was [shut down](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) by the CCP, even though it had advocated for anti-domestic violence litigation and the protection of rights for over 20 years.
1.3.6.3. Pro: China's new Charity Laws are designed to [limit the ability](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) for the civil society to operate outside government sponsorship.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Labour rights leaders and activists have faced [significant persecution](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/china-at-least-19-labour-activists-detained-by-authorities-china-labor-watch-releases-statement-on-those-who-assisted-lide-shoe-factory-workers) by the government.
1.4. Pro: Xi Jinping has encouraged economic development.
1.4.1. Con: China has been an active participant in the trade-war undermining both the [local and global economy.](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2226)
1.4.1.1. Pro: China has lost nearly [2 million industrial jobs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3019916/us-trade-war-has-cost-china-almost-2-million-industrial-jobs) since the trade war has commenced.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The trade war has cost China [$35 billion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trumps-trade-war-has-cost-china-35-billion-un-says-2019-11-1028661750) in 2019 alone.
1.4.1.3. Pro: More than [50 multinational corporations](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/more-than-50-companies-reportedly-pull-production-out-of-china-due-to-trade-war.html) have moved out from China since the commencement of the trade war.
1.4.1.4. Con: The trade-war is a result of Trump's actions. Xi Jinping cannot be held responsible.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Resolutions for the trade-war have [fallen through](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/9/18/17790600/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-taiwan) two times solely due to Trump and the hard-line position he's taking against China.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: The trade war is partly due to the failures of the [World Trade Organisation](https://www.wto.org/) and their ability to regulate disputes between two member states.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: The lack of transparency on the rules of China's accession agreement to the WTO is a cause of controversy amongst member states. It is thus unclear which laws apply to China and which do not.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: It is [disputed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/what-trump-gets-right-about-china-and-trade.html) whether China should be entitled to differential treatment as a "developing" country.
1.4.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: The WTO rules [do not clearly define](https://theconversation.com/myth-busted-chinas-status-as-a-developing-country-gives-it-few-benefits-in-the-world-trade-organisation-124602) what a developing country is.
1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: The WTO is not able to adapt to [interventionist practices](https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2018/10/30/whats-wrong-with-the-world-trade-organization/#3c18b2f73a49) that are typical of many non-market economies.
1.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: The WTO dispute resolution mechanism is [in crisis.](https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/pb18-5.pdf)
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Trump's administration was the first to [impose sweeping sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/business/china-us-trade-war-trump-tariffs.html) on China.
1.4.1.4.4. Con: Xi escalated the trade war instead of trying to deal with it diplomatically.
1.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: Xi responded to Trump's tariffs by [immediately imposing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/business/china-us-trade-war-trump-tariffs.html) tariffs on American goods.
1.4.1.4.4.2. Con: Xi did not escalate the trade war, but retaliated in kind.
1.4.1.5. Con: The China-US trade-war has been [paused](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/13/china_us_pause_trade_war/), which a mark of Xi Jinping's diplomatic skills.
1.4.2. Con: Xi Jinping has failed to solve prominent issues in China such as forced technology transfer and intellectual property rights violations, which ultimately undermine the competitive positions of foreign firms.
1.4.2.1. Con: Copyright protection has been dramatically [improved](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/copyright-protection-in-china-its-real-and-its-spectacular/).
1.4.2.2. Pro: Foreign firms have claimed that it is [difficult to conduct fair intellectual property litigation](https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/chinas-progress-on-intellectual-property-rights-yes-really/) and thus difficult to gather evidence of intellectual property right violations.
1.4.2.3. Con: Xi has shown genuine intent to resolve these issues.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Xi Jinping has claimed that he will [seek to protect intellectual property rights](http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/0426/c90000-9572558.html) and create a better business environment for foreign companies.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: [In 2017](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2111929/china-launches-campaign-protect-foreign-intellectual-property), China completed a nationwide campaign across government agencies intended to protect the rights of foreign firms.
1.4.3. Pro: The "[Made in China 2025](https://gbtimes.com/made-china-2025-plan-unveiled-boost-manufacturing)" plan aims to transform China into a powerful manufacturing country through the manufacturing of higher quality products.
1.4.3.1. Pro: China is planning to move up the [value chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain) by focusing on manufacturing [high-tech products.](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2015-10/22/content_22251655.htm)
1.4.4. Pro: By encouraging economic development globally through investment, China has increased their diplomatic leverage over other states.
1.4.4.1. Pro: China are better able to strong-arm states in diplomatic affairs.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Some of China's economic investments are made under dubious circumstances, effectively amounting to a form of ['debt-trap diplomacy'](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/25/chinas-debt-diplomacy/).
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Debt-trap diplomacy occurs when a creditor [intentionally](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/21/chinese-loans-expose-pacific-islands-to-risk-of-unsustainable-debt-report-finds) lends excessive credit in order to incite political concessions when the country is unable to pay off the loan. While some countries have struggled to pay off the loan, there isn't much evidence that China have entered into credit agreements with any such intentions.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There is a reasonable amount of evidence to suggest that China has intentionally engaged in debt-trap diplomacy.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Many of the countries](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2019/12/13/china-struggles-to-fend-off-allegations-of-debt-trap-diplomacy/) that China gives this debt to are either ''significantly or highly vulnerable to debt distress''. This means that it is highly likely that they will default on their payment and be required to provide alternative concessions to China.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Despite Tajikistan being highly vulnerable to debt distress, China lent it [$300 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/16/why-are-there-anti-china-protests-central-asia/). When Tajikistan was unable to repay this debt, it was required to give China ownership over one of its lucrative gold mines.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Kyrgyztan has been lent roughly [$2 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/16/why-are-there-anti-china-protests-central-asia/) by China, which is unsustainable for one of Central Asia's [poorest countries](https://eurasianet.org/unpacking-debt-in-kyrgyzstan-and-tajikistan)
1.4.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: China offered a [large number of easy loans](https://issafrica.org/amp/iss-today/lessons-from-sri-lanka-on-chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy) to Sri Lanka with few restrictions. By 2017, this debt had become untenable and Sri Lanka was forced to relinquish majority control of Hambantota port, a port of [strategic importance.](https://thediplomat.com/2018/10/a-string-of-fake-pearls-the-question-of-chinese-port-access-in-the-indian-ocean/)
1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.4.1.1.3. Pro: The building of the China-Pakistan economic corridor as part of the larger 21st century 'Maritime Silk Road' is a [strategic move](https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/31/05/2017/maritime-silk-road-initiative-msri-why-india-worried-what-china-can-do) made by China designed to increase their influence and disrupt India's growing economic clout.
1.4.5. Pro: The importance of China to the global economy has increased. As the world's largest manufacturing company, with low production costs, it remains crucial for foreign companies to have access to China's markets so that they may remain competitive.
1.4.6. Con: China's economic growth has been slowing down under Xi's government.
1.4.6.1. Con: This has less to do with Xi's governance and more to do with the [trade war](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9082139/us-china-trade-war-trump-jinping/) initiated by the USA.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: China's model of heavy borrowing with the default expectation of monetary returns no longer holds up and a refusal to adapt to the new order is exacerbating the economic slowdown. Their most recent project, "[China's Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/business/china-economy-debt-tianjin.html)" has only added to the government's debt, bringing little to no returns.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: China's automotive sector [has shrunk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-12/china-car-sales-keep-shrinking-intensifying-automakers-woes) and it has not been able to find a substitute for this hole in its economy.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Pro: There has been an [8%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/chinas-auto-market-could-shrink-about-8-this-year-industry-official-idUSKBN1XA0TD) drop in auto sales in China in 2019.
1.4.6.1.2.2. Pro: Car sales comprise [5%](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/china-economic-growth.html) of China's economic output. This is a bigger role than the one played by US exports.
1.4.6.1.2.3. Con: This drop is because of increasing environmental regulation standards being imposed on [vehicle emissions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/china-auto-sales-fall-again-in-golden-september-as-turnaround-hopes-fade-idUSKBN1WT0LK) in China - an indisputably good thing.
1.4.6.2. Pro: In 2015, the Chinese government used public funds to support equity prices when markets plunged. The [policy failed](https://yp.scmp.com/over-to-you/columns/article/108753/beijing-has-learned-their-lesson-about-stock-market-intervention) to stabilise prices and wasted trillions of renminbi.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: China has since [ceased](https://yp.scmp.com/over-to-you/columns/article/108753/beijing-has-learned-their-lesson-about-stock-market-intervention) to interfere in the stock market, having seemingly learned its lesson from the 2015 affair.
1.4.6.3. Con: Even though economic growth has slowed down, steps are slowly being taken to reverse this trend.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: China has attempted to address this by restructuring their domestic economy away from an export-led growth model that focuses on manufacturing low-value items.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: China has [cut taxes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-promote-stable-growth-as-economic-pressures-increase-11576152472) in 2019.
1.4.6.3.3. Pro: China has been pushing its banks to [lend more](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-promote-stable-growth-as-economic-pressures-increase-11576152472).
1.4.6.3.4. Pro: China has allowed the [yuan to depreciate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-promote-stable-growth-as-economic-pressures-increase-11576152472) to counter the deleterious effects of US tariffs.
1.4.6.4. Con: This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it was the stimuli provided by the Chinese government to encourage growth in the past decade which led to the country amassing a [debt over 270%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-promote-stable-growth-as-economic-pressures-increase-11576152472) the size of its economy.
1.4.6.5. Pro: China's economic growth has slowed to [6.2%](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/china-economy-beijing-posts-q2-gdp-amid-trade-war-with-us.html), which is the weakest rate in at least 27 years.
1.5. Pro: Xi Jinping has transformed China into a great power.
1.5.1. Pro: As a great power, China has shown the world an alternative political model to Western democracy in the ["Beijing Consensus"](https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/03/why-the-china-model-isnt-going-away/274237/).
1.5.1.1. Con: Showing an alternative model is easy and done constantly around the globe. The difficulty is in making it attractive.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Cuba shows an alternative model but that doesnt make it attractive.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The Venezuelan policies are received favorably with the left but that's insufficient to make them spread. This illustrates that popularity with just one group is unlikely enough to make an alternative model attractive.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Authoritarian capitalism is an economic model that can be [exported](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-11/china-s-master-plan-exporting-an-ideology) to other developing nations as a vehicle for modernization.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: In [numerous speeches,](https://www.cfr.org/blog/yes-virginia-china-exporting-its-model) Xi Jinping has reiterated that adopting a Chinese approach is a new option for countries who wish to speed up their development.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Chinese officials have [trained their counterparts](https://www.cfr.org/blog/yes-virginia-china-exporting-its-model) in Cambodia on areas such as controlling public opinion, encouraging foreign investment and retaining foreign technology.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: The Chinese experience is unique and thus no such model could be exported elsewhere.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: China has a one-party political system and this is something they [do not](https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/is-there-really-a-china-model/) openly try and export anymore.
1.5.1.2.3.2. Con: Even other states in the region - especially the famous '[Asian Tigers](https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/asian-tigers-economics-asian-nations/)' historically saw periods of economic growth under authoritarian capitalist models, implying that the Chinese experience is not unique.
1.5.1.3. Con: The 'Beijing Consensus' or the 'China model' is a myth.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: There is nothing uniquely Chinese about the so-called "China model". China has relied on market mechanisms for their growth.
1.5.1.4. Pro: This is particularly important since China's rise to becoming a great power necessarily pits it against the previously existing unipolar power of the United States. Being able to demonstrate that it is an actual alternative to the West is a prerequisite for becoming truly important.
1.5.1.5. Con: China's tendency towards repression makes it unlikely that other countries will be persuaded to follow China's political model.
1.5.1.5.1. Pro: The crack down on protests in Hong Kong has harmed China's international reputation and image.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: Pro Hong Kong rallies have [taken place](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/09/hong-kong-public-opinion-beijing/599059/) in cities across Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America.
1.5.1.5.1.2. Pro: In June 2019, an international crowdfunding drive raised [hundreds of thousands](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/09/hong-kong-public-opinion-beijing/599059/) of dollars in order to highlight Hong Kong's plight.
1.5.1.5.1.3. Pro: By deploying hundreds of security officers to the border near Hong Kong, China is [increasingly being viewed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/world/asia/hong-kong-china-troops.html?module=inline) as a tyrannical state that is intent of bullying Hong Kong.
1.5.1.5.2. Pro: China's reputation has still not recovered from previous incidents of repression towards their citizens.
1.5.1.5.2.1. Pro: The brutal crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests has [tarnished](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3010835/30-years-tiananmen-square-crackdown-why-beijing-still-thinks-it) China's international image ever since.
1.5.2. Pro: Through transforming China into a great power, Xi Jinping has fulfilled the desire of the Chinese people.
1.5.2.1. Con: Given that the CCP practices [brainwashing and 'thought control'](https://china-journal.org/2019/03/10/brainwashing-the-people-mao-zedong-the-chinese-communist-party-and-the-politics-of-thought-control/), the desires of the population may not be their own ones.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The [first opium war](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/asia/opium-war-book-china-britain.html) and China's ['century of humiliation'](https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2019/07/11/how-the-century-of-humiliation-influences-chinas-ambitions-today/) drives the ambition to never be at the mercy of foreign powers again.
1.5.2.3. Con: Due to China's large population it is highly unlikely that there would be anything resembling a unified "strong desire" to become a great power. It is more likely there would be serious divisions about what China's place in the international order should be.
1.5.3. Pro: Xi Jinping has shown that China can be a responsible power.
1.5.3.1. Pro: China has supported the creation of new multilateral institutions.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Xi Jinping has pledged his [full support](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1901791/china-pledges-during-opening-ceremony-aiib-devote-itself) for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: [Legitimate failures](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/09/the-world-bank-and-the-imf-wont-admit-their-policies-are-the-problem) made by these institutions provide a strong case for replacing these multilateral institutions with new ones.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: China has only supported the creation of new multilateral institutions because their institutional structure [favours some states](https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-bias/imf-still-seen-as-biased-towards-rich-members-auditor-idUSL2N0PB17220140701) over others.
1.5.3.2. Pro: China has behaved responsibly in its trade war with the USA.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The [WTO](https://www.ft.com/content/131a55ea-a84a-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04) has repeatedly ruled against the US in the conflict.
1.5.3.3. Con: Some of China's investments abroad are examples of economic statecraft used to meet wider foreign policy goals.
1.5.3.4. Con: China continues to violate the norms of the international community.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: Other countries also violate international norms. China is not unique in this regard.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: The United Kingdom are demonstrating signs of being a [rogue state](https://www.globalresearch.ca/rogue-state-britain-railing-against-international-norms-laws/5674265).
1.5.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: The 2011 [British bombing in Libya](https://www.globalresearch.ca/rogue-state-britain-railing-against-international-norms-laws/5674265) was a violation of UN Resolution 1973, which authorised member states to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and to use ‘all necessary measures’ to prevent attacks on civilians.
1.5.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: The UK's decision to revoke Shamima Begum’s citizenship broke international norms, [as well as UK laws](https://www.globalresearch.ca/rogue-state-britain-railing-against-international-norms-laws/5674265), which forbid the UK Home Secretary from taking any action that would render an individual stateless as a result.
1.5.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: The UK government’s record on bulk data handling for intelligence purposes [violated](https://www.globalresearch.ca/rogue-state-britain-railing-against-international-norms-laws/5674265) international human rights law.
1.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: Russia's [annexation of Crimea violates norms of international law](https://www.unian.info/politics/10201878-russian-annexation-of-crimea-violates-norms-of-international-law-german-fm.html).
1.5.3.4.1.3. Pro: American and the UK's 2003 invasion of Iraq [violated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/12/iraq-invasion-violated-interational-law-dutch-inquiry-finds) international law.
1.5.3.4.1.4. Pro: The extrajudicial killing of Soleimani by the United States violated the sovereignty of Iraq and [international human rights law.](https://nypost.com/2020/01/03/us-airstrike-that-killed-qassim-soleimani-of-iran-violates-human-rights-law-un-official-says/)
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: When investing abroad, China does not require their partners to meet conditions related to [human rights or financial sustainability.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-24/why-democracies-are-turning-against-belt-and-road)
1.5.3.4.3. Con: China has sent [clear messages](https://www.merics.org/en/blog/presenting-china-responsible-power) to the international community which suggest that they are an active member of the international community while also being transparent about areas of "national interest".
1.5.3.4.4. Pro: China has undermined existing multilateral institutions and [promoted](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-emerging-institutional-statecraft/) the creation of new ones.
1.5.3.5. Pro: China plays an [active role](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/03/c_138602916.htm) in resolving collective issues such as climate change and global economic crises.
1.5.3.5.1. Con: China is the world's [largest carbon emitter](https://time.com/5669061/china-climate-change/).
1.5.3.5.2. Con: China relaxed its controls on [polluting industries](https://time.com/5669061/china-climate-change/) \(steel, cement\) in the second half of 2018.
1.5.3.5.3. Pro: China appears to be [honouring the 2015 Paris agreement.](https://theconversation.com/china-is-positioned-to-lead-on-climate-change-as-the-us-rolls-back-its-policies-114897)
1.5.3.5.4. Pro: In the wake of the global financial crisis, China contributed towards providing a large [collective fiscal stimulus](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-world-leaders-arrive) to the global economy.
1.5.3.5.4.1. Pro: China unveiled a [$1tn boost](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-world-leaders-arrive) to the global economy at a post-crisis summit.
1.5.3.6. Con: It is possible to be a great power without being a responsible power.
1.5.3.6.1. Pro: Economic and military capabilities are the relevant indicators to determine whether a state is a great power or not.
1.5.4. Pro: China's foreign policy under Xi has become increasingly expansionist.
1.5.4.1. Pro: China has become [increasingly aggressive](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) in territory conflicts across the Taiwan Strait, East China and South China seas
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: China now considers the entire Strait to be Chinese territorial waters, reacting with [intense hostility](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) to the transit of naval vessels from any other country.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: China [conducted](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3009074/china-fires-drills-near-taiwan-strait-test-combat-strength) live-fire military drills at the Taiwan Strait.
1.5.4.2. Pro: At a conference in June 2019, Defence minister Wei Fenghe [warned](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) that any efforts by foreign countries to thwart China's goal of reunification with Taiwan would result in the Chinese military having ''no choice but to fight at all cost for national unity.''
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Given that China has never recognized Taiwan as an independent state, it is possible to see this statement as defensive, rather than expansionist.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: Chinese representatives have made [similar threats regarding Taiwan in the past](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan/chinas-xi-says-political-solution-for-taiwan-cant-wait-forever-idUSBRE99503Q20131006) and have yet to act on these threats.
1.5.4.3. Pro: The Chinese government has [accelerated](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/prepare-more-authoritarian-china) the erosion of autonomy in Hong Kong in an attempt to speed up the reunification between Hong Kong and the mainland.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: China views Hong Kong as part of China, reflected in the ["one country, two systems"](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-what-is-chinas-one-country-two-systems-policy/article29279828.ece) slogan. China would not view this as an expansionist policy but as policy that seeks to reclaim land.
1.5.4.4. Con: The problem in the South China Sea is less that China has expanded and "taken over" territories but more that China's territorial boundaries haven't yet been clearly articulated.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: The ["nine-dash line"](https://thediplomat.com/2016/06/what-does-the-nine-dash-line-actually-mean/) is ambiguous, leaving room for interpretation about which territories China believes it has a right to sovereign ownership of.
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: States are worried about what an increasingly powerful China could do. It is the [uncertainty](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2015/may/30/beijing-policy-south-china-sea) that they find troubling.
1.5.4.4.3. Con: China's move to transform reefs into artificial lands with military installations has already triggered [diplomatic outrage.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/09/diplomatic-protests-china-shows-militarised-artificial-islands/)
1.5.4.5. Pro: China has been seeking to improve their geo-strategic position vis à vis other states by setting up foreign military bases.
1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Under Xi, China's [first overseas military base](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-djibouti/china-formally-opens-first-overseas-military-base-in-djibouti-idUSKBN1AH3E3) has been opened in Djibouti.
1.5.4.5.1.1. Con: China maintains that this is not a military base, but a [logistical base](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-djibouti/china-formally-opens-first-overseas-military-base-in-djibouti-idUSKBN1AH3E3) meant to assist navy ships taking part in humanitarian and peacekeeping missions in countries like Yemen and Somalia.
1.5.4.5.2. Con: It is entirely possible that military bases are built for defensive purposes rather than aggressive ones.
1.5.4.5.2.1. Con: There is no plausible defensive purpose to be served by a Chinese military base in Djibouti.
1.5.4.6. Con: China seeks not to expand but to preserve their territorial integrity.
1.5.4.6.1. Pro: Xi claims that China's policies are not expansionist, but instead geared towards not giving up '[an inch of its territory](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/xi-says-china-not-expansionist-but-won-t-give-up-an-inch-of-territory-118062700985_1.html).'
1.5.5. Pro: China has improved its international position by strengthening relationships with other states.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The '[Belt and Road](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer)' \(BRI\) initiative is a global development strategy strengthening China's ties to other states by increasing Chinese investment abroad.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Some of this investment is centred around building infrastructure and transportation networks abroad with the aim of [linking China and the rest of East Asia to Europe.](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative)
1.5.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.3.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The relationship between China and Japan has recently improved under Xi Jinping.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: According to a [survey](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/30/national/record-high-85-japanese-view-china-unfavorably-despite-improving-ties-beijing-tokyo/), 85% of Japanese citizens view China unfavorably.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: The [amicable talk](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3017174/after-welcome-thaw-relations-xi-jinping-and-shinzo-abe-have-much-do) between Xi Jinping and Shinzo Abe allowed the two leaders to share their vision of a united future. This marks the first time in nine years that a Chinese leader was in Japan.
1.5.5.2.3. Pro: Xi [accepted the invitation](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2019062800016/xi-accepts-invitation-to-visit-japan-as-state-guest.html) by the Japanese for a state visit to Japan in 2020.
1.5.5.2.4. Pro: China granted Japan a [200 billion yuan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-japan-rqfii/china-to-give-japan-investment-quota-for-first-time-to-boost-ties-idUSKBN1IA1C3) \($31.4 billion\) investment quota for the first time to buy Chinese stocks, bonds and other assets.
1.5.5.2.5. Pro: This achievement is made more remarkable by the fact that, until very recently, Sino-Japanese relations were at a very low point.
1.5.5.2.5.1. Pro: The Chinese government hosted a massive military parade in [2015](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/10/24/commentary/japan-commentary/reset-japan-china-relations/) to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in the Second World War.
1.5.5.2.5.2. Pro: In its [2013 white paper](http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130714/DEFREG03/307140002), Japan called Chinese behaviour and actions 'incompatible with international law'.
1.5.5.2.5.3. Pro: China and Japan both lay claim to the Senkaku Islands, which have historically been a [source of tension](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11221248/Why-do-Japan-and-China-have-such-a-frosty-relationship.html) between the two parties.
1.5.5.2.5.4. Pro: In 2018, Japanese jets were deployed to intercept Chinese military aircraft approaching its airspace [638 times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/10/24/commentary/japan-commentary/reset-japan-china-relations/), an increase of 27.6% compared to 2017. This indicates increased levels of paranoia and hostility between the two countries.
1.5.5.2.5.5. Pro: Chinese people have traditionally resented Japan for its behaviour towards the Chinese during World War II and its subsequent lack of apology.
1.5.5.2.5.5.1. Pro: The actions of Japanese soldiers in the Nanking Massacre are a [particularly sore spot](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2123261/80-years-later-can-china-japan-overcome-nanking-massacres-legacy) for the Chinese, made even worse by the fact that Japan has never apologised for the massacre.
1.5.5.2.5.5.2. Pro: During the war, Japanese soldiers were told that they were [not required to obey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre#Extrajudicial_killing_and_cannibalism_of_Chinese_prisoners_of_war) the constraints of international law by their commanders. This resulted in the widespread execution of Chinese prisoners of war.
1.5.5.2.5.5.3. Pro: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has [openly remarked](http://nation.time.com/2013/05/20/sorry-but-japan-still-cant-get-the-war-right/) that Japan did little wrong during the war and that there is no reason for them to apologise.
1.5.5.2.5.6. Con: The shift towards improved Sino-Japanese relations was initiated by [Hu Jintao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao), the previous Chinese President.
1.5.5.2.5.6.1. Pro: Diplomatic exchanges between Japan and China have been [extremely active](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24761028.2012.11869053) since the first "ice-breaking trip" in 2006 between the leaders of both countries \(p. 79\).
1.5.5.2.5.6.2. Pro: President Hu visited Japan in May 2008 to sign the “[Joint Statement on the Comprehensive Promotion of a 'Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests.](https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/joint0805.html)”.
1.5.5.2.6. Pro: The Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the China Development Bank recently signed a [memorandum](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/10/24/commentary/japan-commentary/reset-japan-china-relations/) to promote cooperation between the two countries in foreign countries where both had corporate interests.
1.5.5.2.7. Con: This is partly due to the trade war with Trump forcing China into an '[economy of enemies](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/10/24/commentary/japan-commentary/reset-japan-china-relations/)', where it is left with no choice but to improve relations with any country it can find.
1.5.5.2.8. Con: The Japanese have taken the initiative to improve relations more so than the Chinese. Credit for it is due to them more than it is to Xi.
1.5.5.2.8.1. Pro: Shinzo Abe chose China as the country for his [first prime ministerial overseas visit](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24761028.2012.11869053) in 2006 \(p. 79\).
1.5.5.2.8.2. Pro: Abe has taken the initiative to be the first Japanese Prime Minister in [nearly 7 year](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2170469/china-japan-ties-historic-turning-point-after-shinzo-abes-visit)s to visit Beijing outside of multilateral meetings.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Under Xi Jinping, China's relationship with Russia is the strongest it has ever been.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: Part of the reason for the strength of this relationship has to do with deteriorating [US-China relations](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/03/xi-jinping-has-embraced-vladimir-putin-for-now/) - which implies that China may not be doing its best to improve ties with other states.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: A [strategic partnership](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/14/c_138554259.htm) has been developed between China and Russia, which strengthens their ties to one another.
1.5.5.3.3. Pro: A better relationship with Russia has a number of strategic benefits for China.
1.5.5.3.3.1. Pro: Russia is among the world’s [top three producers](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics) of oil and natural gas whereas China is the second largest crude oil importer in the world.
1.5.5.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.5.5.3.4. Pro: Xi has met Putin [more times](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3012017/china-looks-russia-central-asia-support-amid-tensions-us) than any other foreign leader since he took power in 2013.
1.5.5.4. Con: The relationship between the US and China has been deteriorating.
1.5.5.4.1. Con: The deteriorating relationship is the result of hostile policies initiated by the US.
1.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: Trump came out in support of [Taiwan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/trade-wars-aside-trump-s-taiwan-card-is-china-s-real-worry) against China.
1.5.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Recognizing Taiwan is a long-standing article of US foreign policy.
1.5.5.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The 1979 [Taiwan Relations Act](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/taiwan-relations-act/) provides the legal basis for the relationship between the two countries, and affirms a US commitment to helping Taiwan maintain its self-defense capacities.
1.5.5.4.1.1.2. Con: Trump's reaffirmation of the US' support for Taiwan is likely the result of deteriorating relations with China. This does not prove that the deteriorating relations are because of US policy failures.
1.5.5.4.1.2. Pro: The US [uninvited China](https://news.usni.org/2018/05/23/china-disinvited-participating-2018-rimpac-exercise) from participating in the 2018 RIMPAC exercise.
1.5.5.4.1.3. Pro: The Trump administration has cracked down on Chinese Communist Party-funded programs, known as [Confucius Institutes](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/14/house-proposal-targets-confucius-institutes-as-foreign-agents-china-communist-party-censorship-academic-freedom/), that offer language and culture classes on more than 100 college and university campuses in the United States.
1.5.5.4.2. Pro: According to a [survey](https://www.ft.com/content/75b391b6-e699-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59), the percentage of US citizens who view China unfavorably has risen from 47% in 2018 to 60% in 2019.
1.5.5.4.3. Pro: The US-China trade war has been underway for nearly [18 months.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45899310)
1.5.5.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.5.6. Con: Given the 'closed' nature of politics in China, it is difficult to determine if China even has a grand strategy. Even if they do, it would be difficult to assess what this precisely entails.
1.5.6.1. Con: Chinese government agencies issue [white papers](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-2019-defense-white-paper). This makes it easy to understand the nation's objectives.
1.5.6.2. Con: The existence of massive projects such as the [One Belt One Road](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/regional-integration/brief/belt-and-road-initiative) initiative strongly suggest that China has a coherent strategy toward becoming a great power.
1.5.7. Con: It is unlikely that China will ever be able to rival other great powers, such as the US.
1.5.7.1. Pro: China lacks the soft power influence that the US and Europe has been able to employ.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: Many countries Asia-Pacific [fear the rise](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/12/china-asia-pacific-blowing-chance/) of China, seeing it not as a potential ally but rather as a threat.
1.5.7.1.2. Pro: Chinese entertainment has [failed to gain](https://www.policyforum.net/chinas-soft-power-struggles/) global popularity as a soft cultural export.
1.5.7.1.3. Pro: Whilst there are [Chinese equivalents](https://www.policyforum.net/chinas-soft-power-struggles/) of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, it’s unclear if any of them have similar global market potential as their Western counterparts.
1.5.7.1.3.1. Con: China has [large multinational companies](https://fortune.com/2019/12/17/china-huawei-technology-ban-trump-germany/) active in the tech sphere such as Huwaei. These companies may in future be a source of competition to the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Youtube.
1.5.7.1.3.2. Pro: China and Western nations are culturally distinct. It makes sense that different companies will market themselves to appeal to one consumer at the expense of another.
1.5.7.1.3.3. Con: Facebook is [not a tech monopoly.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-facebook-a-monopoly-or-just-winning-the-game-11567953000) Even though it may be difficult for Chinese companies to become competitive in the global market, it remains entirely possible.
1.5.7.1.3.3.1. Pro: Technology is evolving rapidly. Given that, if a company is able to manufacture something that is considered a technological breakthrough, it is likely they will become key players in the tech market.
1.5.7.1.4. Pro: In an increasingly interconnected and integrated world, being powerful is [no longer](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3033751/chinese-soft-power-carrot-being-undermined-stick) about dominating land, resources and markets, but more about gaining trust, respect and support.
1.5.7.1.5. Con: China is actively attempting to develop its own soft power through institutions and agreements.
1.5.7.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.5.7.1.5.2. Pro: China is becoming increasingly favourably viewed by [African](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/) states.
1.5.7.1.5.3. Pro: China's ['Confucius Institutes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius_Institute) aim to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries.
1.5.7.1.6. Pro: Many Chinese people admire the US.
1.5.7.1.6.1. Pro: Chinese people have [long looked](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) to America as a source of inspiration.
1.5.7.1.6.1.1. Pro: Some [draw inspiration](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) from the idea of the American dream.
1.5.7.1.6.2. Pro: Many Chinese [love](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) their iPhones and are fans of American television like 'House of Cards' and 'Modern Family.'
1.5.7.1.6.3. Pro: Many [admire](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) America for its education system, strong rule of law, and soft-power dominance.
1.5.7.1.6.4. Pro: The United States is [one of the top](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) destinations for Chinese tourists.
1.5.7.1.6.4.1. Con: The number of Chinese people visiting America has [sharply decreased](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/asia/china-america-trade.html) in recent years.

1.5.7.1.6.4.1.2. Pro: This is likely due in part to the growing [trade and political tension](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/31/728590535/chinese-tourism-to-u-s-is-down-after-years-of-booming-growth) between the two countries.

1.5.7.1.6.5.3. Pro: In 2016, polls showed that only [50% of Chinese people](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/10/05/chinese-public-sees-more-powerful-role-in-world-names-u-s-as-top-threat/) had a favourable view of the America, whilst 44% had a negative view.

By comparing military expenditure to USA, no country could possibly appear to be a global power.
