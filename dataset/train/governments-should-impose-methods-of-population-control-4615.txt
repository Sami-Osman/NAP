Discussion Name: Governments should impose methods of population control.

1. Governments should impose coercive methods of population control.
1.1. Pro: Governments should ensure that population growth is sustainable enough to prevent depletion of resources required for the survival of current and future generations.
1.1.1. Con: The worldwide resource drain is not due to overpopulation but mass consumerism.
1.1.1.1. Con: The extent of resource drain is impacted not only by consumerism but also by the number of consumers.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a capitalist economy, companies aim to acquire as large a market share as possible. Therefore, to the extent that people rely on capitalism for resources, to that extent will they be coerced into becoming a part of [mass consumerism](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210120-how-the-world-became-consumerist).
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Population size is less relevant than the scale of consumption and [consumption patterns and habits](https://www.science.org.au/curious/earth-environment/population-environment). The US, for example, has a significantly higher [ecological footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint) than Hungary.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Over population would not be a problem if governments would [stop enabling or promoting](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/05/corruption-is-a-threat-to-planet-earth/)(Grand corruption—in which laws and regulations themselves are shaped by corrupt actors who benefit from them—can have grave consequences for environmental protection. Take the example of Honduras. As Sarah Chayes\nhas detailed, many of the country’s largest business interests, including mining, have direct connections to the highest levels of government and rely on weak environmental regulations to operate profitably. The government, in turn, placed these companies at the center of its development strategy, and provides them with continual support in spite of widespread environmental degradation.) unsustainable corporatized [consumption of resources](https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2019/the-profitability-of-destroying-our-planet).
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The population that needs to be controlled is the [small elite group](https://earthbound.report/2020/09/22/how-the-worlds-richest-destroyed-the-climate/) that continues to exploit the planet for the sake of profits. [Growth is falling](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN/?end=2015&start=1960), yet [emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions) and [pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) are [rising](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution) at alarming rates.
1.1.1.3. Con: Consumerism is so ingrained in people that it would likely be easier to reduce the population than to get people to consume less.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Consumption confers several significant psychological and social benefits on human beings \([pp. 1-2](https://www.endlich-wachstum.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Chapter3-Why_do_we-consume-Background_text.pdf)\); because of these rewards, human beings have few incentives to reduce consumption.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Consumerism is not natural or inherent to human beings; instead, it is an artificially created stating of [wanting more](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22547185/consumerism-competition-history-interview) than one needs, which is more pronounced in certain countries and sustained by heavy promotional campaigns.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Not all populations have the same levels of consumption and create the same amount of waste. Therefore, it would be more prudent to target countries that rank high on [resource consumption](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/the-countries-that-use-the-most-resources-per-person-14699472).
1.1.1.3.3. Con: Movements that are anti-consumption rather than anti-consumer are [gaining momentum](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2021/11/why-the-circular-economy-is-gaining-momentum-and-how-your-company-can-participate-webinar) around the world.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: [Taxation](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/794/economics/effect-of-tax-depending-on-elasticity/) decreases the demand for goods and services by raising the price, thereby proving that there are effective ways to control consumerism.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Developing countries are witnessing an increase in [per capita](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/indias-per-capita-power-consumption-rising-but-wide-variations-persist-across-states-6663841.html) [resource consumption](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/heres-why-developing-countries-will-consume-65-of-the-worlds-energy-by-2040/282006/) \(e.g., [animal products](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/11/3907S/4818041)\). Thus, even if population size remains the same, mass consumerism would continue to pose significant risks to resource drain.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The consumption of resources like electricity is closely linked to the [advancement of developing countries](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/indias-per-capita-power-consumption-rising-but-wide-variations-persist-across-states-6663841.html) like India \(e.g., education\). Thus, increased efforts to improve quality of life in such countries will inevitably increase resource consumption.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: If a person develops a new form of recycling or renewable energy, then their net resource consumption could be considered negative.
1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Every day, inventors create [innovative products](https://greenisthenewblack.com/10-crazy-but-cool-inventions-that-are-solving-the-worlds-environmental-problems/) that could help save the planet. The extent of damage prevented by collective uptake of such innovations \(e.g., [solar panels](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/brief-history-solar-panels-180972006/)\) presumably exceeds the amount of resources consumed by the individual inventor.
1.1.1.4.2.2. Con: The creation of green solutions necessitates resource consumption \(e.g., education\). For example, education necessitates the construction of a school and utilization of resources \(e.g., stationery and staffing\) - all of which are detrimental to the environment.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Even if all schools adopt remote learning - as was the case during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/edutech/brief/how-countries-are-using-edtech-to-support-remote-learning-during-the-covid-19-pandemic) - students would still need several resources such as [laptops and high-speed internet](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/learning-remotely-when-schools-close-how-well-are-students-and-schools-prepared-insights-from-pisa-3bfda1f7/) connections, which have negative [environmental effects](https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/guest-blog-post-the-alarming-environmental-impact-of-the-internet-and-how-you-can-help-6ff892b8730d).
1.1.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Physical schools and resources \(e.g., textbooks\) are no longer needed for education. The internet enables students to learn from home by means of formal education as well as informal self-learning.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Multiple compounding risks can simultaneously exist; the unique threats posed by [mass consumerism](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/consumerism-earth-suffers) do not negate those posed by [overpopulation](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-overpopulation.php). Therefore, both should be independently resolved to maximize their beneficial outcomes.
1.1.2. Pro: As population continues to increase, it will become increasingly more difficult to stop further population growth or achieve a return to sustainable levels.
1.1.2.1. Con: Worldwide, [birth rates](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/birthrates-declining-globally-why-matters/)(China’s population changes are not unique among the superpowers. According to the United States’ most recent census, the US birthrate has declined for six straight years and 19% since 2007 in total. Like China, the US birthrate is now well below replacement rate at 1.6. \(China is now at 1.3.\) For a country to naturally replace its population, its birthrate needs to be at least 2.1.\n\nYou can also add the world’s second-most populous country, India, to the list of low-fertility countries, with a birthrate at replacement rate \(2.1\). Also include Japan \(1.3\), Russia \(1.6\), Brazil \(1.8\), Bangladesh \(1.7\) and Indonesia \(2.0\).\n\nThere are still big countries with high birthrates, such as Pakistan \(3.4\) and Nigeria \(5.1\). But even these numbers are lower than they were in 1960 – when Pakistan was at 6.6 and Nigeria at 6.4 – and declining every year.) have decreased over the last few decades and are expected to continue decreasing in the coming decades.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Population growth [peaked in the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#/media/File:World_population_growth_rate_1950%E2%80%932050.svg) and has fallen substantially since then - from six in the 1970s to just 2.7 at present.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: China's [birthrate is the lowest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/china-s-record-low-birth-rate-underscores-population-challenges) it has been since the 1940s, falling under ten per 1,000 people for the first time since then.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Women in South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore all have birth rates [at or barely above one](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/total-fertility-rate)(188 Singapore 1.1\n187 Hong Kong 1.1\n189 South Korea 1).
1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: The average population growth rate does not accurately represent [changes in population size](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/10/for-world-population-day-a-look-at-the-countries-with-the-biggest-projected-gains-and-losses-by-2100/) across countries. Africa, in particular, is witnessing a high rate of [population growth](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2019-07-10/africa-to-lead-world-in-population-growth).
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The UN recently revised its [population growth](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) predictions: from expecting 11.5 billion by 2050, experts now claim that the peak will be at 9.5 billion people around 2070, and then it will begin to decline.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Though the birthrate may have peaked in 1968, the world population overall [continues](http://socialrebirth.org/understanding-population-limits/) to [grow unsustainably](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Population growth in developed countries has [nearly zeroed out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/)(The replacement fertility rate is roughly 2.1 live births per woman for most industrialised countries. Due to increased mortality rates, the approximate average for developing regions of the world is 2.3. At this rate, population growth through reproduction will be approximately 0, but still be affected by male-female ratios and mortality rates.); only the developing world is still growing.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The world population has [doubled since 1968](https://www.unfpa.org/press/challenges-opportunities-and-action-world-7-billion). Therefore, making decisions responsibly involves taking into account the unsustainability of unlimited population growth.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Worldwide, population growth rate predictions are constantly being [revised downwards](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europe-s-time-bomb-888030.html).
1.1.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Many millennials and members of Gen Z have responsibly chosen to [forgo having children](https://aldianews.com/articles/culture/social/generation-childfree-not-having-children-save-planet/64316).
1.1.2.1.4. Pro: Growth [rates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster) are already below replacement in most of the developed world and have progressed to negative in countries like [Japan](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/02/japans-population-is-shrinking-what-does-it-mean-for-the-economy/).
1.1.2.2. Pro: As resources become scarcer, companies will need to more aggressively compete with each other for market share; under such circumstances, [sustainability goals](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276077601_Effects_of_Market_Competition_on_the_Sustainability_Performance_of_the_Construction_Industry_China_Case) are likely to take a backseat.
1.1.2.3. Con: Given the [rapid evolution of technology](https://edinburghsensors.com/news-and-events/impact-of-technology-on-the-environment-and-environmental-technology/) in fields related to human sustainability, it is difficult to determine the "ideal" population size.
1.1.3. Pro: World population is already unsustainably high, and [key natural resources](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/oct/31/six-natural-resources-population) are expected to run out in a few decades.
1.1.3.1. Con: Planet Earth will never run out of water. The challenge is being able to [deliver clean freshwater](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/earth/ask-a-scientist-about-our-environment/will-earth-run-out-of-water) to regions experiencing water scarcity; this is a problem that technological advancements could help resolve.
1.1.3.2. Pro: There is not enough food to sustain larger populations, and people will go hungry unless governments impose population control restrictions to ensure sustainability.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: There is enough food and water to support a much larger human population.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Global food supply can be improved by adopting more [sustainable consumption practices](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/feeding-9-billion/).
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: If none of these actions are taken, expanding the population will almost certainly ruin the planet.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Despite pleas and pledges, there has been a [staggering decline](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/sea-running-out-of-fish-despite-nations-pledges-to-stop) in marine biodiversity. If things continue at the same pace, seafood is likely to become a thing of the past [by 2048](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/seafood-biodiversity).
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Growing public consciousness about the impact of meat consumption has been paralleled by more people making [sustainable lifestyle choices](https://sentientmedia.org/increase-in-veganism/). Given that even minor dietary changes can have a significant [effect on the planet](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/21/lifestyle-change-eat-less-meat-climate-change), these changes are likely to offset the effects of mass consumption of meat.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Sea-based farming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2616-y) can help counteract against the global food crisis and food insecurity.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: The maximum carrying capacity of the earth is [around 10 billion](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html)("If everyone agreed to become vegetarian, leaving little or nothing for livestock, the present 1.4 billion hectares of arable land \(3.5 billion acres\) would support about 10 billion people," Wilson wrote.), which will be reached by 2100. To be able to provide food for such a large global population, everyone would have to give up meat.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Reducing [meat consumption and food waste](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/eat-less-meat-food-security)(The massive increase in meat consumption in rich countries in recent decades has led to spikes in the price of grain, used for animal feed, as well as leading to widespread deforestation and pressure on agricultural land, and has contributed to the obesity epidemic. By avoiding meat even for a day or two each week, people could help to ease some of these pressures. \[...\] A national campaign on reducing food waste should also be an urgent priority, according to the MPs, as well as tough targets for big retailers to cut the amount of food they throw away.) would go a long way in mitigating food shortage around the world, particularly in poorer countries.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The [Lenten fast \(i.e., meat abstinence\)](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resource/56337/fasting-and-abstinence-during-lent) shows that it is possible for meat eaters to give up meat, if such a practice is aligned with their beliefs. Concern for the environment should be a valid reason for such groups to give up meat entirely.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Just because humans stop consuming meat does not mean that the unutilized crops will be shared with the poor. The same mechanisms that prioritize meat consumption by the wealthy over the welfare of the poor may also hinder such trickle-down effects.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Rates of meat consumption are highest in [rich nations](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47057341). Therefore, reduced meat consumption in rich countries is unlikey to mitigate food crises in poorer countries; in fact, the [outcomes](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/what-if-the-whole-world-went-vegetarian/) can be [negative](https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/5591351/anti-meat-message-hurting-poor-countries/), from a nutritional, economic, and environmental point of view.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Giving up meat can play a significant role in ending global [poverty](https://borgenproject.org/eating-less-meat-can-reduce-poverty/) and [hunger](https://www.worldanimalfoundation.org/advocate/farm-animals/params/post/1280889/veganism-can-end-worl) and save countries potentially [trillions of dollars](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/the-economic-case-for-worldwide-vegetarianism/475524/).
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.5. Pro: A significant percentage of plants fit for human consumption are used as [animal fodder](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/five-things-would-happen-if-everyone-stopped-eating-meat-a6844811.html). This demonstrates remarkable insensitivity to those suffering from hunger, starvation, and malnourishment.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.6. Pro: Giving up meat would also reduce the number of occurrences of [eutrophication](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466/), where algal blooms thrive in aquatic environments due to the nutrient-rich runoff from fertilizer and animal waste.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Estimates in the cited article assume that food can be grown only on arable land; recent advances in [hydroponics](https://stories.pinduoduo-global.com/agritech-hub/what-is-hydroponic-farming) and the potential to use other biomes as sources of food have not been considered in the estimation procedure \([pp. 58-59](https://www.oup.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/58017/Oxford-Big-Ideas-Geography-9-ch1-Growing-food.pdf)\).
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Land that is not suitable for growing crops \(i.e., non-arable land\) can be used to rear animals for milk and meat.
1.1.3.2.1.1.3.3. Con: The market will adjust to meet the increased demand for food by increasing the cost of [resource-inefficient foods](https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-US/whats-new/is-meat-production-an-efficient-use-of-resources)(In order to be fattened for the table, these intensively farmed animals must be fed. Factory farmed animals are given a grain-based diet originating from crops grown on agricultural land. The Earth Policy Institute estimates that approximately 35% of the world’s grain harvest is used to raise livestock for human consumption. This food could be used to directly feed the populations in starvation, which ignites debate over the ethical dimensions of meat production for wealthier regions.) \(e.g. meat\) and increasing the demand for resource-efficient foods \(e.g. potatoes, corn\).
1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: In [poor](https://www.globalissues.org/article/205/does-overpopulation-cause-hunger)(What they did find was that the populations of poorer countries, and those countries where the poorest 20 percent of the population earned a smaller percentage of a nation's total income, had less to eat. In other words, poverty and inequality cause hunger.) [overpopulated countries](https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines)(Of the countries for which we do have GHI data, it is clear that those with higher levels of hunger have also tended to have had higher population growth over the last 25 years.), available food resources are limited, and climate change is likely to [exacerbate this crisis](https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/overpopulation-in-india/)(A growing population will exacerbate climate change effects and further stress food insecurity. Climate change affects malnutrition in a myriad of ways. Climate change reduces agricultural yields and the nutritional value of staple crops, and it increases the prevalence and spread of diseases. Projections show that climate change will increase stunting by 30 percent to 50 percent by 2050. These and other effects are closely linked with malnutrition in poor communities.).
1.1.3.2.2. Con: The notion that overpopulation is a cause of world hunger has been [repeatedly debunked](https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/blog/hunger-and-population-growth-correcting-common-misunderstanding). Contrary to this common notion, population has increased, whereas childhood malnourishment has declined.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: An [Oxfam report](http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/803791/World-will-run-out-of-food-by-2050-population-boom) suggests that, although the population is rapidly growing, agricultural yields have almost halved since 1990.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Population growth is closely linked to climate change, which in turn poses significant threats to crop yield \(e.g., [extreme weather conditions](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/70658)\).
1.1.3.2.3.2. Con: There are suitable alternatives that can be used to avert a food crisis. For example, [food and agricultural technologies](https://www.ifpri.org/news-release/agricultural-technologies-could-increase-global-crop-yields-much-67-percent-and-cut) provide very high yields of vegetarian food, whereas alternative [sources like insects](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/bugs-you-can-eat-and-why-theyre-good-for-you/) provide very high yields of fat-free, protein-high foods.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Con: There are [biological risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221457451930001X) for introducing insects into areas where they are not native.
1.1.3.2.3.2.2. Con: The "food crisis" is a misnomer as there is no shortage of food or agricultural yield. Instead, rising hunger is attributable to [significant food waste](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/10/1048452); specifically, a third of all global food production is wasted.
1.1.3.2.3.2.3. Pro: In a [2015 NIH study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4483736/), hydroponics offered 11 ± 1.7 times higher yields compared to conventionally produced lettuce.
1.1.3.2.3.2.3.1. Con: At the same time, hydroponically grown lettuce requires [82 ± 11 times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4483736/) more energy compared to conventionally-produced lettuce. This is an unsustainable amount of energy.
1.1.3.2.3.2.3.2. Pro: Hydroponically-grown produce requires substantially [less water and land](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4483736/) than conventional agriculture.
1.1.3.2.3.2.4. Pro: Agricultural [efficiency](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/advantages-disadvantages-intensive-farming.php) increases as technology improves.
1.1.3.2.3.2.4.1. Con: According to the World Bank, total [land area used for agriculture is falling since 2000](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.K2), mainly due to soil erosion stemming from overuse and desperate, unsustainable practices. If trends continue, we will have no [farmlands](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/) in 60 years.
1.1.3.2.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Inventing and utilizing fusion energy \(or any other means of efficient energy production\) would only result in depleting the natural resources that much faster. The basis of economy is natural resources \(soil, freshwater, minerals, oil etc.\) and they are limited.
1.1.3.2.3.2.5. Pro: There are proposals to "[green" deserts](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43962688), which would create large amounts of new and productive land.
1.1.3.3. Con: Technological advancements will help society be better equipped to handle future strains on resources.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: As long as humans continue to use non-renewable resources, the impact of [CO2 emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19301270) cannot be reversed; [atmospheric temperature](https://sciencing.com/carbon-dioxide-affect-environment-8583965.html) and ocean levels will continue to rise, and the environment will become unsustainable.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In 2013, more than 50% of [global coal consumption](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/featurethe-worlds-biggest-coal-consumers-4353695/) was attributable to China.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: A significant proportion of the world has already shifted to renewable energy. This trend is only likely to gain momentum as renewable energy is becoming [increasingly cheaper](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/cost-renewable-energy-falling-race-to-zero-emissions/) and world leaders are committed to [clean energy](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1100712).
1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: In the past, technological advances have allowed us to do more with less; similarly, future advances will solve many of the problems being experienced at present, such as [climate change](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/innovation-and-climate-change/).
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Humans are the greatest resource on Earth because they can innovate and help each other by developing technological advancements to save the planet.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Con: Human beings are [dependent on the environment](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1525003113) and other species; therefore, human activity should be permitted only to the extent that it does not negatively impact the environment.
1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: A smaller population means fewer minds to put together to [innovate and effectively resolve](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2018/03/09/what-role-does-population-play-in-innovation/?sh=149012226ff6)(Entrepreneur James Liang also believes that population can provide telltale clues as to the innovative capabilities of a nation. He argues in his latest book, The Demographics of Innovation, that population growth is vital for innovation and entrepreneurship.) the problems facing the planet.
1.1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: That humans are a valuable resource does not negate the need to ensure that the population does not exceed the carrying capacity of the Earth.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Apocalyptic [consequences of overpopulation](http://www.socialstudies.org/sites/default/files/publications/se/6106/610608.html) are likely to be averted by [technological advancements](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8678-2_6) such as [space exploration](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/527058-how-space-exploration-will-help-to-address-climate-change), which may help human beings counteract against the effects of environmental destruction.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: Even if technological progress temporarily averts the Malthusian crisis, there is no certainty that the said technological progress will not come with its own host of problems.
1.1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: The [sustainable technology](https://www.rubicon.com/sustainability-hub/articles/what-is-sustainable-technology/) movement aims to develop and promote solutions that maximize efficiency while reducing any potential negative impacts on the environment \([p. 7](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230873698_What_is_Sustainable_Technology_Perceptions_Paradoxes_and_Possibilities)\).
1.1.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: [Endocrine disruptors](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/endocrine/definitions/endodis_en.htm), [greenhouse gases](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions), and [pollution](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-air-pollution.php) are examples of disastrous side effects of technological progress that offered short-term benefits to humankind.
1.1.3.3.3.2. Con: The possibility that human beings might one day colonize other planets doesn’t solve the [problems facing humanity](https://www.worldgovernmentsummit.org/press/news/elon-musk%27s-plans-to-%27colonise-mars%27-a-distraction-from-earth%27s-dire-climate-problems-experts-tell-uae-summit) today. It only [exacerbates the problem](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17991736/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-colonizing-mars-moon-space-blue-origin-spacex) here, and would likely cause the humans to perpetuate these same problems on the new colonized planet.
1.1.3.3.3.3. Con: There is no evidence that human beings will be able to meaningfully colonize other planets before the effects of overpopulation become a serious and widespread threat.
1.1.3.3.3.4. Pro: [Technologies](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/762844/FROZEN-IN-TIME-space-travel-planet-colony) such as pods that can sustain frozen humans, so that they can endure interplanetary travel, are already being conceived. In the future, it may be possible to cryonically freeze living human beings so that they can be transported to space.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Freshwater makes up only [3% of the water](https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/freshwater-systems) on earth's surface. [Many large rivers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/rivers) are now so overtapped that they discharge little or no water to the sea for months at a time.
1.1.3.5. Pro: The worldwide shortage of phosphorous - one of the most [important soil minerals](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/phosphorus-a-looming-crisis/) that are essential for crops - poses an immediate threat to food supply.
1.1.4. Con: Population control is not needed because [overpopulation is a myth](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/12/16766872/overpopulation-exaggerated-concern-climate-change-world-population).
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.2.1.
1.1.4.2. Con: The maximum number of people that can be indefinitely supported \(i.e., [carrying capacity](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/david-attenborough-warns-planet-cant-cope-with-overpopulation/)(Scientists are still undecided on the Earth’s "carrying capacity" - the maximum number of people it can support indefinitely - with estimates ranging widely between 500 million and more than one trillion.)\) is difficult to determine. By some estimates, the threshold has already been breached many times over, so the current population size may not be indefinitely supportable.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Overpopulation is a [modern concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism) that is largely based on "[The Population Bomb](http://theconversation.com/a-long-fuse-the-population-bomb-is-still-ticking-50-years-after-its-publication-96090)," which incorrectly predicted that a global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s due to excess population growth.
1.1.4.4. Pro: As developing countries reach the level of technological [development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781829/) found in Western democracies, their population growth slows to sustainable levels.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: The UN has predicted that, due to the rapid technological development of the developing world and the impending population growth slowdown, it is unlikely that the population of the Earth will [ever reach](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html) 12 billion people.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: While technological development may slow down population growth by reducing fertility, improved [healthcare](https://medium.com/memos-of-the-future/the-technology-of-aging-how-to-live-a-longer-life-3e379ccb02f3) and [life-extending](https://interestingengineering.com/how-long-do-you-want-to-live-this-technology-could-potentially-help-people-live-forever) advancements may offset the reductions in population size.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: The threshold of sustainability applies only to highly-developed consumer societies. More than half of the world's population lives on [ten dollars per day or less](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/) and more than one billion people survive on less than one dollar per day; their impact is minimal.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.5. Pro: Child activists like [Greta Thunberg](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719) have vocalized their anger and frustration over having to cope with the ramifications of environmental destruction caused by previous generations.
1.1.5.1. Con: Population control would likely reduce the number of environmental activists in society, particularly those as vocal and influential as [Greta Thunberg](https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/meet-the-activists).
1.1.5.2. Pro: A population that is sustainable with regard to the demands placed on the environment ensures that the next generation has access to the same resources that they have been able to enjoy.
1.1.6. Con: Poverty is a man-made phenomenon caused by the [inequitable distribution](https://www.eapn.eu/what-is-poverty/causes-of-poverty-and-inequality/) of resources. [Resource hoarding](https://blog.ted.com/who-controls-the-world-resources-for-understanding-this-visualization-of-the-global-economy/) by the [wealthiest](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/just-8-men-own-same-wealth-half-world) strata of society is [unsustainable](http://whygreeneconomy.org/inequality-of-overconsumption/).
1.1.6.1. Pro: Countries routinely classified as poor are also the most unequal. For example, in India - one of the most unequal nations - [more than three-fourth](https://www.oxfam.org/en/india-extreme-inequality-numbers) of the national wealth is held by the wealthiest 10% of the population.
1.1.6.2. Con: A smaller population size would mean more resources can be allocated per person. This could counteract against poverty.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Australia is dealing with the opposite problem: [underpopulation](https://www.internetgeography.net/igcse-geography/population-and-settlement-igcse-geography/a-country-which-is-under-populated-australia/), because of which their [natural resources](https://www.internetgeography.net/igcse-geography/population-and-settlement-igcse-geography/a-country-which-is-under-populated-australia/)(Australia is rich in natural resources with large reserves of natural gas, oil, gold, uranium and metal ores. Uranium is important in the development of nuclear power around the world. Australia attracts migrant workers to support the exploitation of these natural resources. Australia has the 9th highest immigrant population in the world with 6.7 million, which makes up 28.2% of its population.) remain under-utilized.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: A small population does not [protect Australia from](https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/underpopulated-overexploited/) environmental degradation.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Forty percent of Australian forests have been [cleared](https://watermark.silverchair.com/rtr038.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArwwggK4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKpMIICpQIBADCCAp4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMVSjChbJmzXSaeVFDAgEQgIICb9iNtiVk_CWWQR0sTLd_ICxwyGBL-vw5G2j9IZgykEr3cFzLSSAIir9j4ILBo2rmmIqjPkgN3w76lzyWPYHv45RhhFbJIfnI1Ype9Mx_owvtYyFB2ERI10Fe3cbWYKBGgtLUN6hPg5q1yXstDZdp4KXP_eDjPleMYSlOUqIKvgj2IgUxKG_BPba6jbZdqvVoDsqKUExguiKUq7W0YOQKBFUNOgPeRFNDhwlNy21QQJIkdaouoWPnab-ZF8L6nupX4EQdm8llkoPIEyn2vovJq6C0g-MowkZHQwI6DYTyKtwG9mTtYBuqRWCR5CYsI9xUVwNxEzEpFldKUZJZbFArjzPewT55TsRCIfxuH4K9Zxx7xLaqBH9eWvRuSre52b8itgv6TloQ4IQ5Z0-VTdb_o5CvWeWRJ_zUouW6YbU9MOmFHQZHP7B0vmcs5MJJNT4SQjwcETrO2PhSDAUpb0ihgX7uIRTOrX-ANB7aejMGYJ9KLqsRQvvn8htDyj6TzpChPuYT1eUwEd-FeRz-OhxI2g88e0HzG8R5t_QjJ6OegXM2wRTcTbASTRNSCQtoNaV1TjbmDOp4jqxApHGaUVbb4vq7ZqhfX4CC6lgs8rSHhdEXSJUBT018Lnvm_kj9CwGJPlN4LQXfN-JqVoFeDorAjqA79e-U5EUI2rNF9Yve4D-LzC7fy7X_GJ0X5Q7ruEYIE8wZpbPB-IJg5MmNOWQDAUj61j0B0efUky2l8mGs54sZ4u9XYLxDJAcLae3IpVfAJFvOVKjIc-703ZwFyn2YNJ2IzQVSxBaHaP7OOaIMDRpxOBtCg_LeJDM1om5pOLft)(p. 109) since Europeans began to colonize the land at the end of the 18th century.
1.1.6.2.1.1.2. Pro: Fishing fleets have [depleted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325491433_Rapid_declines_across_Australian_fishery_stocks_indicate_global_sustainability_targets_will_not_be_achieved_without_an_expanded_network_of_%27no-fishing%27_reserves) many key Australian fish stocks; more than 15% have been overfished or fully exploited, and 35% are data-deficient.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Australia has a significantly large [immigrant population](https://www.internetgeography.net/igcse-geography/population-and-settlement-igcse-geography/a-country-which-is-under-populated-australia/); their underutilized natural resources are an important motivating factor that increases immigration.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Countries with small populations may offer job opportunities for all of their citizens.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Some countries like Portugal are significantly under-populated due to mass emigration of its most qualified citizens, which poses significant threats to the laborforce and economy. This problem is so significant that the government is willing to [pay emigrants](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/portugal-emigration-incentives-population?fbclid=IwAR1Z1CpCf8Urc5f4gRA7pWkz2tM0aR9BVQdFcT_de2ct8clGWzqByrMW7Ic) to return.
1.1.6.2.2.2. Pro: Overpopulation has adverse effects on employment in that many people have to [compete for few jobs](https://work.chron.com/can-overpopulation-decrease-jobs-26855.html) and settle for a lower pay, as there will always be equally qualified candidates who are willing to work for significantly lower pay.
1.1.6.2.2.3. Con: Countries with some of the [lowest unemployment rates](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/nine-countries-where-everyone-has-a-job) are often highly populated nations such as China and Japan. Thus, population size and employment rate appear to largely be independent factors.
1.1.6.2.2.4. Con: [Underpopulation](https://www.libertyradio.co.uk/wayajqi/effects-of-under-population.html) can lead to labor shortages, which can prove particularly problematic when there are not enough workers to fill in crucial positions.
1.1.6.2.3. Con: Fewer people does not necessarily mean fewer resources per person. In accordance with the law of [economies of scale](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-are-economies-of-scale/), more resources would be required to support the needs of each individual person.
1.1.6.2.4. Pro: Taking care of fewer children requires fewer resources and, therefore, strains local and global resources to a lesser extent.
1.1.6.2.4.1. Pro: Population control would help combat [climate change](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about), as overpopulation is [a root cause of climate change](https://www.magellantv.com/articles/overpopulation-in-the-era-of-climate-change).
1.1.6.2.4.1.1. Con: What people do has a bigger environmental impact than the total population. For example, [statistics indicate](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Environment/Ecological-footprint) that on average, every individual living in a G7 country has more of an impact on the environment than ten people from a non-G7 state.
1.1.6.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: A child in the US is responsible for seven times the [pollution](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/science/earth/bringing-up-the-issue-of-population-growth.html) of a Chinese child.
1.1.6.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Given that [Chinese children](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-undercounted-the-number-of-kids-born-by-nearly-12mn-101637786995242.html)(The latest statistical yearbook released by the government puts the number of children born during that period at 172.5 million, well above the 160.9 million in that age group recorded in the 2010 census.) outnumber [American children](https://www.childrensdefense.org/state-of-americas-children/soac-2021-child-population/)(In 2019, there were over 73 million children in the United States—making up 22 percent of our nation’s population.) more than threefold, this comparison is not entirely useful as it downplays the impact of each child in China while overstating the impact of each child in the US.
1.1.6.2.4.1.1.2. Con: Population control and consumption reduction are [not mutually exclusive](https://clintonwhitehouse3.archives.gov/PCSD/Publications/TF_Reports/pop-intr.html).
1.1.6.2.4.1.2. Pro: Deciding [against having children](https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/no-kids-better-for-the-environment-a4198451.html)(While we can lessen our environmental impact by flying less and reducing our use of single-use plastic – the answer could well be in the number of children we bear. A study from 2017 found that the ‘greatest impact individuals can have in fighting climate change is to have one fewer child’.\n\nThe study, published in Environmental Research Letters, found having one fewer child than planned could reduce carbon emissions for each parent by 58 tonnes for each year of their life.) or having one fewer child is the best thing a person can do to save the planet.
1.1.6.2.4.1.3. Pro: Worsening climate change caused by uncontrolled population growth can elicit damaging psychological reactions from people, including [eco-anxiety](https://news.trust.org/item/20210526120959-puazp/) and [suicide](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/03/29/effects-climate-change-suicide-rates/).
1.1.6.2.4.1.4. Con: Combating climate change requires [deliberate effort and collaboration](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/how-cross-sector-collaboration-is-driving-the-global-climate-agenda/) from diverse sets of people across the globe; reducing the population size would inevitably reduce the number of climate change experts and innovators available to address these issues.
1.1.6.2.4.1.4.1. Con: Despite the availability of environmentally-friendly alternatives, putting them into practice has proven to be quite difficult due to a general lack of international collaboration.
1.1.6.2.4.1.4.1.1. Con: The COVID-19 pandemic thrust the entire world in a global crisis necessitating [global solidarity](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/globalpartnerships/). If the same trend of global collaboration continues, sustainable development goals can be met effectively.
1.1.6.2.4.1.4.1.2. Con: The [United Nations](https://www.iso.org/news/2015/12/Ref2031.html)(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) has resolved to achieve, “for the first time, in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a legally binding and universal agreement on climate from all nations of the world ”, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 °C by the end of the century – an agreement seen as crucial by the scientific community who advise that warming above 2 °C is likely to lead to catastrophic and irreversible weather events.) has established an agreement that is "legally binding and universal" for all countries.
1.1.6.2.4.1.4.1.3. Pro: The United States, the second largest carbon polluter in the world, has demonstrated the difficulty of maintaining these agreements across regime changes, having joined and left the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/climate/syria-joins-paris-agreement.html) in successive presidencies.
1.1.6.2.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.6.2.4.1.6. Pro: A smaller population would decrease [consumption](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/12/16/buying-stuff-drives-climate-change/), which stimulates the creation of greenhouse gases.
1.1.6.2.4.1.6.1. Con: A smaller population does not necessarily imply reduced consumption. A [smaller wealthier population](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/wealthy-people-climate-change-energy-consumption/) could consume just as much, if not more, than larger poorer populations.
1.1.6.2.4.1.6.2. Pro: Overpopulation requires an [increase in agricultural production](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315493569_Overpopulation-Food_Security-Agriculture_Productivity-Climate_Change_Nexus_Challenges_for_Agricultural_Sustainability), which [has a significant impact on ecology](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266484064_Impact_of_agricultural_practice_on_ecosystem_services).
1.1.6.2.4.2. Pro: [Poor families](https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/why-do-the-poor-have-large-families) tend to be larger. These children tend to grow up [deprived of basic needs](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/reports/2021/01/12/494506/basic-facts-children-poverty/).
1.1.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: Without their basic needs being met, some of these children could grow up to [become criminals](https://www.childinthecity.org/2018/11/02/study-links-childhood-poverty-to-violent-crime-and-self-harm/?gdpr=accept&gdpr=accept)(The research showed that children who remained in the top 20 per cent of wealthiest families over their first 15 years of life were the least likely to harm themselves or commit violent crime between the ages of 15 and 33. While those from families who remained in the least affluent fifth of society were seven times more likely to harm themselves and 13 times more likely to commit violent crime as young adults.) and commit crimes in order to survive.
1.1.6.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: There are proven links between the legalization of abortion and the resulting [decrease in crime rates](https://www.prb.org/resources/new-study-claims-abortion-is-behind-decrease-in-crime/) that occurs 15-20 years later.
1.1.6.2.4.2.1.2. Con: Criminality is not specific to children from poor families. The only difference between children from poor and [rich families](https://psmag.com/social-justice/rich-kids-commit-crimes-80286) is their motives for engaging in [criminal behavior](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rich-kids-turn-to-crime-for-kicks/articleshow/49852105.cms) \(e.g., boredom, attention\).
1.1.6.2.4.2.1.3. Con: Differences in crime rates between poor and rich children may be exaggerated because affluent people can [buy justice](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24108551_Should_the_Wealthy_Be_Able_to_Buy_Justice) and often [get away with crime](https://time.com/5793956/supreme-court-loves-rich/).
1.1.6.2.4.2.1.4. Pro: Large families tend to [produce](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3900289/) more alcoholics and delinquents.
1.1.6.2.4.2.2. Pro: Having more children can [drive families into poverty](https://www.eldis.org/document/A75457), as evidenced by widespread deprivation in countries such as [India](https://www.indiaspend.com/more-children-means-worse-deprivation-for-indias-poor-families/)(Nearly half \(47.9%\) the Indian households that have more than five children are severely deprived of shelter, water, sanitation, health and education as compared to 7.8% of poor families without children, according to the latest Indian Human Development Survey released on May 11, 2019.), where very large families are common.
1.1.6.2.4.2.3. Con: There is a close association between [being poor](https://thehumanist.com/news/national/why-are-the-poor-more-religious/) and [being religious](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/do-countries-lose-religion-as-they-gain-wealth-1.1310451). Given that many religions oppose [birth control](https://medicamentalia.org/contraceptives/religion/), reducing the average family size among the poor would require an ideological shift, which can be difficult to achieve.
1.1.6.2.4.2.3.1. Con: Collaborative efforts between religious and non-religious entities have [proven effective](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03531-7)(Elsewhere in the world, a consensus is emerging between religious groups and policymakers on the importance of family-planning services. The Faith to Action Network, founded in 2010, now includes more than 200 religious leaders and faith-based organizations that represent the world’s major religions. They signed the Interfaith Declaration to Improve Family Health and Well-Being to serve as ‘first movers’ in the endorsement and implementation of government family-planning policies and programmes in their respective countries.) in promoting birth control.
1.1.6.2.4.2.3.2. Pro: In countries with low contraception use rates such as Ghana, [low uptake](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2055102920975975)(p. 5) has been found to be partially attributable to religiosity.
1.1.6.2.4.2.4. Pro: [Corporal punishment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3900289/) is more common among larger families, which could have an effect on the mental and emotional states of the children.
1.1.6.2.4.3. Con: A low birth rate will eventually lead to a stunted and old workforce that places monumental and systemic strains on institutions \(e.g., healthcare\).
1.1.6.2.4.4. Pro: There is a [direct correlation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4203450/) between a declining population and declining crime rates.
1.1.6.3. Con: The rich do not hoard wealth; they [reinvest it](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-millionaires-keep-money-201959651.html). This not only generates income for the wealthy but also supports capitalism, which is the [most efficient method](https://catalyst.independent.org/2019/06/14/capitalism-remains-the-best-way-to-combat-extreme-poverty/) for [eradicating poverty](https://borgenproject.org/alleviate-poverty/).
1.1.6.3.1. Con: [The elite](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart) hoard their disposable income and [create illiquidity](https://www.ft.com/content/7ebfa850-bf2d-11e9-9381-78bab8a70848); in contrast, poor people spend a greater proportion of their income on [basic necessities](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money).
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: [Rich people](https://www.thepinnaclelist.com/articles/how-billionaires-invest-in-real-estate-and-what-you-can-learn-from-them/) tend to invest their wealth in [real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/real-estate-is-still-the-best-investment-you-can-make-today-millionaires-say.html) - which contributes to [financial illiquidity](https://www.millionacres.com/real-estate-basics/real-estate-terms/what-is-real-estate-liquidity/).
1.1.6.3.1.2. Con: Despite common misperceptions, the wealthy are quite [generous](https://econofact.org/are-rich-people-really-less-generous) and charitable. In 2020 alone, the wealthy donated more than [15 times](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-much-wealthy-households-donated-in-2020-and-how-it-compares-to-the-rest-of-us-11632867016) the amount donated by the general population.
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffet, swears by the strategy of [compound interests](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/08/billionaire-warren-buffett-most-overlooked-fact-about-how-he-got-so-rich.html). Even a small investment of money can, across decades, evolve into a [very large sum](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/warren-buffetts-advice-from-1999-on-how-he-would-invest-10000-dollars.html).
1.1.6.3.3. Pro: Even when wealth is not reinvested, it is likely saved in a bank. The bank then [reinvests the money](https://www.thebalance.com/how-banks-make-money-315473), which facilitates the accumulation of capital required for "non-elites" to engage in enterprise.
1.1.6.3.3.1. Con: The rise of ["housing as an investment](https://evonomics.com/unproductive-rent-housing-macfarlane/?fbclid=IwAR3iHImw7NJ36gWoSoC79TN0XiW30VdRprBj5ZYoHs0C-IuBwZhlhGWxk1g)" rather than as homes means that banks currently loan a smaller proportion to young businesses than they did in Victorian days.
1.2. Con: Nature offers more effective forms of population control than those implemented by governments.
1.2.1. Con: Natural disasters are unavoidable, while government-imposed hard controls do not necessarily need to be implemented.
1.2.1.1. Con: There are many means through which [natural disasters](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/why-natural-disasters-arent-all-that-natural/) can be predicted and prevented. At the very least, the impact of natural disasters can be mitigated significantly.
1.2.1.2. Con: Recent increases in the rates of natural disasters are partially attributable to [human activity](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1099172)(“What we can learn from this report is that disasters we see happening around the world are much more interconnected than we may realize, and they are also connected to individual behaviour”, says one of the report’s authors, UNU scientist Jack O’Connor. “Our actions have consequences, for all of us.”). Thus, changing how human beings interact with nature could reduce the rate at which such events occur.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Natural disasters are often followed by an outpouring of [support and altruism](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/unshakable-humanity-altruism-and-disaster.html). In contrast, support offered to victims of hard controls may be intercepted by the government, further [exacerbating](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/08/020808075321.htm) their experience of trauma.
1.2.2. Con: Methods of population control through nature no longer have a significant effect on population numbers; humanity has found novel methods to circumvent almost all natural population control methods.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Progress and innovation have enabled humanity to overcome most forms of natural population control, such as famine, droughts, and predators.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Despite predictions to the contrary, [famine mortality rates](https://ourworldindata.org/famines) have decreased, not increased, alongside population growth. This is because modern industrialization has generated strategies to prevent or counteract against famines.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Drought frequency and intensity have reduced in some world regions but [increased in others](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/drought-everything-you-need-know). In general, however, climate change is expected to significantly increase [drought risk and ramifications](https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2021/04/30/how-climate-change-is-worsening-drought/).
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: The [development of tools and weapons](https://www.livescience.com/why-predators-dont-attack-humans.html) have provided human beings with the arsenal necessary to protect themselves from man-eaters and predators.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: Predators no longer pose significant risks to human beings, because their existence has been [endangered by human activity](https://www.livescience.com/why-predators-dont-attack-humans.html) - directly through the killing of wild animals, and indirectly through destruction of their habitats.
1.2.2.1.5. Pro: The human species has never been significantly threatened by predators.
1.2.2.1.5.1. Con: Man-eaters, predators, and venomous and disease-carrying animals - including beloved domestic pets like dogs - account for tens of thousands of [\(preventable\) deaths](https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-the-worlds-15-deadliest-animals).
1.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: Human beings are the ultimate predators who have evolved to [appear intimidating to animals](https://www.livescience.com/why-predators-dont-attack-humans.html) \(e.g., bipedalism\). Therefore, animal predators tend to fear and stay away from human beings.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Even at their worst, [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll#Ten_deadliest_natural_disasters_since_1900) reduced world population by only 0.2%.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Deaths due to natural disasters are likely to [increase significantly](https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world) in the coming years as climate destruction is increasing the number of severe weather events around the world.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: There are many ways to protect people from natural disasters. This can take the form of limiting access to disaster-prone regions \(e.g., volcanoes\) or using countermeasures that mitigate damage \(e.g., [earthquake-resistant buildings](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190114-how-japans-skyscrapers-are-built-to-survive-earthquakes)\).
1.2.2.3. Con: Humanity cannot escape nature's ultimate population control method: death due to [natural causes](https://nypost.com/2017/11/01/the-idea-that-humans-can-live-forever-is-impossible-scientists-confirm/).
1.2.2.4. Con: Natural population control methods such as natural disasters are closely linked to recent changes in human society, such as overcrowding. Increasing urbanization and associated [demographic changes](https://www.prb.org/resources/disaster-risk/) increase the risk of such disasters.
1.2.3. Pro: A large population size is self-limiting. Scarce resources, new diseases, war, and displacement will significantly reduce population size without government intervention.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Fatal diseases and viruses are capable of keeping populations under control.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: [Fatal diseases](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/covid-19-will-hit-poor-hardest-heres-what-we-can-do-about-it) disproportionately affect [vulnerable populations](https://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf)(p. 4) such as [the poor](https://www.healthpovertyaction.org/news-events/key-facts-poverty-and-poor-health/). It is unethical to use such diseases intentionally as a form of population control.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Because of [medical and scientific advancements](https://aperioncare.com/blog/inventions-life-expectancy/), human beings are able to live longer and healthier lives. Thus, diseases are unlikely to significantly impact population size.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Natural forms of population control, such as viral diseases, can be quite [effectively treated](https://microbiologysociety.org/our-work/75th-showcasing-why-microbiology-matters/understanding-viruses-challenges-in-microbiology/how-viruses-are-treated.html) by humans.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Modern lifestyle changes \(e.g., diet, inactivity\) have increased the prevalence of [lifestyle diseases](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/lifestyle-diseases-are-affecting-around-75-per-cent-of-the-population/articleshow/65484601.cms) \(e.g., hypertension, obesity\) that are significant risk factors for life-threatening conditions \(e.g., heart disease, cancer\).
1.2.3.1.2.3. Pro: Many countries offer [universal, free, or subsidized](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-universal-healthcare) healthcare. This acts as a significant check against the effect of diseases on population size.
1.2.3.1.2.4. Pro: [Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm) have prevented tens of thousands of deaths each year since their creation.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: In 2019, [WHO officials](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/11-03-2019-who-launches-new-global-influenza-strategy) noted that a serious pandemic was "not a question of if, but when." This was reminiscent of prior [bird and swine flu](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wired-explains-bird-flu-swine-flu?) outbreaks.
1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: Months after their prediction, the COVID-19 outbreak began, and the worldwide death toll as of January 2022 totaled [more than five million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html).
1.2.3.1.3.2. Con: The WHO has concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic was [preventable](https://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Fulltext/2021/08000/WHO_Report__COVID_19_Was_a_Preventable_Disaster.10.aspx); at the very least, the scale of the pandemic could have been mitigated, had governments and international bodies functioned more [efficiently and responsibly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/12/covid-pandemic-was-preventable-says-who-commissioned-report).
1.2.3.2. Con: The [amount of suffering](https://www.uh.edu/class/news/archive/2017/august-september/natural-disasters-impact-adults/) caused by natural population control far outweighs any benefits gleaned from a marginal decrease in the population. Therefore, more humane methods of population control should be devised and implemented.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Governmental population control methods such as [education](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/how-education-can-moderate-population-growth/)(Studies conducted by Mr Lutz and his team support this. The researchers found that, on average, uneducated Malian women gave birth to almost 7 children. For the better-educated, the number was about four.\n\n“Education leads to lower birth rates and slows population growth,” he says. “This makes it easier for countries to develop. A more-educated workforce also makes poverty eradication and economic growth easier to achieve.”) and [voluntary family planning](https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23931930-500-civilised-voluntary-population-control/)(Using civilised, voluntary means, we must rapidly stabilise, then reduce, our population. The means are well-known and cheap: education for women everywhere; free contraception; and removal of social, political and financial incentives for big families.) would be more humane than population control achieved by death due to starvation in countries disproportionately affected by resource depletion.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: More than [225,000 lives](https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Ocean-tsunami-of-2004) were lost in the [2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami); the amount of human suffering endured by survivors was catastrophic. These events highlight the need to find humane ways rather than rely on natural disasters to control the population.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Imposing population control methods would neither prevent natural disasters from occurring nor alleviate the amount of suffering experienced by affected people.
1.2.3.2.4. Con: More humane methods of population control such as education about climate change effects can be more inhumane, as they can trigger [serious psychological problems](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/climate-change-and-mental-health-connections).
1.2.3.2.5. Pro: Natural events such as [disasters](https://www.preventionweb.net/understanding-disaster-risk/risk-drivers/poverty-inequality) and [disease outbreaks](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/covid-19-will-hit-poor-hardest-heres-what-we-can-do-about-it) affect the poorest people the most. Thus, leaving population control to natural mechanisms will disproportionately punish those born into disadvantaged communities.
1.2.3.3. Con: The problems caused by resource scarcity are the very problems that can be avoided by controlling population growth.
1.2.4. Con: More than [99% of all species](https://www.discovery.com/nature/99-Percent-Of-The-Earths-Species-Are-Extinct) that have ever existed on Earth have gone extinct; without a concerted collective effort, the human species will likely be eradicated as well.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Prior mass extinctions were caused by external factors such as meteorites. However, the impending mass extinction will be the first to have been caused by [human activity](https://www.discovery.com/nature/99-Percent-Of-The-Earths-Species-Are-Extinct)(Experts believe that a sixth mass extinction is on its way. Estimates vary, but somewhere between a few dozen to more than a hundred species go extinct every day. At that rate, it would only take a few tens of thousands of years to wipe out the same number of species as the third mass extinction. This time, however, we can't point to a meteorite as the cause. We only have ourselves to blame.).
1.2.4.2. Con: Many organisms that are essential for human survival have survived nature's attempts at population control. Therefore, it is unlikely that the extinction of some species will ultimately lead to the extinction of the human species.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Despite [mass extinctions](https://www.discovery.com/nature/99-Percent-Of-The-Earths-Species-Are-Extinct) and the loss of more than 99% of all species to have ever existed, human beings are still around. This implies that organisms essential for human survival are resilient; therefore, potential biodiversity loss is not a valid reason to limit population growth.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: [Cyanobacteria](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanointro.html) were some of the first organisms on Earth and have survived every major extinction event.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: Cyanobacteria are [incredibly hardy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cyanobacteria) and able to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth; this is hardly an equal comparison to the survival of humans.
1.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: Cyanobacteria are essential to the [survival of all lifeforms](https://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/little-things-matter-a-lot/), including human life; notably, they play a crucial role in oceanic nutrient cycles and formation of atmospheric oxygen.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: [Trilobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite) survived for millions of years and endured many extinctions, yet they ultimately went extinct during the [Great Dying](https://www.livescience.com/why-trilobites-went-extinct.html). In this manner, nature demonstrated its ability to "[nearly erase life on earth](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/729341362/the-great-dying-nearly-erased-life-on-earth-scientists-see-similarities-to-today)."
1.2.4.2.4. Con: The ability of [extremophiles](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/extremophile.html) to survive in extreme conditions does not hold any bearing over humanity's ability to survival.
1.2.5. Pro: Nature will automatically take care of population growth once the [carrying capacity](https://www.britannica.com/science/carrying-capacity) of Earth is reached.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Population growth beyond the carrying capacity threshold would result in [resource depletion](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/ecologyapp/modules/population-dynamics/)(Carrying capacity is determined by the amount of available resources \(food, habitat, water\). As the density of individuals in a population increases, these individuals must begin competing for limited resources with each other \(same species, or intra-specific competition\) or with other species \(inter-specific competition\). If the population grows indefinitely, less and less resources will be available to sustain the population.), which poses significant threats to survival.
1.2.5.2. Con: Approaching the carrying capacity of the Earth will come at a [tremendous cost](https://biologydictionary.net/carrying-capacity/) to life on the planet and threaten the existence of many animal species.
1.3. Con: Coercive population control methods enacted by governments have harmful economic and social effects.
1.3.1. Pro: Population control methods that have been implemented in the past have had a number of negative effects on society.
1.3.1.1. Con: The problems caused by population control in China can be remedied. No country needs to permanently implement population control policies.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The population control measures enacted by China were [reeled back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy#Abolition) in 2016, and again in 2021.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Not all problems caused by population control can be fixed. Due to China's one-child policy, the devastating Sichuan earthquake meant that an entire generation was "[wiped out](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/entire-generations-wiped-out-in-china/articleshow/3040890.cms)."
1.3.1.2. Pro: In China, [one-child](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-11-05/true-history-chinas-disastrous-one-child-policy) and two-child policies have led to gender-based violence and oppression.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Following the implementation of the one-child policy, violence against women, perpetrated by [young unmarried men](https://ifstudies.org/blog/chinas-one-child-policy-effects-on-the-sex-ratio-and-crime), skyrocketed in China.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: China's one-child policy, coupled with cultural and social norms, resulted in a [gender imbalance](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/chinas-onechild-policy-a-demographic-disaster/news-story/5a71127133138acec2644df76f01d9b0) as baby boys were preferred over baby girls.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Millions of Chinese [baby girls](https://www.britannica.com/story/the-effects-of-chinas-one-child-policy) were aborted, outright killed, or given up for adoption as a result of the policy.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Chinese women typically move into their [in-laws' house](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-04/22/content_12373683.htm) after marriage. Chinese parents' preference for sons - a source of income and stability for the family - commonly leads to the abandonment, mistreatment, and neglect of [female babies](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34666440).
1.3.1.2.2.3. Con: The imbalanced sex ratio in China is symptomatic of an Asian [preference for sons](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/chinas-great-gender-crisis), rather than the one-child policy itself. Both [son preference and daughter neglect](https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/UNFPA_Publication-39764.pdf) \(pp. 4-5\) are pervasive problems [in many other Asian countries](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2012/05/problem-and-solution-mismatch-son-preference-and-sex-selective-abortion-bans), such as India.
1.3.1.2.2.3.1. Con: In [many countries](https://voxeu.org/article/declining-son-preference-us), including Asian countries, [son preference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747565/) is declining.
1.3.1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: In India, many appear to be content to have [only daughters](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/acceptance-for-daughters-growing-shows-survey-161200)(Recent evidence shows that over the nearly three decades, there has been a gradual increase in the use of permanent methods of family planning among couples with only daughters.).
1.3.1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: Despite being illegal since 1961, [dowry transaction](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57677253) rates in rural villages in India have remained stable across time. This practice reinforces perceptions of girl children as [a financial liability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665272/), leading to daughter aversion and female [foeticide and infanticide](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/legally-speaking/son-preference-the-veritable-precursor-of-female-feticide/).
1.3.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: In India, female foeticide is so common that prenatal sex determination is illegal \([p. 2](https://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/snehlata.pdf)\). This practice is rooted in a preference for sons - through whom [ancestral wealth](https://www.savethechildren.in/news/is-dowry-system-in-india-still-a-reason-for-female-foeticide-and-infanticide/) was traditionally preserved within the family.
1.3.1.2.2.4. Con: An imbalanced sex ratio does not need to be an inevitable result of population control. Prior to implementation, such potentially adverse outcomes resulting from cultural factors should be identified and pre-emptively prevented.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: If a beneficial policy has harmful ramifications, then the logical course of action would be to mitigate the latter, not invalidate the need for the former.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Rapid changes to population size can exacerbate income and wealth inequality and cause economic issues \([p. 22](https://osf.io/g3yhe/download)\).
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Japan](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/02/japans-population-is-shrinking-what-does-it-mean-for-the-economy/) has an inverted population pyramid and ageing population. This causes serious economic problems, which Japan is attempting to address by implementing policies to increase birth rates.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: The Black Death in Europe improved the economic conditions of those who survived and the generations that followed.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Labor shortages caused by mass deaths during the Black Death in Europe allowed laborers to [demand better wages](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-how-the-black-death-make-the-rich-richer)(The sudden loss of at least a third of Europe’s population led to a redistribution of wealth for everyone else. \[...\] At the same time, the decline of feudalism and the rise of a wage-based economy following peasant demands for better labour conditions benefited urban elites.).
1.3.1.3.2.2. Con: In economies that have witnessed long-lasting declines in fertility rates following population expansion, [economic growth](https://blogs.imf.org/2017/08/10/aging-japan-puts-a-strain-on-the-financial-system/) could be at risk because old and dependent populations may be too large, compared to young and productive individuals.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: [China's](https://fee.org/articles/chinas-one-child-disaster/) one-child policy led to a [below-replacement](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2017/02/below-replacement-birth-rates-in-china-and-japan-colour-their-future-population-grey-1021668w) birth rate, causing an inversion in the population pyramid and economic issues.
1.3.1.4. Con: The kinds of policies that have been implemented in China are undemocratic and violate international [human rights regulations](https://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-two-child-policy-an-assault-on-human-rights/). Therefore, it is unlikely that such policies will be implemented in other countries.
1.3.1.5. Con: Failed attempts at population control should either be improved on or simply disregarded; the lessons learned should help create more successful methods in the future.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Historically, population planning methods have been gender- or minority-targeted.
1.3.1.6.1. Pro: In [Peru](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-34855804), 60,874 women were pressured or forced to be sterilised between 1996 and 2000; most of them were poor and indigenous.
1.3.1.6.2. Pro: Population control is a form of [minority control](http://thetruthwins.com/archives/30-population-control-quotes-that-show-that-the-elite-truly-believe-that-humans-are-a-plague-upon-the-earth), as majority groups are typically described as facing [population decline](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/race.world). Thus, whereas minority expansion is perceived as a threat, majority decline is perceived as a threat.
1.3.1.6.3. Pro: Australia has a history of forced sterilization targeting minorities.
1.3.1.6.3.1. Pro: The United Nations has criticised Australia for allowing the forced sterilisation of women with [disabilities](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/10/un-examines-australias-forced-sterilisation-of-women-with-disabilities).
1.3.1.6.3.2. Pro: In the past, forced sterilisation of [Aboriginal](http://english.khamenei.ir/news/3638/Australia-s-sanitized-genocide-against-Aborigines-in-the-21st#_ednref14) women and children was widespread in Australia.
1.3.1.6.3.3. Con: Sterilization of people with intellectual disabilities cannot be regarded as forced, as they cannot provide consent. As this procedure reduces their risk of [trauma](https://www.bustle.com/articles/65104-forced-sterilization-of-the-disabled-in-australia-doesnt-seem-to-be-going-anywhere)(For many parents and organizations, the sorts of medical procedures that end menstruation or take away fertility often provide for greater quality of life and dignity for disabled individuals. For those people with severe mental incapacities, the argument goes, pregnancy, childbirth and childrearing are beyond their intellectual grasp. Allowing these individuals to become pregnant \(or exposing them to the risk of it\) would only serve to traumatize rather than to provide fulfillment.) caused by pregnancy and childbirth, it is advocated by some disability activists in Australia.
1.3.1.6.3.4. Con: International [human rights agencies](https://www.bustle.com/articles/65104-forced-sterilization-of-the-disabled-in-australia-doesnt-seem-to-be-going-anywhere) and [local politicians](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-17/senate-inquiry-calls-for-court-approval-for-forced-sterilisation/4826728) have been pressurizing the Australian government to impose strict regulations on forced sterilization. Therefore, a ban may be imposed in the near future.
1.3.1.6.4. Pro: The United States has a history of forced sterilization targeting minorities.
1.3.1.6.4.1. Pro: Over the last few decades, many [Native American](https://daily.jstor.org/the-little-known-history-of-the-forced-sterilization-of-native-american-women/) women in the US have had to undergo forced sterilization without their knowledge or consent.
1.3.1.6.4.2. Pro: In some US states, [African American](http://www.msnbc.com/all/eugenic-sterilization-victims-belated-justice) women are sterilized without their informed consent, and [African American men](https://daily.jstor.org/the-lasting-fallout-of-the-tuskegee-syphilis-study/) are not provided with timely treatment for [STDs like syphilis](https://blog.scrcivf.com/stds-fertility-can-you-get-pregnant-with-a-sexually-transmitted-disease)(Unfortunately, syphilis is very easy to transmit to a baby at any stage during pregnancy \(the infection can cross the placenta\) or during childbirth. Congenital syphilis is extremely dangerous to a newborn baby, with a significant chance of fatality when untreated. Getting tested for syphilis before getting pregnant or early in the first trimester is extremely important: the symptoms are not always obvious. Fortunately, treatment with penicillin can help protect both mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and beyond. When detected and treated early, transmission rates drop to 1 or 2% from the 50% transmission rate among untreated mothers.\n\nUntreated syphilis can cause infertility in both women and men.), which can cause infertility or be transmitted to children, threatening their survival.
1.3.1.6.4.3. Con: Bias in the implementation of a procedure does not negate the value or necessity of the procedure. Analogically, Black men are [incarcerated](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/) at a significantly higher rate, yet this does not negate the need to imprison those who violate the law.
1.3.1.6.5. Con: The world has come a long way in improving the [rights of women](https://interactive.unwomen.org/multimedia/timeline/womenunite/en/index.html#/) and minorities. Thus, it is unlikely that population control methods that target one particular demographic group will be implemented.
1.3.1.6.6. Con: Imposing stricter restrictions on women can often be an indirect means to improve gender equality. For example, in India, increasing the [minimum marriageable age](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raising-age-of-marriage-for-women-will-allow-them-to-pursue-a-career-pm-modi/articleshow/88865063.cms) for women reduces their chances of being coerced into marriage to the detriment of other life pursuits.
1.3.2. Pro: Softer, indirect, and non-coercive policies have more social and political benefits.
1.3.2.1. Con: Government imposition of population control methods \(i.e., the end\) is immoral because it infringes upon the rights of citizens. Thus, how such methods are imposed \(i.e., the means\) is irrelevant.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Some consider governmental efforts to control population growth as a means by which privileged classes limit the rights of the [less-privileged classes](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15449959).
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Not all population control methods are equally \(im\)moral. [Forced sterilization](https://ijrcenter.org/forced-sterilization/), for example, is a human rights violation, whereas improved awareness and access to birth control empower citizens to independently make informed decisions.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Softer non-coercive policies will likely have higher social acceptance because they are more ethical; they do not infringe on people's freedoms.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Incentivizing family planning based on population projections and societal needs do not threaten people's basic rights, as there is no risk of negative consequences for refusing the incentive; it would, however, ensure sustainable population growth. This is a low risk-high reward proposition.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Politicians may not be willing to implement hard controls that undermine human rights out of fear of [being voted out of office.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381609990594) Therefore, softer controls would be preferred.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Human rights violations have not cost [autocratic leaders](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/12/the-autocrats-are-winning/620526/) elections, as demonstrated by the rise of [right-wing populist](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/rise-far-right-populism-threatens-global-democracy-security/) leaders worldwide. Imposing hard controls is, therefore, unlikely to adversely affect their election outcomes.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Coercive methods could trigger [major backlash](https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/summer-2008-saving-the-world/how-did-population-control-movement-go-so-terribly-wrong/) or revolt; in extreme cases, they can lead to civil unrest, which is detrimental to societal functioning.
1.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: Coercion is a blunt substitute for progressive policies; governments have learned better techniques, such as "[nudge](https://theprint.in/india/governance/after-swachh-bharat-success-modi-nudges-india-on-population-control-plastic-ban-tourism/277562/)," which have proven to be [cheap and effective](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180220-the-nation-that-thrived-by-nudging-its-population).
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Improving policies that are otherwise unrelated to population size can have serendipitous second-order effects on population growth.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: Public policy cannot be framed based on serendipitous outcomes; instead, [good public policy](https://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/blog/posts/what-is-good-public-policy.htm) clearly outlines clear, achievable, and measurable goals that address a specific problem.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Pro: Governments can implement immigration restrictions to control the [inflow of people](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2015/09/28/chapter-2-immigrations-impact-on-past-and-future-u-s-population-change/) and ensure that population growth is sustainable.
1.3.2.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.2.1.
1.3.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Over the past three decades, the number of immigrants and refugees in the US has [significantly increased](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/children-immigrant-families), and the number of children with an immigrant mother or father has doubled.
1.3.2.2.3.2.3. Pro: The government of Australia is well known for their [immigration policies](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9697/97rp17)(In a number of recent discussions of population policy, the figure of 23 million has emerged as a 'natural' levelling off point for Australia's population, given the projected slowing of natural increase and maintenance of a modest immigration program \(net migration of 50 000 per year\). More recent ABS projections suggest that 25 million is a more likely levelling off point, if fertility rates remain unchanged. Further discussion of the implications of such an ultimate population would be useful, provided it is recognised that no figure is sacrosanct.); they accept an average of 50,000 immigrants to naturalize as citizens every year in order to ensure that population growth is sustainable.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4. Con: Immigration control would not reduce the global population size or composition, as individuals are merely changing where they live.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: Even at the country level, immigration appears to be [unrelated to fertility](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2020/03/can-immigration-solve-the-demographic-dilemma-peri.htm), as low-fertility countries witness low immigration rates, and high-fertility countries witness high immigration rates.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4.2. Con: Immigrating from a poorer country to a [wealthier one](https://voxeu.org/article/moving-poor-economy-rich-one-role-migrant-job-tasks) will likely reduce the amount of children individuals have as the [costs of living](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/cost_of_living_wb/) are higher.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4.3. Con: Immigration control can significantly improve [economic development](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report), thereby allaying concerns about limited resources and incentivizing parenthood to couples who choose to have fewer children due to financial concerns.
1.3.2.2.3.3. Pro: In underdeveloped countries, [improved healthcare](https://populationmatters.org/solutions) access lowers death rates and paradoxically reduces population growth because women have more children to increase the likelihood that at least one child will survive to adulthood.
1.3.2.2.4. Con: The UK adopted a [policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claiming-benefits-for-2-or-more-children) to limit state financial support for bigger families; following public backlash, the government backtracked their decision. This shows that policies infringing on reproductive rights are unlikely to be well-received.
1.3.2.2.5. Con: The reproductive choices of individual citizens affect the well-being of current and future generations of citizens. The government should intervene to prevent the exercise of individual choices that are harmful to others.
1.3.2.2.5.1. Pro: To reduce the incidence of starvation and homelessness, governments in countries affected by these problems should impose restrictions on how many children a couple can have as a valid, if not ideal, approach.
1.3.2.3. Con: The sooner population control measures are implemented, the lighter and less intrusive they can be. Once overpopulation begins to pose significant threats, more drastic solutions will become necessary.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Coercive economic [incentives](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/31/italys-populist-government-plans-reward-fertile-families-state/) prove [ineffective](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/31/italys-populist-government-plans-reward-fertile-families-state/) in raising the fertility rate again when needed.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Evolution favors genetic traits conducive to reproduction rather than those related to unsustainable consumption. Therefore, it would be easier to change consumption habits than to convince people to stop reproducing.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: Human behavior is not always aligned with evolutionary principles. The increase in the number of [childfree](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/25/why-a-generation-is-choosing-to-be-child-free), [gay](https://abcnews.go.com/US/americans-identify-lgbt-poll/story?id=76097305), and [infertile](https://www.singlecare.com/blog/news/infertility-statistics/) people defies the notion that reproduction is not the end game for human evolution.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Restricting the number of children a person can have is a [human rights violation](https://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-two-child-policy-an-assault-on-human-rights/), whereas efforts to reduce consumption and increase recycling is consistent with [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) \(e.g., Goal 12\). Therefore, the latter is likely to elicit lesser public resistance than the former.
1.3.2.5.3. Pro: Consumerism is a modern phenomenon that did not exist for a vast majority of human history. Hunter gatherers had few belongings, as they had to carry them along as they moved from [place to place](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hunter-gatherer)(Conditions of such abundance are rare, and most foraging groups must move whenever the local supply of food begins to be exhausted. In these cases possessions are limited to what can be carried from one camp to another. As housing must also be transported or made on the spot, it is usually simple, comprising huts, tents, or lean-tos made of plant materials or the skins of animals.).
1.3.2.5.4. Pro: Regulating consumption, such as by imposing higher taxes, does not pose significant threats to human rights; thus, they are more likely to be effective than efforts to regulate reproduction.
1.3.2.6. Con: Measures such as public campaigns, paid childcare, and subsidies or tax breaks, that are meant to [encourage](https://www.mercatornet.com/demography/view/what-can-governments-do-to-increase-birthrates/16578) or discourage births only have an [indirect effect](http://mentalfloss.com/article/33485/6-creative-ways-countries-have-tried-their-birth-rates) and cannot completely guarantee results.
1.3.2.6.1. Pro: Forced sterilisation and single-child policies are examples of direct measures of population control that can be enforced to tangibly reduce births.
1.3.2.6.2. Con: Evidence-based policymaking, as the name suggests, relies on the scientific literature to formulate policies \([p. iii](https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/3683.pdf)\). Given the abundant literature on the differential effects of different population control strategies, evidence-based policies will yield the desired results \([p. 15](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2015_highlights.pdf)\).
1.3.3. Pro: Negative socioeconomic outcomes may be more pronounced in countries below [replacement rates](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Population_replacement_rate).
1.3.3.1. Pro: Reducing the population size would strain social programs that primarily serve older adults and those unable to provide for themselves, such as social security programs. With fewer children per generation, the working tax base is smaller for social programs that provide for an aging population.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: The demographic shift toward [an ageing society](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/03/graying-america.html)(This demographic transformation caused by a rapidly aging population is new for the United States but not for other countries. Japan has the world’s oldest population, where more than one in four people are at least 65 years old. Already, its population has started to decline and, by 2050, it is projected to shrink by 20 million people.\n\nEurope is headed down the same demographic path. Some countries in Western Europe have populations that are older than the U.S., notably Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Countries in Eastern Europe are even further along and, within a few years, many of their populations are projected to begin shrinking.) is already straining resources in the US and other developed countries.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: A significant reduction in taxes used to fund welfare is likely to occur only if the population of a country shrinks too quickly. A gradual decline would allow governments to implement alternative corrective strategies \(e.g., more relaxed immigration laws or baby benefits\).
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.2.
1.3.3.2. Con: Population control methods would need to be applied only in countries with a fertility rate higher than the replacement level.
1.3.3.3. Pro: In post-industrial societies [like Germany](http://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/germany-population.jpg), the population is projected to decline significantly in the coming decades. Further [reducing birth rates](https://www.dw.com/en/demography-german-birthrate-down-in-coronavirus-pandemic/a-54395345) will compound this imminent threat to economic development in countries with low fertility rates.
1.3.4. Con: Since having children is an economic choice \([Table 1, p. 26](https://aifs.gov.au/sites/default/files/rp%285%29.pdf)\), countries should remove subsidies and tax benefits directed at increasing the population.
1.3.4.1. Con: Having children is not always a choice.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Removing government incentives like subsidies and tax benefits may promote a more thoughtful [cost-benefit analysis](https://offbeathome.com/analyzing-the-costs-and-benefits-of-having-a-kid/) of having children. In this way, economic measures would reinforce the notion that childbearing is a choice.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Religious people do not think of having children as their choice.
1.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Traditional interpretations of [Bible verses](https://www.christianbiblereference.org/faq_birthcontrol.htm) relating to birth control have concluded that contraception use is un-Christian.
1.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Traditional scholars believe that God punished Onan for [spilling his seed](https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-9.htm). In reality, however, Onan was punished because his [deceitful motives](https://carm.org/bible-difficulties/why-did-god-kill-a-man-for-spilling-his-seed-on-the-ground/)(In that culture, when a man died and left no children, the next of kin was sometimes obligated to “go in to” the wife of his brother and produce children. This is significant because they believed that a man’s seed was what produced children and that a woman’s womb was the place the seed grew. \[...\] Onan knew this and refused to furthering the honor and name of the brother’s wife and thereby also risking provision for her in the future. To this, God was very displeased and took Onan’s life.) for sleeping with Tamar were wicked in the eyes of God and antithetical to [his plans](https://taylormarshall.com/2017/11/god-really-kill-onan-spilling-seed-something-else.html)(Onan’s sin was especially grave because he was the eldest surviving son of the patriarch Judah. As such he is designated ancestor for the line of the Messiah of Israel.).
1.3.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Early prohibitory interpretations of Bible verses relating to birth control were justified [extrabiblically](https://theconversation.com/how-the-catholic-church-came-to-oppose-birth-control-95694). Indeed, the Old Testament contains many stories of men and women using varied birth control methods for [sex for pleasure](https://www.salon.com/2014/01/05/biblical_birth_control_the_surprisingly_contraception_friendly_old_testament/), with no negative implications or ramifications.
1.3.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: The [Old Testament](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm) forbids any man without reproductive organs from entering the assembly of God. This demonstrates that God looks down upon men who lack reproductive capabilities.
1.3.4.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Deuteronomy 23:1](https://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html) has been interpreted as God forbidding vasectomies, which has, in turn, been codified in Jewish law.
1.3.4.1.2.1.3.2. Con: [Deuteronomy 23:1](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/deuteronomy-23/) renounces [eunuchs](https://www.britannica.com/topic/eunuch), not men who have had vasectomies as a form of birth control.
1.3.4.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Old Testament verses condemning eunuchs were [negated by Jesus](https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm)(For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.).
1.3.4.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Later books in the Bible \(e.g., [Isaiah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+56%3A3-5&version=ESV)\) testify to God demonstrating compassion toward eunuchs. Thus, Biblical laws about the acceptability of castration and, by extension, birth control are time-bound.
1.3.4.1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: [Leviticus 22:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2022-24&version=NIV) forbids the sacrifice of castrated animals. This demonstrates that it is not merely the reproductive implications of castration for human beings but also that castration itself is abominable in the eyes of God.
1.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: In the Bible, [fertility](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2023%3A25-26&version=NIV) is a [blessing from God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20127%3A3-5&version=NIV), whereas [infertility and childlessness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020&version=NIV) are described as a curse or punishment. As such, Biblicists are likely to interpret advocacy for not having children as antithetical to a Christian way of life.
1.3.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: One of the first commands that God gave to Adam and Eve after he had created them was to "[be fruitful and multiply](https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-7.htm)." Thus, to have many children is not only a blessing from God but also a religious obligation to Christians.
1.3.4.1.2.2.2. Con: Jesus and most of [his disciples](https://thebibleanswer.org/twelve-disciples-have-children/) did not have any children. Therefore, it would not be unchristian to be childfree.
1.3.4.1.2.3. Con: In practice, religiosity and contraceptive use are not incompatible. Instead, it is [normative](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2011/contraceptive-use-norm-among-religious-women) among religious women.
1.3.4.1.2.4. Con: Religious beliefs may often be reflective of the [moral visions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/contraception_1.shtml) of early religious leaders rather than the scriptures. As such, educating religious people about such misinterpretations could improve birth control among such populations.
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Procreation is often [instinctual](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/bringing-baby/201911/weve-been-designed-reproduce) and unplanned, rather than a deliberate economic choice. Not everyone is likely to consider tax benefits or penalties for having excess children prior to having unprotected sex.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: The ["maternal instinct" is a myth](https://medium.com/\@jenniferneal_39017/the-maternal-instinct-is-a-myth-and-weve-got-the-science-to-prove-it-de435786adbf). There is, however, a maternal drive that emerges once motherhood has started.
1.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: Women experience [higher sex drives](https://www.verywellfamily.com/in-the-mood-you-may-be-ovulating-1960259) during ovulation, and men find women more attractive during their [ovulation window](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/biology/men-really-are-more-attracted-to-women-at-a-certain-time-of-the-month-scientists-found/articleshow/53014387.cms). The fact that such biological drives motivate sexual behavior shows that reproduction is more instinctual than deliberate.
1.3.4.1.3.3. Pro: In the US, every other pregnancy is [unplanned](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/unintendedpregnancy/index.htm).
1.3.4.1.3.4. Con: In Japan – a country with a declining population due to very low birth rates, people cite the high cost of having children as one of the main [reasons](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/japan-mystery-low-birth-rate/534291/) for not having them.
1.3.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.1.
1.3.4.1.3.4.2. Con: Japanese people may self-report economic reasons because they are more socially acceptable, but [other factors](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33362387) such as an increase in the use of isolating technology, sexual disinterest, and mental health problems are also likely contributors.
1.3.4.2. Con: Most economies develop alongside population growth \([p. 1](http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brief7-the-relationships-between-economic-growth-and-population-growth.pdf)\).
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Increased spending](https://www.thebalance.com/consumer-spending-definition-and-determinants-3305917) promotes economic growth and stability. Having children increases spending, both by parents and their children. In this regard, providing tax benefits to parents would be effective in stimulating the economy.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Once an economy is established, fertility rates tend to drop. This decline in population growth offers an opportunity for per capita GDP to increase \([p. 10](https://hrmars.com/papers_submitted/8747/population-and-economic-growth-in-developing-countries.pdf)\).
1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: As per some economic models, a one-percent decline in population growth can lead to a nearly 7% increase in GDP per capita growth in some countries \([p. 11](https://hrmars.com/papers_submitted/8747/population-and-economic-growth-in-developing-countries.pdf)\).
1.3.4.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.2.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Many countries offer [child tax credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_tax_credit) to parents. Even if these credits cannot be eliminated, they could be restructured such that having more children yields diminishing tax credit returns.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Some countries offer a [baby bonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_bonus), wherein the government provides a specified amount of money per child to his or her parents.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: [Child benefits](https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/child-benefits-iceland) in Iceland are paid from birth until the child reaches 18 years of age, with the intent of helping the Icelandic population continue to grow without the need to worry about the high cost of raising a child.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: The baby bonus is typically provided only in countries where the birthrate falls below [the replacement rate](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51118616); the objective is to increase population size by providing monetary incentives to have children.
1.3.4.4.3. Con: Controls aimed at punishing parents for excess children will ultimately affect \(innocent\) children.
1.3.4.4.3.1. Pro: Hard restrictions or penalties for having many children may cause parents to abandon their children once they are born.
1.3.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Population control methods can be limited to those that focus on those who are yet to have children \(e.g., education, birth control\) rather than those who have already become parents \(e.g., tax penalties\).
1.3.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: Children abandoned by parents who fear punishment for violating population control mandates would likely be [raised in orphanages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633702/); this has a negative impact on child [psychological functioning](https://www.hopeandhomes.org/blog-article/orphanages-threaten-mental-health/).
1.3.4.4.3.2. Con: Population controls are imposed to protect the next generation \(i.e., innocent children\) from the harmful ramifications of unsustainable population growth.
1.3.4.4.4. Con: [Despite their efforts](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/study-german-efforts-to-increase-birthrate-a-failure-a-873635.html) to incentivize childbearing and parenthood, the German birthrate has remained steady between 1.4-1.5 children per family.
1.3.5. Con: Population control methods would likely reduce the number of unwanted children born, resulting in greater social stability in the future.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The most effective form of reducing population growth is [eliminating unintended births](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/46/16610.short).
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: By removing undesired pregnancies from the scenario, approximately two or three billion fewer people would [inhabit](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/46/16610.full)(Avoiding the approximate 16% of annual births resulting from unintended pregnancies \(Scenario 5\) reduced the projected population in 2050 to 8.39 billion \(compared to, for example, 9.30 billion in Scenario 2a; Δ = 901 million\), and in 2100 to 7.3 billion \(compared to, for example, 10.4 billion in Scenario 2a; Δ = 3014 million\) \(Fig. 1A\).) the planet at the end of the century.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: Strongly religious people such as Christian fundamentalists believe that [no pregnancy is unintended](https://www.lifemattersww.org/Need-Help/Questions-about-abortion/Does-God-care-about-your-unplanned-pregnancy) or accidental; in societies strongly influenced by such beliefs, instituting policies to eliminate unintended pregnancies would be next to impossible.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: In the US, not only are [unintended pregnancies](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1506575#t=articleResults) more prevalent among lower-income and less-educated women, but also the percentage of those pregnancies resulting in birth is higher.
1.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.3.1.
1.3.6. Con: Severe forms of overpopulation have negative ancillary effects on the planet.
1.3.6.1. Pro: [Overfishing](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/overfishing-could-push-european-fish-species-extinction) or [overhunting](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-overhunting.php) of species leads to their extinction, which affects biodiversity.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.2.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: While overhunting can be harmful to the environment, regulated hunting [can be beneficial](http://archive-srel.uga.edu/outreach/ecoviews/ecoview031117.htm), because consuming wild game utilizes fewer resources than [animal farming](https://travelexperta.com/hunting-good-environment/).
1.3.6.1.3. Con: [Endangered animals](https://novascotia.ca/natr/wildlife/conserva/controlled-hunting.asp) are typically protected from being hunted by humans. Therefore, biodiversity loss cannot be attributed to hunting.
1.3.6.1.3.1. Con: Hunting can lead to some species becoming [endangered or nearly extinct](https://www.huntercourse.com/blog/2011/08/10-animals-hunted-or-nearly-hunted-to-extinction/.).
1.3.6.2. Con: By virtue of existing, humans have [ancillary effects](https://onlinedegrees.kent.edu/geography/geographic-information-science/community/human-impact-on-the-environment) on the planet.
1.3.6.3. Pro: The amount of garbage produced by the global population has been overwhelming local processing facilities.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: A significant portion of the garbage produced by humans has [ended up in the oceans](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/marine-debris/), with larger patches cutting off light and oxygen supplies for aquatic animals.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: The excess of trash produced by developed nations has traditionally been [shipped off](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trash-trade-wars-southeast-asias-problem-worlds-waste) to developing nations.
1.3.6.3.3. Con: Waste management is a [highly lucrative](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/how-the-garbage-industry-outperformed-the-market.html) enterprise. Greater awareness of the high [returns on investment](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-waste-profitable-thing-mind) in such businesses can increase the number of processing facilities while also improving sustainable waste management.
1.3.6.4. Pro: The Earth is running out of suitable land to accommodate the needs of a growing global population.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: [Deforestation](https://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html) to clear more land for human needs leads to a [loss of habitat](https://greentumble.com/how-does-deforestation-affect-animals/) for animals.
1.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.1.1.
1.3.6.4.1.2. Con: Deforestation rates have [significantly declined](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/07/1068761) in recent years; stricter enforcement of [effective policies](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/press-release/government-policies-responsible-for-half-of-the-reduction-in-deforestation-in-the-brazilian-amazon/) is likely to further reduce the scale of deforestation.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: Canada, the world's second largest country, is [running out of room](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-second-largest-country-in-the-world-running-out-of-land-2444658) to house people due to a growing population.
1.3.6.4.3. Con: The Earth isn't running out of land, cities just [aren't densely populated enough](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/06/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-city-that-has-run-out-of-room/) to accommodate everyone. City-dwellers need to adjust to living in smaller quarters with more neighbors.
1.3.6.5. Con: Economic analyses and projections of population trends suggest that [environmental impacts](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/12/16766872/overpopulation-exaggerated-concern-climate-change-world-population)(Fertility declines may offset themselves even when couples have zero children. An American couple that forgoes a child might take an extra vacation, say, a road trip across Peru — burning extra fossil fuel for airfares and extra driving. The couple’s plane ticket alone to Peru would produce between 3 and 7 metric-ton equivalents of CO2. Add in the couple’s double consumption of housing \(their home is vacant while they travel\), their increase in driving \(it’s a road trip\), their increase in eating and other consumption \(it’s vacation, after all\), and that single vacation has about the same carbon impact as a baby in its first year \(some 10 tons of carbon, let’s estimate\).\n\nBecause of this higher-intensity consumption by childless couples, while lower fertility could reduce long-run emissions, it probably has no net impact on short-run emissions — or even increases them.) are not attributable to population size; in fact, a decline in fertility is associated with worse environmental impacts.
1.3.7. Pro: The government cannot consistently provide social goods of high quality in an equitable manner if population size changes too rapidly.
1.3.7.1. Con: Not all governments aim to "provide social goods of high quality in an equitable manner." Therefore, the challenges uncontrolled population growth poses to such a hypothetical goal does not justify the need for population control.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Governments are ranked on various performance indices. While some are effective in promoting [citizen welfare](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-best-governments-in-the-world.html), many are [corrupt and exploitative](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/24/these-are-the-worlds-most-corrupt-countries.html).
1.3.7.1.2. Con: Democratic nations have an obligation to improve the lives of their citizens. For example, the [Preamble of the US Constitution](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/us) posits that the promotion of peace, justice, welfare, and liberty is a fundamental objective of the government.
1.3.7.2. Pro: When the population size is large, government funds must be divided among a large number of people. This can significantly reduce the funds available to each citizen.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: Large populations may necessitate larger governing bodies and more complex hierarchical structures to make governance more manageable. This can cause coordination problems, further [complicating or delaying](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/does-being-large-country-lead-higher-corruption)(conomies of scale in governance imply that larger countries have more efficient bureaucracies, better implementation of laws, more effective rule of law, and better institutional quality, all of which should serve to constrain corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. This suggests that corruption should be lower in relatively large countries. However, if administrative costs escalate with country size, reversing economies of scale, the quality of governance may be poorer and corruption could be greater. Further, as suggested in the broader literature, greater diversity in the larger countries implies that such countries may find it harder to reach a consensus on growth-enhancing anti-corruption reforms. \[...\] The study finds that corruption is indeed higher in relatively larger countries. \[...\] Amin and Soh \(2019\) confirm both of these theories, providing credence to the causal impact of larger country size on corruption via the diseconomies of scale route.) the provision of governments benefits to citizens.
1.3.7.2.2. Con: Since governments [generate their revenue](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/how-the-government-makes-money/)(The primary way that the United States government makes money is through taxation. In Section 8 of the first article of the Constitution, the U.S. Congress is afforded the right to assign and collect taxes. There are several sources of tax revenue.) from taxes paid by the public, a large population size will not pose problems to budget allocation; only an increase in the proportion of beneficiaries would be problematic.
1.3.7.2.3. Con: In most cases, governments do not directly provide financial support but offer services such as national defense, a legal system, and law enforcement. These services can be provided for any number of people, even with minimal taxation.
1.3.7.2.3.1. Pro: A large population would imply that a larger proportion of the population can participate in the provision of crucial government services \(e.g., military, police\) to the public, thereby making the country more impervious to internal and external threats.
1.3.7.2.3.2. Con: Regardless of the purpose of the government, a large population will lower the amount of funds that is available to be spent on each citizen.
1.4. Con: Governments do not have the right to impose direct or hard controls on its population's birth rate.
1.4.1. Pro: People should be free to have as many children as they want.
1.4.1.1. Pro: People have a [natural right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) to have children. Therefore, population control [goes against](https://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article/the-morality-of-population-control) the rights of individuals to reproduce.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The 1968 [Proclamation of Tehran](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/SRHRL/PDF/IHRDArticle15/Proclamation_of_Teheran_Eng.pdf)(p. 3) states that "parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children."
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Due to excess population growth and resource consumption over the past 50 years \([p. 2](https://na.unep.net/geas/archive/pdfs/geas_jun_12_carrying_capacity.pdf)\), the level up to which human life is sustainable \(i.e., [carrying capacity](https://qz.com/1347735/how-many-people-can-earth-support-its-carrying-capacity-isnt-infinite/)\) has been breached. Therefore, the resolution needs to be updated accordingly.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The carrying capacity of the Earth has [increased](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/human-population-growth/) due to technological [advancements](https://people.wou.edu/~courtna/ch371/lecture/popgrowth/carrying.htm)(For a given region, carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals of a given species that an area's resources can sustain indefinitely without significantly depleting or degrading those resources. Determining the carrying capacities for most organisms is fairly straightforward. For humans carrying capacity is much more complicated. \[...\] The carrying capacity may be lowered by resource destruction and degradation during an overshoot period or extended through technological and social changes. \[...\] Increased food production due to improved agricultural practices, control of many diseases by modern medicine and the use of energy to make historically uninhabitable areas of Earth inhabitable are examples of things which can extend carrying capacity.), such as improved food production.
1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The UN adopted the Proclamation of Tehran, in which is enshrined reproductive rights, but these unrestricted rights are antithetical to the UN's [sustainable development goals](https://populationmatters.org/news/2019/09/world-and-un-must-reduce-population-growth).
1.4.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The focus should be on finding sustainable ways for people to live, while still maintaining their freedom to procreate, not reformulating basic human rights every few decades.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The word "responsibly" is a subjective caveat that allows the state to intervene and restrict how "freely" people can determine their family size and composition.
1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: All laws are [written subjectively](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45153.html) and open to the interpretation of the courts.
1.4.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.2.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Individual liberties that result in the mass extinction of other species should be curtailed.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.2.1.
1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.4.1.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: All humans have an equal right to have as many children as they please because all human beings are entitled to bodily autonomy.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Since a person's body is their property, imposing restrictions on what they can do with it is a violation of property rights.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: A person's body is [not considered their property](https://www.encyclopedia.com/politics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/property-rights-and-human-body)(With respect to one's own body, the common law, which has been the primary source of property rights, has provided a set of protections that have the effect of granting certain property rights in one's own body, though the law never speaks of these rights as property.) by the letter of the law.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: A number of US states have [loosened restrictions](https://www.encyclopedia.com/politics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/property-rights-and-human-body)(Several states have enacted laws permitting coroners to remove body parts \(typically corneas\) from a cadaver without the consent of either the deceased or the next of kin.) regarding the removal of body parts and organs from a deceased person without the permission of next of kin.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Laws that do not recognize the human body as property are relics of archaic notions undergirded by [religious beliefs](https://trinitycollegelawreview.org/why-should-the-law-recognise-human-bodies-as-property/)(Lord Judge CJ explained in Yearworth v North Bristol NHS Trust that part of the reason why the body was not treated as property in times past was due to it being the temple of the Holy Ghost, and as such it was sacred and inviolate.), and they pose challenges to use of the human body, for instance, in medical research. Recognition would resolve such issues.
1.4.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Sex work, surrogacy, consensual use of human tissue for medical research, and possible theft of human body parts are all evidence of the [implicit fact](https://www.encyclopedia.com/politics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/property-rights-and-human-body)(Tort law protects us from nonconsensual physical contact and physical invasions. If A punches B in the nose, A is liable for battery. A doctor who fails to get the informed consent of a patient before performing surgery commits a battery. This doctrine implies that the law gives us the right to possess our own bodies and to exclude others from using our bodies. Tort law also prohibits others from unreasonably confining us, through the tort of false imprisonment; giving us the right to direct our own bodies as we see fit. However, the common law has not articulated a clear general position on our rights to profit from our bodies or to dispose of our bodies.) that human beings have [self-ownership](https://lawexplores.com/property-rights-in-the-body/) over their bodies.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Equal reproductive rights apply only when all members of a society contribute equally to its functioning. In a welfare state, contributors are more valuable than beneficiaries, who depend on the former group for their own welfare and the welfare of their children.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Historically, people have had as many children as they wanted; in the [pre-modern era](https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate), women had between four and seven kids on average.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: In the pre-modern era, having a large number of children was necessary in order to have more hands to help on the farm and guarantee that some of the children would [survive to adulthood](https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/demographic-facts-sheets/faq/why-were-families-larger-in-the-past/)(In the past, women had five or six children on average, though many babies died soon after birth or in their infancy. For example, in the eighteenth century in France, half of all children died before age ten, and only one-third reached adulthood. Parents had lots of children to ensure that at least some of them survived. Today, child mortality is much lower and in many countries the death of a child is a rare event. Children are practically certain to grow up, so parents no longer need to raise large families. Parents also choose to have smaller families because they want to give their children every opportunity for a better life. This means providing education, land, capital etc. But parents’ assets are limited, and when they are shared between many children, the amount each one receives is small. Hence the preference for a smaller number of children, each better equipped to make a good start in life.).
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Religiosity is [positively associated](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/news/religious-people-have-more-children) with fertility; this is unsurprising because having children is considered a "[Christian duty](https://www.wholereason.com/2011/03/the-christian-duty-to-bear-children.html)." Since societies were [more religious](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-08-11/religion-giving-god) in earlier times, having many children was the norm.
1.4.1.3. Con: Certain segments of society with an unusually large number of children can have a disproportionate level of influence relative to families with fewer children. This discrepancy can have an impact on the demographic and political makeup of a given area in the future.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Fear that certain segments of society \(e.g., Muslim immigrants\) will have "too many" children and disproportionately change the demographics of a society is [unfounded and rooted in prejudice](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/11/muslim-overpopulation-myth/545318/).
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Family is the single most important factor in determining political affiliations and participation; the influence of larger families can disproportionately change the political structure in a given community \([p. 108](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1254813.pdf)\).
1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.4.1.
1.4.1.5. Con: The freedom to procreate entails a responsibility to care for one's children; thus, people have a moral obligation not to have more children than they can reasonably care and provide for. This principle is simultaneously applied on an individual, familial, and global level.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Child neglect is one of the most common forms of child abuse, and it is a [punishable offense](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/child-neglect-when-is-it-a-crime-50439) in many countries. As such, it would be prudent for parents to not have more children than they can care for.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: That freedom entails responsibility is a moral principle; however, from a legal point of view, citizens in democratic countries \(e.g., [India](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-force-couples-to-have-only-two-children-centre-to-supreme-court/story-sfkoVwb8xyt0w50dvHuISK.html)\) have the right to have as many children as they want, regardless of whether they are able to provide for them.
1.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: Signatories to the [Programme of Action](https://www.unfpa.org/events/international-conference-population-and-development-icpd) of the International Conference on Population and Development are obligated to not impose [coercive population control](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-force-couples-to-have-only-two-children-centre-to-supreme-court/story-sfkoVwb8xyt0w50dvHuISK.html) methods on their citizens.
1.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: Governments [intervene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK195993/) only when children are neglected or at risk, but they do not have the power to decide family size prior to birth.
1.4.1.5.2.3. Con: In democracies, legal points of view are subject to revision based on popular opinion and votes. Therefore, a democracy could, in theory, restrict the [number of children](https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/right-to-as-many-kids-as-wanted/) that citizens are allowed to have.
1.4.2. Pro: Many people do not want to have children, but their [access to birth control](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2015/01/access-to-contraception) is severely restricted. Eliminating these barriers would be a non-coercive and effective way to slow down population growth.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Because of paternalistic attitudes, it is very difficult for women who wish to remain childfree to find gynecologists who would perform [tubal ligation](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/getting-your-tubes-tied-why-do-young-women-have-a-hard-time-getting-sterilized.html)(After consulting a number of doctors who tried to dissuade her for what she describes as “paternalistic” reasons, Trombley finally became so exasperated that she actually considered inventing dangerous and unavoidable family members in order to convince a doctor that she could not live in an environment fit for children.) without intrusive interrogation.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Anecdotal evidence suggests that women are told that their husbands must consent to [tubal ligation](https://www.insider.com/a-woman-needed-husbands-consent-to-get-her-tubes-tied-2020-2) before the procedure can be performed on them.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Single women are often denied a tubal ligation on the grounds that their [hypothetical future husband](https://www.marieclaire.com/health-fitness/a15937/tubes-tied-young/) might want to have a child with them.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: A [national survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005997/) of US obstetrician-gynecologist physicians found that a vast majority would discourage a woman from getting her tubes tied if her husband disagreed.
1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: [Spousal consent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12257282/) for sterilization is a legal requirement in many countries. In such instances, the physicians are merely complying with the law.
1.4.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Spousal consent requirements for voluntary sterilization are [not gender-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_human_sterilization_by_country), yet they are imposed primarily on women, not men.
1.4.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Sterilization deprives one's spouse of the opportunity to have children. In this regard, gender-neutral spousal consent ensures that both partners are equally included in family planning decisions.
1.4.2.1.1.4. Con: Demanding spousal consent for voluntary sterilization is not only [unconstitutional](https://medium.com/fearless-she-wrote/is-spousal-consent-for-sterilization-still-a-thing-ca595f0704b7) but also runs counter to the [medical ethic](https://4w.pub/in-2020-women-still-need-their-husbands-permission-to-get-sterilized/) of respecting bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. Therefore, such demands would not be entertained in a court of law.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: In comparison to women, it is very easy for men to find a surgeon who will [perform a vasectomy](https://www.insider.com/a-woman-needed-husbands-consent-to-get-her-tubes-tied-2020-2)(A woman named Erin Thompson told Vice in 2019 that it took her two years to get her tubes tied. To qualify, she needed to get cleared by a psychologist and write a two-page paper defending her choices. It took her husband a week to get a vasectomy.), irrespective of their wife's consent.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: Vasectomies are simpler, safer, and cheaper. Therefore, from a medical perspective, doctors may be obligated to encourage the man rather than the woman in a monogamous partnered relationship to [undergo sterilization](https://www.vasectomy.org.au/faqs/vasectomy-vs-tubal-ligation/).
1.4.2.1.4. Con: What is often perceived as intrusive interrogation or a condescending lecture is merely [counseling or debriefing](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/getting-your-tubes-tied-why-do-young-women-have-a-hard-time-getting-sterilized.html)(The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that doctors provide in-depth and “individualized” counseling of patients seeking sterilization \(including a thorough discussion of permanence and other available options\). So what some patients take as a condescending lecture or arm-twisting might actually be an OB following professional guidelines.) that physicians are required to provide.
1.4.2.2. Con: Condom-distribution [programs and policies](https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/06/study-teen-birth-rates-rose-in-schools-that-gave-out-free-condoms-with-no-instruction.html) are not unequivocally effective in reducing childbirths. By some estimates, they increase [teen pregnancies](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/condoms-teens-pregnancy/489626/), if provided without accompanying instruction and counselling.
1.4.2.3. Pro: The population could be reduced to manageable levels through government subsidies on [RISUG](https://newatlas.com/risug-male-contraception/18824/) \(reversible vasectomy\) operations and IUDs, allowing adults to affordably and temporarily opt-out of parenthood.
1.4.2.4. Con: Governments and supranational institutions are unable to distribute birth control tools to [222 million women](http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/26/why-222-million-women-cant-get-the-birth-control-they-need/) worldwide.
1.4.3. Con: Just because governments do not have the right to impose population control does not mean that they should not have this right.
1.4.3.1. Con: Government-imposed population control methods are authoritarian in nature and contrary to the concept of individual liberty.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: In general, laws are authoritarian in nature, and most people are willing to comply for the greater good.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Laws that protect the rights of an individual from an aggressor aren’t authoritarian, but laws that dictate how citizens should live by establishing a conception of “greater good” are often [authoritarian](https://www.salon.com/2015/10/30/the_twisted_authoritarian_logic_of_population_control_why_the_end_of_chinas_one_child_policy_isnt_nearly_enough/).
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments imposed restrictions on [individual liberty](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/human-rights-dimensions-covid-19-response)(Citing concerns with “the alarming levels of spread and severity,” the WHO called for governments to take urgent and aggressive action to stop the spread of the virus. \[...\] Human rights law also recognizes that in the context of serious public health threats and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation, restrictions on some rights can be justified when they have a legal basis, are strictly necessary, based on scientific evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, subject to review, and proportionate to achieve the objective.\n\nThe scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly rises to the level of a public health threat that could justify restrictions on certain rights, such as those that result from the imposition of quarantine or isolation limiting freedom of movement.) \(e.g., lockdowns, mask mandates\). This proves that governments have the right to restrict bodily autonomy when public welfare is at stake.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: That governments imposed restrictions does not imply that their actions were justified. In many ways, pandemic restrictions infringed upon various [human rights](https://humanrights.gov.au/about/covid19-and-human-rights/what-human-rights-are-particular-risk-being-restricted-during-pandemic) including the right to movement and association.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: People have the [right to refuse medical procedures](https://educaloi.qc.ca/en/capsules/consent-to-medical-care-and-the-right-to-refuse-care/), yet vaccine certificates are [mandatory in many spaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html). This proves that all rights are contextual and can be limited or revoked based on circumstantial needs.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Hard controls like forced sterilization and abortion are so inhumane that they are regarded as [crimes against humanity](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/crimes-against-humanity.shtml) and [human rights violations](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/dprk-report.aspx), respectively.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Methods such as forced sterilizations and abortions are typically not employed to control population growth but to specifically wipe out certain groups of people, such as [religious](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-weekend-reads-china-health-269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c) and [ethnic minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/dprk-report.aspx).
1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Forced sterilization has a deleterious impact on the mental health of victims, and it exacerbates the challenges faced by vulnerable populations such as [persons with AIDS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887903/) and [disabilities](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/10/sterilization-women-and-girls-disabilities).
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: Imposing methods of population control is a [slippery slope](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Slippery-Slope.html), and can lead to more oppressive ways of controlling the population.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: The notion that population control would lead to oppressive methods exemplifies the [slippery slope fallacy](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Slippery-Slope.html). There is no evidence to suggest that humane population control \(e.g., education\) will lead to the enforcement of more oppressive methods \(e.g., forced sterilization\).
1.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: In order to enforce population control measures, the government would have to prosecute and punish women for reproducing, which is a [fundamental human right](https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/shalev.htm).
1.4.3.1.3.3. Con: Failure to exercise any form of population control can lead to equally oppressive outcomes caused by a [scarcity](https://www.activesustainability.com/sustainable-development/causes-consequences-overpopulation/)(Overpopulation is one of the biggest challenges humanity is facing and threatens the near future of the planet in economic, environmental and social terms.) of resources \(e.g., natural resources\) and opportunities \(e.g., unemployment\).
1.4.3.1.3.4. Pro: To control population growth, governments would need to entertain ethically questionable [eugenic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1129063/) principles.
1.4.3.2. Pro: In democratic nations, [public policies](https://sur.conectas.org/en/public-policies-human-rights-perspective/) are formulated for the betterment of society; therefore, if a decline in global population will solve major issues facing humanity, governments should have the right to impose population control.
1.4.3.3. Pro: In democratic countries, people [freely elect](https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/representative-democracy/43508) their political representatives. Therefore, elected governments are empowered to impose what they believe will be in the best interest of their country.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: Many countries [do not have the option](https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-that-arent-free-report-2019-5) of electing their officials.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: In the US, political affiliation is strongly defined in terms of support for reproductive rights. The popular vote is, therefore, an implicit endorsement of the presidential candidate's position on the issue of [reproductive rights](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/14/how-support-abortion-overlaps-with-votes/)(Comparing support for abortion in PRRI’s poll to 2016 results, we see \(as we would expect\) that there’s a strong correlation between the two. States that more robustly support abortion voted more heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Those that are less supportive of abortion voted more heavily for President Trump.).
1.4.3.3.3. Con: Voter suppression occurs in many parts of the world; this is particularly targeted toward communities under-represented in the political infrastructure, such as [women, young people](https://now.org/resource/voter-suppression-targets-women-youth-and-communities-of-color-issue-advisory-part-one/)(Republicans have a vested interest in suppressing the women’s vote – at least the single women’s vote. In the last two presidential elections, President Obama won with high margins among unmarried women. If Republicans successfully suppress the number of single women who vote, they will not have to be concerned about political consequences for their regressive and anti-woman legislative proposals.), and [racial minorities](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/voting-rights-around-the-world/)(Although internationally known for its democratic ideals, the US continues to struggle with equality when it comes to the right to vote. Black Americans, Native Americans, and other historically marginalized groups continue to face voter suppression despite decades of activism and many steps forward.).
1.4.4. Con: Governments already hold a significant amount of power over population control, so imposing coercive population control methods would not be anomalous.
1.4.4.1. Pro: In some cases, the government has forced the creation of life by [preventing young women](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-abortion-heartbeat-bill-pregnant-11-year-old-rape-victim-barred-abortion-after-new-ohio-abortion-bill-2019-05-13/) from having an abortion.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Many pro-life states in the US use anti-abortion legislation to force victims of rape and incest to [carry their babies to term](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/texas-abortion-law-rape-abbott-b1915879.html).
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: In Argentina, the [government forced](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9033887/Rape-victim-12-gives-birth-twins-Argentina-denied-abortion.html) a 12-year-old rape victim to give birth to twins.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: In the US, [anti-abortion legislation](https://msmagazine.com/2021/10/12/pro-choice-religion-abortion-catholic/) has less to do with the government and more to do with [religious fundamentalism](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/us-abortion-rights-evangelical-campaign). As a result, separation between religion and the state will improve reproductive rights for women.
1.4.4.2. Pro: By enacting laws on birth control and abortions and formulating policies relating to social security and education, governments control population size.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Sex education, a soft method, is generally a reliable and powerful form of slowing population growth.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Sex education is a necessary but insufficient means to slow population growth around the world. For education to take effect, complementary laws, sociocultural norms, and healthcare practices are necessary.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: Comprehensive sex education reduces [teen pregnancies](https://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/study-finds-comprehensive-sex-education-reduces-teen-pregnancy).
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Within Europe, countries where [sex education is mandatory](https://amsterdam-mamas.nl/articles/sex-education-netherlands) have the lowest [teenage pregnancy rates](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2013/462515/IPOL-FEMM_NT\(2013\)462515_EN.pdf)(p. 10).
1.4.4.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.4.
1.4.4.2.1.3. Con: [Abstinence and outercourse](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/abstinence-and-outercourse/what-are-benefits-and-disadvantages-abstinence-and-outercourse) are the safest and most effective ways to prevent individual pregnancies.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Voluntary abstinence](https://www.o.school/article/millennials-voluntary-abstinence) is [popular](https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-millennials-abstaining-from-sex-is-bad-20160803-story.html) among millennials, and their birth rate is correspondingly [low](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/31/17413356/low-birthrate-millennials-economy).
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Abstinence among younger cohorts has been conceptualized as an act of rebellion against [sex norms](https://www.o.school/article/millennials-voluntary-abstinence)(But now that the sex-positivity movement has firmly embedded itself in the cultural zeitgeist, social pressure towards abstinence is less pronounced than it once was. In fact, many young people instead feel pressure to have lots of super-satisfying sex with lots of people. \n\nIronically, rebelling against this new cultural paradigm by abstaining could feel like the ultimate expression of self-confidence and individuality. Millennials and Gen Z’ers are rebelling against the status quo as young people have always done, but this time, the status quo is the cultural expectation that you must be dating and having sex to be a functioning adult. ‍) established by older generations.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Many millennials are choosing to not have children because of external threats such as [climate change](http://www.femestella.com/climate-change-millennials-gen-z-dont-want-kids-antinatalism/), the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://morningconsult.com/2020/09/28/millennials-economy-children-poll/), and the [economy](https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/how-the-21st-century-economy-convinced-millennial-women-that-having-kids-isnt-worth-it/articleshow/83987713.cms). Thus, their decision cannot be described as "voluntary."
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.3. Con: The prevalence of [mental health problems](https://www.businessinsider.in/slideshows/miscellaneous/lonely-burned-out-and-depressed-the-state-of-millennials-mental-health-in-2019/slidelist/71521961.cms#slideid=71521982) among millennials is significant. Given that mental health problems like depression can [lower sex drive](https://www.healthline.com/health/treating-hsdd/low-libido-and-depression#What-does-the-research-say?-), their decision to abstain cannot be said to be voluntary.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Empirical](https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/when-an-ssri-medication-impacts-your-sex-life) and [anecdotal evidence](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvqbmv/we-asked-millenials-why-young-people-are-having-less-sex) collected from millennials suggests that psychotropic medication prescribed to alleviate mental health problems can lower sex drive.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.3.2. Con: Not all mental health problems lower sex drive; for example, [ADHD](https://www.hollandhospital.org/healthylife/healthy-life-blogs/are_more_millennials_living_with_adhd_176) is linked to [hypersexuality](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-sexual-problems) and is quite common among millennials.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: [Excessive media use](https://fightthenewdrug.org/bad-sex-for-millennials/) and ease of [access to pornography](https://mashable.com/article/paying-for-porn-millennials) from childhood have empowered millennials to be [solosexual](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a20682275/masturbation-sex-toy-survey-tenga/) and not have to develop the [social skills](https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/weve-raised-generation-hopeless-millennials-who-lack-basic-life-and-workplace-skills-and-its-a-big-issue/news-story/f3256c05c19c356002103eb50e50cee1)(A survey of American millennials by One Poll found 65 per cent don’t feel comfortable engaging with someone face-to-face, and 80 per cent prefer conversing digitally.\n\nAs a result of this they’re less likely to understand how they’re perceived by others in real life.\n\nThey struggle to strike up a conversation and can’t navigate tricky problems like workplace conflict.) required to build romantic and sexual relationships.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.5. Con: Among both [men](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/western-men-have-had-a-50-or-more-decline-in-sperm-count-over-four-decades-2017-07-31) and [women](https://laivfclinic.com/blog/low-egg-reserve-is-more-common-in-millennials-why/), fertility has been declining at an alarming rate. As such, the low birth rate may be a consequence of an increase in infertility issues.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1.6. Pro: In Japan, celibacy rates are at an [all-time high](https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/lets-talk-about-no-sex-a-closer-look-at-japans-virginity-crisis/).
1.4.4.2.1.3.2. Con: Abstinence and outercourse prevent pregnancies only among those who do not want to become pregnant, not among those who wish to become parents - the primary targets of coercive population control methods.
1.4.4.2.1.3.3. Con: Abstinence-only education and programs are ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.
1.4.4.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: Abstinence-only sex education programs are associated with [higher teen pregnancy rates](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/abstinence-sex-education-us-teen-pregnancy-rates-states-a8763051.html), particularly in conservative regions.
1.4.4.2.1.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.4.2.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: In the US, where abstinence-only education has been well-funded and is quite common, teenage pregnancy rates are [significantly higher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/)(Table 1) than in other developed countries.
1.4.4.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: [Blame-celibacy theorists](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2002/03/priests-pedophilia-and-celibacy.html) posit that high rates of child sexual abuse committed by Catholic priests are partially attributable to their vow of [mandatory sexual abstinence](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/catholic-sexual-abuse-partly-caused-by-celibacy-and-secrecy-report-finds).
1.4.4.2.1.3.3.3. Con: Abstinence-only education is typically provided to school children, a majority of whose ages are below the [age of consent](https://www.unicef.org/lac/media/2806/file) \(p. 2\). Therefore, regardless of its ineffectiveness, abstinence-only education is the only kind of sex education that is compatible with laws governing consent.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: In the US, abortion laws can change depending on which party is [voted into power](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59340789). Leaving population control to the legislature and policymakers would, therefore, not be prudent.
1.4.4.3. Con: Governments holding a significant amount of power over population control should motivate efforts to reduce, not increase, their influence over reproductive choices.
1.4.4.4. Con: Governments that hold power over population control typically do so without violating basic human rights \(e.g., awareness and education\). This would not be the case with more coercive methods \(e.g., [compulsory sterilization](https://blog.ipleaders.in/population-control-india-violation-fundamental-rights-necessary-step/)\).
1.4.4.5. Pro: The government has the authority to end life, ergo they would also have the authority to prevent life.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: In many countries, the government has the right to sentence a person convicted of [serious crimes to death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45835584).
1.4.4.5.2. Con: Governments are empowered to end life for the express purpose of [protecting others](https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v1n3/capital.html) \(e.g., death penalty\). Preventing the creation of life does not fulfill this criterion.
1.4.4.5.2.1. Pro: Death penalty and population control are diametrically opposed in relation to their implications for freedom: whereas the elimination of threats to human society enhances freedom, population control infringes upon this freedom.
1.4.4.5.2.2. Con: Population control can be justified as a means to protect others if an unsustainable population size threatens human survival and well-being.
1.5. Pro: Families are better when they are smaller.
1.5.1. Con: Larger families offer a greater likelihood that children will be able to care for parents as they age \([p. 68](http://www.nasajournal.com.ng/journal_articles/vol_12/issue_1/paper_4.pdf)\).
1.5.2. Con: [Growing up without siblings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237053/)(Compared to adults who grew up with siblings, adults who grew up without siblings have significantly less frequent social activities with relatives, and the difference is greater among those who did not live with both biological parents growing up. This pattern suggests that only children who grew up in single parent homes have noticeably less contact with relatives than do similar children with siblings. \[...\] We also find that at younger adult ages growing up without siblings affects the frequency of engaging in certain social events – less time spent with friends, more time spent at church/synagogue, literary/art or professional/academic events - but these differences decrease with age. The pattern with friends does suggest that adults without siblings may be less sociable and engage in fewer social activities with friends.) can have negative social consequences during youth and adulthood.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Being an only child means that [all parental expectations](https://www.susannewmanphd.com/blog/2007/06/02/great-expectations-may-be-too-great-for-only-children/)(As I point out in Parenting an Only Child, only children expend great amounts of effort and energy to satisfy their parents. Onlies can be very hard on themselves and rarely need additional pressure from their parents.) - which may otherwise be distributed across many children - are placed on one single child.
1.5.2.2. Con: Only child syndrome is a product of bad science that has not stood the test of empirical scrutiny. The hypothesis is the remnants of an [unfounded theory](https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/only-child-syndrome#origins) proposed by a psychologist who supposedly believed that "being an only child was a 'disease in itself.'”
1.5.2.3. Con: The negative impact of not having any siblings is offset by other benefits. Specifically, only children are [less interpersonally efficient but more creative](https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/family/only-child-creativity-behaviour-social-skill-5550261/)(A recent study showed how only children are more creative. The environment a child grows up in can impact his or her brain cells, the study suggests. Conducted by researchers at Southwest University in China in 2016, the study investigated the differences in cognition and personality between only-children and non-only children. While there was no difference in intelligence, only children exhibited secured higher flexibility scores, which measures how well a person can think outside the box. \[...\] Only children, however, got lower agreeable scores, a measure of sociability, empathy and connection, as compared to non-only children, as per the study.) than their counterparts with siblings.
1.5.2.4. Pro: A study conducted among Chinese college students found that mental health problems such as [depression and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313008/) were more prevalent among only children than among those with siblings.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Adult only-children have significantly [less frequent interaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237053/) with relatives as adults.
1.5.2.6. Con: Only-children are exposed to more adult conversations and may receive more [parental attention](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3900289/).
1.5.2.6.1. Pro: Only children, particularly daughters, share [closer relationships with their parents](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.608995/full) than their counterparts with siblings.
1.5.2.6.2. Con: In China, the one-child policy reduced the number of children per family, resulting in excessive attention and spending power dedicated to the only-child - a problem known as the "[little emperor syndrome](https://www.livescience.com/26166-china-one-child-policy-changes-personalities.html)."
1.5.2.6.2.1. Con: As the name suggests, "little emperor syndrome" is a syndrome. Like other psychological conditions, this can be prevented or managed through the adoption of [effective parenting strategies](https://youaremom.com/children/little-emperor-syndrome-kids/).
1.5.2.6.2.2. Pro: Despite receiving excess attention and love from their parents, little emperors experience a strong [sense of loneliness](https://www.npr.org/2010/11/23/131539839/china-s-little-emperors-lucky-yet-lonely-in-life), in addition to other serious [physical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6457487/) and [mental health problems](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/articles/200807/plight-the-little-emperors).
1.5.2.7. Pro: Having a sibling increases the chances for [interpersonal closeness and social development](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.638088/full), which are conducive to good mental health.
1.5.2.8. Con: Only-children are not automatically socially disadvantaged. Parental and social support can [compensate for the advantages](https://www.parentmap.com/article/parenting-an-only-child) enjoyed by their counterparts with siblings.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.4.2.
1.5.4. Con: The preference for small families by a part of the population does not justify governmental intervention to encourage this behavior.
1.5.5. Con: Families with children have a higher rate of [life satisfaction](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Life_satisfaction,_by_household_type,_EU-28,_2013.png) than without.
1.5.5.1. Con: The variable "with children" does not operate in an ideological vacuum. The [psychosocial ramifications](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-act-be/201909/6-myths-about-people-who-dont-have-kids) of being childless or childfree, for example, may account for why families without children report lower life satisfaction.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: People feel [morally outraged](https://www.livescience.com/58094-child-free-parents-moral-outrage.html) by individuals who choose to not have children and consider their lives to be unfulfilling. Recurrent exposure to such hostility may cause child-free people to internalize such standards for a satisfying life.
1.5.5.2. Con: The empirical literature on the relationship between parenthood and life satisfaction is mixed; nonetheless, there is enough evidence to suggest that [childfree couples](https://www.today.com/health/child-free-adults-are-happy-parents-study-finds-today-t223858) are as, if not more, satisfied than their [counterparts with children](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/06/health/parents-happiness-child-free-studies/index.html).
1.5.5.3. Con: Comparisons of families with and without children are meaningless unless they are stratified by whether the underlying cause is involuntary childlessness or a voluntary childfree lifestyle.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.3.1.2.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: Parenthood is associated with better well-being only if it is [voluntarily chosen](https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-does-having-kids-make-you-happy-20140114-story.html).
1.5.5.4. Pro: Prior research on the happiness penalty caused by parenthood may be attributable to external factors such as unsupportive government policies. Once these factors are controlled for, the relationship between [parenthood and happiness](https://www.deseret.com/2019/7/14/8936333/was-earlier-research-wrong-are-we-happier-having-kids-than-not-having-them) turns positive.
1.5.5.5. Pro: A [vast majority of parents](https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/1424-national-parent-survey-overview-and-key-insights) consider parenting to be "their greatest joy" and believe that "their life started when they became a parent."
1.5.5.6. Con: This may change in the future with generational differences in culture, as younger generations make the conscious decision to be [child-free](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/12/06/no-kidding-childfree-movement)(r/childfree is one of the fastest growing communities on Reddit and it's for people who do NOT want children. They don't want to be told why they should have them, how much they'll regret it if they don't, and how "selfish" they are for not "contributing to society." This choice is becoming more common, yet it's still questioned ferociously.).
1.5.5.7. Con: The relationship between having kids and life satisfaction may only be true in first-world countries like [Europe](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/families-with-three-or-more-children-are-the-happiest-report-reveals-10294043.html), where families are economically able to support more children. For those struggling economically, having many kids can be challenging.
1.5.6. Pro: Having fewer children allows parents to invest in their children's education because limited education budgets would have to be distributed among fewer children.
1.5.6.1. Pro: On average, children from larger families have lower IQs and fewer educational and professional achievements [compared](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3900289/) to children from smaller families.
1.5.6.2. Con: Investment in education is not as important as investment in the psychosocial development of a child, because relationships - not education - has been found to be the [strongest contributor to happiness](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/this-harvard-study-reveals-how-you-can-be-happier-and-more-successful.html).
1.5.6.2.1. Pro: Parental hyper-involvement in education can increase academic pressure, which is associated with negative parent-child relationships \([p. 1173](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1305839.pdf)\).
1.5.6.2.2. Con: Membership to a large family is not a prerequisite for good [social and familial relationships](https://populationmatters.org/choosing-small-family) and, consequently, happiness. Small families can be as, if not more, happy as large families.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Better educational achievement is a significant predictor of [employability](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2012/09/17/education-is-the-key-to-better-jobs/). Thus, children from smaller families would have an edge over their counterparts from larger families.
1.5.7. Pro: A small family size is bidirectionally associated with gender equality.
1.5.7.1. Con: In some societies, large families that include many children are the norm \([p. 4](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/family/Publications/mtdesilva.pdf)\); imposing population control mechanisms would threaten the traditional family structure in such countries.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: The need to preserve the traditional family structure over alternative models is founded upon moral dogmatism \([p. 153](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2o0bHscWTFAC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=moral+dogma+traditional+family+structure&source=bl&ots=4Tl7fmWX0z&sig=ACfU3U2UXht1-mMRxv0oEqfT1da8i_WHsQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0zsWolMj2AhVqxzgGHTETDsUQ6AF6BAgzEAM#v=onepage&q=moral%20dogma%20traditional%20family%20structure&f=false)\), not reason or empirical evidence supporting its advantages.
1.5.7.1.2. Con: The traditional family structure has already been fundamentally altered by the emergence of [alternative family models](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/), such as single-parent, same-sex, and child-free households. Thus, population control methods pose no unique or novel threats to such structures.
1.5.7.1.3. Pro: In [developing nations](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262884/countries-with-the-highest-fertility-rates/), parents often have more children to [compensate](https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/demographic-facts-sheets/faq/why-were-families-larger-in-the-past/) for the higher rate of [infant mortality](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/family-planning-can-reduce-high-infant-mortality-levels).
1.5.7.1.4. Pro: Cultural and religious factors may disallow people from having small families. Notably, the [Hindu joint family system](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54053091) continues to be the norm in Indian society.
1.5.7.1.4.1. Pro: Despite predictions that urbanization and modernization will change the Indian family makeup, [household size](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54053091) has remained pretty much the same across time.
1.5.7.1.4.2. Pro: In the eyes of the law, a [Hindu Undivided Family](https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-hindu-undivided-family) - which includes all male members and their direct relatives - is one unit.
1.5.7.1.4.3. Con: The joint family system is inherently [punishing for women](https://feminisminindia.com/2017/01/10/marital-inequality-traditions-subjugating-women/), as it requires her to leave her family and live with her husband, in-laws, and other relatives under one roof.
1.5.7.1.4.3.1. Pro: The [joint family setup](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/great-indian-family-doesn-t-help-working-women-1550524334031.html) reduces [women's employment rates](https://aninjusticemag.com/analyzing-the-impact-of-living-in-joint-families-on-female-labor-force-participation-f0c512c4788), particularly in northern states in India.
1.5.7.1.4.3.2. Pro: In one survey, more than [one-third of the participating](https://www.hindustantimes.com/sex-and-relationships/do-you-know-why-women-ask-potential-partners-if-they-stay-in-a-joint-family-read-on/story-1T2ypbPdPjFCOU1Zm0fspO.html) women stated that they would ask a potential partner about their willingness to move out and live in a nuclear family. This shows Indian women's increasing resistance to live in a joint family.
1.5.7.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Anecdotal reports suggest that even mentioning the term nuclear family can evoke strong reactions from others and render a woman to be perceived as [an unsuitable match](https://feminisminindia.com/2017/01/10/marital-inequality-traditions-subjugating-women/).
1.5.7.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The Indian government has instituted affordable housing schemes that require women to be [co-owners](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/women-must-be-co-owners-in-govts-affordable-houses/articleshow/47777995.cms). Since these [houses are small](https://housing.com/news/ews-housing/), these schemes incentivize nuclear families, thereby promoting social and financial autonomy among women.
1.5.7.1.4.3.3. Pro: Refusing to move into one's husband's home has been established as legitimate [grounds for divorce](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/india-divorce-man-cruelty-western-thought-in-laws)(Justice Anil R Dave, one of the the most senior judges in India, said the wife’s desire to leave her in-laws’ home was inspired by “western thought” and violated traditional values of Indian Hindus.\n\n“In normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family of the husband after the marriage,” stated the supreme court ruling, which also dismissed the wife’s attempt to kill herself as a plot to “torture” her husband and his relatives.) by the Supreme Court of India.
1.5.7.1.4.3.4. Pro: In-laws are [known to pressurize](https://www.familyeducation.com/pregnancy/ovulation-conception/when-laws-pressure-you-have-child) their child and spouse to give them grandchildren. Living under the same roof as one's in-laws greatly increases exposure to such pressures.
1.5.7.1.4.3.5. Con: In general, Indian women are choosing to [remain single and childfree](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3109603/single-choice-indias-women-reject-marriage-their) in the millions. Thus, it is likely that they perceive the Indian notion of marriage and family \(rather than living in a joint family\) to be punishing.
1.5.7.1.4.3.6. Con: Joint families can be punishing, but they do not have to be; instead, supportive joint families could provide women with greater [financial security and assistance](https://aninjusticemag.com/analyzing-the-impact-of-living-in-joint-families-on-female-labor-force-participation-f0c512c4788)(One may argue that living in a joint family setup enables females to have access to pooled income and time which should facilitate their transition from households to employment in economic activities. Greater income and resource pool enables them to acquire better skills and increase their chances of employability. Mother-in-law, sister-in-law, aunts and other members of the family also extend a helping hand towards household chores and child rearing. Infact, for many career women, it is the joint family setup that aids them in managing full-time jobs. But, this also has chances of increasing male dominance and thereby reducing autonomy of females in decision making \(Dhanraj \(2019\)\). It is true that living together enables people to share household responsibilities, but, often working females are viewed from the lens of status symbol \(Eswaran, Ramaswami and Wadhwa \(2013\)\).) with household work and childcare, thereby enabling their labor participation.
1.5.7.1.4.4. Con: While a joint family is, by definition, larger than a nuclear family, the size of a joint family has no implications for population control. Specifically, a joint family is large because it [aggregates several small families](https://www.britannica.com/topic/joint-family)(\[Joint family is a\] family in which members of a unilineal descent group \(a group in which descent through either the female or the male line is emphasized\) live together with their spouses and offspring in one homestead and under the authority of one of the members. \[...\] Thus, a patrilineal joint family might consist of an older man and his wife, his sons and unmarried daughters, his sons’ wives and children, and so forth.), not because it has a higher number of children.
1.5.7.1.5. Con: There is no clear timeline based on which one can differentiate between a traditional and modern family model. The most traditional family model - the caveman model - likely looked very different from what is currently regarded as a traditional family.
1.5.7.1.5.1. Con: Cavemen and cavewomen were [excellent parents](https://psmag.com/environment/neanderthal-cavemen-parenting-78907), whose parenting style complemented the [natural developmental needs](https://www.dnaindia.com/health/report-cavemen-were-better-parents-than-us-study-1442453) of children. Adopting such a parenting style would, therefore, prove beneficial to [modern parents](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/it-time-return-caveman-parenting-flna1c9475826).
1.5.7.1.5.2. Pro: Cavemen and cavewomen were [sexually promiscuous](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/how-to-make-love-like-a-caveman/) and [polyamorous](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/may/19/equality-and-polyamory-why-early-humans-werent-the-flintstones). The notion that a traditional family includes a monogamous male and female member is, therefore, a product of modern civilization.
1.5.7.1.6. Pro: Families in poor countries and rural areas in the developed world often rely on their [offspring](http://nfwm.org/education-center/farm-worker-issues/children-in-the-fields/) to perform agricultural tasks. Small families are disadvantageous.
1.5.7.1.6.1. Pro: Farmers tend to have [large families](https://www.thekinnardhomestead.com/2020/12/05/why-farmers-often-have-large-families/)(The truth of the matter is, in many ways, larger families are easier to manage than smaller families, especially smaller families that still have young children, because of the help older siblings provide in larger families, not just keeping an eye on the younger children but in all aspects of family life.\n\nWhether it’s mowing the yard, taking out the trash, or building that shed, a capable young man helping dad \(or a few capable brothers tag teaming to help dad\) makes all the difference. Or having a capable young woman helping mom \(or a few capable sisters tag teaming to help mom\) prepare dinner, dusting the shelves, or lending a hand at the grocery store, again, makes all the difference.) and perceive large families as ideal; notably, they consider small families to be more difficult to manage, as there are fewer hands on the metaphorical domestic deck.
1.5.7.1.6.2. Con: Making a child engage in field work to support his or her family is inhumane and a violation of [international child labor guidelines](https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/lang--en/index.htm).
1.5.7.1.6.2.1. Pro: If we placed a heavier emphasis on implementing existing technology, farmers would have machines to perform agricultural tasks and children could attend school.
1.5.7.1.6.2.1.1. Con: Excessive reliance on agricultural machinery can lead to [soil compaction](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110505083737.htm), which adversely affects crop yield and productivity.
1.5.7.1.6.2.1.2. Con: Farmers are often able to fix and repair their low-tech farming machines and equipment. Increased uptake of [high-tech alternatives](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/new-high-tech-farm-equipment-nightmare-farmers/) would coerce them to rely on large manufacturing companies for fixes and repairs.
1.5.7.1.6.2.1.3. Pro: Technology adoption would increase the [safety](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/health-and-safety-risks-agriculture/402/), efficiency, and [productivity](https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/agriculture/how-new-technologies-can-raise-farm-productivity.html) of agricultural workers.
1.5.7.1.6.2.2. Con: Field work would be construed as child labor only when its demands strain the [developmental needs and capabilities](https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/lang--en/index.htm)(Participation in some agricultural activities is not always child labour. Age- appropriate tasks that are of lower risk and do not interfere with a child’s schooling and leisure time can be a normal part of growing up in a rural environment. Especially in the context of family farming, small-scale fisheries and livestock husbandry, some participation of children in non-hazardous activities can be positive as it contributes to the inter-generational transfer of technical and social skills and children’s food security. Improved self-confidence, self-esteem and work skills are attributes often detected in young people engaged in some aspects of farm work. Therefore it is important to distinguish between light duties that do no harm to the child and child labour, which is work that interferes with compulsory schooling and damages health and personal development, based on hours and conditions of work, child’s age, activities performed and hazards involved.) of a child. Field work that do not meet these criteria would not qualify as child labor, as per international guidelines.
1.5.7.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Urban children performing age-appropriate chores and errands is not considered child labor; likewise, rural children participating in age-appropriate field activities should not be considered child labor.
1.5.7.1.6.2.2.2. Con: In most cases, children are forced to engage in field work because of [poverty](https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/lang--en/index.htm). Under such circumstances, survival and sustenance may take priority over the developmental capabilities of the child.
1.5.7.1.6.2.3. Pro: Agricultural work is [extremely dangerous](https://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/lang--en/index.htm) and involves exposure to several occupational hazards. In this regard, making a child engage in field work can be construed as [child endangerment](https://www.mirandarightslawfirm.com/blog/what-are-the-possible-charges-for-child-endangerment/).
1.5.7.1.7. Con: Population control is not just about lowering the birth rate. It also involves reducing efforts to keep [people alive for too long](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/pricey-technology-keeping-people-alive-dont-want-live/), especially when it is [against their will](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/15/euthanasia-and-assisted-dying-rates-are-soaring-but-where-are-they-legal).
1.5.7.2. Con: Gender equality is not antithetical to a low fertility rate; instead it can be associated with either [high or low fertility](https://www.niussp.org/gender-issues/gender-equality-and-fertility-is-there-a-connection/)(While very low gender equality is usually associated with high fertility \(likely because in such societies women are largely confined to the private sphere, i.e., they are primarily housewives and mothers\), high gender equality may come in several different shapes, and the associated fertility may be low or \(relatively\) high.) depending on other contextual factors.
1.5.7.3. Pro: [Educated girls](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/30/education-girls-child-marriage-developing-world) have smaller families overall and their first child later in life.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: The link between female education and fertility appears to vary with time. Between the [1990s and 2011](https://voxeu.org/article/highly-educated-women-no-longer-have-fewer-kids), women with more than 16 years of education exhibited a higher fertility rate than those with only 13-16 years of education.
1.5.7.3.1.1. Con: Although female education and fertility may not always share a strictly inverse relationship, women with the [lowest levels of education](https://voxeu.org/article/highly-educated-women-no-longer-have-fewer-kids) still have the highest fertility rates.
1.5.7.3.1.2. Pro: Education increases the likelihood of employment, which makes [paid childcare](https://voxeu.org/article/highly-educated-women-no-longer-have-fewer-kids) more affordable. This can make the prospect of having many children more appealing to educated women.
1.5.7.3.2. Pro: Education and income are inversely related to the number of children women have \([p. 2](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/228/pdfs/female-education-and-its-impact-on-fertility.pdf)(Educated women generally have fewer children than uneducated women. This negative relationship is strong and varies across both developed and developing countries \(measured by GDP per capita\) and among women of different education levels. This is not surprising, since countries differ in their various institutional aspects, including education quality. Further, different education levels can generate different kinds of incentives. For example, better-\neducated women tend to have better jobs and earn higher incomes, thus the forgone earnings\nfrom taking care of children would be higher for these women. Thus, women with primary education tend to have 0–30% fewer children than uneducated women \(ratio of total fertility rate of 1 to 0.7\).)\).
1.5.7.3.3. Pro: Improving female education is [strongly and causally correlated](http://blogs.worldbank.org/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data) with reduced fertility rates. Policies that promote [education among women](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/30/education-girls-child-marriage-developing-world) would, therefore, slow population growth.
1.5.7.3.4. Pro: Access to education increases professional prospects, thereby increasing the [opportunity cost](https://qz.com/work/1492191/the-opportunity-cost-of-raising-my-own-children-was-losing-my-career/) of raising a family.
1.5.7.3.5. Con: For the most part, soft measures like education also entail some level of coercion. For instance, the comprehensive education of all girls and women may require government imposition rather than organic enrollment.
1.5.7.4. Pro: A small family size allows women to participate in the workforce and increase household income.
1.5.7.4.1. Con: Family size is largely irrelevant to women's participation in the workforce, as it is the [birth of the first child](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2018/10/22/women-most-likely-leave-labor-force-after-first-child-not-later-births) marking one's transition into motherhood that causes women to quit.
1.5.7.4.2. Pro: A desire for [a large family](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2018/10/22/women-most-likely-leave-labor-force-after-first-child-not-later-births) appears to hamper women's ability to stay in the workforce; specifically, women who will go on to have many children are most at risk for leaving the workforce.
1.5.7.4.3. Con: Men are increasingly participating in [childcare and household tasks](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-men-are-doing-more-housework-than-ever-hs56pfs5v). Thus, it is possible for the modern woman to have a large family and a successful career at the same time.
1.6. Pro: Population control is necessary to guide selection pressures.
1.6.1. Con: Income is [inversely related](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/december/link-fertility-income)(The decreasing relationship between the two variables demonstrates the connection between fertility choices and economic considerations. In general, poor countries tend to have higher levels of fertility than rich countries.\n\nIn particular, women tend to give birth to no fewer than three children in countries where GDP per capita is below $1,000 per year. In countries where GDP per capita is above $10,000 per year, women tend to give birth to no more than two children.\n\nThis decreasing relationship between fertility and income is well known to economists and demographers alike. In addition, it holds true over time: Rich countries, such as the U.S., have experienced a remarkable decline in their fertility rate as they became rich. Also, the relationship holds at the individual level, as rich families tend to have fewer children than poor families.) to fertility, as demonstrated by the fact that wealthier nations have [lower birth rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/). Therefore, optimizing market forces to increase income would render coercive population control unnecessary.
1.6.1.1. Con: Economic and income growth can be unpredictable and slow. It is possible that optimizing market forces would take too long to make a difference to problems caused by overpopulation, such as climate change.
1.6.2. Pro: Governments sentence those convicted of heinous crimes to [life imprisonment](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/why-judges-hand-multiple-life-sentences.html) or [death](https://www.ijlmh.com/paper/death-penalty-as-a-punishment-for-heinous-crimes/). Both of these strategies can be construed as indirect means to eliminate traits \(e.g., [psychopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4059069/)\) that are harmful to human society.
1.6.2.1. Con: Death sentences could be used by unscrupulous governments to [disproportionately reduce](https://apnews.com/article/united-states-lifestyle-race-and-ethnicity-discrimination-racial-injustice-ded1f517a0fd64bf1d55c448a06acccc)(Black people have been overrepresented on death rows across the United States and killers of Black people are less likely to face the death penalty than people who kill white people, a new report found. \[...\] The report found that throughout the modern era, people of color have been overrepresented on death row — in 2019, 52% of the death row inmates were Black, but that number has dropped to 42% this year, when approximately 60% of the population is white. But it also showed that the killers of white people were more likely than the killers of Black people to face the death penalty, and cases with white victims were more likely to be investigated.\n\nSince the death penalty resumed in 1977, 295 Black defendants were executed for killing a white victim, but only 21 white defendants were executed for the killing of a Black victim even though Black people are disproportionately the victims of crime.) certain ethnicities from their population by claiming that they pose a threat to society.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Even when capital punishment is not an option, life imprisonment effectively ensures that the convict has limited opportunity to reproduce by restricting [mating opportunities](https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-is-the-state-of-conjugal-rights-for-indian-inmates-5038969/)(Conjugal visits is a modern-day concept adopted by countries like Canada, Germany, Russia, Spain, Belgium, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Denmark and, to some extent, the US. Brazil and Israel even allow same-sex conjugal visits.).
1.6.3. Con: Governments already guide selection pressures through their social and economic policies. The same political processes that have led to the current state of affairs are unlikely to lead to better outcomes if the state is empowered to control reproduction more directly.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Government welfare schemes weaken the selection pressure that favors wealthier high-IQ individuals over low-IQ welfare dependents by making childbirth more affordable and beneficial to the latter group.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: In the US, the average IQ of welfare recipients is [about 90](https://pumpkinperson.com/2016/02/11/the-incredible-correlation-between-iq-income/), whereas the average IQ of the general population is [around 100](https://www.healthline.com/health/average-iq).
1.6.3.1.2. Con: Poor low-IQ individuals in developing countries have [high fertility rates](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman), even though such countries are typically not [welfare states](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/07/30/does-the-developing-world-need-a-welfare-state-to-eliminate-poverty-some-insights-from-history/). This demonstrates that withholding welfare would not reduce fertility.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Con: Fertility rates are elevated in every country [as it develops](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/humsos/Econ/Documents/seminars/abstracts/November%2024-2016.pdf)(Section 3.3); over time, those rates fall to sustainable levels.
1.6.3.1.2.2. Con: Reducing subsidies may not affect the number of children born, but it would certainly reduce population size as many children are likely to starve to death or die from other preventable causes, due to inadequate access to resources.
1.6.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Human beings have a [right to health](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health). A state that withholds subsidies from poor parents to allow their children to die of diseases or starvation as a means to reduce population size is one that is morally bankrupt.
1.6.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Around [10,000 children](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/losing-25000-hunger-every-day) die of starvation every day.
1.6.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: Every [five seconds](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/child-under-15-dies-every-five-seconds-around-world-un-report), a child dies of a preventable cause. A vast proportion of childhood mortalities occur in low-to-middle-income countries.
1.6.3.1.2.2.4. Pro: In low-to-middle-income countries, children from poor families have poor access to [life-saving vaccines](https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-015-0154-2), which have significant implications for child survival.
1.6.3.1.2.2.5. Con: The population of the African continent is expected to [double by 2050](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050); despite lacking sufficient resources by Western standards, there are still [enough resources](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/11/europe-africa-overpopulated-global-population) to keep children alive, well above the population replacement rate.
1.6.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.3.
1.6.3.1.3. Pro: IQ is a strong [correlate and predictor](https://pumpkinperson.com/2016/02/11/the-incredible-correlation-between-iq-income/) of income, [accounting for up to 25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Income) of the variance in income among US citizens.
1.6.3.1.3.1. Pro: Intelligence is a robust predictor of [academic performance](https://www.psypost.org/2021/12/intelligence-is-a-stronger-predictor-of-academic-performance-than-self-control-study-finds-62260) in school, which plays a significant role in admission to reputed colleges and universities, which in turn increases the likelihood of landing a [well-paying job](https://blog.prepscholar.com/does-sat-predict-your-college-success-and-future-income).
1.6.3.1.3.2. Con: The relationship between IQ and income may be an exaggerated measurement artefact, as other analyses have found that non-cognitive factors such as inherited wealth, race, and schooling are more important determinants of income than IQ \([p. 22](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533002760278686)(America may still be the land of opportunity by some measures, but parental income and wealth are strong predictors of the likely economic status of the next generation.)\).
1.6.3.1.3.3. Con: Economist [Garett Jones](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15582159.2017.1345242) estimates that "IQ accounts for only about [10%](https://humanvarieties.org/2016/01/31/iq-and-permanent-income-sizing-up-the-iq-paradox/) of variance in personal income".
1.6.3.1.4. Pro: Welfare benefits for the poor are financed by taxing the middle and upper classes \([p. 403](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258076773_Financing_the_welfare_state_and_the_politics_of_taxation)\); this reduces the amount of disposable income that parents in these families can spend on their children.
1.6.3.1.4.1. Pro: In the US, about a quarter of government spending - amounting to [one trillion dollars](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) - was on welfare and assistance, and the vast majority came from federal revenue generated through taxes \([p. 1](https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/PolicyBasics_WhereDoFederalTaxRevsComeFrom_08-20-12.pdf)\).
1.6.3.1.4.2. Con: Income tax is only one source of tax revenue. Sales tax and other taxes are applicable on all citizens; therefore, if the wealthy end up paying more taxes \(e.g., [sales tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salestax.asp), [luxury surcharge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/luxury_tax.asp)\), it is likely because they consume more \(i.e., increased consumption\).
1.6.3.1.4.3. Con: Many of the wealthiest people in the world have urged the government to tax them more in an attempt to reduce the [income and wealth gap](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/millionaires-call-on-governments-worldwide-to-tax-us-now).
1.6.3.1.4.3.1. Con: The willingness of extremely wealthy people to be taxed at a higher rate may not hold for moderately wealthy people or the middle class.
1.6.3.1.4.4. Con: In most countries, taxation is unlikely to have any impact on expenditure on children, because major expenditures including [education](https://cleartax.in/s/tuition-fees-deduction-under-section-80c), [healthcare](https://www.bankbazaar.com/tax/under-section-80dd.html), and [investments](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012114/taxsmart-ways-help-your-kidsgrandkids-pay-college.asp) can be claimed as tax deductions.
1.6.3.1.5. Con: A low socioeconomic status and [poverty](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/poverty-dampens-genetic-influence-on-iq-in-the-us.html) adversely affect intelligence; a nine-wave longitudinal study found that - within a span of 15 years - the IQ gap between [low- and high-SES children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/) had tripled.
1.6.3.1.6. Con: Many welfare programs in Europe are conditional on citizens having been [productive](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10391238/Benefits-in-Europe-country-by-country.html) first. Therefore, recipients can receive welfare provisions such as unemployment benefits or healthcare only if they have worked previously and paid taxes.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Marriage laws and family court rulings that incentivize divorce for women also disincentivize procreation within marriage for men. This especially affects men with high conscientiousness, who want a stable marriage within which to have children.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: Children with a single mother outnumber children with a single father by a [factor of five](https://www.statista.com/statistics/252847/number-of-children-living-with-a-single-mother-or-single-father/). Marriage laws and court rulings cannot be blamed for decisions made by [absent fathers](https://cluelaw.com/divorce/why-fathers-leave/)(Fathers abandoning their families seems to be an ongoing crisis in America, with more than one fourth of children growing up without a father in the home, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By time a child is one year old, half of couples separate, leaving the mother to pick up both parenting roles and to raise her child alone.).
1.6.3.2.2. Con: The ramifications of divorce are gendered: transient for men, but [chronic for women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5992251/). The notion that laws and court rulings can incentivize a life-altering event with lasting implications is dubious.
1.6.3.2.3. Pro: Most divorces \(two-thirds\) are initiated by women, and the percentage is significantly higher among [educated women](https://www.whitleylawfirmpc.com/3-reasons-why-women-initiate-divorce-more-often-than-men/) \(90%\).
1.6.3.2.3.1. Pro: [CEO-level promotions](https://www.businessinsider.in/strategy/news/research-shows-that-women-are-more-likely-to-get-divorced-shortly-after-a-promotion-and-thats-not-always-a-bad-thing/articleshow/74210224.cms) significantly increase the likelihood of a woman divorcing her husband. Though speculative, this trend has been attributed to marital problems caused by consequent changes in domestic gender roles.
1.6.3.2.3.2. Con: Intimate-partner violence is significantly [more prevalent](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/fastfact.html) among women than among men. Therefore, it is only reasonable that women are more likely to initiate a divorce, especially given that [domestic abuse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2016/10/25/domestic-violence-and-divorce/?sh=15d38477401d) is a common cause for divorce.
1.6.3.2.3.3. Con: Educated and employed women likely have the [financial](https://www.familylawdfw.com/blog/divorce-attorney-dallas/barriers-to-divorce-4-financial-security/) and social resources to file for divorce; just because uneducated or unemployed women are [unable to file for divorce](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58245247)(While the final cost of a divorce can vary wildly, even getting started is prohibitive for many. The application fee in England and Wales is £550 - which everyone getting a divorce must pay.\n\n"We spoke to people having to save for months or years to find £550," says Prof Liz Trinder, who led research for The Nuffield Foundation on divorce costs.\n\nThis initial cost amounts to a tax on people when they are "at their most financially vulnerable", says Prof Trinder) does not mean they do not want one.
1.6.3.2.4. Pro: Even after a [no-fault divorce](https://www.reederlawfirm.com/no-fault-divorce-law/), ex-husbands must [pay alimony](https://www.thebalance.com/differences-between-alimony-and-child-support-4687156) to their ex-wives, and custody of children is often granted to the ex-wife, entitling her to child support payments as well.
1.6.3.2.4.1. Con: The law protects both men and women from potentially gendered consequences of divorce, financial or otherwise.
1.6.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Laws related to post-divorce payments are [gender-neutral](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/alimony-what-you-need-know-30081.html). Irrespective of gender, the income-generating spouse ought to pay [alimony and child support](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-women-are-paying-alimonythat-includes-supporting-their-exs-porn-habit-2018-05-23) to the dependent ex-spouse.
1.6.3.2.4.1.2. Con: Child custody laws vary across countries. In Beirut, for example, child custody laws [disproportionately favor men](https://fanack.com/society-en/mothers-have-limited-custody-rights-after-divorce~124856/) and penalize mothers, particularly those who remarry or have children above the maternal custody period.
1.6.3.2.4.1.3. Pro: [Prenuptial](https://www.businessinsider.in/personal-finance/prenups-arent-just-for-the-rich-or-famous-more-millennials-are-signing-them-before-getting-married-and-you-probably-should-too/articleshow/66018811.cms) agreements are becoming increasingly common, especially among younger couples. They ensure that both the man and the woman agree on how financial assets ought to be divided in the event of a divorce.
1.6.3.2.4.1.4. Pro: In the US, several states have passed gender-neutral [child custody](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/05/mens-rights-recognized-the-pro-father-evolution-of-divorce-and-paternity-law.html) [laws](https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time). Court rulings that grant custody to more women often do so because it is in the “best interests of the child” because women are typically the primary [caregiver](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html).
1.6.3.2.4.1.4.1. Con: Women are typically the primary caregiver because of [restrictive gender norms](https://www.whiteswanfoundation.org/caregiving/how-the-role-of-caring-disproportionately-burdens-women), which perpetuate gender inequality. Laws that grant custody to women for being the primary caregiver reinforce these norms.
1.6.3.2.4.1.4.2. Pro: In the US, 91% of child custody decisions are decided by the parents with no [interference](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html) from the family court system. In slightly more than half of those cases, both parents agree that the mother should have custody of the children.
1.6.3.2.4.2. Pro: Movies like [Kramer vs. Kramer](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/12/19/kramer-vs-kramer-hit-national-nerve-40th-anniversary/2694519001/)("Kramer vs. Kramer" came down to a courtroom battle that pit tradition against change as much as it did spouse against spouse. Amid an amplifying national conversation about divorce and, especially, its consequences, its everybody-wins resolution – mother is awarded custody; mother decides at the last minute the child is better left with father – made for a satisfying onscreen drama on the way to Oscar glory for Benton, Hoffman, Streep and the film itself.) and [Mrs. Doubtfire](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/why-mrs-doubtfire-mattered/)(But in its own way, Mrs. Doubtfire was to the issue of divorce through the eyes of a young child as groundbreaking a movie as Philadelphia would be in addressing attitudes to HIV and AIDS a year or two later. Neither movie is anywhere near perfect, but both talk about a complicated issue in a relatively simplistic way, in a manner that’s digestible by a large audience. \[...\] Furthermore, the movie then ends with Mrs. Doubtfire, now front and center of a television program, answering a letter from a young girl. In the letter, the girl reveals that her parents are getting a divorce. And while what happens next has no subtlety to it, it still hits. Because Doubtfire explains in the response that just because they’re splitting up, it doesn’t mean that they don’t love her. \[...\] And to talk directly about a subject too often glossed over, to the people in the audience most confused and affected by it, was incredible.) likely earned their unprecedented fame because of their depiction of the unfairness of gendered child custody and celebration of non-traditional masculinity, which resonated with audiences at the cusp of similar gender-related dilemmas.
1.6.3.2.5. Con: Conscientious persons tend to have more [stable romantic relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201608/how-your-personality-predicts-your-romantic-life), whereas less-conscientious persons are more likely to cheat on their partners. Thus, divorced men are likely low on conscientiousness.
1.6.3.2.5.1. Pro: On average, women are [more conscientious](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article/70/4/919/5046671) than men, but are less likely to be [rewarded](https://theconversation.com/how-skills-and-personality-traits-contribute-to-the-gender-pay-gap-81684) for this trait. Therefore, the net negative effect of having an unconscientious spouse is disproportionately carried by women.
1.6.3.2.5.2. Pro: Infidelity is a [leading cause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012696/#)(The next most often cited major contributing factor to divorce was infidelity, endorsed by 59.6% of individuals and by at least one partner in 88.8% of couples.) for divorce, and married men are [significantly more likely](https://ifstudies.org/blog/who-cheats-more-the-demographics-of-cheating-in-america)(In general, men are more likely than women to cheat: 20% of men and 13% of women reported that they’ve had sex with someone other than their spouse while married, according to data from the recent General Social Survey\(GSS\). \[...\] Men who cheated are more likely than their female peers to be married. Among men who have cheated on their spouse before, 61% are currently married, while 34% are divorced or separated. However, only 44% of women who have cheated before are currently married, while 47% are divorced or separated.) to cheat than married women. Such men evidently do not want "a stable marriage" suitable for procreation.
1.6.3.2.5.3. Con: There are cultural differences and culture-contingent sex differences in conscientiousness \([p. 172](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24001221_Why_Can%27t_a_Man_Be_More_Like_a_Woman_Sex_Differences_in_Big_Five_Personality_Traits_Across_55_Cultures_vol_94_pg_168_2008)\). These findings suggest that conscientiousness [can be cultivated](https://hbr.org/2018/03/becoming-more-conscientious) and that low conscientiousness is a weak excuse for poor interpersonal behavior.
1.6.3.3. Con: Political processes and outcomes vary depending on who is in power. Only the ruling party is to be blamed for failed population control initiatives; they are not evidence that more effective policies will not lead to better outcomes.
1.6.3.3.1. Con: Population control outcomes can be difficult to predict; for instance, scientists predicted that the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a [baby boom](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/researchers-predict-covid-baby-boom), but it actually led to a [baby bust](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-pandemic-caused-a-baby-bust-not-a-boom/). Therefore, governments may not be entirely responsible for failed initiatives, especially during unprecedented crises.
1.6.3.3.2. Pro: Opposition parties tend to [point out](https://www.trailblz.com/articles/how-to-challenge-and-beat-an-incumbent)(The challenger should try to set the agenda. The challenger should try to force the incumbent into talking about issues where the incumbent is weak. The challenger must be able to draw a contrast and show why they should be elected. Beating an incumbent is possible with hard work and having a plan. The electorate must be shown that there is a clear difference between the candidates on issues that the challenger defines. The challenger must tell voters why they are running for office and why they are the better candidate.) the incumbent politicians' shortcomings in hopes of getting elected instead.
1.6.4. Con: Selective pressures should not be exerted by government policy, because no central authority should have the power to determine which genetics are desirable. Instead, we should allow people to thrive and reproduce according to their own merits.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Selective pressures due to population expansion actually help [improve](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2783-2)(We identified immune related gene sets that could be involved in the protection against pathogens especially in the African population. We also identified the glycolysis & gluconeogenesis gene set, related to metabolism, which supports the thrifty genotype hypothesis invoked to explain the current high prevalence of diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Extending our analysis to the gene level, we found signals for 23 candidate genes linked to metabolic syndrome, 13 of which are new candidates for positive selection.) the immune system and metabolism.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Natural selection worked over time to improve the immune system by [favoring genetic variants that were advantageous](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2783-2)(As individuals migrated to new environments \(e.g. climate, diet\), they were forced to adapt, and natural selection acted to favor variants that were advantageous both in pathogens and hosts. Both environmental factors and pathogen load must have had a great impact on the human genetic variation and infectious disease susceptibility. Based on all the analyses carried out, we identify a total 35 gene sets related to immune protection and host defense interactions; seven of them were detected with XPCLR and 28 with iHS \(details about the populations that the gene sets were detected are presented in Additional file 2: Table S5\).) for both pathogens and hosts.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: These findings are not relevant across the board, rather they are more [regionally focused](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2783-2)(These observations overall suggest that gene sets related to host defense interactions in the immune system were under selective pressures in Africa. However, they were released from such pressures once humans migrated to Asia, presumably because many of the pathogens \(bacteria, viruses and other infectious pathogens\) were absent in the newly colonized continent.) on a per continent basis.
1.6.4.2. Con: Governments determine which genetics are desirable, such as by selectively permitting abortions when fetal anomalies are detected. A vast [majority of fetuses](https://www.bpas.org/get-involved/campaigns/briefings/fetal-anomaly/)(Advances in pre-natal screening and diagnostic testing, alongside trends in later motherhood, mean that more women are faced with a diagnosis of fetal anomaly, generally in the second trimester of pregnancy. Many women opt for abortion in these circumstances: for example, 90% of pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 \(Down's Syndrome\) will be terminated.) with such features are aborted.
1.6.4.3. Pro: To be effective, government management of incentives in complex systems should be evidence based and mindful of the role of [extraneous variables](https://www.formpl.us/blog/extraneous-variables)(Extraneous variables, also known as confounding variables, are defined as all other variables that could affect the findings of an experiment but are not independent variables. \[...\] This is why the researcher must ensure that the impact on the dependent variable is caused solely by the manipulation of the independent variable. \n\nTo ascertain this, all other variables that can affect the dependent variable and cause a change must be monitored and controlled.\n\nThe researcher must control as many extraneous variables as possible because they may be essential in providing alternative explanations as to why the effect occurred.); however, only few countries formulate their economic policies based on [behavioral research](https://journals.openedition.org/oeconomia/2230) findings.
1.6.5. Pro: Without population controls for certain groups, the average IQ of a society will decrease.
1.6.5.1. Con: [High-IQ individuals](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/SSR2014.pdf), particularly high-IQ women, are less likely to have children \(pp. 162-164\). Thus, a decrease in average IQ is likely to occur, regardless of the imposition of population control measures among lower-IQ groups.
1.6.5.2. Pro: The [Flynn effect](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338633042_THE_REVERSAL_OF_THE_FLYNN_EFFECT_2020)(p. 153) - an increase in IQ scores across time - is showing signs of reversal.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Low IQ is significantly associated with [poor health and mortality](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29925669/). This suggests that underlying genetic vulnerabilities may act as a natural population control method.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: There is a difference between natural population reduction resulting from genetic vulnerabilities and population reduction achieved through deliberate attempts to prevent the birth of individuals with certain characteristics.
1.6.5.3.2. Pro: [Research](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/low-i-q-predicts-heart-disease/) has shown that people with lower IQ scores have four times higher risk of heart disease.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Women with low IQ are more [fertile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10842506) than those with high IQ. Given that intelligence is [heritable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270739/), higher fertility among low-IQ women could lower the average IQ of a society.
1.6.5.4.1. Con: The relationship between IQ and fertility is at least partially attributable to extraneous factors such as [education](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180621112004.htm), [socioeconomic status](https://ifstudies.org/blog/how-income-affects-fertility), and [social mobility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248886/). Reducing socioeconomic inequality would, therefore, [increase IQ](https://www.economist.com/international/2019/02/02/thanks-to-education-global-fertility-could-fall-faster-than-expected) while also controlling [fertility](https://www.cgdev.org/page/demographics-and-poverty) without necessitating population control methods.
1.6.5.5. Con: IQ tests have [significant limitations](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/iq-tests-are-fundamentally-flawed-and-using-them-alone-to-measure-intelligence-is-a-fallacy-study-finds-8425911.html), which limit their usefulness in making decisions about population control among low-IQ groups.
1.6.6. Pro: Societies that consume unsustainably are, by definition, more likely to collapse than those that use resources sustainably. This constitutes a selective pressure to create a society constituted by individuals who value sustainability.
