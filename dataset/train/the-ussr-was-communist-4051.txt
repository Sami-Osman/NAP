Discussion Name: The USSR was communist.

1. The USSR can be called a communist state.
1.1. Pro: The USSR attempted to create a non-capitalist system.
1.1.1. Pro: The [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union) controlled the means of production.
1.1.1.1. Con: Communism does not require a government to control the means of production.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Communism and Socialism are [fundamentally different](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/difference-between-communism-and-socialism/). Socialism is an economic model in which the means of production are owned collectively and can exist under many forms of government; Communism, however, is a societal model in which the means of production are also collectively owned but the government is nearly non-existent and there is no need for money or classes.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Socialism does not require government. It is only the state of affairs where the means of production are collectivized, making it a purely social/economic description of society.
1.1.2. Pro: The USSR reduced economic freedom in the name of equality.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The USSR was egalitarian.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: There were class differences.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: In [communist Eastern Europe](https://visegradinsight.eu/gender-equality-in-central-eastern-europe-media/), women and men were equally present in most jobs.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Under Stalin, the USSR was a [dictatorship within a bureaucratic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism).
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: In the USSR there was a divide between those in control - the government and their managers – and the proletariat.
1.1.2.2. Con: Marx wanted to expand economic freedom, not limit it. He wanted people to live without limitations of material necessity, being free to labour in a manner which they [chose from their own spirit](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#a4) and not because hunger called.
1.1.3. Pro: Individuals did not own private property.
1.1.3.1. Con: Individuals did own [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy). Only the means of production, like farms and factories, were collectivized. After WWI, even farms were privately owned in the New Economic Policy made by Lenin.
1.1.3.2. Con: Collective farms included a small proportion of private lands.
1.2. Pro: The USSR was inspired by communist thought.
1.2.1. Pro: The USSR was inspired by the writing of Karl Marx, specifically by a [Marxist-Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism) stream of thought.
1.2.1.1. Con: The USSR was not structured the way that Karl Marx outlined in The Communist Manifesto. It did not include [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Marxism) - which Karl Marx insisted that it must to be successful.
1.2.1.2. Con: According to Marxist thought, revolution could only occur in advanced industrial societies, not [backward agrarian ones like Russia](http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/opinion-russias-october-revolution-not-marx-mind-279962/).
1.2.1.3. Pro: The Soviet Revolution was driven by the proletariat rising against the bourgeoisie.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The 1917 Revolution happened because of [hunger among the soldiers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/09-10/russian-revolution-history-lenin/) rather than ideological conviction.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The 1917 Revolution was seized by the Bolsheviks, and then manipulated by them in the coming months and years, to bring about a Bolshevik-controlled state structure. Even though the cause may be said to have been soldier hunger, the swell of the Revolution was quickly and continually made in the image of the Bolsheviks.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The USSR was a [one-party state](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state) which is consistent with Marxist–Leninist political ideology of communism.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: The [dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat) was considered a transitory state necessary to achieve real communism, goal that was never achieved, arguably because of Stalin.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: If a system of any kind can be hijacked by one man, the system cannot be deemed 'good' or even well thought out.
1.2.1.5. Con: This doesn't back up the claim that the "USSR was communist".
1.2.1.5.1. Con: There is no absolute bar for truth that defines what a state is and what a state isn't. There are only pieces of supporting evidence.
1.2.1.6. Con: [Lenin was inspired by Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism). [The Bolsheviks were inspired by Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks). The USSR was founded by the Bolsheviks and therefore it is more correct to say that the USSR was more inspired by Lenin. As Lenin takes Marxism in a particular direction this is an important distinction.
1.2.1.7. Pro: The USSR was lead by Lenin and then Stalin, who were both Marxist-Leninists.
1.2.1.7.1. Con: Lenin and Stalin were right-wing aberrations that misused the word communism.
1.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: [One party rule never ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state#Former_Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist_one-party_countries), nor was there a transition to a significantly more democratic form than Western capitalist democracies.
1.2.1.7.1.2. Con: Communism itself is an aberration that ignores human nature and disallows common behavior. Stalin and Lenin were exactly what a system of that kind can expect.
1.2.1.7.1.2.1. Con: Beyond primal needs, there is no common human nature. We adapt to the world around us and are remarkably good at doing so
1.2.1.7.2. Pro: Lenin founded '[The Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union)' \(Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза \(КПСС\), Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza\), abbreviated in English as CPSU\) in 1919, Stalin became a member later on. The party's aim was to bring about a Communist society but it did not succeed. Membership of a political party that expresses such aims, was and still is, what is colloquially understood as what is meant to be a 'communist'.
1.2.2. Con: The USSR was by name and definition socialist and not communist.
1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.2. Con: Communism is a form of socialism.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: While the transitional model of socialism was intended to achieve communism, and Marxism-Leninism is a branch of communist politics \(despite claims to the contrary from some anarcho-communists\), the USSR did not successfully complete the transition to communism.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Even if a state/regime does not reach the end goal of the ideology underpinning their governance, it is still fair to label them according to the ideology underpinning the transition they were undertaking \(but could not complete\).
1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: The ruling ideology of the USSR, "[Marxism-Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism)", claimed that the USSR was socialist and was moving towards communism. In this scheme, socialism was supposed to be an intermediary phase between capitalism and communism. This is quite different from the way Marx and Engels used the words, as synonyms.
1.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: This is evidenced by Khrushchev's slogan of the USSR achieving "[communism by 1980!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_20_years)"
1.2.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.2.
1.2.2.3. Con: Saying that the USSR wasn't communist because it fails to fit into someone's specific ideal of what communism should be is a 'No True Scotsman' fallacy.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: This is not about someone's specific ideal. This is about actual definitions.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Communism is an economic and social system envisioned by the nineteenth-century German scholar [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx). He invented it, his definition therefore is the one that is used. The USSR does not conform to Marx's definition of Communism.
1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Marx did not invent communism.
1.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: A variety of communist theories have predated Marx.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites are the only living examples of communism. The few exceptions to this are small, short-lived attempts such as the [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune).
1.2.2.3.3. Con: A "[No True Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)" fallacy refers to changing a definition of something so that an argument can stay afloat, closer to goalpost-moving than trying to follow a precise definition of something. In this case, the argument is based not on an ideal, but a definition provided by Marx/Engels/etc. The USSR was not run by a state made up of the working class, and the Russian working class did not have power over production. That is the definition of socialism/communism. The USSR did not meet it.
1.2.2.3.3.1. Con: No state will ever meet it because of the fact that it is purely academic theory. Given the fact that multiple states have attempted to live up to the ideal and failed it becomes necessary to revisit the theory itself and, perhaps, admit that it is flawed.
1.2.2.3.3.2. Con: This argument relies on faulty reasoning, according to which communism or communists cannot fail or do wrong: "It failed because it's not real communism, so we need more communism. It succeeded because of communism, so we need more communism."
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Communists often try to distance their ideology from the atrocities committed by communist regimes in an attempt to [whitewash communism](https://medium.com/the-liturgical-legion/the-marxist-the-nazi-and-the-no-true-scotsman-54c3b9d10b37).
1.2.2.3.4.1. Con: If the regimes committed atrocities which were fundamentally at odds with communist ideology, it is correct for communists to attempt to distance the ideology from the regimes. This is not whitewashing.
1.2.2.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.3.2.
1.2.2.3.5. Pro: Communism has [many different interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communist_ideologies) by several political philosophers. Given that any civilization will violate at least one tenet of any communist philosophy, there can never be "real communism". Therefore, we should accept the closest examples \(the USSR\) as examples of actually existing communism.
1.2.2.4. Pro: By definition a communist society is a society in which there is no [state, no classes, and no monetary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_society). All of which the USSR had. The USSR was socialist, intending to become communist, but it actually wasn't communist.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Even calling it socialist is ill-informed. Socialism is the society resulting from [the working class taking power](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/csp.htm). The working class and the soviets that took power in 1917 were largely destroyed in the civil war, forcing the central bureaucracy to substitute itself for supreme power, with historically tragic results.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.2.
1.2.3. Pro: The founding and leading political party of the USSR was the [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union). Saying that a country led and founded by communists, on communist principles, isn't communist because it fails to achieve impossible standards serves no other purpose than to distance communism from the atrocities that was committed in its name.
1.3. Con: The USSR did not achieve the class-based goals of communism.
1.3.1. Pro: [Workers did not control the means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_working_class).
1.3.1.1. Pro: The state, which did not represent the people, controlled the means of production.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: The state was controlled by the working class.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The means of production were controlled by the [Communist Party](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/history-of-the-soviet-union#section_8), which was controlled largely by elite members of the upper-class.
1.3.2. Pro: The society was not classless.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Government officers received greater remuneration than peasants.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.3.2.
1.3.4. Pro: Society was not organised by [the principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs) of "from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs".
1.3.4.1. Con: There is no way to make society function on such a principle. The list of failed attempts keeps growing because merit and competence do not distribute themselves according to 'fairness', but along hierarchies.
1.3.5. Pro: [Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_ruble), [generalized commodity production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_goods_in_the_Soviet_Union), and [market exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union) all existed in the USSR.
1.4. Con: The USSR was imperialistic, which communism is opposed to.
1.4.1. Con: Marxist communism is inherently imperialistic.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Marxist communism is reliant on [violent revolution](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708729?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: This revolution is to be brought about by professional revolutionaries who engage in subterfuge and otherwise attack stable societies - this disruption and attempt to take over is inherently imperialistic.
1.4.1.2. Pro: [The fundamental goal of communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_communism#Early_era_\(1917%E2%80%931944\)) is to conquer the world.
1.4.2. Pro: The USSR had a whole host of [satellite states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire) under its direct informal control.
1.4.3. Pro: The [Communist International](https://www.viewpointmag.com/2018/02/01/communist-international-imperialism/) was founded on the principle of a global struggle against imperialism.
1.5. Con: The USSR was a totalitarian state.
1.5.1. Pro: Totalitarianism requires a state, which a communist society does not have.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The USSR was a state and a state cannot be communist.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Communism cannot exist without a state due to the fact that it is impossible to arbitrate 'equity' without an all-powerful arbiter. A collectivist society with joint ownership [requires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2153998.I_Pencil) a strong central authority to divide resources and direct them to the appropriate places. Even AI isn't capable of that feat yet.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The state did not wither away.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The fact that the state did not wither away implies that [Marxist ideology surrounding said phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering_away_of_the_state) is inherently flawed.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Several initiatives were taken to assist in the withering away of the state, e.g. the [Five Year Plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union).
1.5.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: However, all of them failed, leaving the state stronger than ever.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: These plans were based on a key Marxist theory \(the [theory of the productive forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_productive_forces)\) that was seen as essential to realising communism.
1.5.1.2. Pro: According to Marx, states have emerged as mechanisms of class exploitation. In this perspective, a [communist state is impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_the_state) because in a genuinely communist society there is no class to be exploited.
1.5.2. Con: Totalitarianism wasn't absolute in the USSR but varied by who was in power.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The [Lenin Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Soviet_Union#The_Lenin_years) were characterized by a diversity of cultural and social experimentation.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Lenin was [the first to order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag) the creation of gulags in 1917, and was also the direct inspiration for the incredibly totalitarian Stalin.
1.5.2.2. Con: Totalitarianism was absolute regardless of who was running the country. The camps began immediately in 1917 [under Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag), grew to [their height under Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism), and didn't disappear until the collapse of the USSR. Every attempt at communism has resulted in a totalitarian state irrespective of who was in charge and despite the fact that the theory requires that no one be in charge.
1.5.3. Pro: Communism, as envisioned by Marx, Engels, and countless others as a society without the [state, classes, money, or oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_society), is mutually exclusive with totalitarianism.
1.5.4. Pro: Massive slavery and deportation \(gulags\) are not part of the communist ideology.
1.5.4.1. Con: While they may not be a part of the communist canon, they are an [inevitable part of the practice thereof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism). There is not a single record of any attempt at communism that does not also contain these features.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: To assume that they are not a feature simply because they are not accounted for in the theory is to disregard the notion that the theory could be \(and based on real-world practice, actually is\) wrong.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: While attempts at communism have included [repression](https://reaction.life/trendy-socialism-leads-straight-gulag/) of individuals in order to ensure collective needs are prioritised, that is quite distinct from communism always featuring slavery/gulags.
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Communist theory calls for [abolition of private property](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf)(In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition\nof private property.). Abolition of private property inevitably leads to discontent of those who were deprived of property. To pacify the discontented people, repressions are necessary to keep the communist government in charge.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Communism is against the bondage of [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) \(jobs in the capitalist system\), so it is clearly opposed to actual unpaid slavery.
1.5.5. Con: A [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) cannot exist without a state. As all communist economies must be centrally planned, not only is a state necessary, a totalitarian state is the only means by which a planned economy can exist.
1.5.5.1. Con: A centrally planned economy is a feature of socialism, not communism.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Given the fact that communal ownership of the means of production and real property requires management of some kind, the concept of central planning is inescapable no matter which collectivist ideal you choose.
1.6. Con: The USSR did not make meaningful attempts to become more communist.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.7.1.
1.6.2. Pro: The word communism was only used to increase support from the working class.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.1.
1.6.4. Con: Nikita Khrushev [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_20_years) in 1961: "We are strictly guided by scientific calculations. And calculations show that in 20 years we will build mainly a [communist society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_society)".
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.
1.7. Pro: Although the USSR was nominally socialist, the [differences between Socialism and Communism](https://www.thoughtco.com/difference-between-communism-and-socialism-195448) are immaterial.
1.7.1. Pro: [One \(Socialism\) claims state ownership of the means of production, the other \(Communism\) of the thing produced.](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/difference-between-communism-and-socialism/) Since all economies consist of production-consumption cycles, centralization of one or the other is equivalent to the eradication of private choice and always results in a state-controlled monopoly.
1.7.2. Con: Socialism is a way of [transferring](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm#s2) from capitalism to [communism](https://en.internationalism.org/icconline/201312/9350/period-transition-capitalism-communism), as opposed to sudden ruling. Moreover, socialism couldn't possibly be the same as communism due to the fact it has a state, as opposed to communism being stateless, and having no currency.
1.8. Pro: The USSR advocated communism.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.8.2. Pro: The USSR [supported cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) with the international proletariat against capitalism worldwide.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.8.4. Con: The USSR only pretended to be communist, which does not mean that it was actually communist.
1.8.4.1. Con: The USSR could have advocated for communism publicly even while privately not progressing down that road.
