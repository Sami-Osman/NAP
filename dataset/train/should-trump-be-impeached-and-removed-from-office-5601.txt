Discussion Name: Should Trump be impeached and removed from office?

1. Donald Trump should be impeached and removed from office.
1.1. Pro: Trump should be impeached because he is mentally unfit to serve as President.
1.1.1. Con: The [25th Amendment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-could-be-removed-for-political-incompetence--using-the-25th-amendment/2017/09/12/b6c62380-9718-11e7-82e4-f1076f6d6152_story.html?utm_term=.630756bb30d9) provides a separate process for removing a physically or mentally unfit President.  Impeachment is not necessary.
1.1.1.1. Con: While the 25th amendment defines the process, the majority of "the [principal officers](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xxv) of the executive departments" are fired immediately whenever they exhibit any disloyalty to Trump. Because their selection criteria is loyalty above any other criteria \(such as duty to the American people\), the power of the 25th amendment has been curtailed.
1.1.1.2. Con: The 25th amendment does not prohibit [congress](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/05/645021413/amid-another-wild-week-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-25th-amendment) from pursuing impeachment on the grounds of mental unfitness, nor does it block the passage of a law that would remove the president for mental unfitness.
1.1.1.3. Con: The 25th amendment's [process requires](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/06/09/the-25th-amendment/) the unanimous consensus of the Vice President and the Cabinet. This is not a professional opinion on his mental or physical wellbeing.
1.1.2. Pro: [Senility is apparent](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-brain-health) in his speech patterns. He is the most aged person to serve as President of the USA.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Trump has been [exhibiting](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/09/does-donald-trump-have-dementia-we-need-know-psychologist-column/3404007002/) the symptoms compatible with senility such as "memory loss," poor judgment, impaired concentration, and confusion since he was much younger \(at least before the election\).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The evidence of memory loss, in particular, may actually just be Trump deliberately misrepresenting his memories.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Diagnosis can't be made on actions alone. The state of his mind can only be clearly assessed by a physician.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: A diagnosis that is not made by a doctor physically examining the patient, can negatively impact not only the subject, but others who also have the disease, [particularly with people who have brain disorders.](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/dementia-and-donald-trump-why-not-to-diagnose)
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: The visible symptoms/exhibited attributes and traits warrant are enough to warrant further inquiry including physician assessment, which may result in diagnosis alleged.
1.1.3. Pro: [Donald](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/readersrespond/bs-ed-rr-trump-lies-letter-20180604-story.html) [Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/25/donald-trump-stumps-south-carolina-governor-talks-himself/732458002/) [shows](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/world-leaders-have-figured-out-how-to-play-to-trump-s-fragile-ego-20180505-p4zdjy.html) most, if not all of the signs of [Clinical Narcissism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder).
1.1.3.1. Con: Even if granted, clinical narcissism is not necessarily grounds for being [unfit](https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/06/donald-trump-mental-illness-diagnosis/) to serve the office of the president. The two are not mutually exclusive.
1.1.3.2. Pro: George T. Conway has provided an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/) that supports the view that Donald Trump’s narcissism makes it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires.
1.1.3.3. Con: Past presidents of both parties - [Nixon, Bush, Obama, Clinton](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/the-10-most-narcissistic-u-s-presidents.html) - have also shown symptoms of narcissism and grandiosity while still being mentally fit enough to run the office.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: The argument above commits whataboutism. While past presidents have arguably egocentric views of themselves, the case against Trump's fitness is based on unique pathological narcissism.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: No other president has lied at historic levels proportional to Trump, which is a hallmark of a narcissist personality disorder.
1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Trump [continues to lie and make misrepresentations](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ap-fact-check-distortion-trumps-054238232.html) to cover up his wrong doing.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Health care professionals have largely [spoken](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-acquittal-celebration-224804821.html) on the topic about Trump's possible pathology, which has never happened with past presidents.
1.1.4. Pro: Trump is a [pathological](https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-mueller-practice-session-lies/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_5776e9f0b08511e8872dc93302272904) [liar](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html).
1.1.4.1. Con: All American politicians engage in purposefully misleading rhetoric. Impeaching one particular politician on these grounds would be a meaningless gesture.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Trump's position as president makes him a uniquely important politician that has to be viewed with more scrutiny than everyone else.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: As the president, Trump has a duty to the American public that goes above and beyond politics, party, campaigning, or otherwise.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Since he took office, President Trump [has made](https://secondnexus.com/news/donald-trump-bob-woodward-credibility-problems/1/) more than [4229](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) factually inaccurate claims or comments.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Trump has made [13,435](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/) false or misleading claims between January 20, 2017, and October 9, 2019.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Trump's false allegations include those against his [opponents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/), including Joe Biden, that he "forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was investigating his son, Hunter".
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Trump has falsely claimed 204 times that the [U.S. economy today is the best in history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/president-trumps-repeated-claim-greatest-economy-history-our-country/), even though the economy is not doing as well as it did under previous presidents. The American economy is beginning to hit the head winds [caused by](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/) Trump’s trade wars and the manufacturing sector in recession.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Trump has falsely claimed 171 times that he passed the [biggest tax cut in history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/01/president-trumps-tax-cut-not-the-biggest-in-u-s-history/). However, Reagan’s tax cut still remains the biggest \(amounting to [2.9% of the GDP](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/)\), as compared to 0.9% by Trump.
1.1.5. Pro: CEOs of large companies, like Donald Trump, [often have psycopathic traits](https://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-often-have-psychopathic-traits-2017-7?r=US&IR=T).
1.1.5.1. Pro: In a [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/president-trump-unstable-danger-nuclear-war-psychologists-warn-685029) article, a licensed psychologist and psychotherapist, ostensibly experts in their field\(s\), claimed that Trump is unstable and dangerous.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: For a therapist to make such a public claim would violate their training and credentials. It is [irresponsible](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/08/13/489807468/psychiatrists-reminded-to-refrain-from-armchair-analysis-of-public-figures) to diagnose a person one has not treated.
1.1.6. Pro: Trump has been claimed to have dementia by top psychologists, and on various occasions leaked information he should not have. These claims come from prestigious establishments, such as [Yale Conferences.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/donald-trump-dangerous-mental-illness-yale-psychiatrist-conference-us-president-unfit-james-gartner-a7694316.html)
1.1.6.1. Con: The opinions being laid as claims do not meet the needs to provide a medical diagnosis of [dementia or any other mental condition](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_steps_to_diagnosis.asp), given the lack of a medical exam by those laying the claim.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The [Goldwater rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_rule) is the informal name given to section 7 in the American Psychiatric Association's \(APA\) Principles of Medical Ethics, which states that it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures whom they have not examined in person, and from whom they have not obtained consent to discuss their mental health in public statements.
1.1.6.2. Con: U.S. President Donald Trump passed a test for signs of dementia and is in [overall excellent health](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-medical/trump-is-fit-for-duty-but-should-hit-the-gym-white-house-doctor-idUSKBN1F52OR).
1.1.6.2.1. Con: The test for dementia was carried out by the president´s doctor and not by an independent group.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: [The Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Summary-of-Physical-Exam-for-President-Trump-12-Jan-2018.pdf) released Trump's medical review by the White House Physician, which reports Trump's mental health is fine.
1.1.7. Con: There is not a part of the constitution that says the IQ of the president must be XXX.
1.1.7.1. Con: There is the part where he takes the oath and makes promises to the public. If he has not read or comprehended the constitutional duties he has sworn to uphold \(and defend\), his IQ is not sufficient for the office.
1.1.8. Con: Mental illness and things like senility cannot be diagnosed by lay people who only view him on TV. Trump is a lot smarter than he looks. His persona that he shows to the public is not who he is in private.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Examinations, evaluations, and tests that span over many appointments are [needed before a diagnosis is made](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.books.9780890426760.pe02) by a psychiatrist. A neurologist would need to be brought in to evaluate a senility claim.
1.2. Pro: Trump has tried to take actions that are unconstitutional. For this, he should be impeached.
1.2.1. Pro: Trump's team is guilty of bribery.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Trump likely took a [bribe from China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/opinion/trump-china-bribe-national-security.html). After banning sales of the phone on military bases on the grounds that China was using them for espionage, Trump turned around and said that he was working with President Xi of China to help save ZTE. This occurred after a Chinese owned company invested a large sum of money in a project in which the Trump Organization has a substantial stake.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Trump's personal lawyer [has received](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/nyregion/giuliani-ukraine-business-trump.html) hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for a diplomatic meeting with the Ukrainian president.
1.2.1.3. Con: Trump has not been convicted of bribery.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Impeachment is the only constitutionally available process by which a sitting president could be convicted. One may be guilty without having yet been legally found guilty; a legal presumption of innocence is not a reason not to begin a legal proceeding.
1.2.1.4. Con: It is only illegal to [bribe government officials](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201).
1.2.2. Con: The constitution is a [living document](https://study.com/academy/answer/why-is-the-us-constitution-called-a-living-document.html) and therefore subject to interpretation and change. Judging whether an action is constitutional or not is the responsibility of the US Supreme Court, not Congress, where an appeal for impeachment would be initiated.
1.2.2.1. Con: Article. VI [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause), "This Constitution... shall be the supreme Law of the Land" and as alive it may be, it is still a law that may provide legal grounds for impeachment arguments.
1.2.2.2. Con: The Supreme Court has substantial precedent as to what is or is not constitutional, both putting the President on notice - thus precluding claims of innocence he might have because of the Supreme Court's role of interpreting the Constitution - and providing more than enough material such that Congress need only interpret the standard for impeachment, as designed.
1.2.3. Pro: Trump is accused to be guilty of [violating campaign finance law](https://www.newsweek.com/michael-cohen-says-donald-trump-directed-him-violate-campaign-finance-laws-1084213).
1.2.3.1. Con: A United States citizen, such as Trump, is [considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_v._United_States).
1.2.4. Pro: Trump has violated his [oath of office](https://theconversation.com/has-trump-violated-his-oath-of-office-a-primer-on-presidential-duty-and-accountability-100122), by failing to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."
1.2.4.1. Pro: Trump has [refused to acknowledge](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-denies-he-denied-russian-medd/) that the United States has been attacked and [has refused to take steps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-ignoring-the-worst-attack-on-america-since-911/2018/02/18/5ad888f2-14f3-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.a4f00ad88e68) to protect the country from future attacks. This violates his [oath of office](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States) and is an ideal qualification for his impeachment.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Trump has committed treason.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: The people who believe Trump has committed treason, the penalty for which is death, appear to be suffering from a [cognitive dissonance](http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/05/26/episode-81-how-to-spot-cognitive-dissonance/) disorder that therapists are calling Trump Anxiety Disorder \([TAD](https://palmettonews-opinion.com/therapists-are-coining-the-phrase-trump-anxiety-disorder/)\) also known by some as [Trump Derangement Syndrome](http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/05/17/episode-69-how-to-guide-a-victim-out-of-trump-derangement-syndrome-tds/),
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Many [therapists claim](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/07/30/psychiatrist-debunks-trump-anxiety-disorder-says-it-partisan-pop-psychology) there is no such thing as TAD or [TDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Derangement_Syndrome) and it is instead "partisan pop psychology". It is [not an official,](https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/38179-trump-anxiety-disorder) recognised diagnoses. Even if there were anxiety, many would consider it [justifiable](https://www.rt.com/uk/435026-icymi-trump-anxiety-disorder/) given the president's actions.
1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: Accusing his political critics of mental illness is a tactic used to absolve Trump of any guilt and distract from the issue.
1.2.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Ironically this is precisely what Trump's critics [allege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_of_Donald_Trump) of him.
1.2.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Donald Trump's behaviour has become [increasingly paranoid and erratic of late](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/), with frequent alleged examples of memory lapse.
1.2.4.2.1.3. Con: This is [ad hominem fallacy](https://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html), i.e., the person raising the argument is bad or mad, there any ideas he suggests are useless.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: [Siding with](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-backs-vladimir-putin-against-us-intelligence-agencies-over-election-meddling-claims-11439065) a hostile foreign government over our own intelligence agencies is considered treason.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: Under US law treason is defined as ['Levying War against the US, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_3:_Treason) Since the US is not currently at war with Russia no possible treason could have occurred.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Many would define Russia as an enemy. And refusing to name them as a culprit, or conspiring with them, refusing to enact sanctions, would fall under comforting and aiding.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The United States is currently not at war with Russia, so from a legal standpoint, they are not an enemy of the USA.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This claim is actually misleading. [Legally,](https://news.gallup.com/poll/189503/four-nations-top-greatest-enemy-list.aspx) a country doesn't have to be at war, or in a state of open hostilities to name a [country it's enemy](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/photos/which-countries-are-allies-and-which-are-enemies/ss-BBBNVNJ). It is enough for the Government and/or those in power and authority to consider something or someone [an enemy](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/which-country-is-americas-biggest-enemy/) for it to be so.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The "cold war" was not an [actual physical war](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/47122488) and there was no formal declaration, yet America would consider Russia its enemy in such a state or situation.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The government regularly names nations, states and individuals whom they name or declare as enemies, without declarations of war. A good example would be Iran, which America sees as an Enemy state, yet [no formal state of war exists](https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-soft-war-iran).
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Enemies need not be bordered countries. Lies and deception, and other fraudulent acts, may constitute enemies of the people; whose needs Government is designed to serve.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Under [US](https://definitions.uslegal.com/e/enemy-of-the-united-states/) [Law](https://www.jstor.org/stable/787437?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents), a country has to be engaged in hostilities to be classified as an enemy.
1.2.4.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Russia itself still defines and sees itself as an enemy, or at least a major rival of, the United States, as expressed through their [state run media](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-fury-intel-briefing-shows-084315257.html).
1.2.4.2.2.2. Con: The President is not legally required to abide by US intel assessments. Reliance on flawed intel in the past has resulted in unnecessary war and loss of life.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: President Trump has not been convicted of treason.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: Unsubstatiated accusations of collusion or differences of opinion with a citizen of the US are not grounds for treason.
1.2.4.2.3.2. Con: A conviction of treason is not required for treason\(s\) to have been perpetrated. An impeachment proceeding and presentation of evidence of treason would occur before a subsequent conviction.
1.2.4.2.4. Pro: When [EPA regulations designed to protect the citizens from harm are rolled back](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html), at direct financial benefit of corporations; with the intention of benefiting these corporations \(in the markets, or otherwise\); at the direct harm to the general welfare of the American public; then a treason has occurred.
1.2.4.2.4.1. Con: Trump himself did not make each rollback himself, rather this was delegated to [Administrator Scott Pruitt](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/03/how-trump-is-changing-science-environment/), a former coal lobbyist. Therefore Trump is not responsible for the harms to the public.
1.2.4.2.4.1.1. Con: Trump has fired other appointments, but not this administrator and corrected his actions. He expresses at least a tacit approval [legitimizing potential chemical treasons](https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-epa-is-undermining-new-law-to-regulate-chemicals/) against the wellbeing of the American public.
1.2.4.2.5. Pro: Failing to uphold the oath taken to "preserve, protect and defend" the Constitution of America and the promises to the people therein; is to adhere to the enemies thereof.
1.2.4.2.5.1. Pro: The Constitution is the first and greatest ally of the American people. Their rights and the duties of those elected to serve the people are defined therein.
1.2.4.2.6. Con: As defined in the US Constitution, [treason requires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution) a declaration of war by the Congress. No such declaration has been made. At this time, there are no legally-defined "enemies" to adhere to, to comfort or to aid, it is not possible for a charge of treason to be made out.
1.2.4.2.6.1. Con: Nothing in the constitution states the requirement of a declaration of war. Enemies of the Constitution may operate foreign or domestically \(or even in the office of the president\). If the Constitution is the ally of the American people that it defines itself to be \(in the opening\) then a failure to uphold these duties is to operate as the enemy of the Constitution and the American people.
1.2.4.2.7. Pro: It is likely that Trump and his administration colluded with Russia.
1.2.4.2.7.1. Con: While a valid reason to impeach President Trump would be if he is found to have colluded with Russia to influence elections, a President has only ever been impeached for acts committed while [in office](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1867/01/the-causes-for-which-a-president-can-be-impeached/548144/), so foreign interference during the campaign wouldn't be a constitutionally valid reason.
1.2.4.2.7.1.1. Con: Trump's [wording](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference) in the Helsinki conference indicate that he is currently under the influence of the Russian government.
1.2.4.2.7.1.2. Con: Foreign influence over elections is the same as foreign influence over government. While at glance it appears to treads very finely on the line of Treason, complicity in these facts by a president of the US may be well over that line.
1.2.4.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: Even if Trump used these tactics and general intent by the Russians to [divide our country](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/357344-democrats-dig-for-russian-connection-and-uncover-environmentalists) for their own present and future gains \(in markets or otherwise\), it is the duty of a President to condemn these actions unilaterally, not merely where convenient for his campaign base.
1.2.4.2.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: To personally benefit the few; by exacerbating a [divisive political drama](https://prospect.org/power/trump-takes-dividing-nation-new-level/), while leaving the genuine needs of the entire country by the wayside is a violation of constitutionally defined presidential duties to "[take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed](https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/98/take-care-clause)", where the law in question is the Constitution of the United States or otherwise.
1.2.4.2.7.2. Pro: Former intelligence chief John Brennan [believes Trump committed treason](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/john-brennan-donald-trump-treasonous-vladimir-putin/index.html) by [saying things Brennan didn't like](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-backs-vladimir-putin-against-us-intelligence-agencies-over-election-meddling-claims-11439065) about US intelligence agencies during a press conference with Vladimir Putin.
1.2.4.2.7.2.1. Con: John Brennan is a [political](https://andmagazine.com/us/1527014711.html) [hack](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-08/untold-truth-about-obamas-former-cia-director-john-brennan).
1.2.4.2.7.2.1.1. Con: Part of that is written by [Sam Faddis](https://www.thebaynet.com/articles/0416/arnessorfaddisgettoknowthetwogophousecandidates.html), who happens to be running as a pro-Trump Republican senate candidate for Maryland, and hence hardly constitutes as an impartial source.
1.2.4.2.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Sam Faddis [headed](https://www.hstoday.us/author/sfaddis/) the Counter Terrorism Center \(CTC\)’s Weapons of Mass Destruction unit charged with pursuing terrorist weapons of mass destruction programs worldwide in 2003, specifically in Iraq. That did not turn out too well.
1.2.4.2.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: Sam Faddis has published a book "[Beyond Repair: Decline of the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Repair-Decline-Fall-CIA-ebook/dp/B0030GGFPU/)" attacking the organisation he served and left. While not attacking the people working for it, he believes it needs to be replaced as it cannot do its job. Notably, he is extremely critical and disdainful of non-field agents and the leadership of the CIA.
1.2.4.2.7.2.2. Pro: [Trump](https://www.indy100.com/article/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-remembrance-day-service-ww1-france-macron-merkle-grin-smile-watch-video-8629691) is indeed [very friendly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/thumbs-up-from-putin-as-trump-rains-on-armistice-parade) and [close](https://www.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1439954) with [President Putin](https://www.express.co.uk/videos/563590/Armistice-Day-Putin-gives-Trump-a-thumbs-up-at-memorial), who is otherwise an International Pariah due to the belief he has hacked elections, directed cyber attacks and even authorised the deployment of outlawed and illegal radioactive and chemical weapons on the sovereign soil of other nations.
1.2.4.2.7.3. Pro: Trump's administration has been [caught](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/politics/trump-tower-meeting-donald-jr.html) in several iterations of lies about meetings with Russian agents, first saying they never happened, then that they were about adoption, and later that they were about "getting dirt" on Clinton.
1.2.4.2.7.3.1. Pro: At the [Trump Tower meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting), Trump initially told the press that the meeting was held to discuss adoptions of Russian children by Americans. However, news reports confirmed that the meeting was political, to receive information that was damaging to Hillary Clinton.
1.2.4.2.7.4. Con: Misbehavior by Trump's associates is [not grounds](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4) to impeach him.
1.2.4.2.7.4.1. Con: Trump could be considered to have [imputed knowledge](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=493006020002127025071017092108064122055021026063030057104020113005083029097060027048108120037005112022123076066009029092045044003004021110027094124113065070090080034116069020009122123021118117019118091108070109095122125079113122088093127119099&EXT=pdf) of \(and thus legal liability for\) misdeeds of his subordinates in the course of campaign duties if those misdeeds were done for the benefit of the campaign.
1.2.4.2.7.5. Pro: It is unlikely that Trump would allow his [staff members](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a53134/trump-administration-russia-ties/) to [conspire](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/a-timeline-of-the-trump-russia-scandal-w511067) with [Russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-30/trump-s-ex-campaign-chairman-manafort-told-to-surrender-to-u-s) without his consent.
1.2.4.2.7.5.1. Con: Trump now allowing his staff to conspire does not necessarily mean that the Trump campaign actually did conspire with the Russians.
1.2.4.2.7.5.2. Pro: Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Adviser, [plead guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html) to lying to the FBI.
1.2.4.2.7.5.2.1. Con: The subject of Flynn's lies, interfering with foreign diplomacy, [hasn't been cause for prosecution since the creation of the Logan Act in 1799](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.7d865f68ffce).
1.2.4.2.7.5.2.1.1. Con: Just because a law hasn't needed to be enforced, does not mean that it can be ignored.
1.2.4.2.7.5.2.1.2. Con: Michael Flynn was not being investigated for Logan Act violations, but for collusion with a hostile foreign power.
1.2.4.2.7.5.2.2. Con: Trump fired Flynn [for lying to Pence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-021417/). Unless there is evidence that Trump instructed Flynn to lie to the FBI, Trump is not responsible for the crime.
1.2.4.2.7.5.3. Pro: [Trump tweeted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/02/trump-faces-watergate-era-question-what-did-he-know-when-did-he-know-it/915482001/) suggesting he knew Flynn lied to FBI when he fired him.
1.2.4.2.7.6. Pro: Putin knows that Trump will support Fracking expansions, which include development of new markets for natural gas. These [directly benefit Russia](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-putin-hates-fracking), who can undercut American prices in that market.
1.2.4.2.7.7. Con: There is insufficient evidence of illegal collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia.
1.2.4.2.7.7.1. Pro: Mueller states, "While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was [not sufficient to support criminal charges](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)."
1.2.4.2.7.7.2. Pro: Mueller states, "the [evidence was not sufficient](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal".
1.2.4.2.7.7.3. Pro: Mueller states, "evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks’s [releases of hacked materials was not sufficient](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation."
1.2.4.2.7.7.3.1. Con: [Yet](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/politics/roger-stone-trial-verdict/index.html) [it](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html) [was](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/15/20964909/roger-stone-trial-verdict) [enough](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/15/roger-stone-guilty-verdict-wikileaks-hacking-case-latest-news) [to](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/roger-stone-found-guilty-on-charges-stemming-from-mueller-probe) [secure](https://apnews.com/ad355d2c983e4a7c85bc17e86d8c563f) a [charge](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/trump-friend-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress.html) [against](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/roger-stone-found-guilty-all-seven-counts-n1082326) [Roger Stone.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone) And [other](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-michael-cohen-broke-campaign-finance-law) [evidence](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/politics/trump-cohen-legal-risk/index.html) [was](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/12/michael-cohen-sentencing-campaign-finance-law/) [enough](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-claim-campaign-finance-violations-are-not-crime-attack-ncna904996) to [charge](https://time.com/5556331/mueller-investigation-indictments-guilty-pleas/) [and](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/18/are-trump-hush-money-payments-most-significant-campaign-finance-violation-ever/) [Convict](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html) Michael Cohen of the same.
1.2.4.2.7.7.3.1.1. Con: Stone was convicted of “[process crimes](https://www.dailywire.com/news/roger-stone-convicted-on-all-counts-trump-responds-double-standard)”: five counts of lying to Congress, one count of witness tampering and one count of obstructing a Congressional committee, all related to his attempts to reach out to WikiLeaks in 2016 to get more information on the leaked Democratic emails.
1.2.4.2.7.7.3.1.2. Con: Stone’s alleged attempts to get some type of inside information [highlights the lack of connection](https://www.dailywire.com/news/roger-stone-convicted-on-all-counts-trump-responds-double-standard) between those who hacked the emails and Trump’s associates.
1.2.4.2.7.7.4. Pro: Mueller states, "the [evidence was not sufficient](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election."
1.2.4.2.7.8. Pro: Investigations are usually carried out when there is a suspicion of wrongful/illegal activity. The [Russia Special Counsel Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_\(2017%E2%80%932019\)), therefore, would not have been commissioned and carried through if there was nothing untoward to be suspicious of.
1.2.4.2.7.8.1. Pro: The body of lies, exaggerations, and misleading statements by Trump, which is enormous and [well-documented](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/20/president-trump-made-2140-false-or-misleading-claims-in-his-first-year/?utm_term=.4ff1eded4556), naturally leads one to the conclusion that attempts to obstruct justice are highly likely.
1.2.4.2.7.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.2.4.2.7.8.2. Con: The FISA court recently released a statement accusing the FBI of [providing false information to the Court](https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-fisa-court-releases-statement-blasting-comeys-fbi-for-misconduct-providing-false-information-to-court).
1.2.4.2.7.8.3. Con: Michael Horowitz’s IG report lays out [17](https://www.dailywire.com/news/ig-report-here-are-the-17-specific-inaccuracies-and-omissions-in-the-fbis-fisa-warrants-against-carter-page) “inaccuracies and omissions” that were not brought to the attention of the Office of Intelligence prior to the fourth and last FISA application being filed in June 2017.
1.2.4.2.7.8.4. Pro: [Several members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_\(2017%E2%80%93present\)) of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted as a result of the investigation, which suggests there was more than mere media frenzy to spark the investigation.
1.2.4.2.7.8.4.1. Con: The indictments were not related to the campaign or collusion with Russia.
1.2.4.2.7.8.4.1.1. Con: The [indictment of George Papadopoulos](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download) directly relates to knowing attempted coordination between parts of the campaign and Kremlin operatives.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5. Pro: The previous head of the FBI, Comey, was [dismissed by Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_of_James_Comey#Comey_memos) upon failing to drop enquiries into National Security Advisor Flynn, who later pleaded guilty of lying to the FBI about his links to Russia.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.1. Con: Speculation as to the reason, even though the [Democrats](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-before-trump-fired-fbi-director-james-comey-democrats-wanted-his-dismissal-20170510-story.html) were calling for his dismissal as well before he was actually dismissed.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.1.1. Con: The Democrats who wanted James Comey dismissed wanted it solely because of how he handled the [investigation into Hillary Clinton](https://edition.cnn.com/specials/politics/james-comey-firing). If Trump had wanted to fire Comey for the same reason, he would not have waited six months to do it. Regardless of Trump's reasons, his decision had nothing to do with the Democrats' opposition to Comey.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.1.1.1. Pro: Trump once [praised James Comey](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/trump-democrats-change-position-on-comey/index.html) for his handling of the Clinton email case.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Trump criticized [Comey](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/factchecking-trumps-criticism-fbi/) and highliged several things he felt were done wrong
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.1.1.2. Con: Given the nature of investigations, the news media's opinions and what is public, it is understandable that it took 6 months for Trump to get enough information to make the decision.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.2. Con: Incidents like Comey's mishandling of the  [Clinton e-mail scandal](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/363194-former-fbi-agent-changed-comeys-language-of-clinton-email-use-to), amongst [other shortcomings](https://texasscribbler.com/2017/05/12/comeys-failures/) were more than likely justification for the decision to fire him as they became known.
1.2.4.2.7.8.5.2.1. Con: Trump has admitted that [Comey's handling](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/giuliani-trump-fired-comey-because-he-wouldnt-tell-him-he-wasnt-a-target.html) of the investigation into Flynn and the whole [Russia conspiracy](https://themoscowproject.org/collusion/trump-cites-russia-investigation-motive-firing-comey/) was foremost on [his mind](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/politics/trump-comey-russia-investigation/index.html) when he fired him.
1.2.4.2.7.8.6. Con: The investigation was created out of conspiracy theories that were constructed through political organizations \([DNC Emails](https://nypost.com/2017/10/26/how-team-hillary-played-the-press-for-fools-on-russia/)\), essentially creating a conflict of interest for self investigation and a political catch 22 which only had the option to allow a special counsel.
1.2.4.2.7.9. Con: "Collusion" is very much in the eye of the beholder.
1.2.4.2.7.9.1. Con: Collusion is not in the eye of the beholder at all. It is a provable pattern of interaction, communication, and efforts to reach a goal common to the parties in collusion.
1.2.4.2.7.9.2. Pro: It could be argued that politics is full of collusion and is therefore effectively no different to anything the Democrats did.
1.2.4.2.7.9.2.1. Pro: Democrats are equally guilty of collusion, after coordinating with the chair of the democratic national committee to receive [pre-debate information](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/07/donna-brazile-is-totally-not-sorry-for-leaking-cnn-debate-questions-to-hillary-clinton/?utm_term=.92d65c8dd789) to help prepare for it.
1.2.4.2.7.9.2.2. Con: Collusion itself is not a crime. [However](https://globalnews.ca/news/4362409/is-collusion-a-crime/), [working with a foreign powe](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/31/17634146/trump-collusion-crime-russia-mueller)r to sway an election is a crime in both campaign finance, election fraud, hacking, and even wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which actually meets the standards for treason.
1.2.4.2.7.9.2.2.1. Pro: If someone sought “dirt” on a candidate from the Russians \(a foreign power\), he might be charged with conspiring to violate the election laws of the United States, which prohibit foreign nationals from contributing any “thing of value” to an electoral campaign.
1.2.4.2.7.9.2.2.2. Pro: Although the term Collusion is often used, and itself is [not a legally recognised crime](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/12/what-is-collusion-215366), the actual legal term would be "conspiracy", which is indeed a crime.
1.2.4.2.7.10. Pro: Trump [publicly asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UutkJGJaMxE) for Russian help to hack Clinton at a rally.
1.2.4.2.7.10.1. Con: Candidate Trump [stated](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would “find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” This is not a formal request to Russia.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2. Con: [Experts agree that](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/hillary-clintons-email-was-probably-hacked-experts-say.html) Clinton's private server had probably been hacked by Russia. Trump was speaking on this when he made his remark. The only possible way Russia could find the emails is if they had previously hacked Clinton's server. Asking Russia to return stolen information is not the same as asking them to steal.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1. Con: Asking them, a foreign power, to publicly disclose them, to boost or improve his own campaign, would be a violation of [campaign contribution laws](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45320.html), which prohibit a foreign power from making any substantial contribution to a electoral campaign.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.1. Con: In-kind contributions are ["Goods or services offered free or at less than the usual charge"](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/types-contributions/). There is no usual charge for the release of politically damaging information.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.1.1. Con: Politically damaging information on an opponent has been deemed to be a valuable commodity, by the [bodies](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/14/18677631/trump-campaign-finance-law-fec-illegal-fbi) [responsible](https://campaignlegal.org/update/yes-president-trump-violated-campaign-finance-law-asking-ukraine-favor) for the [laws](https://billmoyers.com/story/violating-certain-campaign-finance-laws-criminal-offenses/).
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The Justice Department feels that nothing the President has asked for has any [substantive value](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/justice-department-trump-call-ukraine-thing-value).
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Justice department's own definition contradicts itself, as it lists information as a [valuable asset](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/justice-department-trump-call-ukraine-thing-value), along with other items of no determinate value.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.2. Con: Mueller determined, "The investigation [did not find evidence](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) that the Trump Campaign recovered any such Clinton emails, or that these contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign."
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3. Con: To [solicit](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/300.2) a request, Trump must "request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value." Trump's public statement which is about what he hopes Russia will do does not amount to this standard.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1. Con: Trump [asked](https://www.scribd.com/document/427409665/Ukraine-Call-Transcript#from_embed) President Zelensyy of Ukraine in a [July 25, 2019 phone call](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-transcript-read-ukraine-president-phone-call-transcript-pdf-released-today-joe-biden-crowdstrike-2019-09-25/) to investigate Joe Biden, his most prominent political opponent.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Trump illegally pressurized a foreign leader to [investigate Biden and his son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyWNFvt9Fck&app=desktop), thereby indicating that Trump has reason to distrust Biden, his opponent. The investigation is highly problematic as it presents Trump as manipulating foreign affairs to provide him with a more favourable position in the re-election.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The legality of Trump’s request depends on intent. Intent to attack a political opponent has not been proven.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Through their inquiry, Democrats have provided one witness close enough to Trump to indicate intent: Gordon Sondland. He gave no indication in his [testimony](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6540439-Gordon-Sondland-transcript.html#text/p7) that Trump was out to get the Bidens, merely to get the Bidens.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Foreign nations cannot influence US elections merely by investigations. If Trump asked Zelensyy for an investigation, it is likely that he would have wanted something in return.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Foreign nations can influence internal policies, and influence American elections. The special counsel found that Russia did interfere with the [2016 presidential election](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2019/03/mueller-concludes-investigation/).
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: A quid pro quo is [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo) and is often used as a diplomatic tool.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.2.3. Con: [Withholding Congressionally approved](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7818277/Trump-administration-froze-Ukraine-aid-91-minutes-president-asked-Zelensky-investigations.html) and ear-marked funds from an ally, while simultaneously [asking for something in return](https://www.countable.us/articles/40058-ukraine-aid-freeze-ordered-91-minutes-trump-s-call-zelensky) and[actively trying to hide the act from Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/23/new-evidence-impeachment-keeps-turning-up-thats-why-we-need-witnesses/), a co-equal branch of the Government, is impeachable, as it rises to the level of abuse of power.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.3. Con: Trump asked President Zelenskyy to investigate the Bidens as [part of a broader inquiry](https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-complete-timeline-of-the-trump-ukraine-story) into Ukraine corruption. Just because this could possibly help Trump politically does not absolve him from his sworn duty to protect our laws by discovering corruption and interference in U.S.elections.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.2. Con: Trump has requested a "favour" directly from the Ukrainian president with regards to investigating, supporting and promoting a conspiracy theory, namely that Ukraine, not Russia, [meddled in the US elections](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/23/politics/ukraine-meddling-debunked-conspiracy-theory/index.html) and hacked the DNC server.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.3. Con: Trump went on [national](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49924579) [television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nze9xJjElQQ) and [urged](https://www.axios.com/lindsey-graham-trump-china-ukraine-impeachment-a94c87c9-bce0-4e79-9a33-02b15e94af43.html) [China](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/trump-biden-china-investigation-demand) to [open an](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-china-bidens.html) [investigation](https://apnews.com/c4fc388b22f549e0a67925cab8cd7e93) into one of his [political](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/trump-calls-for-ukraine-china-to-investigate-the-bidens.html) [opponents and rivals](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trump-encourages-china-investigate-biden-family-clouding-trade-talks).
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Stating that "China should start an investigation into the Bidens" is not the same as making an explicit or implicit request.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Given that Trump has declared official policy using Twitter \([e.g. anti-trans military member ban](https://twitter.com/i/moments/890200249884651520?lang=en)\), his statements made on National Television should be taken more seriously.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Making a speech on National, and indeed International television, where those you "hope" will or "should" do something will overhear, is, psychologically, tantamount to implicitly making a request.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.2. Pro: Trump's [exact quote was](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-e-mail-server-turned-over-to-fbi/2015/08/12/aba5feea-4160-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html?utm_term=.3cb5d508306e), "I hope that you are able to find the 30K emails that are missing." When the quote was made the servers were already offline and in possession of the FBI .
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.3. Con: There's no such thing as "returning stolen information". Trump didn't ask Russia to destroy the stolen information, he asked for a [copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFG5vBg45qs).
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.3.1. Con: Expressing general hopes that you opponent will be damaged by leaked information is not the same as requesting the entity with the information to leak it.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.3.1.1. Con: Trumps exact quote does not [reflect a simple hope](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/reviewing-trumps-call-russian-hacking-after-mueller/585838/), but rather an arrangement if it should come to pass.
1.2.4.2.7.10.2.4. Con: Trump did not ask Russia to return stolen information. He made no formal request to Russia related to these emails.
1.2.4.2.7.11. Pro: If the election was tampered with, he may truly be an illegitimate president.
1.2.4.2.7.11.1. Con: Election tampering would not have occurred at a time when Trump was President. As impeachable conduct can only occur within the scope of the Office of the Presidency, such tampering, even if discovered, would likely not be impeachable.
1.2.4.2.7.11.2. Con: "Tampering" would be preventing votes from being cast or counted, or casting and counting illegal votes. There is no evidence to suggest that occurred. A "misinformed" vote is still a legal vote.
1.2.4.3. Pro: The constitution states its goal to "[form a more perfect Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution)" and Trump has both failed to achieve this and worked against this goal.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Lying to the American public subverts Justice, and divides the Union by [polarizing the political divide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/).
1.2.4.4. Pro: The US Constitution states its goal is to "[establish Justice](http://x24xlaceyx24x.tripod.com/id1.html)". Trump has not only failed to achieve this, but also worked against this goal.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Trump's communication encourages [discrimination](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hate-on-the-rise-after-trumps-election) of women and minorities amongst the American population.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: The link in the parent claim cites statistics gathered by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/reminder-the-southern-poverty-law-center-is-a-fraud-and-nobody-should-treat-them-as-responsible-actors/article/2631852), a political action group well known for its left leaning bias.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: The SPLC is allegedly a hate group itself.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The SPLC hate list has [inspired violence](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/17/southern-poverty-law-center-hate-groups-scam-column/2022301001/).
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In 2012, [a terrorist used the smear factory's "hate map"](https://pjmedia.com/trending/splcs-hate-group-accusation-outed-as-a-scam-more-than-60-groups-considering-lawsuits/) to target the Family Research Council \(FRC\), aiming to kill everyone in the building and place a Chick-Fil-A sandwich by their heads.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The mere fact that an organization publishes information does not make the organization morally or legally culpable for the acts of a party who chooses to utilize that information for violent purposes.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: According to The Progressive's John Egerton, [SPLC co-founder Morris Dees](https://pjmedia.com/trending/splcs-hate-group-accusation-outed-as-a-scam-more-than-60-groups-considering-lawsuits/) "viewed civil-rights work mainly as a marketing tool for bilking gullible Northern liberals."
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The parent claim is merely the citation of an opinion.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: Former SPLC spokesman Mark Potok said, "I want to say plainly that our aim in life is to [destroy these groups](https://pjmedia.com/trending/splcs-hate-group-accusation-outed-as-a-scam-more-than-60-groups-considering-lawsuits/), completely destroy them."
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Wanting to destroy hate groups does not make an organization a hate group.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.4. Pro: Clare Locke LLP secured an unprecedented $3.375 million settlement from the Southern Poverty Law Center, Inc. on behalf of British Muslim reformer Maajid Nawaz and the Quilliam Foundation [based on false and defamatory statements](http://clarelocke.com/our-cases/maajid-nawaz/) in the SPLC’s Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5. Pro: SPLC has a history of labeling non-hate groups as hate groups.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: In 2010, SPLC added the conservative [Family Research Council](https://townhall.com/columnists/joshgoldstein/2017/07/26/splc-hate-group-n2360208) to its list of hate groups.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: The Family Research Council [baldly states that it is homophobic](https://www.frc.org/homosexuality).
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: In early 2015, SPLC added Dr. [Ben Carson](https://townhall.com/columnists/joshgoldstein/2017/07/26/splc-hate-group-n2360208) to its list of hate groups.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Ben Carson has made [numerous homophobic statements](https://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Ben_Carson_Civil_Rights.htm).
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: On Sean Hannity's TV show , Carson [compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality](https://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Ben_Carson_Civil_Rights.htm), sparking the outrage of the LGBT+ community.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Ben Carson claims that the term "marriage" [should not be extended](https://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Ben_Carson_Civil_Rights.htm) to same-sex couples.
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.2.1.3. Pro: Ben Carson told CNN's Chris Cuomo that being gay is ["absolutely" a choice](https://www.advocate.com/election/2015/10/29/7-things-ben-carson-believes-are-not-homophobic), because “A lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight — and when they come out, they’re gay.”
1.2.4.4.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an atheist, feminist, and former Muslim [who speaks out against female genital mutilation](https://townhall.com/columnists/joshgoldstein/2017/07/26/splc-hate-group-n2360208), was added to the SPLC hate list in recent years.
1.2.4.4.1.2. Pro: Trump was invoked in [20% of hate crimes](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/saalt-hate-crimes-report_us_5a7390fee4b01ce33eb12ae4) against South Asians and Middle Easterners.
1.2.4.4.1.2.1. Con: SAALT relies on an "[online database](http://saalt.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Communities-on-Fire.pdf) on...\[SAALT's\]...website populated by a variety of methods, including internet news searches, action alerts and announcements by ally organizations, community members, and media watchdog entities." In essence, they built a database from biased media and organizations similar to themselves and are calling it authoritative.
1.2.4.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: SAALT's database relies on "[members of the public](http://saalt.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Communities-on-Fire.pdf) ...\[submitting\]...incidents on this crowd-sourced database." Thus there is no verification of these accounts and they are most likely to be submitted by users who agree with the perspectives of SAALT.
1.2.4.4.1.2.2. Con: SAALT [self-defines](http://saalt.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Communities-on-Fire.pdf) "the term “xenophobic political rhetoric” represents biased language by those in positions of power or influence such as elected officials, public figures, law enforcement agents, hate groups, and mass media. Biased language includes any racist, antiimmigrant, and anti-Muslim rhetoric." This is ambiguous and vague and unreliable for analysis purposes.
1.2.4.4.1.2.3. Con: SAALT gives hundreds of examples of alleged hate speech against their constituents. However, while Trump is invoked in some and these are specifically referenced in their appendices, [Trump is not invoked in anywhere close to 1 in 5 incidents](http://saalt.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Communities-on-Fire.pdf).
1.2.4.4.1.3. Pro: Trump's rhetoric against such groups have increased [discrimination](https://bigthink.com/brandon-weber/dog-whistles-indeed-twitter-encourages-hate-crimes-study-shows) against them in the US. This violates the standard of justice within the US.
1.2.4.4.1.3.1. Pro: According to [FBI data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/03/23/hate-crimes-rose-the-day-after-trump-was-elected-fbi-data-show/?utm_term=.db02185c21bd), hate crimes rose the day after Trump was elected.
1.2.4.4.1.3.1.1. Con: The source used admits the same happened after Obama was elected.
1.2.4.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: During Obama's administration, however, the [number](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2008) of hate crime offenses overall [fell](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses); during Trump's administration, the number of offenses [overall](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2018/topic-pages/incidents-and-offenses) [rose](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2017/topic-pages/incidents-and-offenses).
1.2.4.4.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There is little evidence that increases in hate crimes are connected to political rhetoric. It may account for specific incidents \(e.g. specific mass shootings where the intentions of shooter are known and a political influence is mentioned\); however, we can’t conclude that political rhetoric is the sole reason for increases/decreases in hate crimes.
1.2.4.4.1.3.2. Con: Influential Twitter users have a right to free speech as much as anyone else.
1.2.4.4.1.3.3. Con: Unless speakers explicitly call for violence against a certain group, their speech should not be an impeachable offense.
1.2.4.4.1.3.3.1. Pro: [Maxine Waters](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/maxine-waters-political-violence/) should be impeached for saying, "If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”
1.2.4.4.1.3.3.2. Con: Bernie Sanders [should not be removed from office](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/homepage2/james-hodgkinson-profile/index.html) because one of his supporters went on a shooting rampage.
1.2.4.4.1.3.3.3. Con: Elizabeth Warren and Aelexandria Ocasio-Cortez [should not be impeached](https://www.dailywire.com/news/dayton-attacker-was-hardcore-leftist-pro-warren-ryan-saavedra) because the Dayton, Ohio shooter was influenced by them.
1.2.4.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.4.4.1.3.3.
1.2.4.4.1.5. Pro: Many of Trump's Tweets and comments encourage discrimination against women and minorities.
1.2.4.4.1.5.1. Pro: Trump has told a group of four minority congresswomen that they should “[go back](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-squad-congress.html)” to the countries they came from, rather than “loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States” how to run the government.
1.2.4.4.1.5.2. Pro: Trump has a history of making discriminatory and controversial comments [against](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50563106) women.
1.2.4.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: Trump has made remarks about grabbing a [woman's genitals](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50563106) without her [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape), which was recorded on the Access Hollywood Tape.
1.2.4.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: Referring to Rosie O'Donnell, Trump [commented](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50563106): "She's a slob. How does she even get on television? If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and say, 'Rosie, you're fired.'"
1.2.4.4.1.5.2.3. Con: Trump has a history of making controversial insults against [everyone](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/249102-trumps-most-notable-insults). Women are not necessarily a special target of Trump.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Politifact rating suggests Trump has [lied to the American people](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/). If the people do not know the truth then they may accept injustice.
1.2.4.4.2.1. Pro: Truth and Justice are the [American way](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/442233-what-would-superman-say-truth-justice-and-the-american-way-trump-era), and also inextricably linked. Without the truth there is no capacity for justice.
1.2.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Lies spread and peoples' minds become less open to new information as they age. The spread of lies has a long lasting and negative effect on the ability of the American people to identify injustice and make choices that are fair to themselves and others.
1.2.4.4.2.2. Pro: Trump claims the impeachment process [is an attack on democracy itself](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/impeachment-move-by-democrats-an-attack-on-american-democracy-donald-trump/articleshow/71862037.cms). This is factually inaccurate.
1.2.4.4.2.2.1. Pro: Impeachment is part of the [democratic process](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Impeachment/) in the United States and written into the Constitution.
1.2.4.4.2.3. Con: Lying to the American people is an unreasonable standard for impeachment at any level of government.
1.2.4.4.2.3.1. Pro: If the standard to be in office included never lying to the American people, then nearly every politician in office would have to be ejected.
1.2.4.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: There are crowdsourced lists of politicians with thousands of votes indicating that many people [feel lied to by politicians](https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/lying-politicians-the-worst-liars-in-american-politics).
1.2.4.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Fact checking sites clearly illustrate [lying](https://www.factcheck.org/party-lines/) by politicians [on all sides](https://www.factcheck.org/tag/2020-election/) is the norm.
1.2.4.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: Public trust in the government [remains near historic lows](https://www.people-press.org/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/). Only 17% of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right “just about always” \(3%\) or “most of the time” \(14%\).
1.2.4.4.3. Pro: [Obstruction of Justice](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/obstruction-of-justice-10-times-trump-may-have-obstructed-justice-mueller-report/) is only one of the many ways that Trump has undermined the laws within the constitution.
1.2.4.5. Pro: The US constitution states its goal to "[promote the general welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_welfare_clause)" and Trump has both failed to achieve this and worked against this goal.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: Trump has made political promises to make women's health services less accessible, and [has followed through](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-trumps-change-to-title-x-funding-means-fewer-health-choices-for-women) on these promises.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: Trump nominated [former Coal Industry lobbyist as EPA administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pruitt). Under this watch, he revoked a rule that prevented coal companies from dumping mining debris into local streams.
1.2.4.5.2.1. Pro: Trump has [weakened federal rules](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html) regulating the disposal and storage of coal ash waste from power plants, and more relevant revocations of protections designed to promote the general welfare of the public.
1.2.4.5.3. Pro: Trump's EPA [narrowed the scope of a 2016 law mandating safety assessments](https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-epa-is-undermining-new-law-to-regulate-chemicals/) for potentially toxic chemicals.
1.2.4.5.3.1. Pro: Trump's [EPA rejected a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos](https://www.ucsusa.org/ignoring-scientific-evidence-dangerous-pesticide-chlorpyrifos), a pesticide linked to developmental disabilities in children.
1.2.4.5.4. Pro: Trump announced his intent to [stop payments to the Green Climate Fund](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/31100/20161103/trump-administration-cancel-billions-payment-uns-green-climate-fund.htm), a United Nations program to help poorer countries reduce carbon emissions.
1.2.4.6. Pro: The US Constitution [states](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68-2.htm) its goal to "secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity" and Trump has both failed to achieve this and worked against this goal.
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: Trump has [left](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/05/paris-climate-agreement-united-states-withdraw/) the Paris Climate Agreement.
1.2.4.6.2. Pro: Trump has [rolled back environmental protections](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html).
1.2.4.7. Con: Trump is not the first President to violate some aspect of the oath sworn to the Constitution, therefore his actions are not grounds for Impeachment.
1.2.4.7.1. Con: While the oath is sworn "[to the best of my \[a\]bility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States)", this does not excuse repeated systematic and unapologetic violations of constitutional principles; that are the President's promises to defend for the people.
1.2.4.7.2. Pro: Many of America's greatest presidents [violated](https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/these-are-the-presidents-who-violated-the-constitution-and-how-donald-trump-compares.html/) the Constitution.
1.2.4.7.2.1. Pro: If the grounds presented are impeachable, then most if not all presidents ought to have been impeached, or better yet, tried for crimes.
1.2.4.7.2.2. Pro: During the first year of the Civil War, while riots were occurring in border states, [Lincoln suspended](https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/these-are-the-presidents-who-violated-the-constitution-and-how-donald-trump-compares.html/) habeas corpus and allowed “the indefinite detention of ‘disloyal persons’ without trial.” This goes against the US Constitution's [right to fair trial](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/fair-trial).
1.2.4.7.2.2.1. Con: This was also done during [World War 2 to Japanese Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans). [Very](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/george-takei-family-separation-op-ed/index.html) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=AqfGE9r5h5s) [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLvLhy1RUQ) consider it, with the benefit of hindsight, to be a [good move](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/george-takei-japanese-internment-americas-great-mistake.html) or one that the [nation should be proud of](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-08-22/george-takei-they-called-us-enemy-memoir-japanese-internment).
1.2.4.7.2.2.2. Con: Just because something was done, does not make it right or a good thing. This fundamentally fails to say if this was a positive or negative action and it could equally be argued to be the latter, and a stain on Lincoln's reputation.
1.2.4.7.2.2.3. Con: "The Constitution...[explicitly grants](https://www.usnews.com/news/history/articles/2009/02/10/revoking-civil-liberties-lincolns-constitutional-dilemma) the government the power to suspend habeas corpus 'in cases of rebellion or invasion".
1.2.4.7.2.3. Pro: President John Adams helped pass the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, which [made it illegal](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1238/sedition-act-of-1798) for publications to publish “false, scandalous, and malicious writing" against Congress or the president.
1.2.4.7.2.4. Con: This is a whataboutism. Just because someone was considered great, does not mean that all of their actions were always right or correct.
1.2.4.8. Pro: Trump's actions are detrimental to American national security interests.
1.2.4.8.1. Pro: Trump has jeopordized national security by withholding resources from Ukraine that would have been used to resist Russia's [invasion into the Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_\(2014%E2%80%93present\)).
1.2.4.8.1.1. Pro: The security of the United States is improved by resisting Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
1.2.4.8.1.1.1. Pro: Russia's invasion jeopardizes the acceptance of borders as set down after WWII. Resisting Russia's [extra-legal change to borders](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016b-a5a1-d241-adff-fdf908e00001) supports the status quo that has produced 75 years of peace in Europe.
1.2.4.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: If there is a war in Europe, the United States will likely be pulled into the war, as it was in WWII. The cost of war to the US would be much higher than the cost of maintaining the status quo. Thus, it is in the US national interest to support institutions and processes that prevent extra-legal border changes.
1.2.4.8.1.1.1.2. Con: On [19 February 1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea#Region_in_Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_\(1954%E2%80%931991\)), the USSR by decree transferred the Crimean region to the Ukrainian SSR, stating that the transfer was motivated by "the commonality of the economy, the proximity, and close economic and cultural relations between the Crimean region and the Ukrainian SSR". The legitimacy of the transfer has been questioned by scholars, as no vote or referendum took place. The transfer may have contradicted even the Soviet law.
1.2.4.8.1.2. Con: [According](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2019/09/30/the-milley-hyten-era-begins-483340) to the Secretary of defense, And at no time or at any time has any delay in this money, this funding, affected U.S. national security.”
1.2.4.8.2. Pro: Trump has violated constitutional law by excepting [ZTE](https://fortune.com/2018/06/13/zte-trump-china-heres-fuss-all-about/) and [Trump Towers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/donald-trump-s-longtime-business-connections-turkey-back-spotlight-n1064011), which have led to choices that compromised the strength of the US in the eyes of the world.
1.2.4.8.3. Con: Illegal immigration [threatens the national security](https://roe.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=3ZEAOEXCBW2VHJBF54NWBJKB5A) of Americans in the US.
1.2.4.8.3.1. Con: The term illegal is used far too often in reference to people seeking asylum, especially in the [last four years](https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/12/03/asylum-explainer).
1.2.4.9. Pro: Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice.
1.2.4.9.1. Pro: Trump obstructed justice by [dictating Don Jr](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/02/us/politics/trump-legal-documents.html).’s misleading statement about the June 9 Trump Tower meeting.  The dictation of the statement was admitted by Trump’s own lawyers in their letter to the Mueller team.
1.2.4.9.2. Pro: Donald Trump [committed obstruction of justice](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/flynns-plea-raises-new-questions-about-whether-trump-obstructed-justice/547328/) by asking the FBI not to investigate Michael Flynn. It is therefore likely that Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI about the campaign's contact with Russian officials, but still suggested that the FBI drop its investigation.
1.2.4.9.2.1. Pro: The obstruction statute does not require the person doing the obstruction to know that the person under investigation is guilty, but such knowledge strengthens an obstruction case. Evidence of such a knowledge, in this case, is based on [Trump's tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/937007006526959618) that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI and that's why he fired him.
1.2.4.9.2.2. Pro: The fact that Trump told FBI director James Comey to drop the Flynn investigation is confirmed by [Comey’s contemporaneous memos](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4442900-Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-s-memos.html).
1.2.4.9.2.3. Con: President Trump has not obstructed investigation on Flynn. The investigation [has not stopped](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-tells-congress-fbi-currently-looking-into-issues-of-trump-blackmail).
1.2.4.9.2.3.1. Con: The obstruction statute is about [attempts to obstruct justice](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1503), it does not require an investigation to actually be stopped.
1.2.4.9.2.3.2. Pro: It is [Muller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_\(2017%E2%80%93present\)), not Comey, who was directly running the investigation into Flynn's actions.
1.2.4.9.2.3.2.1. Con: The investigation nevertheless fell within Comey's jurisdiction, for he was [the director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey) of the organisation conducting the investigation.
1.2.4.9.2.3.2.2. Con: Mueller was not appointed at the time. Mueller was only appointed by Rod Rosenstein [after Trump fired](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download) Comey. So when Trump told Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, he was talking to the person overseeing it.
1.2.4.9.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: In fact, part of the reason that Mueller was appointed was because of reports that Trump had told Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.
1.2.4.9.2.4. Con: The view posted here is an opinion that does not align with [Comey's](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/02/531116018/did-james-comey-lie-about-interference-in-the-russia-investigation) own testimony related to the matter, where he stated he was not pressured or asked to stop the investigation. The accusations are based on politics and not the standing or commentary from the individual under consideration.
1.2.4.9.2.4.1. Con: [Comey's testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html) suggests that Trump told him "I hope you can let this \[- the investigation into Flynn - \] go", which can be read as a thinly-veiled request that the investigation be dropped.
1.2.4.9.2.4.2. Con: Comey [was speaking about](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/06/context-james-comeys-past-comments-interference-fb/) whether or not he was being pressured by senior officials in the Department of Justice, not about the President of the United States.
1.2.4.9.2.5. Con: A president can not be charged for exercising his constitutionally granted powers.  [This includes firing subordinates for any reason or no reason at all.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers_v._United_States)
1.2.4.9.2.5.1. Con: It is true that Trump had the constitutional authority to end the Flynn investigation and to fire Comey. But exercising one's constitutional authority for a corrupt purpose [can still run afoul of various federal laws](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/presidential-obstruction-of-justice-the-case-of-donald-j-trump-final.pdf), including obstruction statutes.
1.2.4.9.3. Pro: Trump has attempted obstruction of [investigations into his behavior](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mueller-report-couldnt-be-more-clear-donald-trump-repeatedly-tried-to-obstruct-justice).
1.2.4.9.3.1. Pro: The [Mueller report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) provides substantial [evidence](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/what-the-mueller-report-says-about-obstruction/) of such an obstruction of justice.
1.2.4.9.3.1.1. Con: The Muller report came up with [no wrongdoing](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/24/706318191/trump-white-house-hasnt-seen-or-been-briefed-on-mueller-investigation-report).
1.2.4.9.3.1.1.1. Con: Mueller declares his Russia report [did not exonerate Trump](https://apnews.com/94323cfc164c4759ba6bf84ad2a46203)
1.2.4.9.4. Pro: Trump has repeatedly interfered with investigations alleging Russian involvement with the US.
1.2.4.9.4.1. Pro: It is argued that Trump [interfered with the investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/20/us/politics/russia-interference-election-trump-clinton.html) of the Russian Hack of the 2016 election.
1.2.4.9.4.1.1. Con: An appearance of interference is not proof of interference.
1.2.4.9.4.1.1.1. Con: An appearance of interference is sufficient grounds to investigate underlying circumstances and assess whether a legal criminal case for obstruction of justice is appropriate
1.2.4.9.4.2. Pro: Trump admitted to firing Comey because of the Russia investigation in an [interview with Lester Holt](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia).
1.2.4.9.4.2.1. Pro: Trump obstructed justice by [threatening Comey](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/12/trump-threatens-comey-secretly-recorded-tapes-conversations/) to stay silent about his conversations with Trump with the specter of tapes of their conversations. Comey’s conversations with Trump are evidence of obstruction of justice on Trump’s part, so Trump was obstructing an obstruction investigation into him.
1.2.4.9.4.2.2. Pro: Trump’s lawyer [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/03/trump-fire-comey-reason-rudy-giuliani-566043) told Sean Hannity that Trump “fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.  He’s entitled to that. Hillary Clinton got that and he couldn’t get that. So he fired him and he said, ‘I’m free of this guy.’"
1.2.4.9.4.2.3. Pro: The [original draft](https://www.wsj.com/article_email/trump-drafted-letter-on-why-he-wanted-comey-out-1504303851-lMyQjAxMTA3MTA1MTcwNTE1Wj/) of Trump’s letter firing Comey makes clear that the reason for the firing was the Russia investigation.
1.2.4.9.4.2.4. Pro: The official White House [minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-comey.html) of Trump’s Oval Office meeting with the Russian ambassador and Russian foreign minister say that Trump told them “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
1.2.4.9.4.3. Pro: Trump obstructed justice by [forcing Rosenstein](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-orders-doj-campaign-infiltrated/story?id=55309163) to disclose certain details about confidential human sources in the Russia investigation to Devin Nunes and other House Republicans.
1.2.4.9.5. Pro: President Trump has obstructed Congress by not turning over emails and documents to the house related to Ukraine, and by not allowing key witnesses such as Mulvaney and Pompeo and others to [testify](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/10/us/politics/articles-impeachment-document-pdf.html).
1.2.5. Con: Merely an attempt to institute a policy that is found by the courts to contravene the Constitution is not a principal to guide a decision on whether to impeach or not. If a president faced possible impeachment, he would avoid policies where legal opinion is uncertain of constitutionality, reducing creative policy development.
1.2.5.1. Con: The Constitution is the [supreme law of the land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause). To violate these principles constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors. To fail to impeach when the president violates his promise to uphold the Constitution screams of injustice and corruption.
1.2.6. Pro: Trump has twice violated [Article II](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-ii/article-ii-section-3-by-saikrishna-prakash/clause/38) of the Constitution, which requires the President to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed", by failing to execute bills passed by Congress to their legal letter.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Trump [changed](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/10/17/16489526/take-care-clause-obamacare-trump-sabotage-aca-illegal) his enforcement of the ACA in an avowed attempt to destroy the law.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Trump [failed to institute](https://www.thedailybeast.com/congress-trump-wont-implement-russia-sanctionsand-he-wont-tell-us-why) any of the sanctions against Russia that were passed by Congress and signed by Trump in early August.
1.2.6.3. Con: While this is true and certainly a good reason for Congress to impeach a President, we have seen the same behavior from the last several Presidents who blatantly refuse to enforce laws with which they disagree. Impeaching a President now, based on this behavior would be a stunning change in precedence.
1.2.6.4. Con: Congress passed the bills associated with [ACA](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-senate-tax-reform-bill-health-care-impact-2017-12) that impacted it. Trump's actions were only related to [EO's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/healthcare/), which he is authorized/legally allowed to override.
1.2.7. Pro: Trump's [actions](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aclu-donald-trump-constitution_us_57878e2be4b08608d3331493) have [repeatedly](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/2016-donald-trump-constitution-guide-unconstitutional-freedom-liberty-khan-214139) [been](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/donald-trump-one-man-constitutional-crisis) [found](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/367911-publisher-trump-effort-to-stop-book-flagrantly-unconstitutional) to [violate](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/politics/4th-circuit-travel-ban/index.html) the [U.S. Constitution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/11/21/federal-court-rules-that-trumps-executive-order-targeting-sanctuary-cities-is-unconstitutional/) by [numerous federal courts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-court-of-appeals.html), and he has generally shown a disregard for the [rule of law](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2017/08/25/trumps-pardon-of-sheriff-arpaio-could-spark-a-constitutional-crisis/#1f558699351e).
1.2.8. Pro: The Muslim Ban, for instance, is [argued](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trumps-ban-on-muslims-is_b_8804284) to be [unconstitutional](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-travel-ban-still-unconstitutional).
1.2.8.1. Pro: A Federal District Court and two Federal Appeals Courts have ruled that [the ban is illegal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-court-of-appeals.html), one of which was on the basis that it broke the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: The federal court did not rule it was illegal. They ruled in favor of a [TRO \(Temporary Restraining Order\)](https://www.lawfareblog.com/judge-issues-temporary-restraining-order-against-proclamation-barring-uninsured-immigrants), based on a stay/hold of implementation pending review over comments and requests. In addition, the TRO expired and the ban was allowed to progress for this reason.
1.2.8.2. Con: The citation presented is from an unreliable source. It is declared a "Muslim ban" which is incorrect. It [banned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states/) all people from several; countries that could not vet individuals wishing to enter the U.S. A "Muslim ban" would have included many other Muslim countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, & etc.. It did not.
1.2.8.3. Con: The Muslim "Ban" is a temporary halt on immigration and [Section 1182](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182) of the Constitution gives him the power to do such.
1.2.8.4. Con: The term "Muslim Ban" is incorrect and used by the political left to vilify the president. He placed a [ban on all travel to and from several countries](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court-decision-countries-map/). Despite the President's personal views towards the religion, there is nothing in his executive order that targets Muslims.
1.2.8.5. Con: The Supreme Court has [upheld the ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html) temporarily until they can come to a conclusion. This in and of itself suggests the President has a strong case for the executive order to be upheld.
1.2.8.6. Con: Issuing executive orders that are found to be unconstitutional is not a crime.
1.2.8.6.1. Pro: [FDR, Bill Clinton, and Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_\(United_States\)) have all issued executive orders that were subsequently overturned. While enforcing an overturned EO is certainly legally dubious, issuing executive orders is well within the President's purview.
1.3. Pro: Allowing Trump's alleged misconduct to continue without consequences sets a dangerously poor precedent for future leaders of the country.
1.3.1. Pro: A president's unchecked misconduct also pertains to the [25th amendment to the US Constitution](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). To allow unchecked what 70,000 mental health professionals regard as narcissistic personality disorder as to [Trump’s behaviour](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump) sets a precedent that any future President need not be held to the 25th Amendment. Such a President might be able to use the authority of their office to personally retaliate for perceived slights, such as failure to be named Person of the Year.
1.3.2. Pro: If Trump cannot be impeached for his abuse of power, Congress is unlikely to ever hold another president accountable.
1.3.3. Pro: This was one of the arguments the Republican party put forth during the [impeachment of Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton).
1.3.4. Con: Allegations are not a reason to engage in a very serious Constitutional solution of impeachment. The real danger is that future leaders will be victimized by unproven allegations, rather than fact-based investigative conclusions.
1.4. Con: Trump becoming impeached could cause more uproar than it is probably worth. It could simply be left up to the people again to decide if he should be in office or not at the next elections.
1.4.1. Con: Allowing the people to decide will not always work, due to the electoral college system. The majority of the people might want him impeached, but a [smaller number might](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote#2016:_Donald_Trump) [still re-elect him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election).
1.4.2. Con: The uproar should not outweigh the merits and need for justice and accountability. Doing so allows a demagogue to gain a foothold and sets a bad precedent and example for future incumbents of the office.
1.4.3. Pro: After the [division of the 2016 election](https://www.history.com/news/just-how-divided-are-americans-since-trumps-election), America does not need another divisive political drama.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The impeachment process removes him from office, it does not convict him of a crime. A separate criminal trial would have to be held for such a conviction, but without the evidence of a crime, he can not be convicted. If he were found innocent, that would lead to significant civil unrest.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: It is certain that any identified felony or criminal act would be pardoned by the incoming president. This statement alone invalidates the claim that the president would be found innocent following an impeachment.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: A pardon is not certain, especially if the evidence is weak, and does not have to be granted before a trial. Trump's personality indicates he would demand his day in court, along with all the media attention it would attract.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: While not technically an impeachment, this was the [logic behind Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon and the alleged Watergate conspirators:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/ford-pardons-nixon-in-1974/2017/07/21/c83efd54-6e3b-11e7-abbc-a53480672286_video.html?utm_term=.37f799b5042b) to "write an end" to an "American tragedy, in which we all have played a part."
1.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Ford is also [on record](http://www.scotusblog.com/2006/12/commentary-gerald-fords-impact-on-the-court/) as a proponent of an essentially political impeachment process. According to him, an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers to be at a given moment in history and a conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two-thirds of the Senate considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.
1.4.3.2. Con: If the nation survived [Bill Clinton's impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton), it would survive Trump's impeachment.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: There are too many different variables to make the two situations comparable.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: The fear of some is not the fate of the country itself, but rather the opinions of those who govern it, as almost every president who has been impeached faced an immediate surge in popularity from their base and sympathetic non-partisans.  Liberals are trying to avoid empowering him politically.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Impeachment enhances the legitimacy of the constitution. The law being upheld does not detract from the strength of our nation.
1.4.3.3. Con: Trump is a [creator](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/us/politics/trump-divisiveness.html) of divisive political drama. His actions and tweets in his first year created enough division already; impeachment would relieve this political stress.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Trump is at the centre of the [divisive Kaepernick controversy](http://www.courant.com/sports/hc-jacobs-column-trump-sports-0926-20170925-column.html) in football and sport in general.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: Trump refused to call out the divisive white supremacists rally in [Charlottesville](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-heather-heyer-profile/index.html), which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer.
1.4.3.3.3. Pro: [A poll](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/trump-polls-division-unity-243063) shows that a majority of Americans find Trump to be a divisive figure.
1.4.3.3.4. Con: Based on the history of the division in the US, the articles are selective in filtering out that Trump came in with the most divided country in history. Even [PEW](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/07/americas-political-divisions-in-5-charts/) covered the division with an "unknown if Trump can fix it."
1.4.3.3.5. Con: Divisive political drama has always existed, and this current trend started a decade ago with the advent of social media.
1.4.3.3.5.1. Pro: Trump is not the cause of such division. The unfair and biased liberal monopoly on the media has caused this division.
1.4.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: Organizations such as the [Media Research Center](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2018/05/08/media-get-trumped-presidents-polls-improve-despite-90-negative) have found that the media's coverage of Trump was just as severely biased and negative in 2018 as it was in 2017.
1.4.3.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Good journalism may require positing some critical position in order to evade the bias of the topic of report in order to [remain unbiased](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/seven-days-of-fox-news-impeachment-coverage-proves-divisive-for-its-hosts). To put it another way, fair and balanced reporting requires [critical thinking](https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/29416/false-balance-binary-discourse-and-critical-thinking/). While this may appear negative; it may be a balancing factor.
1.4.3.3.5.1.2. Con: The widespread popular belief in media bias is caused by one media company badmouthing other media companies as being biased. In other words, it is not the "liberal monopoly" that has [perpetuated the division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias_in_the_United_States#Causes_of_perceptions_of_bias).
1.4.3.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: Right-wing media sources have effectively segregated themselves into in an increasingly isolated silo, creating a propaganda feedback loop continually becoming more extreme and more [partisan](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/10/network-propaganda-takes-a-closer-look-at-media-and-american-politics/).
1.4.3.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: Progressive media watchdog group [Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting](https://fair.org/press-release/examining-the-quotliberal-mediaquot-claim/) \(FAIR\) has argued that accusations of liberal media bias are part of a conservative [strategy](https://fair.org/article/pitching-softballs/).
1.4.3.3.5.2. Pro: Social media creates [echo chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_\(media\)), whereby people only encounter material that supports their view and are never challenged by arguments against them.
1.4.3.3.5.3. Con: [A study](http://pablobarbera.com/static/barbera_polarization_APSA.pdf) showed that social media actually reduces mass political polarisation, by exposing people to messages from more distant individuals, which are more likely to provide novel information.
1.4.3.3.6. Pro: Increasing division is a misuse of the office of the President whose constitutional duty is to form a more perfect union.
1.4.3.3.7. Pro: [Many families](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/donald-trump-election-hillary-clinton-half-my-family-torn-apart-hatred-animosity-between-racism-a7424651.html) have fallen out over the divisiveness of the recent US election. Bringing an end to this administration would enable families to come back together again.
1.4.3.3.8. Con: [Polarization has been increasing for many years](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/).  This is a trend that began long before President Trump took office and polarization has increased over many past presidents.  Impeachment of Trump would not resolve this trend because he is not the cause of it.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Trump's base of support would cause havoc and riot if Trump was impeached, while the liberal left would rejoice. This would create an even greater divide between these two sides of America.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Trump's approval rating is [so low](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) that the "riots" would not be impossible to manage.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: Trump's approval ratings are not an accurate measure of how willing people are to take an action, or what actions they may take.
1.4.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Trump's ratings were also [negative before the election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-won-despite-being-unpopular-so-can-he-govern-that-way/), but enough people came out to get him elected.
1.4.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: A small percentage of the population can still make a impact large enough to cause extreme damage.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Pro: Trump has lost the confidence of the public since taking up office.
1.4.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Removing presidents based on the shifting whims of public opinion would destabilize our entire government.
1.4.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Trump had received [3 times](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/26/17-striking-findings-from-2017/) more negative media coverage than Obama in his first 60 days, with only 5% positive coverage.
1.4.3.4.1.2.3. Pro: The latest [Gallup polls](http://news.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx) show that 60% of American citizens disapprove of Trump's work so far.
1.4.3.4.1.2.3.1. Con: Gallup polls results are [the least accurate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_\(company\)) when it comes to election results.
1.4.3.4.1.2.4. Pro: The [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/worldwide-few-confident-in-trump-or-his-policies/) has published data that shows levels of confidence in Trump are low worldwide.
1.4.3.4.1.2.5. Pro: Americans' perception of Trump, six months into his presidency, was [historically low](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/six-months-in-trump-is-historically-unpopular/).
1.4.3.4.1.2.5.1. Con: Trump's approval according to [Rasmussen](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_feb09) has risen since his State of the Union speech. His approval is currently higher than Obama's at the same time of his presidency.
1.4.3.4.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Rasmussen uses a combination of [landline polling and voluntary online surveys](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/about_us/methodology) to get their data. They are routinely an outlier.
1.4.3.4.1.2.5.1.2. Con: [Other sources](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) that take an aggregate place him lower than anyone other than Carter and Truman.
1.4.3.4.1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Rasmussen polls trend more conservative than most.  RealClearPolitics averages polls together to be more indicative of a president's approval ratings.  They put Trump's approval/disapproval on Feb. 21st of his second year at [41.9/54.2](http://dyn.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html) \(-12.3\).   At the same point in his presidency, Obama's spread was [47.1/46.0](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html) \(+1.1\).
1.4.3.4.1.2.5.2. Pro: [A CNN poll](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/08/politics/cnn-poll-trump-one-year-later/index.html) showed that whereas 81% of Republicans surveyed in 2016 thought Trump could unite the country, in 2017 the figure dropped to 65%.
1.4.3.4.1.2.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.1.2.3.1.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: Donald Trump rose to prominence as a demagogue for the [blue-collar communities](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support) of America. If he is impeached, these communities would likely see him as a martyr who stood up for their beliefs.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: This reasoning is an example of the [post hoc fallacy](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_fallacy). While an impeachment could possibly be the "tipping point" for such protests, they wouldn't be the cause. That has been fermenting for much longer.
1.4.3.4.4. Con: If riots and rejoicing are the response to each side, the divide is already great.
1.4.3.4.5. Pro: This would radicalize each party to form new platforms and disrupt the status quo in Washington.
1.4.3.5. Pro: The debate to impeach Donald Trump is designed to further divide Americans within the bipartisanship.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: The debate could divide, but it is not designed to. Debate and investigation is ultimately about discussion of facts and finding the unity to proceed.
1.4.3.6. Con: Politics is, by its nature, [divisive](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-is-more-partisan-now-but-its-not-more-divisive/). That's not a reason not to impeach a President.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: Political parties are divisive; politics and specifically the job of the president is about finding an agreeable way forward. The oath of office, "[preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States](https://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/1b2.html)," which is aimed to "[form a more perfect Union](http://www.ushistory.org/independencehall/history/indhall4.htm)," is precisely what Trump is failing to do.
1.4.3.6.2. Con: Other factors in the national interest, including economics, national security and divisiveness, are valid and proper reasons for partisan politicians and non-partisan observers to support or oppose impeachment of a President.
1.4.3.7. Con: Trump's [ability to be a polarizing force](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) is only enhanced by the fact that he is president. If he were impeached, the Republican party would revert back to being less polarizing, and Trump would just be another internet troll.
1.4.3.7.1. Con: The polarizing force started [near the middle of Bush's second term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush) and has escalated non-stop since then.
1.4.3.7.2. Pro: The Office of the President is designed to be utilized to unite and align the public for the common good, not to wound the country by further deepening and polarizing the divide. Only an enemy of the United States would take the later approach.
1.4.3.7.3. Con: This is not a "one party" issue when it comes to polarization. Both sides are in the wrong and taking a "my way or the highway" attitude.
1.4.3.8. Pro: Impeachment proceedings without broad popular support for removing him may just cause entrenchment of "[Trumpism](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42738881)".
1.4.3.8.1. Pro: "Trumpism" should be defeated at the ballot box, not by impeachment. Using a political process rather than an electoral process to defeat an political ideology is authoritarian and not democratic.
1.4.3.8.1.1. Con: If the president has committed treason or a substantiated impeachable offense, he/she should be impeached. Wishing for Trump to only be defeated in a democratic voting process is nothing more than wishful thinking for the future.
1.4.3.8.1.2. Con: A defeat at the ballot box is not a sufficient way to defeat "Trumpism". An impeachment on the correct grounds has a better chance to succeed in revitalizing pride in our constitutional republic and awareness of proper presidential duties.
1.4.3.8.2. Pro: Impeaching Trump would only fuel the conspiratorial mindset of his base, making the already divisive presidency far more symbolic, and dangerous.
1.4.3.8.2.1. Con: The Trump presidency is dangerous to our democracy, and sets an example where a president may [act as king](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-king-impeachment-founders-ukraine-922935/), violating his constitutional duties to the people. Impeachment may be an opportunity to remind the republic about the constitutional duties of a president.
1.4.3.8.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.7.
1.4.3.8.3. Pro: The country needs both an impeachable offence and a sweeping emotional public sentiment around which to rally in order to defeat Trumpism ideology writ large, and not just - literally speaking - impeach the man himself.
1.5. Con: Impeachment should be reserved for actions so egregious that there is bipartisan support for the same.
1.5.1. Con: Bipartisan support should not be the benchmark for what constitutes an impeachable offense because it doesn't take into account evidence and whether or not the law was broken. It's more likely that any given president's party will protect their own before breaking ranks, even when a impeachable crime has actually been committed.
1.5.2. Pro: The conviction requiring a [2/3 vote by the Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States) suggests that the Founding Fathers designed the impeachment process to avoid politically motivated attacks and so force legislatures to reserve impeachment for only the worst of deeds.
1.5.3. Con: Using Bipartisan support as the only means to call for impeachment precludes the possibility of a demagogue subverting one of the parties and would essentially allow such a person to commit crimes unimpeded by any legal reprocussions.
1.5.4. Con: The argument is undermined by the simple fact that Republicans have been [publicly vowing](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/15/rand-paul-witness-votes-impeachment-099407) extremely severe political consequences for anyone on their side who breaks ranks.
1.6. Pro: Trump has been involved in actions that stand in violation of US federal law.
1.6.1. Pro: Trump has been accused of sexual harassment and has been recorded describing lewd behaviour towards women.
1.6.1.1. Con: Trump has accusations against him but he has not admitted to sexual harassment.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Trump admitted to sexual harassment [on tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape), and confirmed the tape is real.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Trump was [heard saying](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-hot-mic-when-you-re-star-you-can-do-n662116), "I'm automatically attracted to beautiful \[women\] - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."
1.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Talking about it is not actually doing it.
1.6.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The claim was that Trump admitted to doing it, not that he did it by means of talking about doing it.
1.6.1.1.1.3. Con: Harassment of an individual must be [continual](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/harassment). If it is not alleged by the individuals that Trump's unwanted advances were continual over multiple instances, the allegations cannot be considered harassment by definition.
1.6.1.1.1.3.1. Con: When a person engages in serial activity to harass multiple individuals, thus establishing a pattern of harassing behavior, it does not matter if each victim is distinct or if the behavior is repeated and impacts an individual victim multiple times. Harassment can be applied as a label to the perpetrator of patterned behavior, even when the perpetrator victimizes each person a single time.
1.6.1.1.1.3.2. Con: A [single, egregious act](https://www.tlnt.com/court-finds-it-only-takes-one-incident-to-have-a-hostile-work-environment/) can suffice to establish harassment.
1.6.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Technically that court decision said the single act “rendered the workplace hostile”, not strictly that the offending behavior was “harassment,” although the case was categorized under the broad phrase “sexual harassment”
1.6.1.2. Pro: Trump is [accused of sexual assault by 19 different woman.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/what-about-the-19-women-who-accused-trump/547724/)
1.6.1.2.1. Con: Accusations do not constitute either high crimes or misdemeanors
1.6.1.2.2. Con: Because all of these incidents occurred before Trump was elected, they are not grounds for impeachment.
1.6.1.2.2.1. Con: Trump's [feud](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/trump-gillibrand-feud-layers/) over Senator Gillibrand's call for him to resign is adding pressure to the GOP to act on previous allegations.
1.6.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Senator Gillibrand calls for resignation based on uninvestigated, unsubstantiated  accusations, thus unconstitutionally, bypassing due process.
1.6.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Over 100 members of Congress are calling for an [investigation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/12/16766800/democratic-congress-members-trump-investigation-women) into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump.
1.6.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: This is not the jurisdiction of the oversight Committee. It's just a political maneuver to stir the pot. The Oversight Committee [is for](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/how-does-government-spend-money-what%E2%80%99s-process) government spending, taxation and things that happen while in office. Cases like Bill Clinton's activities while in AK were ruled out of jurisdiction during the whole Lewinsky incident as an example.
1.6.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: As the oversight committee examines waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars; the realm of this oversight may extend to the office of the president, and/or the failure of congress to act against the president and perform their duty of oversight regarding presidential waste, frauds, or abuses of taxpayer dollars.
1.6.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Based on Senator Gillibrands statements, she should resign immediately due to making defamatory remarks and stated unproven allegations as fact.
1.6.1.2.2.2. Con: While the constitution has no condition related to it, in some states, being convicted of a crime [blocks you](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/does-democracy-encourage-criminal-politicians/) from being on the ballot. It is a far reach, as it would require actual felony charges to be applied for it to happen though.
1.6.1.2.2.3. Con: High crimes may be discovered only after the president takes office, and plots for power and influence may span many decades. It seems unlikely that actions taken in such plots prior to entering office would be immune from consideration during impeachment, even if the office and duties to the people were seemingly performed immaculately.
1.6.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: In such situations, prior actions, in so far as they constitute evidence of an ongoing plot or seditious conspiracy, are satisfactory to admit as evidence against the president.
1.6.1.3. Con: He has not been convicted in the court of law of anything having to do with sexual harassment.
1.6.1.4. Pro: Donald Trump [admitted in 2005](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/) to walking into women's changing rooms before pageants, bragging about how he can "get away with things like that". This was verified by former contestants. It is not a crime to do this, but it is not moral character fitting of a president.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: Men in the changing rooms is "common place" in the fashion and modeling world.
1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: Being commonplace does not make it right.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Trump is the president, yet hasn’t been cleared of multiple sexual offense allegations sends a message that sexual abuse is not a serious issue, that powerful men will escape accountability and that it’s not worth coming forward about abuse.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: The crimes he is accused of took place prior to the presidency and came out before he was even elected or sworn in. As such, they cannot form the basis of a presidential impeachment.
1.6.1.5.2. Con: Allegations are not a serious issue. Allegations do not require any sort of judicial review or supporting evidence. Anyone can make any allegation towards any person at any time. No citizen of the United States is guilty of a crime until they have been given the due process of law.
1.6.1.5.3. Con: He hasn't been charged with any sexual offences.
1.6.2. Pro: Some of Trump's actions can be seen as bribery.
1.6.2.1. Pro: He [paid Stephanie Clifford](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/trump-hush-payment-stormy-daniels.html) \(Stormy Daniels\) to stay silent about their sexual relations.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Trump has paid money or favor to people to influence their conduct - that is the [definition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bribe) of bribery.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: Trump has not bribed anyone. He has engaged in a non-disclosure agreeement. It is “legally binding in all 50 states.”[formswift.com](https://formswift.com/non-disclosure-agreement)
1.6.2.2.2. Con: Trump's payments do not meet the criminal definition of a [bribe](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bribery). It is not criminal to pay a private individual to do something they are legally entitled to do. Bribing your children to take a bath is not a crime. Bribing an official to change their vote is.
1.6.2.2.3. Pro: Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his direction met the CEO of American Media Inc. to help suppress unfavorable stories about Trump’s relationships with women by [buying the rights](https://freespeechforpeople.org/trumps-hush-money-payments-to-influence-the-election-are-grounds-for-impeachment/) to those stories and burying them.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Trump has been recorded discussing a silencing payment to [Karen McDougal](http://abc11.com/politics/trump-recording-secretly-made-by-personal-attorney-released/3819006/) to prevent her from discussing an alleged affair with him.
1.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.6.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.6.2.6. Con: Depending on how you approach other forms of governmental influence, one could argue that Lobbying is just a form of legally sanctioned bribery with a few more rules.
1.6.2.6.1. Pro: Both of the desired outcomes is to affect political outcomes through buying political power. The only difference between the two is that lobbyists are required to register with the government and state how big their bribes are, while illegal briebery is under the table.[Bribery Versus Lobbying](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0912/the-differences-between-bribery-and-lobbying.aspx#targetText=Bribery%20is%20considered%20illegal%2C%20while,contributions%20that%20affect%20political%20outcomes.)
1.6.2.7. Con: President Trump's actions can be seen as upholding laws against corruption and be within his power to uphold the laws enacted by Congress.
1.6.3. Con: There are no grounds to impeach the president as he has not committed a violation of a federal law.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Impeachment at this point is premature without sufficent evidence and would trivialize the significance of the impeachment process.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: One of the primary roles of impeachment proceedings is to find that evidence. The [Nixon tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_White_House_tapes) dropped after his impeachment proceedings began.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: Since this discussion was started, more than enough evidence has come to light against Trump.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.
1.6.3.1.2.2. Pro: On October 3, 2019, Trump [asked](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49924579) China to investigate Biden.
1.6.3.1.2.2.1. Con: President Trump did not "ask" China to investigate the Bidens. He [told the reporters](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/trump-calls-for-ukraine-china-to-investigate-the-bidens.html), "China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine". Voicing an opinion does not constitute a request.
1.6.3.1.2.2.1.1. Con: A person with criminal intent will mask his command as an opinion. The opinion conveys what the speaker wants. The speaker can technically deny, i.e., "I didn't tell anyone to do anything, I expressed an opinion. I'm not responsible for what someone else does ." Trump thus hides behind a technical defense while soliciting "something of value" for his campaign from China. Substance prevails over form, to avoid give accused an easy way to avoid the charge.
1.6.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Trump's intent behind his China comments is [unclear](https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-cruz-agrees-its-inappropriate-to-say-china-should-look-into-the-biden-family). Trump himself claims they were about broader corruption, not an effort to get the Biden's politically.
1.6.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.9.
1.6.3.2. Con: President Trump has been implicated in several [Federal Crimes](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/politics/michael-cohen-plea-deal-talks/index.html) that could be considered [impeachable offenses](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/cohen-implicated-trump-court-how-he-did-it-could-be-n902761).
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: [It is increasingly clear](http://time.com/5109253/trump-organization-money-laundering-russians-russia/) that the President, [by refusing to fully divest himself from his business](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/11/news/trump-conflicts-press-conference/index.html), is either directing or willfully ignoring [massive amounts of money laundering](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-schiff/trump-organization-money-laundering-alleged-in-fusion-gps-testimony-house-democrat-idUSKBN1F739D) going on [through the acquisition and sale of real estate](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article152934589.html) by his direct business reports. Money laundering is a federal crime.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Trump has violated federal law by soliciting foreign interference in US elections.
1.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.1.
1.6.3.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.2.2.
1.6.3.2.2.3. Con: Trump was asking for an [existing investigation](https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/20/sondland-testified-misleading-ukraine-story-spread-among-conservatives-social-media-n1087511), possibly stopped by a [corrupt Ukrainian administration](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-gas-company-burisma-holdings-joe-bidens-son-hunter-explained-2019-9), to be brought [back on track](https://www.thedailybeast.com/theres-no-new-biden-or-burisma-investigation-but-some-ukrainian-pols-are-playing-games-with-impeachment-info) by the new Ukrainian administration.
1.6.3.2.2.3.1. Con: The suggestion that President Trump's stated purpose of this investigation was to root out corruption is contradicted by his selective approach to this investigation. If his goal is to root out corruption in Ukraine, then investigating [Burisma-Biden](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20976009/impeachment-hearing-hill-holmes-volker-sondland-burisma-biden) would re-empower a well known corrupt former prosecutor.
1.6.3.2.2.3.2. Con: The United States has a [treaty](https://www.congress.gov/treaty-document/106th-congress/16/document-text) with Ukraine under which the U.S. can request assistance in investigations. Trump chose not to use official channels, instead opting to remove his anti-corruption ambassador, and have his personal lawyer handle things behind the scenes.
1.6.3.2.2.4. Con: President Trump asked for investigation into possible corruption but did not ask for any foreign interference in US elections.
1.6.3.2.2.4.1. Con: The sort of corruption proposed \(the alleged end to an [investigation into Burisma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burisma_Holdings#Investigations), which was also not the goal when Biden was withholding the funds\) is an internal matter of corruption within the US government and not the business of the president of Ukraine.
1.6.3.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: Investigations into Burisma [did not cease](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-burisma/ukraine-widens-probe-against-burisma-founder-to-embezzlement-of-state-funds-idUSKBN1XU2N7) when Shokin \(who was slow-walking the investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma\) was replaced.
1.6.3.2.2.4.2. Con: Specifically, Trump asked the president of Ukraine to [announce that he was investigating the Bidens](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rudy-giuliani-ukraine-president-joe-biden-investigation-trump-state-visit-impeachment-petro-a9196086.html). Such an announcement would inevitably have a major impact on the US election, and would have to be considered to be foreign interference if it was in any way a deliberate outcome.
1.6.3.2.2.5. Con: Asking Interpol or other forms of international help to investigate domestic criminals, including those who participate in elections, is not illegal. [Interpol's broad mandate covers virtually every kind of crime, including political corruption.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol)
1.6.3.2.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.7.10.2.1.3.3.
1.6.3.2.2.5.2. Con: Trump did not ask Interpol to investigate a [political rival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal), [he asked](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript/index.html) [a foreign government](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-asked-ukraine-and-china-to-investigate-biden-2019-10), in this [case Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/trump-asked-ukraine-president-if-you-can-look-into-biden-and-his-son-in-phone-call.html), [while withholding](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/09/trump-asked-ukraine-to-investigate-biden-call-transcript) [military funds](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/politics/gao-report-administration-violated-law-withholding-aid/index.html) [and a](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/politics/ukraine-aid-trump-call-omb/index.html) [White House](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-forced-turn-ukraine-aid-documents/story?id=67869710) [invitation](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/12/politics/trump-ukraine-impeachment-inquiry-report-annotated/) [and meeting](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50323605) [from said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-hold-on-ukraine-aid-violated-federal-law-congressional-watchdog-says/2020/01/16/060ea7aa-37a3-11ea-9c01-d674772db96b_story.html) [Government](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/ukraine-aid-hold-violated-law-government-accountability-office-n1117031) [and](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/trump-administration-broke-law-in-withholding-ukraine-aid.html) [ally](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/478557-gao-finds-trump-administration-broke-law-by-withholding-aid-from). [This has been](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/heres-the-story-on-trump-ukraine-and-impeachment-quicktake/2019/12/13/0b9e554a-1ddf-11ea-977a-15a6710ed6da_story.html) [found to be](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/politics/gao-report-administration-violated-law-withholding-aid/index.html) [against](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/trump-administration-broke-law-in-withholding-ukraine-aid.html) [the law.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/ukraine-aid-hold-violated-law-government-accountability-office-n1117031)
1.6.3.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: Whether it was his intent or not, this looks corrupt and could be seen as Bribery and quid Pro Quo, to intimidate or pressure a supposed ally.
1.6.3.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: Whether it was his intention or not, this shows extremely poor judgement about just how badly this could be perceived, given the timings involved.
1.6.3.2.2.5.2.3. Pro: Withholding funds approved and ear-marked Congress from an Ally who is involved in a bloody civil war that is widely believed to be sponsored by an enemy state, violates part of the constitution, and is at the very least, very bad judgement.
1.6.3.2.2.6. Pro: GAO found that [OMB violated the Impoundment Control Act \(ICA\)](https://www.dailywire.com/news/read-it-gaos-report-on-white-house-withholding-ukraine-aid-violated-law) by withholding funds for a policy reason instead of a programmatic delay.
1.6.3.2.2.6.1. Con: The penalty for violating the ICA is not impeachment of the President. It is a [lawsuit](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/insight-trump-violation-puts-spotlight-on-impoundment-control-act) brought by GAO forcing OMB to spend the funds appropriately.
1.6.3.2.2.7. Con: Public deserves to know what [leading anti-corruption](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-anticorruption-effort-in-ukraine-overlapped-with-sons-work-in-country-11569189782) efforts in another country really means. Such activity of a presidential candidate deserves investigation and President can start it.
1.6.3.2.2.7.1. Con: In the event that there is evidence of illicit activity in regards to a former Vice President, such matters should be handled by investigative agencies within the government, not those of a foreign power.
1.6.3.2.2.8. Con: Inducing foreign governments to expose anything to the public is not personal benefit.
1.6.3.2.2.8.1. Pro: Even if he did so as claimed, a President should have that leeway to maneuver on international affairs, even if that might benefit him politically a bit.
1.6.3.2.2.8.2. Pro: The electorate has a right to know as much as possible about candidates for political and government office.
1.6.3.2.2.8.3. Con: Asking someone to reveal information about a direct opponent that casts that opponent in a negative light is inherently an act seeking personal benefit.
1.6.3.2.2.8.4. Pro: Shokin’s recent [criminal complaint](https://www.les-crises.fr/breaking-news-prosecutor-shokin-files-a-complaint-against-joe-biden-for-interference-in-ukraine-s-legal-proceedings/) and Lutsenko’s recent revelations reveal that Trump may in fact be vindicated, and that Biden actually withheld funding for [Ukraine](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/434875-top-ukrainian-justice-official-says-us-ambassador-gave-him-a-do-not-prosecute).
1.6.3.2.2.9. Con: Asking a foreign power to investigate corruption is, in fact, a [treaty](https://www.congress.gov/treaty-document/106th-congress/16/document-text) obligation to Ukraine.
1.6.3.2.2.9.1. Con: The treaty requires an on going investigation into criminal matters and does not cover "fishing expeditions" where no crime is currently alleged or under investigation. Thus the request was "out of order" of the proper sequence.
1.6.3.2.2.10. Con: The fact that the subject is Biden's son when Biden is a candidate is irrelevant, just as investigating Trump, when he was a candidate, was irrelevant.
1.6.3.2.2.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.7.10.
1.6.3.2.3. Pro: Trump has been involved in [criminal conspiracies](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/the-president-has-been-implicated-in-a-criminal-conspiracy) to mislead the American public.
1.6.3.3. Pro: If a blatantly impeachable offense is uncovered, it is likely Congress would act.
1.6.3.3.1. Con: The likelihood of Congress acting against their own party is not supported by historical evidence.
1.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: The last three presidential impeachment proceedings, against Andrew Johnson in 1867, Richard Nixon in 1973, and Bill Clinton in 1998, only took place while their opposing party held both chambers of Congress. In fact, the [majority of impeachments overall](https://www.infoplease.com/history-and-government/us-government/impeachments-federal-officials) have only been initiated by members of an opposing party.
1.6.3.3.2. Con: The current administration can and would insist to everyone who would listen that the "blatantly impeachable" offence either does not exist or is not impeachable, if they believe that doing so would serve the party.
1.6.3.3.3. Con: Republican partisan loyalty could preclude impeachment regardless of how egregious or blatant the offenses are.
1.6.3.3.3.1. Pro: Representative Devin Nunes has been [recorded](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/9/17670930/devin-nunes-tape) claiming his goal is to keep Trump in office whatever the circumstances rather than see justice upheld.
1.6.3.4. Con: President Trump’s personal and business holdings present untenable conflicts of interest.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.2.1.
1.6.3.4.2. Pro: By using taxpayer money to provide accommodations for his staff and secret service for his frequent visits to his own resorts he is [funneling taxpayer money](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/us/politics/trump-properties-ireland-g7.html) directly into his family’s business. The taxpayers should be demanding his removal for this alone.
1.6.3.4.2.1. Pro: Housing facilities have been established for the office of the president, yet Trump chooses to force the Secret Service to [lease](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-secret-service-maralago-new-years-eve-costs-783831) his [properties](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/04/trump-tower-evicts-secret-service-over-rental-dispute.html) for profit, which is akin to profiteering off of the office of the President.
1.6.3.4.3. Con: [The FEC](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html) has evaluated Trump's supposed conflicts of interest and deemed it not an issue.
1.6.3.4.3.1. Pro: Based on filing disclosures and a Trust, the president has cleared the Ethics Committee's requirements to avoid the [Emoluments clause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-retains-assets-worth-at-least-14-billion-new-disclosure-shows/2017/06/16/c0bc4caa-52b9-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html?utm_term=.3a3319df6018).
1.6.3.4.4. Pro: Trump has [the means](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-blackmail-bribe-foreign-government-philippines-japan-taiwan-turkey-argentina-a7473811.html) to receive an anonymous bribe through his companies.
1.6.3.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6.3.4.5. Con: Conflicts of interest are unacceptable and should be handled, but they are not [grounds for impeachment](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html).
1.6.3.4.5.1. Con: No specific grounds are required to impeach any president. [Legal opinion](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html) holds that "high crimes and misdemeanors" is expressly political. Congress has the power to impeach a President for political reasons.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1. Con: This is a political view over a legal view. In order to [file a successful impeachment](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/100/standards-for-impeachment), a legal clause must be violated, specifically at the federal level, that applies to the President. From "High Crimes to a Misdemeanor" \(which can be as simple as a procedural violation\), a formal charge must be in place.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: Impeachment is a hybrid of legal and political process. Legal because the reasons for the process to be started are written in law, and political because the "judge" is the congress and not a magistrate.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.2. Con: Articles of impeachment against [Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) included [noncriminal violations of civil and administrative statutes and political claims](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7). Because law enforcement is not a congressional power, [adopting articles of impeachment is seen as a legislative process and not a judicial or administrative process.](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm)
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3. Con: A determination of whether the grounds for impeachment exist is [solely in the hands of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States) and not the judiciary, due to the [Political Question Doctrine](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine), effectively making any impeachment political.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1. Con: While it is within the power of Congress to determine what is or is not a high crime or misdemeanor, the separation of powers in the US system also relies on norms of behavior that parties should not abuse their prerogatives.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Allowing Congress to remove a president for political reasons threatens the separation of powers that protects the US from tyranny by any individual branch.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Impeachment is the Constitutionally prescribed method by which the legislative branch of government is empowered to [check the President](https://www.lawfareblog.com/impeachment-national-security-framers-intentions). It is the way the system is designed to work.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Legislation is the prescribed method of [keeping the Executive political power in check](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=faculty_publications). Impeachment is an extreme measure intended to be used for the removal of a sitting president for enumerated reasons.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Impeachment would be more dangerous for the stability of the nation: the American legal system is based on the [Common Law](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/lawschool/pre-law/intro-to-american-legal-system.page), so devising a system to make him fall would create a dangerous precedent usable in the future to affect presidents who are making right but unpopular choices.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Nobody is devising a system to make Trump “fall”, i.e. be removed from office through the impeachment process, which is not intended to remove any president from office. Impeachment is the first step. The second [step](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/what-impeachment-how-does-it-work-10-facts-know-n1072451) is the sole responsibility of the Senate, which is to conduct a trial to determine if he should be removed from office on the grounds of the impeachment findings put forth by the House.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Even if Congress can choose to impeach a President for political reasons, such a precedent would be dangerous.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Broadening the allowable reasons for impeachment to include political views or supported policy would allow Congress to theoretically impeach down the succession list \(vice president, senate president, etc.\) until they reached someone they politically aligned with, which would give congress a great power unchecked by the Executive or Judicial branches.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: You would have to convince 2/3s of Senators each time. Unlikely.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.3.2. Con: For a given inquiry and subsequent Judgement by the senate, selection of a singular crime\(s\) for all parties accused seems necessary, so in the selection of the accused in any conspiracy could be tried at once in an Impeachment of the entire conspiratorial group. I do not believe this would proceed down the line \(serially\) but rather; in parallel to include any number of accused, \(vp and senators\) all at once. While this may seem overtly political, it would depend on the arguments and charges.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Charges are laid per person, not per group of conspirators.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Several people or entities may nevertheless be tried for the same crime. They would not let some defendants sit on the jury of other defendants. For a singular crime committed by multiple entries; that separate jury or trial is required; especially in cases of Impeachment; remains unclear.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: Impeaching a President purely for political reasons would cause unnecessary political division in the United States.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.5. Pro: Breaking the taboo of frivolous or excessively political impeachment would likely produce a destructive cycle of partisan retribution that would hurt both sides in the long run.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: This arguably has already begun, as every president since [Ronald Reagan has had at least had a hearing held on his impeachment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_investigations_of_United_States_federal_officials#George_H._W._Bush)
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.2. Con: The Political Question Doctrine applies to the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question), not the House where impeachment presides. The Supreme Court can lay charges, which the Senate can then take up in order to proceed with impeachment but the PQD only applies if it's a topic political in nature. For example, [conduct charges](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/246/297/) against the president or items with the [responsibility of another](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/369/186) branch.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.2.1. Con: The basis for the Court applying the political question doctrine to impeachment is that impeachment is a political matter to be determined solely by Congress. Thus, while the Doctrine only applies to the Court, the basis for its application indicates that impeachment is inherently political rather than legal.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The basis was not on it being a "political matter" but nonjusticiable, as in not the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Issues of this nature are handled by the "Senate Judiciary Committee", a legal arm of the Senate.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The impeachment process is not ["handled" by the Senate Judiciary Committee](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf). While certain committees in either chamber may make non-binding recommendations, the only actions relevant to an impeachment outcome are [\(1\) the entry of draft articles of impeachment into the hopper, \(2\) a simple majority vote of the House to adopt those articles, then \(3\) a 2/3 majority vote of the Senate to remove the President based on any one article.](https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/98-806.pdf)
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: The PQD is only about [justiciability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciability), as in the limits upon legal issues with relation to the law over which a court can exercise its judicial authority. It by no means designates anything political, it just applies as a rule of jurisdictions related between the branches. Cases like [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_States_political_question_doctrine_case_law) show examples of where it applies \(or not\).
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Because the impeachment process is nonjusticiable, no aspect of it can be challenged on legal grounds or reversed by the [judiciary](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25726769.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A487a335865ab5c0a689a9c010893e4bd). Thus, even if a defendant had legitimate reason to feel a duly adopted article of impeachment were unconstitutional or illegal, they would have no recourse in the matter. The effect is that the process is solely governed and constrained by congressional politics.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.3. Con: Technically Speaking, even the Supreme Court is a [Political Branch](https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm) of the US government, but [impeachment](https://definitions.uslegal.com/i/impeachment/) is still a law presided over by the Senate.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Generally, experts [distinguish](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=faculty_publications) between the political branches \(the executive and legislature\) and the judiciary \(e.g., the Supreme Court\).
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Based on the included [publication](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=faculty_publications), the separation of the three political branches is about jurisdictions of authority. Also per the linked publication: "\[s\]carcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question".
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: However, due to long-established [nonjusticiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States) of impeachment proceedings, impeachment is one of those "scarce" exceptions.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.4. Con: In Federalist Paper no. 65, Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachment is an inherently political process designed to address "[injuries done immediately to the society itself](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/fedimpeachment.htm)."
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.4.1. Con: Alexander Hamilton is citing branches of government in the linked document for handling impeachment. That does not change the fact that a legal precedence is required in order to file articles of impeachment.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5. Con: Legal scholars appear to agree that indictable offenses [cover far more](https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZSUH83kBt4C&lpg=PA103&ots=5Ur9-Yg668&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%20major%20disagreement%20is%20not%20over%20whether%20impeachable%20offenses%20should%20be%20strictly%20limited%20to%20indictable%20crimes%2C%22&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20major%20disagreement%20is%20not%20over%20whether%20impeachable%20offenses%20should%20be%20strictly%20limited%20to%20indictable%20crimes%2C%22&f=false) than conduct prohibited by criminal statutes. A president can be impeached for misconduct that is entirely legal.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: "High crimes and misdemeanors" under the British Common Law means an [abuse of the power of an office](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/what-does-high-crimes-and-misdemeanors-actually-mean/600343/). It needn't be a criminal violation, but it should be an abusive use of the power of a Constitutional office.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Trump's pattern of [protecting Flynn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/01/trump-put-his-presidency-at-risk-to-defend-michael-flynn-what-happened/), [firing Comey](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/ex-fbi-director-james-comey-violated-fbi-policies-and-employment-pact.html), [pressuring Sessions not to recuse](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/politics/trump-sessions-obstruction.html), [publicly attacking the FBI](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-fbi-wray.html), and [seeking assurances of loyalty from Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html) easily fits this definition.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Trump [demanded the resignation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-resigns-at-trumps-request/2018/11/07/d1b7a214-e144-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html) of Sessions without giving any reason. While he does not have to give a reason, both the timing \(right after [appointment of Kavanaugh and the mid-term elections](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/08/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-may-be-the-midterm-boost-republicans-need)\) and the replacement selected, \([Matthew Whitaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Whitaker), a vocal and public opponent of the Mueller probe who has proposed choking and scraping it\), are deeply suspicious and troubling.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: This can be seen as an attempt at obstruction of justice. [Laurence Tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Tribe), a constitutional law professor at Harvard University, say's [Trump’s replacement of Sessions with Whitaker was arguably an impeachable offence in itself.](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/jeff-sessions-us-attorney-general-211548701.html)
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.2. Con: The interpretation of the book is incorrect. Indictment \(felony level charges\) or misdemeanors is the specific language. An indictment isn't required, but some form of charge is. A misdemeanor level charge is also acceptable.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.3. Pro: Federal Judges have been successfully removed from office for non-criminal acts including [conflicts of interest, intoxication, and abuse of power.](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/impeachments-federal-judges)
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.6. Pro: [Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) was impeached for violating the Tenure act, while other citations were in the articles, this was the only rule violation noted.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.6.1. Con: [Each "article" is a co-equal, enumerated charge](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7). [The Senate process tried individual articles separately, not the full bill.](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/treasures_of_congress/Images/page_14/48a.html) This clearly implies that any one article could be tried on its own and found to be grounds for removal by a 2/3 vote of the senate.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.7. Pro: [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton) was impeached for lying to investigators.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.8. Pro: While Nixon was not successfully impeached, it's believed he would have, where the articles that were drafted cited the [Watergate scandal \(DNC headquarters break in\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal), specifically citing the "obstruction of justice" for Nixon not turning over the tapes as ordered.
1.6.3.4.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.
1.6.3.4.5.1.3. Con: From the article cited in the above claim,"The Constitution sets specific grounds for impeachment ... To be impeached and removed from office, the House and Senate must find that the official committed one of these acts."
1.6.3.4.5.1.3.1. Con: The Constitution [states](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Impeachment/), “The president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Given there is no greater specificity given, misdemeanours can be read as misdeeds or bad behaviour and need not refer to an illegal infraction.
1.6.3.4.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.3.1.
1.6.3.4.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.
1.6.3.4.5.1.6. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.
1.6.3.4.5.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.4.
1.6.3.4.5.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.
1.6.3.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.5.3.
1.6.3.4.6. Pro: Trump has [conflicts of interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tracking-trumps-web-of-conflicts/#foreign_properties) based on his private holdings, several of which violate the U.S. Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause, which alone is grounds for impeachment.
1.6.3.4.6.1. Con: [Conflicts of interest](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_7.1), once disclosed or contracted handling is absolved are no longer within the conflicts of interest category for charges.
1.6.3.4.6.1.1. Pro: Once disclosed and contractual control distributed, this is no longer applicable. [The law](https://www.oge.gov/Web/OGE.nsf/Resources/18+U.S.C.+%C2%A7+208:+Acts+affecting+a+personal+financial+interest) also [exempts](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/16/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-president-trump-will-be-exempt-conflict-i/) a large portion of potential conflicts of interest from being applied to the president or the vice president.
1.6.3.4.6.2. Pro: By Trump's own admission, his business investments in Istanbul pose a [conflict of interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tracking-trumps-web-of-conflicts/#foreign_properties) when dealing with Turkey politically.
1.6.3.4.6.3. Pro: The Commercial Bank of China \(CBC\) is a[major lender to Trump](https://www.vox.com/2016/12/9/13799904/trump-corruption-conflict-of-interest) and the primary tenant in Trump Tower. This obviously conflicts with Trump's ability to separate his personal interests from those of the country when dealing with issues involving the CBC.
1.6.3.4.7. Pro: The [Presidential Compensation Clause](https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/resources/faqs/#grounds-for-impeachment) prohibits serving US Presidents from receiving emoluments outside of their Presidential compensation, as a way of preventing corruption. Trump's domestic businesses violate this clause.
1.6.3.4.7.1. Con: It refers to any payment derivative from his direct actions as president, not from payments received from business made outside of his presidency.
1.6.3.4.7.2. Pro: Trump continues to own businesses that receive government [subsidies and tax breaks](https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/resources/faqs/#grounds-for-impeachment). It is in his interest, therefore, to keep this in place regardless of what that means for the country at large. This is corruption.
1.6.3.4.8. Pro: Trump has [reportedly](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40639370) booked people, including foreign dignitaries into his Trump hotels and Mar-a-Lago resort for presidential events.
1.6.3.4.9. Con: The US has never had a President who was a [businessman like Trump](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-30/does-donald-trumps-business-background-matter). This would prevent anyone with businesses or private holdings domestically and abroad from becoming President.
1.6.3.4.9.1. Con: [Jimmy Carter](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=4pF9x-cDGsoC&dat=19770104&printsec=frontpage&hl=en) turned his peanut farm and warehouse over to a blind trust when he became president, so people with assets or businesses have become president without contravening ethics rules.
1.6.3.4.9.2. Con: [Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/trumps-conflict-of-interest-problem) all placed their assets in blind trusts while serving as President.
1.6.3.5. Con: Trump has on [two occasions authorised](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-slammed-failing-tell-congress-183625451.html), and indeed, had performed, military action [without notifying Congress,](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/what-is-trumps-legal-authority-for-soleimani-assassination.html) in [violation of the Constitution and traditions of the United States.](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/us-lawmakers-not-told-attack-055259313.html)
1.6.3.6. Con: On multiple occasions, Trump [actively encouraged people to use violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIs2L2nUL-0) which is in direct violation of [18 U.S.C. § 2101 - U.S. Code](https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2101.html).
1.6.3.6.1. Con: Not a single example within the source provided in the parent is a serious call for violence.
1.6.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.7.
1.6.3.8. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.2.2.
1.7. Con: It is likely that impeachment would not achieve the goal of holding Trump accountable for his wrongdoings.
1.7.1. Con: Impeachment is the only way to stop Trump from taking future actions that could be damaging.
1.7.1.1. Con: No impeachment proceeding has ever successfully removed a president. A failed removal effort in this case would likely backfire politically and/or in terms of Trump's post-impeachment behavior in office.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Impeachment is valuable for no other reason than that a criminal rarely attempts to commit other crimes while they have a spotlight on them. If it served no other purpose than as a deterrent of future crimes then it is certainly worth it.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: The only impeachment inquiry that [backfired was the Clinton impeachment](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/03/clintons-impeachment-barely-dented-his-public-support-and-it-turned-off-many-americans/). Clinton did something very wrong by perjuring himself; however, if Trump is guilty of the crimes the Democrats are accusing him of, then he represents a profound threat to our system of government. The two situations are not analogous at all.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Donald Trump's hardline approach has posed significant danger to the rest of the world. Impeaching him would stop him from taking it too far.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Donald Trump's disregard for the value of the work of the previous administration, and drastic shift from it, has [eroded](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/u-s-image-suffers-as-publics-around-world-question-trumps-leadership/) long-term international confidence in the USA as a reliable partner on trade, military support, and other international interests, and has resulted in lost investor confidence of its bond holders and closest trade partners. Impeachment may restore international confidence in the stability of the USA.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: Impeaching Trump while the United States is involved in  serious confrontations with other nations could put our national security at risk.
1.7.1.2.2.1. Con: Since many of these confrontations are driven by Trump's comments, removing him will also remove the threat to national security.
1.7.1.2.2.2. Pro: If the Congress and Senate would agree that Trump is a threat and act as the "checks and balances" they should be, then America could stabilize. The government needs balance and neither branch is stepping up.
1.7.1.2.3. Pro: Trump has ignored Congress’s call to leave the Saudi-led war in Yemen and is in [violation](https://reason.com/2019/05/17/yemen-iran-and-the-war-powers-act/) of the War Powers Act.
1.7.1.2.4. Con: Trump is taking what appears to be extreme measures to set America up for success in the 21st century.
1.7.1.2.4.1. Con: While reform is probably long overdue in the US, whether Trump's actions will yield success or not are no grounds for impeachment. Illegality and misconduct are.
1.7.1.2.5. Con: Trump's shift in strategy has largely seen ISIS's territory [dramatically shrink](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452868/trumps-isis-victory) since he was in office.
1.7.1.2.5.1. Con: These campaigns were well underway during the [previous administration](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-takes-full-credit-gains-against-isis/).The blunder in this case was [forcing the hand](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/us-to-arm-kurds-for-assault-on-raqqa-despite-turkeys-objections/article/2622551) of the Iraq and Turkey government by announcing the formation of a largely Kurdish security force on the Syrian side of the Iraq and Turkish border.
1.7.1.2.5.2. Con: The Syrian people are now [experiencing an even worse situation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/04/syria-iraq-fight-for-isis-old-territory-just-beginning/) as a result of all of these dynamics.
1.7.1.2.5.3. Con: America has lost any ability to steer the situation in any way \(toward our 'interests'\) - either regarding justice or democracy for Syrians, greater geopolitical stability, or US business interests.
1.7.1.2.5.4. Pro: In [January 2017](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/10/trump-isis-victory/), ISIS controlled 23,300 square miles, which shrank to about 9,300 square miles by October.
1.7.1.2.5.4.1. Con: There is no solid proof that this was the work of Trump or American Military intervention. Russian and Syrian troops loyal to Assad can take as much, if not more of the credit, as can other [non-US supported Arabic and African forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_military_intervention_against_ISIL).
1.7.1.2.6. Pro: [Trump's antagonising](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/trump-continues-to-tease-a-war-with-north-korea.html) of North Korea could bring the two countries closer to nuclear confrontation, which would be devastating.
1.7.1.2.6.1. Con: Trump's lack of tact associated with communicating with individuals does not change the last several years of [threats from North Korea and the North Korean government](https://ig.ft.com/north-korea-missiles/), along with their actions against the US.
1.7.1.2.6.2. Con: Trump's 'peace through strength' is a viable way to achieve security on the peninsula.
1.7.1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Trump is [putting pressure](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/us-and-china-agree-to-maximise-pressure-on-north-korea) on China to act because a stronger and more forwarded military posture by the US is seen as a threat in Beijing.
1.7.1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: China is simply appeasing Trump and establishing its position on North Korea for its own independent needs. China has [no intention](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-china-isnt-ready-to-put-pressure-on-north-korea) to fully follow the US's policy of 'strategic strangulation'.
1.7.1.2.6.2.2. Pro: Provocation is a legitimate tool of diplomacy that has been used throughout history.
1.7.1.2.6.3. Pro: His method of communicating with potentially dangerous countries such as North Korea is senseless and immature display of provocation.
1.7.1.2.6.3.1. Con: Fear is not a position to negotiate from. As the US is the most powerful nation on the planet, placating dictators and aggressors because of their capabilities is a poor practice and belies this fact.
1.7.1.2.6.3.1.1. Con: Fear does not need to be the stance to operate from; however needlessly provoking the enemy to act in ways that might put innocent lives in danger, is not rational and is more risky than just letting things play out. Being firm and confident if fine, but being immature and cocky is unreasonable.
1.7.1.2.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Under Obama's '[strategic patience](https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2017/09/04/on-north-korea-strategic-patience-has-enabled-strategic-blackmail/)' policy North Korea was allowed to develop nuclear technology.
1.7.1.2.6.3.2. Con: His communication style is not an impeachable offense.
1.7.1.2.6.4. Con: There is no direct link between Trump's "antagonism" and a nuclear war. North Korea [has made progress with it's missle program](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-missile-tests-a-timeline/) for many years under many presidents. This has been a consistent policy across presidents [of both political parties](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/26/us-developing-missile-shield-to-guard-against-nuclear-attack-fro/). Impeaching Trump likely wouldn't change this strategy.
1.7.1.2.6.5. Pro: The amount of capability that North Korea has displayed with their [ICBM program](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/latest-north-korean-icbm-capable-of-reaching-us-so-now-what/) is staggering. They are becoming more of a possible threat for the US mainland and allied countries.
1.7.1.2.6.6. Con: North Korea is a [very oppressive country](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/north-korea) and the US therefore has a responsibility to take a strong stance against them.
1.7.1.2.6.6.1. Pro: North Korea has been a rogue state for 70 years and [severely oppresses](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/north-korea) its own people while its leader reportedly lives a [very lavish life](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-spent-over-600m-in-a-year-while-north-korean-citizens-starved-to-death-9145059.html).  Trump came along and said enough is enough so this is in no way grounds for impeaching Trump.
1.7.1.2.7. Pro: Donald Trump's decision to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem led to [riots and deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/08/palestinian-shot-dead-in-gaza-as-protesters-clash-with-israeli-troops-in-west-bank) overseas.
1.7.1.3. Pro: The appointment of multiple justices during his term can have an enduring and[irreversible effect](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/trump-judge-appointments-roe-v-wade-courts) on the country in the future, even when he doesn't get reelected.
1.7.1.4. Con: There are multiple ways of preventing a President from taking harmful actions. Significant action requires the approval of Congress. Actions can be challenged in court.  We elect a President, not a King.
1.7.1.5. Con: This argument could be used for every future president. All presidents have the potential to make a poor decision, therefore all should be impeached.
1.7.1.5.1. Pro: This argument could also be made for every person. The claim in question holds as much influence as the statement 'The only way to prevent insider trading is to prematurely fire everyone with the opportunity to share insider information'. Impeachment on the grounds of the opportunity to commit a misdeed is a ridiculous proposition, especially considering how much power the president of the United States is granted.
1.7.1.5.2. Con: Trump is unique in this regard-- he has shown no clear propensity to care or take precautions against the actual and potential harmful results of his decisions.
1.7.1.6. Con: It's not a decision the public get to make, it's system protocols. Overruling protocols by popular pressure is more dangerous than he is.
1.7.1.7. Con: People should not be held accountable for "potential actions."
1.7.1.7.1. Pro: The [presumption of innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence) is still a fundamental right in the legal system of the USA.
1.7.1.7.1.1. Con: Impeachment is not a criminal proceeding, per se, so the strict presumption of innocence is not as important as the credible check on Executive power.
1.7.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Both protections and liabilities are drastically different for an impeached President than for a criminal defendant, indicating that impeachment is a peculiar institution, bound by its own norms, rather than an extension of criminal or civil justice.
1.7.1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Punishment for impeachment is [limited to removal from office \(and a bar from future office-holding\)](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3-), and an impeached president is not arrested, arraigned, or indicted \(in the criminal sense\).
1.7.1.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: An impeached president is not tried and convicted by a unanimous decision of a jury of his peers, but by a [2/3 vote of the Senate](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm).
1.7.1.7.1.2. Con: A presumption of innocence doesn't hold up when someone expresses the intent to take harmful or illegal actions.
1.7.1.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.7.1.7.2. Con: Preventing or deterring potential actions is a good reason to hold people accountable for past actions.
1.7.1.7.2.1. Pro: People who plan terrorist attacks are incarcerated based on the potential of their actions.
1.7.1.7.3. Con: This statement includes some incorrect assumptions. Impeachment is not a criminal proceeding. Impeachment and removal from office is more akin to being fired from a job than it is to a criminal trial. If Trump is “convicted” by the Senate, he is not going to jail. He is only being removed from office.
1.7.1.7.4. Con: As a society, we often hold people accountable for their potential actions.
1.7.1.7.4.1. Pro: Having a criminal report weekly to his or her parole officer is a pretty solid example of holding someone accountable for potential actions.
1.7.1.7.4.1.1. Con: In this example, the person has already been found guilty of a crime by a jury, so the reporting requirement is an extension of the prior punishment.
1.7.1.7.4.2. Pro: If someone is at risk of harming themselves or others, we arrest or hospitalize them.
1.7.1.7.4.2.1. Pro: If a judge believes someone accused of a crime might be a flight risk, the judge will deny them bail.
1.7.1.7.4.3. Pro: If an employee says things that suggest he or she might be harmful to the company, his or her employer will fire that employee.
1.7.1.7.4.4. Pro: If another nation threatens our safety, we may pre-emptively attack that nation.
1.7.1.8. Pro: By not impeaching him, he would be able to [manipulate re-election](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-going-to-manipulate-the-government-to-stay-in-power), which would be undemocratic and dictatorial.
1.7.1.9. Pro: It takes more time, money, and effort to undo the effects of bad policy than it does to implement the policy in the first place. Therefore, nullifying potential damage is an important issue.
1.7.1.9.1. Con: An impeachment would leave the rest of the legislative and executive policy-making apparatuses intact. Unless you contend that Trump himself is the frount of all bad policy, impeachment does little to solve the problem.
1.7.1.9.1.1. Con: While an impeachment would not solve all of the problems, it would be a step towards solving some of them. Without a better alternative, impeachment seems to be a decent, if not perfect, option.
1.7.1.9.1.2. Pro: Evidence shows going back 10+ years the dysfunction has been [escalating](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/nicholas-kristof-americas-political-dysfunction.html). Trump has little to do with it other than being the guy in front.
1.7.1.10. Pro: Trump must be impeached to protect the homeland from the influence of foreign adversaries.
1.7.1.10.1. Pro: According to the [Fusion GPS transcript](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/26/782908119/fusion-gps-founders-on-russian-efforts-to-sow-discord-they-have-succeeded), Donald Trump has "clear" long-time relationships to Russian organized crime. This poses a significant national security threat that could possibly spill over to diplomatic issues.
1.7.1.10.1.1. Pro: Glenn Simpson claims that he [went to the FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier) with this information because he believed then candidate Donald Trump was at risk of being blackmailed.
1.7.1.10.1.2. Con: This is conjecture and accusation driven by a political campaign supported by the previous administration in power. Conjecture that causes hysteria and overreaction are threats to our electoral system and should not be indulged.
1.7.1.10.1.2.1. Con: Many aspects of the dossier have been widely reported [\(since Feb 2017\)](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonaleopold/us-intelligence-has-confirmed-parts-of-the-dossier-about-tru?utm_term=.pn6bzPZB7#.vodNbap1y) to have been confirmed by intelligence sources.
1.7.1.10.2. Con: It is equally as likely that impeachment would encourage foreign influence in US politics.
1.7.1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.7.
1.7.1.10.4. Con: Trump is advancing US interests and rebuilding the country. His broader political success counteracts any political misdemeanours Trump may be accused of. Impeaching him would put a stop to this good work.
1.7.1.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.1.2.
1.7.1.10.4.2. Pro: Unemployment levels under Trump are at a [50 year low.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48145563)
1.7.1.10.4.3. Pro: The US economy is going through an all-time high, [with 70 Dow Records](https://www.bespokepremium.com/think-big-blog/a-record-for-record-highs/).
1.7.1.10.4.3.1. Con: Economics, even if one could claim that sustained stock-market price rises indicated economic strength, is but one aspect of a country's wellness.
1.7.1.10.4.3.1.1. Pro: This is akin to claiming that a dishonest, wife-beating husband who throws trash around and insults all his neighbours is a "keeper" because he runs a thriving business.
1.7.1.10.4.3.2. Con: DOW is not a reliable measure of US citizens' interest or well-being, it merely reflects the trading value of an elite group of companies.
1.7.1.10.4.3.2.1. Pro: The DOW is just the trading value of [a few top companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/dow-jones-problems.html), and their high values may have come from things that are bad for Americans. The DOW is high because investors expect this profiteering to increase under Trump.
1.7.1.10.4.3.3. Con: The stock market [fell dramatically](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/us-stocks-powell-fed-trump.html) in March of 2018, a direct result of Trump's economic policies and ongoing scandals.
1.7.1.10.4.3.4. Pro: GDP has [averaged 2.9%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188165/annual-gdp-growth-of-the-united-states-since-1990/) under his administration, almost double Obama's 1.5% average.
1.7.1.10.4.3.4.1. Con: The data is open to interpretation. Though this [article](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/08/trumps-gdp-puffery/) focuses on something tangential to the above claim, it does mention that the real GDP growth was higher than 2.6 in eight of the last eighteen quarters.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5. Con: None of the improvements to the economy are the result of anything that Donald Trump or the Republican Administration have done.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.1. Pro: Trump has not been in office long enough to credibly claim significant positive impact from his leadership.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: It is [too early](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/donald-trump-economy-stock-market-jobs-reports-credit/) to determine whether or not these changes will stick. It's possible the markets reacted to Trump's campaign promises, but may not exhibit continual growth.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.2. Con: While Trump's policies have resulted in small short term gains, at the expense of long term stability, there does appear to be [correlation](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/how-trump-has-set-economic-growth-on-fire.html) between his policies and some of the market growth. Mostly because industries are able to do things more cheaply thanks to more lax oversight.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3. Pro: In particular, the [Dow Index](https://www.google.ca/search?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&tbm=fin#scso=uid_gW9_WrnoEqOE5wLQtpSoBQ_5:0,uid_R3N_Wrv6KcmOsgHLrJTYBw_5:0) and the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.google.ca/search?q=INDEXSP:.INX&tbm=fin#scso=uid_i29_WufOMaLJ5gLZ0IvIBA_5:0,uid_ZnN_Wu__H4T-sQHPoYqADQ_5:0) were already increasing before Trump took office.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1. Con: According to the sources given, and applying that same logic, noting the rate of growth and recovery suggests that Bush started the recovery and not Obama.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Whether or not Obama caused the stock market to improve is irrelevant to the claim that Trump caused the stock market to improve.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1.1.1. Con: If one places a ruler on a [DJI chart](https://www.google.com/search?q=dji+chart&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS787US787&oq=dji&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0j69i59l2j0.3523j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) at the start of Obama's term \(6,627\) to the end \(20,810\), one can see that the rise under Trump to March 5, 2018 is a continuation of the rise under Obama as that rise is almost exactly where it is now \(24,875\).
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1.1.2. Con: It's relevant in the case of the logic you applied where it pertains to "not giving Trump credit". Either Obama's recovery started with Bush and Trump's recovery was due to Obama, or neither is the case.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1.2. Con: Noting the rate of growth/recovery, the economy improved more under Obama in any 5 years than [under Bush from October 2002-2007](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-economic-record-an-assessment) \(between the two recessions\). The difference between the improvement since Trump's inauguration and the improvement in the previous year is not unusual variation for a single year.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1.3. Con: Unlike the Obama/Trump comparison, the economy was not already improving before Bush left office.
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.3.1.3.1. Con: The US started a [recovery](https://www.cfr.org/report/quarterly-update-us-economic-recovery-historical-context) late 2007, and have been on the same rate of growth since. This is an issue given the rate of recovery being so slow, tied with additional bureaucratic regulatory controls like [DF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) , creation of complex [health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) bureaucratic rules and the push for the [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing) that artificially inflated stocks \(filling the 1%'s bank accounts while ripping off the lower/middle class\).
1.7.1.10.4.3.5.4. Con: The massive corporate tax cuts will increase share earnings and have already [boosted stock prices.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/19/stock-markets-record-highs-us-tax-reform-vote-business-live)
1.7.1.10.4.3.6. Pro: Trump's tax restructuring has encouraged [companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/tax-reform-reaction-att-is-giving-bonuses-to-200000-employees.html) to re-invest into the US.
1.7.1.10.4.3.7. Con: At the point when Trump made this claim, [the market](http://fortune.com/2017/12/19/justin-wolfers-donald-trump-stock-market-returns/) had risen 17.5% so far in the Trump presidency. It rose 37.5% over the equivalent part of the Obama presidency. It is therefore not a record.
1.7.1.10.4.3.8. Con: The [1.5 trillion dollar tax cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-jobs-act.html) will lead to massive deficits and debt, leading to automatic spending cuts in medicare and other entitlement programs greatly impacting the medical industry and Americans' general well being, which will affect worker productivity.
1.7.1.10.4.3.8.1. Pro: The [2010 PAYGO act](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/29/upshot/paygo-medicare-cuts-tax-bill.html) mandates automatic cuts to programs such as Medicare in the case of rising debt, created by the tax cuts.
1.7.1.10.4.3.8.2. Pro: The Congressional Budget Office [estimated that](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/27/politics/cbo-score-senate-tax/index.html) the Nov 27 version of the bill would add 1.44 trillion to the debt over 10 years, assuming some growth from the tax cuts. Later versions to secure votes would add additional tax breaks.
1.7.1.10.4.4. Con: Trump has been making damaging changes to the makeup of government agencies. This is likely to continue if he is not stopped, with serious and long term damage to the nation.
1.7.1.10.4.4.1. Con: It is not generally agreed that these actions are negative for the country. Criminality, and not policy opinion, should determine whether or not a president is impeached.
1.7.1.10.4.4.1.1. Con: Since some of these administrative agencies are created to enforce duly adopted law, attempting to undermine their functions violates the [President's Constitutionally mandated oath to "faithfully execute the office."](http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/1b2.html)
1.7.1.10.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Hypothetically, a pacifist President who chose to use their office to unilaterally disband or inhibit the function of particular branches of the American military would expect to face calls for impeachment as well.
1.7.1.10.4.4.2. Pro: Trump has [hollowed out](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/29/567133958/a-diplomat-on-the-reported-hollowing-out-of-the-state-department) the State Department.
1.7.1.10.4.4.2.1. Con: It appears the department's actions and activity over the past year have been largely [proactive](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/12/276570.htm) without showing any negative impact in accordance to "hollowing out". This reduction may actually be more akin to a "cutting the fat/waste". In addition, the hollowing out is based on [Tillerson's](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/tillerson-state-department-town-hall/index.html) call, not Trump's.
1.7.1.10.4.4.3. Pro: Trump has [downsized the EPA](https://www.propublica.org/article/brain-drain-at-the-epa).
1.7.1.10.4.4.3.1. Con: The EPA reduction was a departure based on a new administration taking over, which is typical.
1.7.1.10.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: The EPA's job over the past 12 years has [expanded](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/critics-hear-epas-voice-in-public-comments.html) way outside its bounds from a regulatory rule provider defining state requirements to a police force and bureaucratic agency. Frequent issues around the EPA stepping on FBI and OSHA's toes mean it needs to be [reined](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/245201-drowning-by-epa-overreach) in.
1.7.1.10.4.4.4. Con: None of the provided information is against the law to the extent that they could result in impeachment, nor do they have any defined negative impact.
1.7.1.10.4.4.4.1. Con: The information challenges the claim that Trump's actions have been primarily positive.
1.7.1.10.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.5.
1.7.1.10.4.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.1.2.5.
1.7.1.10.4.7. Con: How well someone is doing as president should not preclude them from facing justice for legal crimes.
1.7.1.10.4.7.1. Pro: Claim to virtues or accomplishments do not excuse one from obeying the law.  If some action of the President would be grounds for impeachment were he not effective or advancing U.S. interests, it constitutes similarly valid grounds even if he is.
1.7.1.10.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.
1.7.2. Con: The purpose of impeachment is removal from office, not the administration of justice.
1.7.2.1. Con: An important point to keep in mind is that impeachment is essentially the discovery phase of a trial. It’s purpose is to bring up charges and amass evidence that will be adjudicated on by the Senate. The purpose of impeachment is not to remove a president from office, it is merely the beginning of that process.
1.7.3. Con: While it wouldn't hold him accountable, it would be a first step in putting him into a position where he could be held accountable.
1.7.4. Pro: Removing Trump from office will allow external actors to influence the machinery of the US society.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Impeachment by this process will make it easier for others like extremists to [stall](https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/12/18/heres-how-much-the-formal-impeachment-inquiry-has-cost-taxpayers-so-far/) US politics and society, grinding it to a halt, [paralyzing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/democrats-congress-trump-impeach-rashida-tlaib) it and causing it to [cease](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/we-asked-arabs-muslims-about-impeachment-heres-what-they-said) functioning. This is because all time, attention and money will need to be put in investigations and trials and not proper legislative work, such as passing laws and running the country.
1.7.5. Pro: There are other ways to hold Trump accountable for his actions that do not require something as tumultuous as impeachment.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Trump can be held accountable by voting him out of office in 2020.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: The country has a better chance of holding Trump [legally accountable after he is voted out of office.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/06/how-trump-could-be-prosecuted-after-the-white-house-227050)
1.7.5.1.2. Con: If he deserves to be impeached, it should be done immediately.
1.7.5.1.3. Con: The founding fathers explicitly included Impeachment in the constitution in order to handle cases of [abuse](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed65.asp) by a president. The election is very deliberately not the only way to deal with Presidents and other officials caught [abusing the power of their office](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/779938819/fractured-into-factions-what-the-founders-feared-about-impeachment).
1.7.5.1.4. Con: An election every four years does not provide enough of a check on a president who is unfit and abusing the power of the office.
1.7.5.1.5. Pro: Trump is [unlikely to be reelected anyway](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/). It may not be worth the effort, and [impeachment is no guarantee of removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States), because it is just an indictment, not a conviction. No U.S. president has ever been removed from office after impeachment. Johnson and Clinton were acquitted, and Nixon resigned on his own before being impeached.
1.7.5.1.5.1. Con: The likelihood of reelection is not particularly relevant. If Trump's behavior is explicitly impeachable, then it is the duty of Congress to impeach him.
1.7.5.1.5.2. Con: Many of Trump's alleged offenses include a variety of attempts to significantly sway the outcome of the 2020 election. Attacks upon the impartiality of our elections cannot be tolerated, not least because it calls into question the people's ability to enforce their choice whether or not to reelect him.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Impeachment should only be used in the most dire circumstances. The checks and balances in the government are working, just like the worked when Obama or Bush were president.
1.7.5.3. Con: It doesn't matter if a method is tumultuous.
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: An alternative is [censure](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/barring-impeachment-democrats-could-still-censure-trump.html), which is a public condemnation and is probably no less tumultuous.
1.7.5.4. Pro: When a President's party does poorly in a midterm election, [it is generally seen as a rejection of his presidency](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/politics/democratic-wave-election-2018/index.html). Therefore, dissatisfied voters held Trump accountable by voting for Democratic candidates in the 2018 election.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: This is the equivalent of a mild slap on the wrist, and has had no apparent impact on the president's behavior.
1.7.5.4.1.1. Pro: The result of the mid-term elections has not substantially altered or impacted Trump's behaviour, in any objective, noticeable or measurable manner.
1.7.5.4.1.2. Pro: This punishes Congressmen and Senators and has no direct impact on the President themselves.
1.7.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: This is the equivalent of punishing someone else for your wrong doings. If you have empathy, it might discourage you a little, but it has no direct impact or bearing on you.
1.7.5.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: This would not discourage a psychopath or sociopath in the least.
1.7.5.4.1.3. Pro: At most, it is like giving points on a drivers license for causing death by dangerous driving. While it has some impact on the individual and may curb the behaviour, the punishment is disproportionate \(too lenient\) to the crime, and may instead embolden the behaviour or at the very least not act as a deterrent at all.
1.7.5.5. Pro: People who were wronged by Trump can bring civil suits against him to be compensated for the harm.
1.7.5.5.1. Con: [Nixon v. Fitzgerald](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731) established a doctrine of "Presidential Immunity" whereby Donald Trump cannot be held personally liable for his actions within the scope of presidential duties. People who suffered damages due to Trump's actions as president cannot sue him.
1.7.5.5.1.1. Con: [Nixon v. Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._Fitzgerald) and the presidential immunity doctrine do not protect the president from acts committed prior to his tenure as president. Given that he has harmed many people prior to assuming the presidency, the Presidential Immunity Doctrine does not apply to those cases.
1.7.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: A woman was able to [proceed with a sexual harassment lawsuit against President Bill Clinton](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/28/opinion/the-limits-of-presidential-immunity.html), while he was in office, arising from his conduct while Governor of Arkansas.
1.7.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: The Presidential Immunity Doctrine only covers actions of the office of the president. It does not protect him if he were to do something illicit in office that is not part of the duties of the president.
1.7.5.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The problem here is that Nixon v. Fitzgerald \(and the Constitution\) are fuzzy on where exactly the "duties of the President" end. There are legitimate [legal opinions which interpret these duties so broadly as to effectively immunize any sitting president from any lawsuit](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/presidents-immune-civil-lawsuits-state-court-private-conduct), and the courts have not really settled many questions on the matter. [Zervos v. Trump](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellefabio/2017/12/06/ny-judge-to-decide-whether-defamation-lawsuit-against-trump-can-move-forward/#15d8b28d68fd), for example will set precedent on whether a sitting president can be sued in a state court.
1.7.5.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Trump's lawyer is trying to classify the statement of "liar" as political opinion, additionally the "cousin" of [Zervos](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/301156-trump-campaign-releases-statement-from-accusers-cousin) has come forward to refute her previously.
1.7.5.5.1.1.3. Con: While Presidential Immunity is undoubtedly limited in scope, it does mean that not all people who are wronged by Donald Trump have legal recourse outside of impeachment. People can be wronged within the scope of Presidential duties and powers.
1.7.5.6. Pro: Important executive appointments and all federal judicial appointments must be [approved by the Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent). Congress can hold Trump accountable by refusing to approve his nominees.
1.7.5.6.1. Con: Refusing to approve his nominees would not affect his behavior.
1.7.6. Pro: Like President Gerald Ford, a President Pence would likely use his executive power to [pardon his predecessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon).
1.8. Pro: Trump should be impeached on political grounds.
1.8.1. Pro: Removal of Trump will help global perception of the US.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Trump's "[America First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_\(policy\))" mentality will continue to isolate the US. By impeaching him, America's allies will regain trust that America is for them.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Other countries are for themselves, as been shown over the last several years in the policies related funding, trade and resource distribution. The US should not be any different, as it would be detrimental to the economy.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Russia's geopolitical actions](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron) slow the US's countering of North Korea's nuclear arms and Syria's government actions.
1.8.1.2. Pro: [Trump's anti-immigrant stance](https://mtstandard.com/opinion/columnists/millennial-view-trump-s-anti-immigrant-stance-is-all-about/article_1a321df8-8275-5f58-9e67-a6f5b5f0a8ce.html) has been received very negatively abroad, changing the way the world sees America, the supposed 'land of the free'.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: Even Europe protects its own borders and is too distracted with an [immigration](http://thefederalist.com/2017/07/18/unable-confront-migrant-crisis-europe-committing-suicide/) [crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/hungary-is-making-europes-migrant-crisis-worse.html) to even have an opinion on American immigration.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many European states [failed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/europe-trumps-travel-ban) to criticise Trump's travel ban.
1.8.1.3. Con: While this would be politically expedient, it is not a grounds for impeachment.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.
1.8.1.4. Pro: Trump was [booed at the WEF](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/trump-booed-davos-2018-jeered-fake-news-media-speech-us-president-wef-latest-a8179471.html) in Davos.
1.8.1.5. Con: We cannot sacrifice a democratically elected leader for a popularity contest.
1.8.1.5.1. Con: The impeachment process is integral to the United States Constitution's separation of powers and put in place for a person like Donald Trump.
1.8.1.5.2. Con: Democratic election is more accurately described as a popularity contest than impeachment.
1.8.1.6. Con: Trump is known as a man of strength after his most recent visit to China. He has stood before the UN and stated without shame that the US's top priority is its people. This will only hurt the US' reputation among those who sought to use the US for financial gain of their own.
1.8.1.6.1. Con: "Man of strength' is not an objectively verifiable claim.
1.8.1.6.2. Con: Trump's global reputation as thin-skinned, incompetent, regressive, and dangerous, based on his actions and behaviour throughout his campaign and presidency, was not reversed by something he said at one meeting in China. Many people are not even aware that he said that.
1.8.1.7. Con: Perception of the U.S. on a global level will always be perceived through the media in which it is permitted, filtered by the owners of that media.
1.8.1.7.1. Pro: There is evidence that media outlets are biased in favor of impeachment. They are [misreporting facts and presenting false information](https://gop.com/the-highly-anticipated-2017-fake-news-awards/) about Donald Trump.
1.8.1.7.2. Con: While media plays a large part in foreign perception of the US, tourism is another significant factor that can be extremely difficult for consolidated entities to control.
1.8.1.7.3. Con: Perception of Trump is perceived primarily from recorded video or audio, from his official statements, and from his tweets.
1.8.1.8. Pro: Trump has consistently passed derogatory remarks against other politicians.
1.8.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.1.5.1.
1.8.1.8.2. Pro: For years now, Trump has been [calling](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/2/20702029/donald-trump-racism-squad-tweets-media-2020) Sen. Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas”, which is explicit bullying with a sheen of bigotry.
1.8.1.9. Pro: The Office of President of the United States is one that the people of other nations look to in order to understand the attitudes and direction that the government and people of the United States are embracing, so by upsetting the global perception Trump is affecting how US citizens are perceived.
1.8.1.9.1. Pro: Impeaching Donald Trump communicates to the public, the world, and future presidents, that the actions he has taken thus far are unacceptable for the post.
1.8.1.9.1.1. Pro: If a president is allowed to behave any way not legally acceptable, his [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump) poisons the presidency for the future.
1.8.1.9.2. Con: All over the world, countries put themselves first when considering immigration applications, international trade, defense, global welfare, world policing, etc. The US is not the first or most nationalistic country in the world.
1.8.1.9.2.1. Con: Part of putting one's self or one's nation first is doing right by others in order to gather friends and allies on whom you can count to come to your assistance in times of need and not to try to steal from or take advantage of you when times are good.
1.8.1.10. Pro: Trump has made racist and derogatory comments about other nations.
1.8.1.10.1. Con: The above claim conflates Race and Nationality. Disparaging a country and its citizens is not the same as disparaging a race.
1.8.1.10.1.1. Con: Derogatory generalizations about any class of people are both false and immoral. They are products of amorality and a weak intellect, unfit for the high office of President.
1.8.1.10.2. Pro: Trump is blatantly alienating our allies and befriending our "enemies"- i.e. dictators who stand against everything our country stands for. This is weakening our country, our safety and the world order for democracy.
1.8.1.10.3. Pro: Trump has called African nations "[shitholes](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-doesnt-deny-calling-african-countries-shitholes-2018-4)."
1.8.1.10.4. Pro: Trump's repeated racist comments are also increasing the sentiments of racism among the citizens of the United States.
1.8.1.10.4.1. Pro: A Pew poll [found that](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/2/20702029/donald-trump-racism-squad-tweets-media-2020) “it’s become more common for people \[in the US\] to express racist views since Trump became president.”
1.8.2. Con: Any political malfeasance can be stopped or reversed by the other branches of government. Trump is a President, not a King.
1.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.8.2.2. Con: The branches of government don't check every action of the President - the President is responsible for a set of duties, and political malfeasance in those duties \(also known as dereliction of duty\) is grounds for impeachment.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: The other branches can check every action of the executive.  Failing to do so is dereliction of their duty, not the executives.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.1.2.
1.8.4. Con: Impeachment \(with no proof of wrongdoing\) is an attempted shortcut to avoid the electoral process.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Impeachment and removal would mean removing the President selected by the election process, thus nullifying the 2016 election decision.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: The people also voted for a Vice President, who will take over if the President is removed. Thus, the election results are not fully nullified.
1.8.4.1.2. Con: That people voted for the President does not negate the necessity, existence, or warrantability of the legislatures enumerated power to check the executive.
1.8.4.1.3. Con: [Three years have passed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump) since the President's inauguration, making impeachment too far removed in time to be considered a nullification of the election.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Impeachment bears the possibility of barring the President from running for re-election, thus reducing choice of the electorate.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: The electorate can still choose from any other available candidate; they just could not vote for a candidate who has committed acts that meet the constitutional standard for impeachment and removal.
1.8.4.2.2. Con: It bears the possibility, but not the guarantee. The senate can chose to remove, with no bar on running again, thus allowing the people a say in the matter.
1.8.4.3. Con: Impeachment with "no proof" of wrong doing is very unlikely to pass in the House, and almost guaranteed to fail in the Senate.
1.8.5. Pro: There are multiple representatives raising the motion to impeach based on Trump [violating regulations](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/cohen-articles-of-impeachment/index.html).
1.8.5.1. Con: Without evidence to process these claims, this is a procedural motion with no hope of passing, given no charges have been filed. This means, as a procedural motion, it is political.
1.8.5.1.1. Pro: The political nature of the claims inherently implies organized efforts to impeach. Therefore, multiple sources of motions to impeach aren’t proof of independent action, to the contrary, they bolster the statement regarding the political nature of the attacks.
1.8.5.2. Con: The violations have yet to be proven and as such are unproven allegations.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Impeaching President Trump for his "high crimes" against the U.S. will set an important precedent for future presidents that they are not above the law, even though they hold the most powerful leadership position in the world.
1.8.6. Pro: It is in the Republicans' interest to impeach Trump as this reduces the chances that the Democrats would take power in the next election.
1.8.6.1. Pro: [A poll](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/29/politics/poll-2020-trump-democrats/index.html) revealed that more than half of Americans think Trump will lose in 2020.
1.8.6.2. Pro: [Just 36 percent](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/23/trump-democrats-2020-election-603421) say they would vote to reelect the president in 2020, compared with 44 percent who would pick the Democrat.
1.8.6.3. Con: Twenty months in, Trump has more or less the [highest ever](https://qz.com/1295674/donald-trump-now-owns-the-republican-party/) approval ratings in the Republican party for a Republican president in the modern era during peacetime. Impeaching him would be catastrophic for Republican party
1.8.6.3.1. Con: However, he has, [on aggregate from multiple sources](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/), the lowest public approval and highest public disapproval ratings of a sitting president in the last century, with the exception of Truman. This is dangerous for the Republican party from a voting perspective.
1.8.6.3.2. Con: It's unclear how that number \(a majority of a minority of the percentage of Americans who vote\) is affected by the people who have left the Republican party because of Trump, or never joined, or would carry over to the next Republican president.
1.8.6.4. Con: Impeaching someone for political alignment not being with party would not be a legal grounds for impeachment.
1.8.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.
1.8.7. Pro: Trump is Russia's [favoured candidate](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-fury-intel-briefing-shows-084315257.html) and it is widely believed within the intelligence community that [they are helping, or at least trying to help](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-meddling-us-election-boost-trump-lawmakers-told-094653210.html), him get re-elected. [Trump was furious at this assessment and seeks to cover it up.](https://uk.yahoo.com/news/us-intelligence-chief-replaced-clash-013801589.html) He did before, and [is doing so again now](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-rejects-intelligence-warning-russia-172833477.html).
1.8.7.1. Pro: Anything that is good for Russia, [an avowed enemy of the United States](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-fury-intel-briefing-shows-084315257.html), and that they want, should be viewed with suspicion and not in America's interest. If they want Trump as President, this is unlikely to be a good thing for the US and means there are likely links.
1.8.8. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.1.3.1.2.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.
1.8.10. Con: Politically, it would be a more impactful social rejection of Donald Trump's movement for him to lose a fair election badly.
1.8.10.1. Con: If he deserves to be impeached, it should be done expeditiously. Waiting for an election could risk him repeating his misdeeds.
1.8.10.2. Con: In this situation the very misdeeds that Trump has been accused of jeopardizes the possibility of a fair election.
1.8.10.3. Con: Given the historical frequency and follow-through of impeachment proceedings, impeaching Trump would have a far greater social and political impact than a landslide loss.
1.8.10.3.1. Con: The most recent president to be impeached, Bill Clinton, enjoyed a [jump in popularity](https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/20/impeachment.poll/) and positive [congressional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1998) [electoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2000) results for his party.
1.8.11. Con: -> See 1.7.1.10.4.
1.9. Pro: Trump should be impeached on ethical and moral grounds, in part for harming the wellbeing of US citizens.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Trump's polarising effect is negatively affecting US citizens.
1.9.2.1. Con: Removing any president who causes division is not a feasible political principle. The nature of polarization means that most people will tend to excuse this quality in any president they tend to agree with.
1.9.2.2. Con: Impeaching Trump, particularly if it's perceived to be politically motivated, would increase the polarization of the country.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: The Trump presidency is a symptom of a broken American government and/or political system. Removing Trump for any reason while allowing that system to remain unchanged would be counterproductive.
1.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: Trump's [inept administrative leadership](https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-is-trumps-staff-turnover-higher-than-the-5-most-recent-presidents/) undermines foundational American institutions, and his divisive politics mobilize [a sizable internal resistance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/resistance-trump-blossoming-movement-la-kaufmann). This may be enough to enable some sort of revolutionary backlash against the American system to succeed.
1.9.2.2.1.1.1. Con: A "revolutionary backlash" should be prevented, as it would likely cause considerable suffering and destruction.
1.9.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Social psychologists posit "[false uniqueness / false consensus](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-15558-001)" as [keys to maintaining an entrenched social condition that would otherwise be economically or socially untenable](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/Monin_Norton_2003.pdf). This includes everything from simple social taboos to complex repression \(i.e. minority rule, economic exploitation, etc.\). The more vocally aggrieved people there are, the less power these biases have to stymie social change.
1.9.2.2.1.2. Con: The costs of letting the Trump presidency continue are too consequential to justify any potential benefits that might be borne of the crisis. It is unfair to ask the individuals and classes that Trump harms to simply "take one for the team."
1.9.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.9.2.2.1.3. Pro: If Trump is a result of a broken system, that system will inevitably give rise to someone else who is as bad or worse.
1.9.2.2.1.4. Con: Trump's actions may send America into a spiraling decline, both at home and abroad, from which no revolutionary backlash, 'lessons learned', or future efforts could recover.
1.9.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: Trump's actions may damage important security and economic relationships with key allies and, during the time of Trump's tenure, these allies are forced to continue making economic and security decisions and relationships. Trump's tenure at this time may force key allies to move toward other partners and away from America in ways that have permanent impacts on our security and prosperity.
1.9.2.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.9.2.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.9.2.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.6.
1.9.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: Many [scientists](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-08-04/urgent-action-needed-in-light-of-new-climate-change-studies-scientists-say) believe we are within a critical window to address climate change and, as the world's largest per-capita polluter, Trump's failure to take needed action on this issue may result in permanent, irreversible climate impacts.
1.9.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: Experts warn and history shows that democracy is fragile, and Trump critics believe he exhibits [authoritarian](http://www.newsweek.com/harvard-political-science-professor-donald-trump-authoritarian-how-democracy-778425) tendencies.  If Trump undermines democratic processes and institutions, rule of law, and public expectations, America may plunge into authoritarian control, of which it may take centuries to recover from if we ever do.
1.9.2.2.1.5. Pro: Impeaching Donald Trump undermines the power foundations of those who supported him.
1.9.2.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.5.
1.9.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: Many within the Republican party who supported Trump will suffer when the president is impeached.
1.9.2.2.1.5.2.1. Con: The Republican Party [chose Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/opinion/trump-impeachment-clinton.html). He is what they wanted. If he is bad for them, then they should reap what they have sown, politically-speaking.
1.9.2.2.1.5.2.2. Con: Impeaching Trump would be [politically expedient](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/478855-republicans-will-pay-on-election-day-for-politicizing-trumps-impeachment) for the [Republicans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/18/impeachment-isnt-democrats-vs-republicans-its-right-vs-wrong/).
1.9.2.2.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Moderate voters concerned about the moral viability of Republican candidates who view Trump as impeachable may have their concerns relieved if Republicans support Trump's Impeachment.
1.9.2.2.1.5.2.3. Pro: The impeachment of a Republican president would permanently tarnish their reputation.
1.9.2.2.1.5.3. Pro: Impeaching Trump without any evidence of illegal activities would only prove to his supporters that their opinions and vote doesn't matter, further dividing the nation.
1.9.2.2.1.5.3.1. Con: Not impeaching Trump tells his voters that their candidate and the president can get away with impeachable offenses just because we are worried they might feel like their vote and opinions don't matter. Law and order should be chosen over opinions and bad votes.
1.9.2.2.1.5.4. Con: If impeaching Trump becomes the will of the majority of the American public as expressed by its elected representatives, our system dictates that Trump supporters' wishes should be overruled.
1.9.2.2.1.5.4.1. Con: Contrary to the above claim, the US system does not dictate the [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority). The system was established with safeguards against such abuses.
1.9.2.2.1.5.4.1.1. Con: [Impeachment was established as a systemic check on the Presidency in the original text of the Constitution.](http://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) Carrying out that procedure as designed can hardly be considered an abuse. Rather it is the system working as it was intended.
1.9.2.2.1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: The preceding claims that "Trump should be impeach if it becomes the will of the majority" are not attempts to follow the Impeachment process as designed. Applying it for purposes other than those enumerated \(treason, bribery, crimes\) is a clear abuse of power.
1.9.2.2.1.5.4.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5. Pro: Trump was [democratically elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump) and many Americans [still support him](https://news.gallup.com/poll/271691/trump-approval-inches-support-impeachment-dips.aspx).
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.1.2.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.2. Con: Both the Republican party and the Democrats have [lost confidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html) in the president’s ability to govern.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.3. Con: Although he was elected, he did not [win the popular vote](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/22/donald-trump-popular-vote-electoral-college-2020).
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.3.1. Con: The popular vote is not currently, nor ever has been, the way the USA has elected a president.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.4. Pro: Given his impeachment is debatable at present, impeaching Trump now could rupture the American democracy, which is one of the few in the world which is stable after centuries.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.4.1. Con: This argument makes the assumption that Trump has not committed any crimes to justify impeachment.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.5. Con: Neither of these conditions historically precludes impeachment.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.5.1. Pro: None of the other things Trump has done has been historically used to impeach a President.
1.9.2.2.1.5.5.5.1.1. Con: As [only two Presidents](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/presidential-impeachment-usa-often-has-happened/) have ever been impeached, binding historical precedent has not been established.
1.9.2.2.1.5.6. Con: Impeachment is not an act of subversion.  It's every bit as legal, valid, and constitutional as the Electoral College.
1.9.2.2.1.5.7. Pro: Although there may be grounds on which to impeach the president, he should remain in office as it is more important for the US electorate to learn the consequences of voting for someone without due experience.
1.9.2.2.1.5.7.1. Con: The public should have the power to change its mind.
1.9.2.2.1.5.7.2. Con: It should be up to the public to define "Due experience."
1.9.2.2.1.5.8. Con: The Republican voters would not be undermined should the President be impeached; seeing as the Republican Party's ideology will stand as the ambitions for the still-GOP presidency.
1.9.2.2.1.5.8.1. Con: This assumes a blind tribalism among all Trump voters, many of whom were independent or voted for Trump because he did not campaign as a traditional Republican. Trump clearly delineated himself as something different than the status quo.
1.9.2.2.1.5.8.1.1. Con: Given their continued support in the face of a [mess of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSE-XoVKaXg) [self-contradictions](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/ranked-donald-trumps-foreign-policy-contradictions/513635/) in Trump's [public policy actions](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-denies-reached-daca-deal-democrats-article-1.3495117) and [stances](https://www.elitedaily.com/news/politics/much-needed-reddit-finds-trumps-contradictory-tweets-dont/1955264), it is reasonable to conclude that committed Trump supporters could only be blind adherents to a cult of personality.
1.9.2.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.1.5.7.
1.9.2.2.1.7. Con: Whether it would be subjectively "better" or "worse" has no effect on the process on impeachment.
1.9.2.2.1.7.1. Con: As impeachment is a primarily political institution designed to check the power of the presidency, "better/worse" should be the primary consideration when weighing impeachment.
1.9.2.2.1.7.1.1. Con: This is incorrect. [Impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_4:_Impeachment) is designed to remove all civil officers who are convicted of Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
1.9.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.9.2.4. Con: The act of polarizing requires two entities with opposing interests. In this case, two political parties. These parties have always been at odds. Trump is not the polarizing factor, politics are.
1.9.2.4.1. Con: Trump exemplifies the polarization factor, and does little if anything to reduce this. He has spread misinformation and lies and this proliferation violates his duties as President to "form a more perfect union" and "establish justice". He is campaigning for re-election rather than running the country as he promised in his oath of office.
1.9.2.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.8.
1.9.3. Con: There are no clear examples of Trump placing US citizens in harm's way or decreasing the well being of US citizens. Without a clear and distinct act, there are no grounds for impeachment.
1.9.3.1. Con: The above statement is not a requirement for the process of impeachment to be warranted.
1.9.4. Pro: Trump has repeatedly attacked the first amendment to freedom of speech by attacking the free press. This is unconstitutional and worthy of impeachment.
1.9.4.1. Con: President Trump has made no effort to abridge freedom of the press. This is strongly supported by how [negative](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/02/555092743/study-news-coverage-of-trump-more-negative-than-for-other-presidents) his press coverage is.
1.9.4.2. Con: Trump has shown personal disdain for certain groups he considers fake news but has not made an effort to take away their rights.
1.9.4.3. Con: It would be unconstitutional for Trump to be impeached for exercising his first amendment right to speak his mind and defend himself against a press that frequently attacks him.
1.9.4.3.1. Pro: Even if Trump has out-rightly advocated that we censor the press, it would not be unconstitutional, given how even speech like that is protected by the first amendment \(which guards free speech, not some speech\).
1.9.4.3.2. Con: Constitutional rights may extend to the president, but he has constitutional duties to the people, which may also include not deceiving the public. In so far as his free speech conflicts with upholding his official duties, his free use of speech may in some cases be an impeachable offense.
1.9.4.4. Pro: Trump's anti-press rhetoric is a means of breaking down the important [democratic role](https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trumps-attacks-press-attack-democracy/) it plays in keeping the presidential power and authority in check.
1.9.4.5. Pro: [Trump's ban](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/media-blocked-white-house-briefing-sean-spicer) of media outlets that are critical of his actions is an infringement on freedom of speech.
1.9.4.6. Con: Trump's criticism of 'fake news' stories in the media is [entirely justified](https://gop.com/the-highly-anticipated-2017-fake-news-awards/).
1.9.4.6.1. Con: Trump tends to label anything negative about himself as "fake news", while doing nothing to discourage or attack other sources of fake news, such as [Pizzagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory#Responses).
1.9.4.7. Pro: [Some would claim](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-02/senate-impeachment-acquittal-of-trump-won-t-be-the-end) that Trumps attempts to get Ukraine to interfere in the elections is a violation of citizens First Amendment rights.
1.9.5. Pro: Trump's views on immigration are harmful to people.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Trump's [border wall](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37243269) between the US and Mexico will not stop immigration, meaning it is a wasteful use of tax payers' money, which could instead be used more efficiently on other, more pressing citizen needs.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: Wasteful spending and inefficiency are not grounds for impeachment, as they are not in and of themselves high crimes or[misdemeanors](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html).
1.9.5.1.2. Con: Equally important is the message it sends. Just Trump getting elected alone and talking tough on immigration has resulted in [significant reductions in immigration rates.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/9/illegal-immigration-southwest-border-down-70-pct/)
1.9.5.1.3. Con: It is debatable on whether or not the wall will be effective.
1.9.5.1.3.1. Pro: Other countries, [like Turkey](http://uk.businessinsider.com/turkey-is-building-a-wall-along-its-border-to-keep-out-isis-militants-2015-7?r=US&IR=T), have walls for national security to combat IS.
1.9.5.1.4. Pro: [Texas smugglers](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/25/texas-smugglers-say-trumps-border-wall-wouldnt-stop-immigrants-drugs-p/) have said that the wall will be ineffective in stopping drugs and immigrants from making it over the border.
1.9.5.1.4.1. Con: The argument relied on is that US officials can be bribed. Although no doubt true to an extent, this argument is intrinsically flawed because such bribery can only happen relatively rarely without getting caught. It is totally implausible that there could be enough bribery to allow illegal aliens to flood the border in their current numbers.
1.9.5.1.5. Pro: The wall would do little to stop the [inflow of heroin](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/11/13/why-donald-trumps-wall-wont-keep-heroin-out-of-america) into the USA, as most heroin that comes across the Mexican border is transported by vehicle and smuggled through official entry points because it is a low-volume, high-value commodity.
1.9.5.1.5.1. Con: The inflow of heroin is not what the wall is primarily intended to stop.
1.9.5.1.6. Con: [51% of Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/06/27/what-do-americans-think-about-the-wall-the-answers-may-surprise-you-only-if-you-read-drudge/) believe building a wall with Mexico is a good thing, indicating it is a pressing need for citizens and so should be constructed.
1.9.5.1.7. Con: Mexico will ultimately pay for the wall and enjoy it, [according to Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/may/30/mexico-will-pay-for-border-wall-and-enjoy-it-says-trump-video), and so the cost to tax payers will be minimal in the long run.
1.9.5.1.7.1. Con: Trump still has not proposed exactly how Mexico will pay for it and they keep repeatedly denying that they will. Nor is there any evidence that they will "enjoy" it.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Trump's administration is [splitting up families](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children/exclusive-trump-administration-considering-separating-women-children-at-mexico-border-idUSKBN16A2ES) at the Mexico border, thereby causing immeasurable distress.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: The fault of that distress lies on the illegal aliens themselves for breaking the law, not on the government for enforcing the law.
1.9.5.2.2. Pro: This policy is illegal and is considered a [war crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/world/americas/us-un-migrant-children-families.html) by the UN.
1.9.5.3. Pro: Trump's [deportation plans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandafabian/2018/03/04/undocumented-entrepreneurs-how-deportations-could-hurt-the-u-s-economy/) could negatively affect US industries.
1.9.5.4. Con: There will always be negative consequences to significant political action. Trump's action on immigration, particularly illegal immigration will hurt some families but help the country.
1.9.5.4.1. Pro: Illegal immigration threatens [democracy](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/did-votes-by-noncitizens-cost-trump-the-2016-popular-vote-sure-looks-that-way/) in the US.
1.9.5.4.1.1. Con: The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) of the US Constitution grants that all persons [born or naturalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Children_born_to_foreign_nationals) in the United States are citizens and are guaranteed "equal protection of the laws." Representation is perhaps one of few core protections of living within a democratic system. The representation of people governed by the system cannot threaten democracy.
1.9.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: [The Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) claims that the Rights written into the Constitution are inalienable and apply to all people, citizen or not.
1.9.5.4.2. Pro: Illegal immigration places American workers at a [disadvantage](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/2/16/18355997/at-major-northwest-side-bakery-labor-issues-pit-blacks-vs-hispanics).
1.9.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.8.3.
1.9.5.4.4. Con: It doesn't help, but hurts the US, because ripping families apart leaves a dark stain on our reputation based on American values. Human life should always take precedence.
1.9.5.5. Con: Trump's views are far less harmful than Obama's [indiscriminate killing](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush) of people through drone strikes. Obama did not face impeachment for this, and so it is hypocritical to call for Trump's impeachment for treatment of foreigners breaking US laws that does not involve indiscriminate death.
1.9.5.5.1. Con: Indiscriminate drone warfare predates the Obama administration, and continued into the Trump administration.
1.9.5.5.1.1. Pro: Indiscriminate drone warfare [violates the American ideals](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5571&context=flr) of due process of law, and undermines the American position in the world, regardless of whom committed the offense \([Bush](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/drone-war/data/the-bush-years-pakistan-strikes-2004-2009), [Obama](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/covering_obamas_secret_war.php), and [Trump](https://merip.org/2018/02/trumps-drone-surge/) have held office while drones and other less discriminate attacks killed civilians and spurred further hatred of America in the process\).
1.9.5.5.2. Pro: In one [strike](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush), Obama killed twenty-one children, 10 of whom were under five, and twelve women, five of whom were pregnant.
1.9.5.6. Pro: Trump has made [claims that immigrants are violent criminals](https://www.cato.org/blog/illegal-immigrants-crime-assessing-evidence) when the [facts of immigrants and crime rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Relationship_between_illegal_immigration_and_crime) do not substantiate this claim.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.9.7. Con: The Constitution calls for this only for "[High crimes and Misdemeanors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors)." Misdemeanors in that context refers to breaches of public trust. No such crime has been proven.
1.9.7.1. Con: Asking another leader to do opposition research on a rival he might have to run against in order to release military aid and an official White House visit does not engender public trust.
1.9.8. Pro: Trumps [moral character](https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-liquor-license-international-hotel/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_c908b450b60611e8872dc93302272904) is being called into question by former judges and several religious leaders for various reasons.
1.9.9. Pro: Citizens For Ethics has called Trump’s time in office "[the most unethical presidency](https://www.citizensforethics.org/yearone/)".
1.9.10. Pro: Trump's tax proposal will further the wealth gap.
1.9.10.1. Con: A wealth gap in and of itself does not reflect that citizens are having their well-being harmed. It is simply a numerical difference between the poorest and richest in a country and not reflective of current or changing [living standards](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/09/how-americans-compare-with-the-global-middle-class/).
1.9.10.1.1. Con: While the gap does not prove harm, it may be a symptom of of the corruption of the public sphere in favor of private interests over public ones. Considering the linked article considers high income $50 per day \(56% of Americans\), it is possible it has nothing to do with the wealth gap or wealth inequality. The top [1% make more than $2740 per day](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/).
1.9.10.1.2. Pro: The [wealth gap](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219643/gini-coefficient-for-us-individuals-families-and-households/) changes in the US have had the largest separation in 1992 to 1994 and 2007 to 2011.
1.9.10.2. Con: As an [experienced businessman](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/donald-trump-success-story/), Trump is applying his knowledge to promote a corporation friendly environment in order to keep jobs in the US.
1.9.10.2.1. Con: Promoting a corporation friendly environment is not the duty of any elected public official. Private interests may run [contrary to the public interests](http://ingrimayne.com/econ/government/PublicPrivate.html), and the primary benefactor is rarely the public. The government ideally works for everyone's needs equally, not better for some than others.
1.9.10.3. Con: Breaking apart the tax proposal, there is no direct benefit to only the wealthy. Some may benefit overall, but given the [caps](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/here-are-the-finalize.html) being implemented, the wealthy "benefit the least" out of all wealth groups.
1.9.10.3.1. Pro: Interest paid on loans for vacation homes is no longer [deductible](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/013014/tax-breaks-secondhome-owners.asp). Surprisingly, this hits Trump pretty hard given his real estate standings.
1.9.10.3.2. Pro: Property, state and local income taxes face a combined [$10,000 deduction limit](https://www.taxslayer.com/tax-reform/state-and-local?rdr=/tax-reform/stateandlocal), overwhelmingly affecting high wealth areas with overblown tax rates. Specifically, high income land owners in NY and CA that don't qualify for systems like STAR in NY due to income.
1.9.10.3.3. Pro: Deduction limit pertaining to mortgage interest drops to [$750,000](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/taxes/real-estate-tax-deductions/can-i-still-deduct-my-mortgage-interest-2018/) of debt on primary residence. This overwhelmingly hits people like Trump that are real estate investors with millions in mortgage debt and leverage.
1.9.10.4. Pro: The budget bill proposes cutting [$473 billion](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/opinions/trump-tax-cuts-opinion-obeidallah/index.html) from Medicare over 10 years, which leaves those who rely on the program to cover their health costs at risk.
1.9.10.5. Con: The tax plan was [authored by](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-vote-republicans.html) congressional Republicans. Trump had little to do with it, and probably doesn't really understand it. Any problem with the tax plan needs to be taken up by those who voted to pass it.
1.9.10.6. Pro: Trump's tax plan includes weakening and then eliminating the [federal estate tax](http://fortune.com/2017/11/03/trump-gop-tax-plan-cuts-2017/), which is paid only by America's wealthiest households.
1.9.10.7. Pro: Trump's tax plan drops [corporate tax to 20%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/03/trump-gop-tax-plan-cuts-2017/), which primarily benefits rich corporations.
1.9.10.7.1. Con: Enacting an unpopular policy is not grounds for impeachment.
1.9.10.7.2. Con: Wealth is not a factor in the US tax system as we [pay tax based on income](https://www.myexpattaxes.com/do-expats-pay-us-taxes-depends-on-how-you-file). Wealthy typically have a "low" income as the money they make is based off investments.
1.9.10.7.3. Con: US corporations [pay taxes](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-taxing-wealthy-americans/) based on income, not wealth. Higher income tax rates hurt startups far more than large wealthy businesses.
1.9.10.7.4. Con: This is a tax to incentivise industry growth, which in turn will trickle down and create jobs for less wealthy classes.
1.9.10.7.4.1. Con: [Corporate tax](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/corporate-tax-cuts-skew-to-shareholders-and-ceos-not-workers-as-administration) cuts skew to benefit shareholders and CEOs, not workers lower-down the chain.
1.9.10.7.4.1.1. Con: This is only true with large publicly traded companies, not [small or medium](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/effective-tax-rate-size-income) [businesses](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs343tot.pdf). Large businesses use carrying debt as a way to hide income. Small or medium businesses cannot do that.
1.9.10.7.4.2. Con: "Trickle-down economics" is [flawed](http://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons). It only works if the extra profits a corporation makes due to lower taxes cause the corporation to pay higher wages, hire more people and lower their prices. Corporations therefore re-invest most extra profits back into the corporation, and the rest are distributed as dividends.
1.9.10.7.4.2.1. Pro: Basic corporate theory tells us that a corporation will do none of those things unless they have to, since the golden rule is to [maximize shareholder value](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20159343.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ae7e3de21f35167560fa78656585961cc).
1.9.10.7.4.2.2. Con: Re-investment and increased dividend payouts spur [more economic activity](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/2007a_bpea_baker.pdf), not less.
1.9.10.7.4.3. Pro: Lower corporate taxes will make American companies more competitive and discourage them from [moving abroad](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-will-tax-overhaul-affect-us-competitiveness). This means the companies are able to offer more jobs to American people.
1.9.10.7.4.4. Pro: Trickle down economics is at work right now. [125 companies](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1023848001) have announced pay raises or bonuses specifically correlating to the adopted tax plan.
1.9.10.7.5. Pro: The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation within the Congress has [shown](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html) that the tax bill will accelerate income inequality. Most of the cuts for those earning under $70k expire, whereas they do not for higher earners. This does not include effects due to loss of healthcare, corporate or estate tax effects which will add to the income disparity.
1.9.11. Con: Such a principal is not workable. Many government policies harm the well being of some US citizens. I.e., a minimum wage may be evaluated as harming the well being of a business owner who wold be better off paying lower wages.
1.9.11.1. Con: The government is designed to serve for the public good. This claim conflates the purpose of government with the actions of corrupt government \(i.e. serving private interests over the public interests it is founded to serve\).
1.9.11.1.1. Pro: When the constitution was drafted after the Revolutionary War, it was crafted in a way such that the government would serve the public interest. The revolutionaries were fed up with corruption whereby the government would only serve select and often remote interests that didn't represent the will or interest of the public at large. US government was founded on the principle of responsibility for serving the public it represents, as stated in the opening of the constitution.
1.9.11.2. Con: The well being of the average business owner is not harmed by a public that earns a living wage. In most cases a public that has financial resources may lead to more business transactions.
1.9.12. Con: Trump won't be able to carry out his presidential duties or campaign promises anymore, which would be a letdown for the people who voted him in \(which is a large portion of the US\).
1.9.12.1. Pro: He's very much tried to in terms of [keeping his word](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000) on what he said he would do to through building a wall, standing up to China, and bringing back jobs, whether he succeeded in doing so or not.
1.9.12.1.1. Con: This statement presupposes that any of those aims should be pursued at all.
1.9.12.1.1.1. Pro: The duties of the president to keep campaign promises are not defined by or mentioned in the constitutional duties he swore to uphold.
1.9.12.2. Con: Trump is already failing to carry out his presidential duties by [violating his oath of office](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/impeachment-trump/580468/) and constitutional duties to unite the American people. The use of the office of the president to spread lies to the American people is a travesty that undermines the future of everyone who believes his lies, and undermines his future as president.
1.9.13. Pro: The presidency should be held by someone who is a moral and intellectual example to the rest of the nation, which Trump is not.
1.9.13.1. Con: Trump's morals and intellect were known prior to the election.  The electorate judged him worthy of the position.
1.9.13.1.1. Pro: The general election is the best referendum on the moral character and example of sitting presidents, not impeachment.
1.9.13.1.1.1. Con: Due to the electoral college system and institutional racism and corruption, the election cannot be held as a reliable indication of the public's opinions or beliefs, much less by something as subjective as moral codes, ethics and such.
1.9.13.1.2. Con: [Since the Election, even more scandalous "dirt" and behavior has been revealed and come to light](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/trump-administration-conflicts/), despite Trumps best efforts to hide and conceal it. The[number of scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_scandals_in_the_United_States#Donald_Trump_administration_\(2017%E2%80%93present\)) is [so numerous,](https://www.businessinsider.com/21-scandals-that-rocked-the-trump-administration-in-2018-2018-11) it would be [very hard to be comprehensive](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/trump-scandals-unprecedented-president-180908070216183.html), or [list them all](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/opinion/trump-administration-corruption-conflicts.html) and would likely [derail a debate](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/trump-ukraine-texts/).
1.9.13.1.2.1. Con: Obama's tenancy and tenure as President was [just as Scandal ridden as Trumps, if not more so](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/10/01/trump_scandals_vs_obama_scandals_what_the_numbers_show_141375.html).
1.9.13.1.2.1.1. Con: None of Obama's scandals were personal.
1.9.13.1.3. Con: To be fair, [Trump received almost 3 million less votes than his rival and lost the popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election), thus an appeal to the electorate is hardly conclusive or definitive. He is President due to the [technicalities of the Electoral college system, not necessarily by the will of the majority of the Electorate.](https://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005330)
1.9.13.2. Con: The U.S. public has often lauded a ["Superhero President"](https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/article/superhuman-american-national-myth), which would encompass all virtues of the American public. Unfortunately this superhuman is not real, [and few presidents have held close to this ideal.](http://all-that-is-interesting.com/shocking-presidential-quotes)
1.9.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.9.13.4. Con: The Constitution clearly lays out who is allowed  to run for president. There is no "should be" such and such requirement.
1.9.13.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.9.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.9.
1.9.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.10.
1.9.14. Con: According to the [President's legal team](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-lawyer-dershowitz-argue-abuse-of-power-not-crime-2020-1), he must commit a violation of a federal law in order to be [impeached](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/us/politics/trump-impeachment-legal-defense.html). Ethical and moral grounds do not constitute a federal violation.
1.9.14.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.5.1.
1.9.15. Con: The decision of what is "good" or "bad" for the country is made at the election booth. Ethical and moral determinations are made by the electorate. Shifting those functions to an impeachment proceeding nullifies the system of democracy.
1.9.15.1. Con: All aspects of an impeachment proceeding are carried out by the people's elected representatives, so a credible threat of impeachment makes the system more democratic than simply allowing the Executive branch to act for a 4-year period without contemporaneous accountability.
