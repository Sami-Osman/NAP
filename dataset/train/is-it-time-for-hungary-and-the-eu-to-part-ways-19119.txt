Discussion Name: Is it Time for Hungary and the EU to Part Ways?

1. Hungary should leave the European Union.
1.1. Con: Leaving the EU would result in Hungarian people losing their EU citizenship, which provides important benefits for everyone.
1.1.1. Con: The citizenship goes both ways. Citizens of other EU member countries can move freely into Hungary and take Hungarian jobs.
1.1.1.1. Con: This happens to a lesser extent as Hungary is [poorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita) than other member states so there would be more opportunities in other countries.
1.1.1.2. Con: Hungary has an [exceptionally low](https://financialobserver.eu/ce/hungary/exceptionally-low-unemployment-rate-in-hungary/) unemployment rate compared to other European states.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [unemployment rate](https://countryeconomy.com/countries/compare/france/hungary) of 3.8% is the lowest in decades, and certainly is something Orban's government can be very proud of.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Since 2013 around 20-30.000 Hungarians [emigrate every year](https://dailynewshungary.com/how-many-people-do-you-think-emigrate-from-hungary-latest-statistics/). This means a significant reduction in the labour pool, which affects society and the economy negatively.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Those emigrating from Hungary [disproportionately](http://hungarianspectrum.org/2015/07/02/the-growing-hungarian-emigration/) have higher levels of education.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The low unemployment rate has come at the [cost of welfare](http://abouthungary.hu/blog/unemployment-in-hungary-hits-a-new-record-low/) spending and tax cuts for employers, increasing inequality in society.
1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: This low employment is in part due to a [public employment system](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-interior/news/government-s-public-employment-policy-is-successful) implemented by the Hungarian government.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Most of the European countries have a very complex and complicated [process](https://www.currencyfair.com/blog/what-eu-companies-need-to-know-about-hiring-non-european-union-nationals/) for employing foreigners, that is incomparably simpler, to say the least, for the citizens of the EU.
1.1.1.4. Con: The presence of these EU citizens is good because of the [brain drain](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/863689/eu-hungary-free-movement-brain-drain-tragedy) being experienced due to the large scale emigration of educated Hungarians.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Hungary has had [above average rates of growth](https://checkinprice.com/how-to-find-a-job-in-hungary-eu-and-non-eu-citizens/) in the past few years, which is an incentive for people from more struggling EU economies to go there for jobs.
1.1.2. Con: Free movement might be better for the individual but not for the whole country. Free movement to other countries means young people, skilled workers etc. leave Hungary for opportunities elsewhere.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Free movement fuels the rise of political ideologies like [populism and xenophobia](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/899709/european-union-hungary-prime-minister-Viktor-Orban-migration-eu).
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Immigrants tend to congregate together for the simple reason that people like being around people they relate to. So areas start looking ethnically ambiguous rather than distinctly Hungarian.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Xenophobia is also high in cities which are [completely unaffected by immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/28/hungary-election-viktor-orban-far-right-stokes-migration-fears-far-from-border) and free movement, implying that these are insufficient explanations for the phenomenon.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Immigrants in both the US and the EU have a tendency to move into "[ethnic enclaves](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2014/09/in-europe-and-america-segregation-continues/380408/)" for a sense of cultural and linguistic familiarity.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Free movement undermines the welfare state. It's [hard to know](https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/ide-vezetett-a-tomeges-kivandorlas-tobb-magyar-lepett-le-mint-gondoltuk.1.260665.html) how many people will be in the country at any given time, making welfare spending difficult to calculate.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: This puts states in a dangerous double bind. Either only help their citizens, making migrant workers worse off, when they take the jobs citizens wouldn't want anyway. Or they serve everyone, meaning there's less welfare for citizens, the people who pay taxes, live there and don't have the ability to leave.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Welfare is based on lawful registered residence in an EU member state that falls under defined categories \("exercising treaty rights" - employment, studying, etc.\). That would mean that there is no ambiguity about the number of people who are eligible in any one state.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: These policies are equally fueled by the refugee crisis which cannot be prevented by removing Hungary's visa free travel within the EU.
1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Without EU [quota systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/world/europe/eu-migrants-hungary-slovakia.html), Hungary could likely opt to accept fewer refugees, subduing the concerns of populists.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: In 2015, The European Commission launched an "infringement case" against Hungary over its [asylum legislation](https://www.todayonline.com/world/eu-executive-opens-case-against-hungary-over-its-asylum-law?page=1), which rejected mandatory migrant quotas.
1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Because Hungary is on the frontier of the European Union, it is unable to effectively police its borders and control the large number of immigrants who enter [illegally](http://abouthungary.hu/illegal-immigration/).
1.1.2.1.5. Con: The [vast majority](https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/ide-vezetett-a-tomeges-kivandorlas-tobb-magyar-lepett-le-mint-gondoltuk.1.260665.html) of Hungarians support free movement of labour within the EU, including Hungarian President [Viktor Orbán](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban/hungary-pm-warns-against-eroding-free-movement-for-eu-citizens-idUSKBN1CB0IE).
1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: Statistics show that Hungary has [less net emigration](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-exodus-examining-europes-falling-population-economic-perspective-33519/) than its neighbors \(including those outside the EU\).
1.1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: The World Bank’s net migration data from [2012 shows](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-exodus-examining-europes-falling-population-economic-perspective-33519/) that Romania has a net migration rate of -21.80%, Serbia -13.89%, Croatia 1.39%, and Hungary 1.33%.
1.1.2.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.5.1.
1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Free movement has created a [brain drain](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/863689/eu-hungary-free-movement-brain-drain-tragedy) in Hungary. An estimated 400,000 Hungarians have left the country since it joined the EU in 2004. According to the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, people leaving are mostly young, highly educated and single, and usually between 20 and 39.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: This “brain drain” and shortage of workers has become so severe that some politicians fear an [economic collapse](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/863689/eu-hungary-free-movement-brain-drain-tragedy) in the next 10 years.
1.1.2.5. Pro: In the presence of free movement, people are likely to leave Hungary for [economic opportunities](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/863689/eu-hungary-free-movement-brain-drain-tragedy). For instance, the minimum wage in Hungary is £360 per month, but in the UK or Germany the same jobs can fetch up to £1,256 per month.
1.1.2.6. Con: A lot of the money earned abroad in the EU returns to Hungary in the form of [remittances](https://tradingeconomics.com/hungary/remittances).
1.1.2.6.1. Con: Remittances in Hungary have [decreased](https://tradingeconomics.com/hungary/remittances) by over thirty million euros between the first and second quarters of 2018.
1.1.3. Pro: EU citizenship allows Hungarians to travel around 27 countries freely.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Since the enactment of [Directive 2004/38/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038) all member states have to ensure that there are no explicit or implicit barriers to the free movement of persons across the EU.
1.1.3.2. Con: Hungary could negotiate new visa agreements with many countries.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Leaving the EU would likely generate ill-will with other countries and make such agreements unlikely.
1.1.4. Pro: EU citizenship allows Hungarians to work in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The [free movement](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/41/free-movement-of-workers) of workers is a fundamental freedom protected by the EU.
1.1.4.2. Con: Given the [large number](https://budapestbeacon.com/600000-hungarians-living-eu-countries/) of Hungarians who are already residents of other EU states, Budapest would likely be able to negotiate reasonable work visa regulations with other EU member states.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Hungarian exit from the EU is likely to lead to [poorer relations](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/viktor-orban-hungary-eu-right-wing-migration-refugee-policy-bad-news-a8296276.html) with EU countries, making the negotiation of these visas very difficult.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: [Many Hungarians](https://budapestbeacon.com/600000-hungarians-living-eu-countries/) live in other EU states making Hungarian a part of the European identity.
1.1.5. Pro: EU citizenship allows Hungarians to study in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
1.1.5.1. Pro: While in 2016, an estimated 11,800 were studying outside Hungary, by 2017 it was around 13,300 students \(not counting those spending exchange semesters as part of Erasmus mobility programs\). Almost all of these students are studying in [EU countries](https://dailynewshungary.com/a-growing-number-of-hungarians-opt-to-study-abroad/).
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Non EU members are also in the [Erasmus](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/programme-guide/part-a/who-can-participate/eligible-countries_en) program.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Tuition in many EU countries \(Denmark, Austria, France, Germany, Greece, etc.\) is [free](https://www.study.eu/article/study-in-europe-for-free-or-low-tuition-fees) for students from EU countries.
1.1.6. Con: Compared to other Europeans, [significantly fewer](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) Hungarians claim to have benefited from opportunities derived from their EU citizenship. These findings suggest that what the European Union perceives as benefits for the Hungarians is not necessarily what the majority of the Hungarian population actually needs.
1.1.7. Pro: EU citizens have the right to [medical treatment](https://www.giovani.com.cy/news/32-interested-in-a-second-citizenship-here-are-5-benefits-about-the-eu-citizenship-you-probably-didn-t-know) in any EU country by applying for a free European Health Insurance Card. This entitles all EU citizens to the same healthcare as insured local people in that country.
1.1.7.1. Con: Hungary is a European destination for [medical tourism](https://www.treatmentabroad.com/destinations/hungary/why-choose-hungary), implying that it provides healthcare preferable to other countries in the EU.
1.1.8. Pro: The EU has recently introduced [the General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.australiantimes.co.uk/seven-benefits-of-eu-citizenship-you-probably-havent-considered/), one of the most robust data privacy laws in the world, protecting citizens’ fundamental rights to privacy. The GDPR also offers a layer of privacy regarding taxation that is not available in many parts of the world.
1.1.9. Pro: According to [Eurobarometer](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/), 40% of Hungarians have a positive attitude towards the EU, 40% a neutral attitude, and only 20% a negative one. This is above average when compared to other European countries and shows that Hungarian people wish to stay within the EU.
1.1.10. Con: No longer being a member of the EU would slow down emigration from Hungary.
1.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.5.1.
1.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.10.3. Con: If Hungarians want to emigrate, the government should not take measures which make it harder for them to do so and disrespect their choice.
1.1.10.3.1. Pro: People emigrate because they feel that conditions abroad are preferable to conditions at home. In such a circumstance, governments should prioritize fixing domestic circumstances rather than barring emigration.
1.2. Con: Leaving the EU would push Hungary closer to Putin's Russia or to China.
1.2.1. Con: Britain leaving the EU does not appear to have led to closer UK-Russia ties.
1.2.1.1. Con: The history of Hungarian-Russian relations and those between UK-Russia are too different to be directly comparable.
1.2.1.2. Con: Unlike the UK, Hungary is a relatively small country that an aggressive Russia may seek to dominate.
1.2.1.3. Con: The geographic position of Hungary puts it in a direct sphere of interest for Russian geopolitical ambitions, contrary to the further located UK.
1.2.1.4. Con: Hungary was formerly part of the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc) during the cold war, the UK was not.
1.2.1.5. Con: [Hungary's political system](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/) is more similar to Russia's than the UK's ever was.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Hungary is [moving away from the liberal democratic model](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/) that is part of the core values of the EU, and moving more toward an authoritarian government.
1.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: In Hungary, [the media](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/) are fiercely loyal to the state and hence biased in its portrayals.
1.2.1.5.1.2. Con: There are many other illiberal democracies in Europe, most notably the [Visegrad Group](https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/publication_series/monographs/monographs/illiberal_democracies_in_the_eu_the_visegrad_group_and_the_risk_of_disintegration).
1.2.1.5.1.3. Pro: [Media freedom](https://euobserver.com/political/125128) is increasingly threatened in Hungary.
1.2.1.5.1.4. Con: In spite of this, Hungary has not expressed desire to leave the EU. This implies that Hungary does not consider this to be such a fundamental clash of ideals that it cannot continue being an EU member.
1.2.1.5.1.5. Pro: Viktor Orbán boasts Hungary is an [“illiberal democracy”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/hungary-eu-values-refugees-viktor-orban).
1.2.1.6. Con: Hungary is currently seeking [closer](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/hungary-relationship-russia-send-message-eu-180919131248490.html) ties with Russia.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: Russia and Hungary are pursuing closer energy [agreements](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/hungary-relationship-russia-send-message-eu-180919131248490.html).
1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: The construction of [Paks II](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsconstruction-of-hungarys-paks-ii-to-begin-in-february-6036753), a new nuclear plant in Hungary, is supported and financed by Russia.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Hungary and Russia are [planning](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungarys-foreign-minister-urges-cooperation-russia-military-technical-sphere/) to increase military cooperation with each other.
1.2.1.6.3. Pro: Bilateral trade between Hungary and Russia increased by [25%](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/hungarys-partnership-with-russia-is-squeezing-ukraine.html) in 2017.
1.2.1.6.4. Con: Hungary [approved the EU sanctions](http://hungarianfreepress.com/2017/08/28/is-hungary-already-in-the-russian-sphere-of-influence/) placed on Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
1.2.1.6.4.1. Con: Viktor Orban has since called the sanctions [a mistake](http://hungarianspectrum.org/2018/07/14/viktor-orban-considers-russia-a-threat-to-europe/).
1.2.1.6.5. Con: Victor Orban has said that Russia poses a threat to Europe and cited it as a reason for member states to [increase defense spending](http://hungarianspectrum.org/2018/07/14/viktor-orban-considers-russia-a-threat-to-europe/).
1.2.1.7. Pro: Russia has [blocked](https://mlexmarketinsight.com/insights-center/editors-picks/brexit/europe/russia-blocks-uks-post-brexit-tariff-proposal-at-wto) the UK's post-Brexit tariff proposals at WTO.
1.2.1.8. Pro: UK-Russian relations have deteriorated significantly in recent months due to Russia's alleged involvement in the [poisoning](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/spy-scandal-uk-russia-relations-tumbling-what-next-skripal-salisbury-poisoning) of a British spy.
1.2.1.8.1. Pro: Theresa May [criticised](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/trump-theresa-may-brexit-un-bloomberg-global-russia-a8556896.html) Russia at the UN for "flagrantly breach\[ing\] international norms, from the seizing of sovereign territory to the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the Russian GRU".
1.2.1.9. Pro: Britain and Australia have both [accused](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-04/australia-britain-condemn-russia-cyber-attacks/10337266) Russian military intelligence of using cyber attacks to attempt to undermine Western democracies.
1.2.1.10. Pro: Russia has [accused](https://www.thejournal.ie/russia-proof-britain-chemical-attack-syria-3957015-Apr2018/) Britain of being behind chemical weapon attacks in Syria.
1.2.2. Con: The Visegrad Group instead of Russia would be an alternative for Hungary. These countries could form a strong Central European bloc.
1.2.2.1. Con: The Visegrád Group are all members of the EU and NATO. It doesn't present an alternative, as much as just being a weaker version of existing alliances that Hungary is already part of.
1.2.3. Pro: China and Hungary have many overlapping incentives.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Bilateral economic and trade relations have become [increasingly close](http://www.nouvelle-europe.eu/en/hungary-flagship-china-europe) in recent years.
1.2.3.2. Con: China only views Hungary as valuable due to it being a "gateway to Europe". If Hungary left the EU it would [diminish](http://www.nouvelle-europe.eu/en/hungary-flagship-china-europe) this status.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Chinese companies have [invested](https://gbtimes.com/chinese-companies-have-more-opportunities-in-hungary-as-china-and-cee-countries-deepen-ties) significantly in Hungary in recent years.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Chinese investment isn't in itself necessarily a benefit for the country. It can be exploitative and can increase Chinese influence over some sectors of Hungarian economy.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: China has pursued [exploitative](https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinas-ugly-exploitation-of-africaand-africans) investment strategies in Africa.
1.2.3.3.1.2. Con: Chinese investment in Hungary is likely to include investment in Hungarian [infrastructure and tech](https://www.theepochtimes.com/questions-linger-in-hungary-about-chinese-investments_2668965.html).
1.2.3.3.1.3. Con: This is true for investment by any country.
1.2.3.3.1.4. Pro: China's current "belt and road" infrastructure and investment project has been widely criticised for its [exploitative nature](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/a-scary-glimpse-into-how-chinas-obor-can-ruin-small-countries/articleshow/60173526.cms).
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: China has invested in a massive 141 million euro [power plant](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/china-to-realise-141-million-euro-geothermic-power-plant-project-in-hungary) in Hungary.
1.2.4. Con: Russia and China are not inferior to the West by default. Only a fraction of the world’s nations can be considered [democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index). More than half, including several developed and wealthy nations, have chosen to function as hybrid or authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the prospect of Hungary coming closer to Putin’s Russia and/or China cannot in itself be a counterargument to leaving the European Union.
1.2.4.1. Con: Western Europe is a better partner than Russia.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Western Europe has more [wealth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) for FDI into Hungary.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Freedom to negotiate with Russia and China is important as Hungary has expressed concerns about the [EU's lack of financial support](https://bbj.hu/economy/orban-if-eu-doesnt-pay-hungary-will-turn-to-china_143836) in developing infrastructure in Central Europe.
1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Hungary feels that the [greatest benefit](https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2017-7-27_hungary_poll_presentation.pdf) it receives from its EU membership is financial aid.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Most Hungarians are [skeptical](https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2017-7-27_hungary_poll_presentation.pdf) of Russia’s interests.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Due to its [massive human rights abuses](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/russia) domestically, Russia is far less likely to stand up for human rights in Hungary than Western Europe.
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Russia has a history of backing autocratic regimes that abuse the rights of their populations in states that are within its sphere of influence.
1.2.4.1.4.1. Pro: Russia [backs](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/russia-syria-putin-assad-trump-isis-ghouta/554270/) the Assad regime in Syria which is responsible for the [mass murder](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/bashar-al-assad-a-profile-of-a-mass-murderer) of Syrians.
1.2.4.1.4.1.1. Con: Western airstrikes in the Syrian crisis have also contributed to many thousands of [civilian casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Civilian_casualties_and_alleged_war_crimes). Russia is not the only morally reprehensible party in the conflict.
1.2.4.1.4.2. Pro: Russia [supported](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/russia-syria-putin-assad-trump-isis-ghouta/554270/) Ukrainian [autocrat](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-19/ukraine-s-ousted-autocrat-suing-country-violating-his-human-rights) Victor Yanukovych who was [responsible](https://mic.com/articles/190642/manafort-funded-his-lavish-lifestyle-through-decades-of-work-for-corrupt-leaders-and-despots#.UfKXrwMik) for corruption and persecution of political opponents.
1.2.4.1.4.3. Con: Western Europe has also [backed dictatorships](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2016/05/europe-s-secret-deal-africa-s-dictators) and leaders wanted for war crimes by the international community.
1.2.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Even though both Russia and the West have done this, the West has a check on this through vocal populations who protest the backing of dictators.
1.2.4.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Germany has stated it will stop all [arms trade](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/eu-stop-arms-sales-saudi-wake-khashoggi-killing-181030070950257.html) with the KSA until such time that action is taken to redress the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
1.2.4.1.4.3.1.2. Con: The [UK and France](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/eu-stop-arms-sales-saudi-wake-khashoggi-killing-181030070950257.html) are two of the largest weapons sellers to the KSA, a monarchy with a terrible human rights record.
1.2.4.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: The US, UK, and France have [far less media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_freedom_in_Russia) censorship compared to Russia.
1.2.4.1.4.3.1.4. Con: In spite of the fact that most [Britons oppose the arms trade](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/most-britons-believe-selling-arms-to-saudis-is-unacceptable) with the KSA, it continues. This implies that vocal populations have proven ineffective in checking the West meaningfully.
1.2.4.1.4.3.2. Pro: The UK [supported](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/304516.stm) Chilean dictator and human rights abuser Pinochet.
1.2.4.1.4.3.3. Pro: The UK supported Lybian dictator [Gaddaffi](https://www.itv.com/news/2015-01-24/dear-muammar-tony-blairs-letter-to-colonel-gaddafi-apologises-for-failing-to-deport-dictators-enemies/).
1.2.4.1.4.3.4. Pro: France [supported](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/28/us-france-backed-convicted-chad-dictator) Hissène Habré, the former Chadian dictator who was convicted of atrocity crimes on May 30, 2016.
1.2.4.1.5. Con: Hungarians and Russians share several values and incentives.
1.2.4.1.5.1. Pro: Both Hungarian and Russian people are overwhelmingly against immigration into their country.
1.2.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: In Russia, 67% of respondents to a [recent poll](http://www.levada.ru/2017/04/28/otnoshenie-k-trudovym-migrantam/) believe that the inflow of migrant workers should be limited.
1.2.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: 57% of Russians and 54% of Hungarians think that immigration is causing their countries to change in ways they don't like. \([pp12](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2017-09/ipsos-global-advisor-immigration-refugee-crisis-slides_0.pdf)\)
1.2.4.1.5.1.3. Pro: 56% of Hungarians [believe](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) that immigration is among the two most serious problems that the EU is currently facing. \(QA5\)
1.2.4.1.5.2. Pro: Both Hungary and Russia are seeking to enhance the influence of Christianity while the EU is [fundamentally secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union#Church_and_state) with a strong separation of church and state.
1.2.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: As per the 7th Amendment to the Constitution, it is the [fundamental duty](https://s4c.news/en/2018/06/27/the-christian-culture-of-hungary-is-now-enshrined-in-the-constitution/) of the Hungarian State to protect the country’s constitutional self-identity and Christian culture.
1.2.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: For several years, there has been a [growing rapport](https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/europe/2017/10/putin-triumph-christianity-russia-171018073916624.html) between the Russian state and the Orthodox Church.
1.2.4.1.5.3. Pro: Hungary was a Soviet satellite state in the Eastern bloc for several decades, functioning under substantial Russian influence. Hungarians might therefore be better prepared to cooperate with Russia than Western Europe, especially the more senior generations.
1.2.4.1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.2.
1.2.4.1.5.3.2. Pro: There has been [a growing divide](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/eu-east-and-west-are-falling-out-tune) between the Eastern and Western members of the EU, with East European states stepping up their criticism of Brussels and acting at odds with the EU.
1.2.4.1.5.3.3. Con: There was a substantial level of dissatisfaction in Hungary during the Eastern bloc years, peaking in the [1956 uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956).
1.2.4.1.5.3.4. Con: While there are some economic and ideological remnants of the Soviet system in Russia and Eastern Europe, the Putin and Orbán governments are substantially different such that the Marxist-Leninist past is no longer relevant.
1.2.4.1.5.4. Con: Before the post-WWII Communist Era, the religious, cultural and socio-political identities of Russia and Hungary were always substantially different. The shared history spans only a short period of time.
1.2.4.1.5.4.1. Pro: Hungary was part of the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Austria-Hungary) for over half a century, an entirely different political setup from the Russian Empire.
1.2.4.1.5.4.2. Pro: Even during the Communist era, the [Hungarians revolted](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hungarian-Revolution-1956) against the Soviet puppet government in 1956, implying that no real cultural or political integration actually took place.
1.2.4.1.5.5. Pro: Hungary and Russia both need alliances on account of having been excluded by the Western bloc.
1.2.4.1.5.5.1. Pro: Russia has lost a lot of diplomatic power over the [poisoning](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/hungary-relationship-russia-send-message-eu-180919131248490.html) of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in the UK.
1.2.4.1.5.5.2. Con: The exclusion is not comparable, as unlike Russia, Hungary is a member of NATO and is viewed as a full member of the Western bloc despite the differences in opinion under the Orbán regime.
1.2.4.1.5.5.2.1. Pro: Russia, unlike Hungary, is [sanctioned](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/ukrainerussia/) by Western states.
1.2.4.1.5.5.3. Pro: Hungary has been pushing back against democratic norms that are a major part of EU membership.
1.2.4.1.5.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.1.5.
1.2.5. Pro: Being outside of the EU would likely also give Hungary significantly more freedom to negotiate trade deals with Russia or China.
1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.2.5.2. Con: Trade deals usually benefit the party that has more bargaining power.
1.2.5.3. Pro: China and Hungary's existing trade deals are made [controversial](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhutt/2017/09/05/chinas-relationship-with-hungary-is-hitting-a-rocky-patch/#7155677416d3) by Hungary's EU membership.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Hungary's ["Eastern Opening"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhutt/2017/09/05/chinas-relationship-with-hungary-is-hitting-a-rocky-patch/#74b493f916d3) policy aims to shift its economic focus from Western Europe to Asia, away from the EU.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: EU Member States' engagement with China must comply with [EU laws](http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/china/docs/joint_communication_to_the_european_parliament_and_the_council_-_elements_for_a_new_eu_strategy_on_china.pdf), rules and policies. However, [China does not](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhutt/2017/09/05/chinas-relationship-with-hungary-is-hitting-a-rocky-patch/#4978e07c16d3) always follow these laws.
1.2.5.4. Pro: The [South Stream](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hu-forrel-ru.htm) gas pipeline between Hungary and Russia was built against the wishes of the European Union. This implies that similar deals could be reached with less interference outside of the EU.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: Hungary was able to build the [South Stream](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hu-forrel-ru.htm) gas pipeline in spite of being in the EU. This implies that, although the EU may disapprove, it does not heavily restrict the trade policies of its member states.
1.2.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.
1.2.5.6. Pro: The EU has shown itself to be adverse to [bilateral](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-to-block-us-attempts-to-cut-bilateral-trade-deals-with-members/) trade agreements between its members and other countries.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: This adversity is specifically targeted towards the [USA under Trump](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-to-block-us-attempts-to-cut-bilateral-trade-deals-with-members/), and not towards countries such as China, which the EU is currently pivoting towards.
1.2.5.6.2. Con: Many EU countries are actively involved in [bilateral](http://bruegel.org/2018/06/trade-wars-just-how-exposed-are-eu-member-states-and-industries-to-the-us-market/) trade with countries like the USA.
1.2.5.7. Con: [Germany](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Russia-EU_%E2%80%93_international_trade_in_goods_statistics), which is an important member of the EU, was Russia's largest trading partner in 2017.
1.2.5.8. Con: [Russian-Hungarian trade flow has increased](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/hungarian-russian-relations-are-developing-again) by a huge 17 percent in the first eight months of 2018, implying that being in the EU has hardly acted as a barrier to the trade.
1.2.5.9. Con: Among EU member states in 2017, China was the largest partner for [EU imports of goods](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/China-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics) and the second largest partner for [EU exports of goods](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/China-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics). It seems highly unlikely that Hungary could get a better deal than the one which the EU already has.
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.
1.2.7. Pro: Russia has strong influence over Hungary.
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.2.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Hungary imports most of its gas from Russia under a long-term supply agreement, due to expire by [2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-hungary-gas/russias-putin-hungarys-orban-to-discuss-energy-issues-gas-supply-next-week-idUSKCN1LS2E3).
1.2.7.3. Pro: Russian propaganda is [widespread](http://hungarianspectrum.org/2018/03/22/russian-propaganda-in-hungarian-government-media/) in Hungarian media.
1.2.7.4. Pro: [Reports](http://www.politicalcapital.hu/pc-admin/source/documents/western_experiences_eastern_vulnerabilities_20171012.pdf) have indicated that Hungary is one of the most susceptible countries to Russian influence in the region.
1.2.7.5. Con: [Hungary's Foreign Minister](https://www.unian.info/politics/10164317-hungarian-fm-denies-moscow-s-influence-on-budapest-s-policy.html) has strongly denied Russian influence in Hungarian actions, saying "we are an independent state and we don't care what Russia thinks about our policy toward minorities".
1.2.7.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.4.
1.2.7.7. Con: There have been many major and [popular demonstrations](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/bjdk55/hungarians-take-to-the-streets-to-protest-rising-russian-influence) by the Hungarian people against Russia, implying that any influence it does have is probably confined to the level of the state, and is ultimately not a popular ally.
1.2.8. Pro: Expelling Hungary from the EU could aid in the formation of a [Euroskeptic](https://www.cfr.org/article/europe-wrestles-hungarys-populist-challenge) Eastern bloc.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Russia has been actively supporting [far-right](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/europe-s-far-right-enjoys-backing-russia-s-putin-n718926) and [Euroskeptic](http://www.gmfus.org/publications/russia-euroskeptic-parties-and-italian-elections) parties across the European Union.
1.2.8.2. Pro: This is noteworthy as Poland is currently shifting towards [authoritarianism](https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_poland_hungary_slipping_facade_of_democracy) in a similar way to Hungary.
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: [Poland's government](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-rule-of-law-suspended-from-eu-judicial-organization/) has also been at odds with the EU in recent years - if Hungary left the EU, Poland would most likely follow.
1.2.8.2.1.1. Con: Poland is massively dependent on the EU, they would not leave just because Hungary does.
1.2.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: Support for the EU is [very high](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-eu-membership-support-for-membership-courts-rule-of-law-mateusz-morawiecki-juncker-a8149876.html) in Poland.
1.2.8.2.1.1.2. Pro: [80%](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/poland_en) of Poland's trade is with the EU.
1.2.8.2.1.1.3. Pro: Poland receives over [€10 billion](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/poland_en) a year from the EU.
1.2.8.2.1.1.4. Con: Hungary is dependent on the EU in the exact same way as Poland and both countries' governments are currently pursuing similar political strategies.
1.2.8.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Poland is not as close with actors outside the EU, such as [Russia](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-hungary-stand-united-except-on-russia-orban-szydlo/), and thus has few viable options if it left.
1.2.8.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: Both countries face multiple EU infringement proceedings, and have repeatedly indicated that they will not take in any [asylum seekers](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-says-ecj-ruling-on-refugee-quotas-has-raped-eu-law-asylum-seekers-italy-greece-relocation-scheme/), rejecting the Commission’s quota system for migrants.
1.2.8.2.1.1.4.3. Pro: Poland, like Hungary, has been criticized for its shift towards [illiberal](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-hungary-stand-united-except-on-russia-orban-szydlo/) practices.
1.3. Pro: Hungary has consistently been at odds with the EU.
1.3.1. Con: Often countries within the EU are at odds with each other over policies.
1.3.1.1. Pro: French president Emmanuel Macron has extensively [criticised](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-isolated-by-emmanuel-macron-central-european-offensive-posted-workers/) the actions of the Polish government.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The EU is not united on the issue of resettlement of migrants, with [Italy threatening to close its airports](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1028138/eu-migrant-crisis-italy-germany-asylum-seekers-matteo-salvini-charter-flights) for German flights.
1.3.1.3. Con: Hungary's problems are not with other specific countries in the EU, but with [the organization itself](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban/eu-must-give-up-nightmares-of-united-states-of-europe-hungarian-pm-idUSKBN1IB1TG).
1.3.1.4. Pro: Germany is at odds with other EU states. For example, over fiscal discipline.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Germany has demanded Ireland raise its [corporation tax](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/german-parties-battle-over-our-corporation-tax-29651496.html).
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Germany argues that many countries are violating conditions within a [fiscal compact](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/germany-and-e-u-clash-over-fiscal-discipline-723146) signed by 25 member states.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Con: Both France and Germany regularly [ignore](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11207721/Why-do-France-and-Germany-keep-breaking-EU-rules.html?) EU budget guidelines.
1.3.2. Pro: Hungary has violated many EU laws and principles.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Hungary has violated the EU's policies on handling the migrant crisis.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Hungary's new "[stop Soros](https://www.ft.com/content/f8cc8108-8aa0-11e8-bf9e-8771d5404543)" rule violates EU asylum rules and the EU's charter of human rights.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The EU executive has [sent](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-hungary-migration/eu-raps-hungary-for-stop-soros-law-steps-up-legal-battle-idUSKBN1K91CJ) a letter to Hungary condemning the law.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: The European Court of Justice has [ignored](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/eu-court-dismisses-complaints-by-hungary-and-slovakia-over-refugees) Hungary's complaints on EU refugee quotas.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: [Leaked](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44136218) documents from Italy show that the Italian government also planned to defy the EU's migrant policies.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Italy planning to violate the EU's policies does not mean that Hungary's violation of these policies is irrelevant.
1.3.2.1.4. Con: Hungary is in line with the [official EU migration policies](http://publications.europa.eu/webpub/com/factsheets/migration-crisis/en/) as the country is trying to put efforts into Frontex, tackling the root causes of migration, trying to reduce migrant flows and protecting borders.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Con: Hungary recently refused UN human rights experts access to their refugee camps. As a result, the exact treatment of migrants in Hungary is [unknown](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/un-experts-hungary-migrant-camp-detention-serbia-viktor-orban-eu-immigration-a8637241.html).
1.3.2.2. Pro: Many MEPs are calling for [article 7](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-eu-news-article-7-vote-poland-rule-of-law/) to be implemented as a response to Hungary breaching "core EU values".
1.3.2.2.1. Con: MEPs are not the ones to decide if a member state breached a law. This is the prerogative of the courts.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Hungary's [weakening](https://www.ft.com/content/6c538e70-168f-3d1e-ba92-8a80790a6247) of their constitutional court has been condemned by the European Court of Justice.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Viktor Orban and the Hungarian Government have been [accused](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hungary-orban-balaton/) of large levels of corruption.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Over the past 8 years Orban established a circle of [oligarchs](https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) around him, members of which achieved success primarily through state contracts, about 60 per cent of which are funded by the EU.
1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: The [Corruption Research Center Budapest](https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) \(an NGO\), analysed all public procurement contracts from 2010-16. It found four Fidesz-linked businessmen - Lajos Simicska, Lorinc Meszaros, Istvan Garancsi and Istvan Tiborcz - together won 5 per cent of contracts by value, totalling €1.88bn. Contracts won by the four men averaged 13 times the size of other contracts.
1.3.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: [Transparency International](https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482), based on analysis of contracts since 2007, estimated in 2015 that Hungarian public contracts were overpriced, on average, by 25% compared to market prices.
1.3.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: Consequently, much of the money coming in from the EU is already not reaching the people, and they are not dependent upon it.
1.3.2.2.3.1.3.1. Con: If the EU funding source feeding the oligarchs dries up, they will have to shift their attention to sources of state income that will directly impact the people, such as taxation.
1.3.2.2.4. Pro: Hungary has been [accused](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/ana-gurau/hungarian-governments-war-on-free-speech) of cracking down on freedom of speech.
1.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: A 25% [tax](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/hungary-eu-values-refugees-viktor-orban) has been slapped on funding for NGOs that “support immigration”: in practice, that means having anything positive to say about immigration.
1.3.2.2.5. Pro: The Hungarian Government has been restricting [freedom](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2017/hungary) of the press.
1.3.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.5.5.3.
1.3.2.3. Con: It has been reported that large parts of the [Sargentini report](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A8-2018-0250&format=XML&language=EN), which details the alleged abuses Hungary has committed are [misleading and untrue](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-hungary-sanctions-witchhunt-budapest-viktor-orban/).
1.3.3. Pro: Hungary has constantly been against further cooperation with the EU.
1.3.3.1. Con: Hungary strongly [supports](https://dailynewshungary.com/hungarian-foreign-minister-eu-should-speed-up-enlargement/) EU enlargement.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: If Hungary stays in the EU longer, newly admitted smaller states \(e.g. Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro\), who will have similar interests being similar sized economies, will be likely to help it counter the political will of larger states like Germany and France.
1.3.3.2. Con: Hungary has [collaborated](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/jrcsh/files/jrc_country_leaflet_hu_en.pdf) extensively with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre on many projects.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Hungary [vetoed](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/09/hungary-slammed-after-blocking-europe-wide-agreement-on-lgbt-rights/) an EU wide policy on LGBT rights.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Countries within the EU regularly veto policies they feel are not in their country's interests.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Ireland [refused](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/ireland-will-not-participate-in-any-attempt-for-eu-wide-corporation-tax-rate-805968.html) to participate in an EU wide tax policy to protect its own low corporation tax.
1.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: Poland [vetoed](https://euobserver.com/justice/142825) sanctions against Hungary out of fear it would receive sanctions itself.
1.3.3.3.1.3. Con: While the Council and Parliament have increasingly included veto provisions in EU law, the actual exercise of veto rights has been [extremely low](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/10/25/a-dearth-of-legislative-vetoes/).
1.3.3.3.1.4. Con: It is different to veto policies that are not in the country's interest and policies that are securing human rights.
1.3.3.4. Con: Hungary is supportive of an [EU army](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-founded-as-project-of-peace-debates-a-militarized-future-nato-european-defense-fund-russia/).
1.3.3.5. Pro: Hungary has been obstructive in the [passing of EU budgets](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/955177/EU-news-Viktor-Orban-Hungary-European-Union-budget-latest).
1.3.3.5.1. Con: Many countries including [Italy](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/italy-vows-to-veto-eu-budget-over-migrant-funds-row-864931.html) have also threatened to reject EU budgets.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Orban refuses to cooperate with EU members on the [refugee crisis and minority rights](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-hungary/hungarys-orban-vows-to-defy-eu-pressure-ahead-of-unprecedented-vote-idUSKCN1LR215).
1.3.3.6.1. Con: Despite its vociferous disagreement, Hungary did [accept refugees](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-secretly-accepted-1300-refugees-2017/) in 2017 above its quota.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: This refusal undermines the work that Europe has done on [integration](https://www.cfr.org/article/europe-wrestles-hungarys-populist-challenge) of refugees to date.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Hungary's lack of cooperation with the EU, and the EU's inability to make them comply weakens the [international perception](https://www.cfr.org/article/europe-wrestles-hungarys-populist-challenge) of the EU. This is not beneficial when the EU deals with other organisations.
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.5.3.2.
1.3.5. Con: Many countries within the EU disagree with its policies.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.1.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Italy [rejected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/24/eu-countries-may-be-paid-to-host-migrants-in-secure-centres) the EU's proposal to solve the migrant crisis, calling it a "charity handout".
1.3.5.3. Pro: EU is made up of culturally very diverse countries.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: The EU has 24 [official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union) and many more spoken amongst its population.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: Because EU countries are culturally diverse, disagreement between them is inevitable. There is nothing out of the ordinary with Hungary being at odds with the EU on some issues.
1.3.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.2.1.
1.3.5.5. Con: The mere fact that 27 nation states managed to agree on [common foreign & security policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy) is showing that despite differences, member countries of the EU are able to reach compromises.
1.3.5.6. Pro: France and Germany have both urged the EU to change its [immigration policies](https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/germany-and-france-urge-commission-to-revise-immigration-plan/).
1.3.5.7. Con: EU laws and policies have to be approved by the elected [European Parliament](https://europa.eu/european-union/eu-law/decision-making/procedures_en). The European countries themselves have ratified the EU's policies.
1.3.5.8. Con: A [Eurobarometer survey](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20180522STO04020/eurobarometer-survey-highest-support-for-the-eu-in-35-years) in 2018 showed a record high for support for the EU in the past 35 years.
1.3.5.9. Con: There will always be some countries which do not agree with the EU's policies, the important thing is that the majority do agree, therefore giving the policies democratic legitimacy.
1.3.5.10. Con: The new generation of European youth have an overwhelmingly high opinion of the EU, with [73 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/06/15/the-european-union-is-popular-again-but-there-are-reasons-for-brussels-to-worry/?utm_term=.f5dfdc39d0b6) of people aged between 18 and 29 supporting the organization.
1.4. Con: The EU is a force for good in the world and is worth being a part of.
1.4.1. Con: The EU has a democratic deficit.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Even the EU [recognizes](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/democratic_deficit.html?locale=en) that many voters feel it suffers from a democratic deficit.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The EU has acted to correct this. The democratic basis of the EU has been the European Parliament whose members have been elected by the electorate of the member states. While this is democratic, the electorate places more significance on their votes for their own national government than they do for their MEP, and are subsequently disenchanted that the European Parliament can overrule their national Government.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: The public opinion about the democratic deficit in the EU doesn't necessarily reflect reality.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Public opinion about democracy in the EU [has changed](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/files/be-heard/eurobarometer/2016/major-changes-in-european-public-opinion-2016/report/en-report-exploratory-study-201611.pdf) dramatically many times.
1.4.1.1.2.2. Con: If the public feels they are unable to meaningfully impact the EU, it is highly likely that there is an actual democratic deficit, as democracy is measured by people's ability to make decisions which affect their lives.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: The fact that the EU publicly recognizes this is the mark of a responsive governance system.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: The EU recognizes this, but this does not necessarily translate to it taking meaningfully democratic steps to correct it.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The [Citizens' Initiative](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) in the Lisbon Treaty of 2007 empowers citizens to directly invite the European Commission to initiate a piece of legislation through a petition.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: However, all the citizens are able to do is bring something to the attention of the Commission, not actually have it passed.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: If the EU were meaningfully undemocratic, it would attempt to undermine or hide the existence of the democratic deficit. That it does not indicates that the deficit is something it recognizes as a problem and wants to challenge.
1.4.1.2. Pro: European Parliament elections [suffer](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/europes-democratic-deficit-is-getting-worse/371297/) from low turnouts and increasingly disengaged electorates.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: This does not mean the EU has a democratic deficit; the [United States](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/15/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) suffers from similarly low voter turnouts.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: If there is also a democratic deficit in the United States, this does not make the EU’s deficit any less severe.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If most mature democracies have similar rates of voter participation, it implies that these rates are the norms of democratic participation as opposed to a deficit.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The US is an [outlier](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) trailing most mature democracies concerning voter turn out.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: In the UK only 35.6% of people voted in the [2014 EP election.](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf)
1.4.1.2.3. Con: This is not a critique of the EU, but of the participation taking place in the electoral process.
1.4.1.3. Pro: One of the most powerful EU bodies, the Commission, is [not democratically elected](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-ellery/eu-referendum_b_9514608.html).
1.4.1.3.1. Con: One potential Commissioner is [nominated](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_1.3.8.html) by the ruling \(democratically elected\) national government of each member state. These suggestions are then confirmed by the democratically elected European Parliament. So, the public vote for their own national government and, in doing so, place their trust in them to choose a suitable Commissioner, in an equivalent way to that which the Hungarian public places their trust in their elected representatives to select a suitable Prime Minister.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: The President of the Commission \(Jean-Claude Juncker\) was elected by the [Spitzenkandidat process](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20150526STO59409/spitzenkandidaten-the-story-of-what-made-last-year-s-ep-elections-different).
1.4.1.3.3. Pro: The European Commission is unelected and have been active since 2007. We may elect our MEPs but the [main policy makers](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/c_2017_6915_final_en.pdf) are still unelected and while they are accountable to the European Parliament who can censure their decisions, it is by no means a perfect system as it falls to the foibles of international politics.
1.4.1.3.4. Con: The European Commission holds no actual legislative power, and serves a purely executive function, equivalent of that of the Hungarian civil service, which is itself unelected.
1.4.1.3.5. Pro: Poorly performing members of the EU Commission cannot be [sacked](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) or be held accountable in any other way by popular pressure.
1.4.1.3.6. Con: The [European Parliament](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/20/eu-democratic-deficit) has twice dismissed the commission's budget and once forced its resignation.
1.4.1.3.7. Con: A lot of democracies do not elect all of their leaders. An example is Hungary, which does not elect its prime minister.
1.4.1.4. Pro: The EU is considered too [complicated and non-transparent](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) for citizens to be sufficiently involved in its decision making.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The EU only has one directly elected institution which is the [European Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/files/home-page/en-ep-brochure.pdf). The powers of the EP are [weaker](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) than those of other institutions.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: The EP is [unable to propose legislation](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) and only has the power to propose amendments to laws.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: The [Council of the EU](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu_en) consists of member states' government ministers, according to the policy area being discussed. Although they are not directly elected for this role, whoever makes it to the Council of the EU is ultimately decided by the voters in each member state.
1.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.4.1.6. Con: The Lisbon Treaty of 2007 increased the role of national parliaments in law-making and gave them the right to [challenge any EU laws](https://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/CIT5.-Dem.pdf) which they felt should be made at a national level rather than at the level of the EU.
1.4.2. Pro: The EU fights [globally](http://fra.europa.eu/en/speech/2017/protecting-human-rights-todays-europe) to uphold human rights.
1.4.2.1. Con: Members of the EU have been involved in [bombings](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2016/05/how-valid-claim-eu-has-delivered-peace-europe) in Syria and Libya without facing any opposition from the EU.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Hungary, as part of NATO, is complicit in many of these bombings whether they are in the EU or not.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The EU has long been fighting against the erasure of human rights by countries in [Asia.](http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2018/04/14/eu-fighting-a-lone-battle-for-human-rights-in-asia/)
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: The [EU](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1MD28E) has been a vocal advocate for the rights of the Rohingya people.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The EU has stood vocally against China's violations of human rights including their treatment of [Uyghur Muslims](https://unpo.org/article/20803).
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: The EU has called out labour rights abuse in [Cambodia](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/2172219/cambodian-workers-weigh-cost-eus-stand-human-rights).
1.4.2.3. Pro: The EU provides [asylum](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum_en) to people fleeing harm and persecution in their home countries.
1.4.2.4. Con: The EU has been complicit in the [torture and abuse](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/12/libya-european-governments-complicit-in-horrific-abuse-of-refugees-and-migrants/) of migrants in Libya.
1.4.3. Pro: The EU is widely [credited](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/david-cameron-eu-nato-war-in-europe-letters-a7022806.html) for keeping the peace on a continent that has seen some of the worst wars in human history.
1.4.3.1. Con: The EU was unable to [intervene](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2016/05/how-valid-claim-eu-has-delivered-peace-europe) effectively in the Balkan Wars of the 1990s.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The EU's emphasis on [democratizing member nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory) leads to these nations developing political affinities and trade ties which makes them unlikely to engage in war with each other.
1.4.3.3. Con: Post-war peace in Europe is actually because of the bloc-forming nature of the Cold War.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: There was no war in Western Europe or Eastern Europe because they were directly under immediate US and Soviet [spheres of influence](http://theconversation.com/can-the-eu-keep-the-peace-in-europe-not-a-chance-49267).
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: The only major armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War was the [Yugoslav War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars), notably occurring in a major non-aligned state.
1.4.3.4. Con: The EU of today has little to do with the [European cooperation post-war,](http://theconversation.com/can-the-eu-keep-the-peace-in-europe-not-a-chance-49267) which was comprised of smaller individual efforts such as the Coal and Steel Community and the Treaty of Rome.
1.4.4. Pro: The EU is the largest donor of aid in the world, giving an estimated [€50 billion annually](https://euaidexplorer.ec.europa.eu/AboutAction.do) to a variety of humanitarian causes.
1.4.5. Pro: The EU has set [standards of human rights, democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/europe-nobel-peace-prize-10-things) and the rule of law to which countries must adhere if they want to be part of it.
1.4.5.1. Pro: These guidelines have had a [particular impact](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/europe-nobel-peace-prize-10-things) on the countries of southern, central and eastern Europe, which joined after they emerged from dictatorships with often underdeveloped civil societies.
1.4.6. Pro: The EU has tackled [discrimination on the basis of gender, race, age and disability](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/europe-nobel-peace-prize-10-things) with a range of different directives which have had their biggest impact on the labour market.
1.4.7. Pro: Due to [legislation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/europe-nobel-peace-prize-10-things) by the EU to improve the quality of rivers, seas, and beaches, and reduce acid rain and sulfur emissions, member states have demonstrated their own appetite for protecting the environment.
1.4.8. Con: The EU has failed to address many of the [economic problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/17/europe-in-turmoil-five-years-of-economic-crisis) that have developed since 2008 and has promoted policies that have continued inequality.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Economies in Southern Europe still face [over 20%](https://tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate) rates of unemployment compared to Northern European economies like Germany which enjoys [under 5%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/07/05/3-reasons-brits-voted-for-brexit/#53545e6d1f9d) unemployment rates. This system of inequality continues to put a strain on the union.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: The only country with \>20% unemployment in the EU is [Greece](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/).
1.4.8.2. Con: Many countries outside the EU, especially the USA, also suffered a deep recession starting in 2008. Blaming the EU for this is wrong.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: The US was able to recover strongly from its recession because of [stimulus policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/upshot/what-debate-economists-agree-the-stimulus-lifted-the-economy.html), which the EU has been unwilling and unable to carry out. The EU has not recovered in many regions. Therefore it is sensible to blame the structure and policies of the EU.
1.4.8.2.1.1. Pro: Germany has been the principal [force](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/31/growth-decide-eurozones-future-greek) behind EU austerity measures throughout the Eurozone, particularly in Greece.
1.4.8.2.1.1.1. Con: Greece has a huge culture of [Tax Evasion](https://www.dianeosis.org/en/2016/06/tax-evasion-in-greece/) which it has been reluctant to tackle, as well as hiding its [debt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16834815) from the EU when it joined. The EU could not afford to continue bailing out Greece to the cost of other nation states when it made no real attempt at tackling its own economic problems.
1.4.8.2.1.2. Pro: Coordinated stimulus is a difficult policy to carry out due to the [lack](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/01/greece-problems-eurozone-fiscal-policy-germany) of unity in the monetary and fiscal policy of the EU.
1.4.8.3. Con: It is not an agreed area of EU competence to intervene in sovereign member states' economic affairs. Therefore, it is not to be expected that the EU would address member states' internal economic problems.
1.4.9. Con: There is a rapidly rising rate of [labour exploitation and sex trafficking](https://www.politico.eu/article/labor-trafficking-exploitation-modern-day-slavery-on-the-rise-in-europe-report/) in the EU.
1.4.9.1. Pro: The majority of trafficking victims are Eastern Europeans, particularly from countries like [Hungary](https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/commission-urges-member-states-to-step-up-action-against-eus-modern-slavery/).
1.4.10. Con: The EU's border-tightening response to migration without any attempt to find alternative safe and legal paths for the migrants has led to horrible conditions for them.
1.4.10.1. Pro: The EU has donated many millions of Euros to Nigerian and Libyan police to prevent migration, which has directly contributed to the rise of [torture, exploitation, and slavery](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/slavery-walls-fortress-europe-171128094218944.html) in Libya.
1.4.10.2. Pro: Over [34,000 migrants](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount) have died attempting to reach Europe through illegal means. This is a direct consequence of the EU not allowing in enough migrants.
1.4.10.3. Pro: Many migrants travelling to the EU fall victim to [exploitation and human trafficking](https://www.cfr.org/blog/sex-trafficking-and-refugee-crisis-exploiting-vulnerable).
1.4.11. Con: The EU has merely verbally condemned the [Israeli policy of settlement](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-the-palestinians-can-t-rely-on-europe-1.5765841) and displacement in Palestinian lands, but has fallen short of actually boycotting them or weaponizing their international influence to stop the harms caused to Palestinians.
1.5. Con: Leaving the EU would accelerate the degradation of democracy.
1.5.1. Pro: EU legislation and its direct applicability provides an important check on governments - leaving the EU would open the doors to virtually any kind of authoritarian legislation.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Leaving the European Union would allow for an intensification of xenophobic antagonisms; refugees and minority communities would be at a greater risk of violence and abuse.
1.5.1.2. Pro: In 2014 Orban promised to voters he would create an "[illiberal state](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-15/trump-s-embrace-of-populist-rulers-expanding-to-hungary-s-orban)" citing countries such as Russia which he said are unencumbered by checks and balances on power.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.1.
1.5.1.3. Pro: EU demands the protection of minorities within Hungary.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: EU [Charter](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) of Fundamental Rights guarantees rights and protections for all EU citizens.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: There are many countries that are not EU member states, but are members of the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Council_of_Europe), and still fall under the jurisdiction of the [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights#Jurisdiction). Hungary is a member of the Council of Europe, and its citizens would still be protected by the ECHR, regardless of its membership of the EU.
1.5.1.4. Con: Switzerland is not an EU member but is more democratic than any country in the EU by virtue of having a system of [direct democracy](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/switzerland-direct-democracy-explained/).
1.5.1.5. Con: Norway, a non-member of the EU, has been ranked the "world's best democracy" for [six years running](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/trumps-address-to-congress/norway-world-s-best-democracy-we-asked-its-people-why-n720151).
1.5.1.6. Con: [Iceland,](https://icelandmag.is/article/iceland-worlds-second-most-democratic-country-study-finds) a non-member of the EU, is considered the second most democratic country.
1.5.2. Con: Being in the EU erodes confidence in democracy since it makes decisions which do not adequately account for the preferences of Hungarians.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Since at least the [2013 Helsinki hearing](https://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/kim-lane-scheppeles-testimony-at-the-helsinki-commission-hearing-on-hungary-full-text/comment-page-1/) on Hungary, the EU has repeatedly presented serious criticism of Hungary’s ruling government. And yet, no opposition party or coalition has managed to shift Hungarian voters’ preferences. The [majority](https://kozvelemenykutatok.hu/#1) of Hungarian people are either pro-Fidesz, or do not support any existing party at all. Therefore, the EU’s consistent strong attacks on Orban’s government can create the impression that Hungarian people’s democratic choice is not respected by the EU.
1.5.2.2. Pro: In contrast to the EU average, [more Hungarians](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) tend to trust their national government and parliament than the European Union. This suggests that Hungarian people might feel that their national government more adequately represents their preferences than the EU.
1.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.6.
1.5.2.5. Con: There is an increasing trend towards [local and regional](https://cor.europa.eu/en/engage/studies/Documents/division-powers-additional-elements/division-of-powers-additional-fiscal-budgetary-elements.pdf) authority within the EU.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: The Pew Survey of more than 10,000 people across 10 EU countries found that citizens favoured [greater devolution](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/rising-euroscepticism-across-europe-new-pew-poll-finds-1.2675662) of EU power. Even if the EU is not very responsive to internal democratic pressure, it would be hard for it to resist such a wholesale demand for devolution.
1.5.2.6. Con: -> See 1.3.5.7.
1.5.3. Pro: The rights of Hungarian people will not be protected.
1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.1.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The only reason why the rights of the Hungarians are not even more infringed by illiberal Orban, is that he avoids head-on [confrontation](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/03/23/safeguarding-democratic-rule-within-the-eu) with Brussels.
1.5.3.3. Con: The EU has very [little capacity](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/03/23/safeguarding-democratic-rule-within-the-eu) to prevent human rights abuse within its member states.
1.5.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.
1.6. Con: Hungary will have significantly less influence in Europe if it leaves the EU, and as a result will be a weaker nation in the international community.
1.6.1. Pro: While within the EU, Hungary has sizable representation in the European parliament \([22 seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_European_Parliament_for_Hungary,_2009%E2%80%9314)\), as well as throughout all EU institutions.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Fidesz, unlike many other parties within the European parliament, looks likely to [gain even more seats](https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-epp-hungary-reshapes-european-center-right/) which will give it a larger voice within the EU compared to other parties.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The increase in the number of seats controlled by Fidesz will become even more influential when the total number of seats within the European parliament [decreases](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180607IPR05241/number-of-meps-to-be-reduced-after-eu-elections-in-2019) due to Brexit.
1.6.2. Pro: Outside the EU, Hungary will have significantly less leverage in international negotiations.
1.6.2.1. Pro: While within the EU, Hungary is negotiating with some of the world's largest economic and military powers on its side.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Hungary's voice is not heard within the EU, so leaving will not make a difference.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: The European Court of Justice has ruled against Hungarian laws and stood in opposition of actions taken by the Hungarian state.
1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The ECJ has [interfered](https://bbj.hu/economy/court-of-justice-finds-hungary-discriminates-in-notary-appointments_128137) in the Hungarian process of notary appointments.
1.6.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The ECJ's rulings were all positive, aimed at upholding democracy, the independence of the judiciary, human rights and international competition law.
1.6.2.1.1.1.3. Con: The EU is always prioritising the effectiveness of EU law, yet there are [15](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-03-1069_en.htm) member states not complying with ECJ rulings and really high number of [infringements](http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/applying-eu-law/infringements-proceedings/infringement_decisions/index.cfm?lang_code=EN&r_dossier=&noncom=0&decision_date_from=&decision_date_to=&active_only=0&DG=TAXU&title=&submit=Search). EU law cannot be [enforced](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-05-482_en.htm), which makes the ECJ fundamentally flawed.
1.6.2.1.1.1.4. Con: If a member state proposes a law that is not compatible with EU law, the ECJ will rule against it, regardless of the content of the proposed legislation or what country proposed it.
1.6.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The ECJ's rulings against Hungary indicate that Hungary's needs might not be compatible with EU law.
1.6.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.
1.6.2.1.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.
1.6.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.6.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.2.1.1.4. Pro: Hungarians overwhelmingly voted ['no' to a referendum](http://theconversation.com/hungarys-invalid-refugee-referendum-dents-viktor-orbans-anti-eu-revolution-66424) which asked whether they wanted the EU to make decisions on migration, but the EU paid it no heed.
1.6.2.1.1.4.1. Con: The referendum did [not meet quorum](http://theconversation.com/hungarys-invalid-refugee-referendum-dents-viktor-orbans-anti-eu-revolution-66424) and was therefore illegitimate.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: The EU is the [largest trade bloc](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/eu-in-brief_en) in the world.
1.6.2.1.3. Pro: The EU has proposed a 13 billion euro [European Defense Fund](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-founded-as-project-of-peace-debates-a-militarized-future-nato-european-defense-fund-russia/) as a new long term project aimed at militarizing.
1.6.2.1.3.1. Con: Most of Europe's military might is tied up in NATO, which will be strong either way.
1.6.2.1.4. Con: The EU's international position has [weakened](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/12/05/is-there-hope-for-eu-foreign-policy-pub-74909) in the decade since the signing of the Lisbon Treaty.
1.6.2.1.4.1. Pro: The [EU's preference](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/12/05/is-there-hope-for-eu-foreign-policy-pub-74909) for soft power, legal solutions, and multilateral politics have caused it trouble in adjusting to a world of power politics.
1.6.2.1.4.2. Pro: The EU has displayed many weaknesses as a [crisis manager](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/12/05/is-there-hope-for-eu-foreign-policy-pub-74909) in Libya, Syria, and the Ukraine.
1.6.2.1.4.3. Pro: The EU has failed to develop a coherent response to the [rise of China](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/12/05/is-there-hope-for-eu-foreign-policy-pub-74909). Competing interests of member states have allowed Beijing to play various parts of the EU off each other.
1.6.2.1.4.4. Con: The EU is becoming increasingly united again as a Western bloc which is [critical of Donald Trump's](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/06/05/the-trump-effect-in-europe/) America.
1.6.2.1.4.4.1. Con: [Euro-skepticism](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36471989) is growing within Europe since [Brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/03/brexit-has-put-other-leaders-off-wanting-to-leave-says-ec-vice-president); Hungary leaving would increase the strength of arguments saying that states do not need the EU.
1.6.2.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.2.1.
1.6.2.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Even [Italy](https://www.thelocal.it/20180521/analysis-italy-eu-founder-euroscepticism), a founding member of the EU, has seen a surge of populist Euroskeptic sentiment.
1.6.2.1.4.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.6.2.1.4.5. Con: The EU has [increased](https://tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp-annual-growth-rate) its economic output since Lisbon.
1.6.2.1.5. Con: Hungary would still have the leverage of being a NATO member.
1.6.2.2. Pro: In the event of a hard exit, Hungary will overnight be excluded from EU arrangements with “third countries”, or non-EU countries, entering the equivalent of a legal void in key parts of its external commercial relations. This exclusion will mean that Hungary will have to renegotiate an incredibly high number of treaties.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: Each agreement has to be reviewed, the country approached, the decision makers found, meetings arranged, trips made, negotiations started and completed. This will take up considerable time and resources of the Hungarian government.
1.6.2.2.3. Pro: Using the example of the UK, Brexit will mean a renegotiation of at least [759](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) treaties. Hungary will likely have to negotiate a similar amount with much less leverage.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.1.
1.6.4. Pro: The EU is using its leverage to make countries adopt policies they don't support, in order to gain [trade benefits](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-trade-deal-paris-climate-change-accord-agreement-cecilia-malmstr-m-a8206806.html).
1.6.5. Con: The EU's own influence internationally has begun to [decline](http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/62635), so it cannot offer Hungary much in the long term.
1.6.6. Con: [Norway](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norway_reputation/id2340387/), a European country which is not a member of the EU, has a positive international image and is considered to be highly ranked for global influence.
1.7. Pro: Without restrictions from the EU, Hungary would be free to address pressing political, social and economic problems better.
1.7.1. Pro: The European Union [has failed](https://www.euronews.com/2018/07/28/hungary-s-pm-viktor-orban-attacks-the-eu) to find an appropriate way for Europe to deal with Muslim immigration.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The EU has not given Hungary enough [funds](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/600728/Hungary-EU-cash-immigrants) to deal with the migration crisis.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: While these funds may not be enough, even they would cease to exist once Hungary leaves the EU.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Hungary would not need these funds if they could close their border.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hungary is currently able to control the flow of immigrants and prevent the [majority](https://visegradpost.com/en/2017/09/18/hungary-the-border-fence-is-two-years-old/) of refugees from entering the country without these EU funds.
1.7.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Hungary does not need to fully close their border to control immigration. Currently they are able to prevent the [majority](https://visegradpost.com/en/2017/09/18/hungary-the-border-fence-is-two-years-old/) of refugees from entering the country.
1.7.1.2. Con: However, unlike Hungary, which has an [anti-migrant](https://www.ft.com/content/5626fdb8-8b52-11e8-bf9e-8771d5404543) stance, the EU is still attempting to do good by letting in large numbers of migrants.
1.7.2. Con: Orban's government has consistently failed to address political, social or economic problems over the past 8 years - if anything, they only exacerbated them. Nothing guarantees that leaving the EU would have a positive effect on these areas.
1.7.2.1. Con: Hungary has some of the [highest projected real wage growth](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/graphic-projected-real-wage-growth-in-selected-oecd-countries-in-2018-118010800069_1.html) among OECD states.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Much of this has to do with the legislated increase in minimum wage rates, which in many cases [only exists on paper](https://think.ing.com/articles/wage-growth-in-hungary-is-not-all-it-seems/).
1.7.2.1.2. Con: The overall wage has not changed in many cases: the base wage has merely been increased and the [performance-based portion](https://think.ing.com/articles/wage-growth-in-hungary-is-not-all-it-seems/) of the wage decreased.
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: Wages have increased by [12.8%](http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/hungarys-economy-is-booming-and-the-standard-of-living-of-hungarians-has-improved-dramatically-over-recent-years/) in Hungary due to government policy.
1.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.1.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Social and economic [inequality](https://merce.hu/2017/11/24/ketteszakitja-magyarorszag-terkepet-a-gazdasagi-egyenlotlenseg/) remains a huge problem in Hungary, but this is not necessarily reflected in general statistics, only when economic and social data is broken down between the counties.
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Children born into the wealthiest areas of Hungary are [expected to live](https://merce.hu/2017/11/23/a-borsodiak-negy-evvel-kevesebbet-elnek-mint-a-budapestiek/), on average, four years longer than those born into the poorest parts of the country.
1.7.2.3.2. Pro: Hungary ranks amongst the worst countries in the EU for [gender inequality](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/).
1.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: In Hungary, only [9.7 percent of MPs](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/) are female compared to the EU average of 27.7 percent.
1.7.2.3.2.2. Pro: The share of women in [municipal councils](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/) in Hungary is less than half of the EU average of 28 percent.
1.7.2.3.2.3. Con: There is no meaningful distinction in the [accessibility to healthcare](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/) for both men and women.
1.7.2.3.2.4. Con: The [gender pay gap](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/) in Hungary is smaller than the EU average.
1.7.2.3.2.5. Con: Slightly more women have [more leisure time](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/) than men in Hungary than they do in the rest of the EU.
1.7.2.3.2.6. Pro: Only about 1.5 percent of junior and senior Hungarian [ministers](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-ranks-among-worst-eu-gender-equality/) are female compared to an EU average of 26.8 percent.
1.7.2.3.3. Pro: The economic [top 10%](https://knoema.com/atlas/Hungary/topics/Poverty/Income-Inequality/GINI-index) of Hungary holds 23.8% of the nation's wealth.
1.7.2.3.3.1. Con: Many other countries such as the [UK](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/12/19/of-course-the-top-10-own-50-of-the-wealth-thats-how-wealth-distributions-work/), [Sweden and Norway](http://uk.businessinsider.com/why-socialist-scandinavia-has-some-of-the-highest-inequality-in-europe-2014-10?r=US&IR=T) are much more unequal.
1.7.2.4. Pro: [Antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Hungary), racism and anti-Roma sentiments are persistent social problems in Hungary, and the Orban government's aggressively nationalist and [xenophobic](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-refugees-immigration-viktor-orban-racism-border-fence-a8446046.html) rhetoric has not helped the situation.
1.7.2.5. Pro: During Orban's reign countless [football stadiums](https://444.hu/2016/05/30/megprobaltuk-a-lehetetlent-osszeszedni-az-osszes-mar-kesz-vagy-meg-epulo-stadiont) were built around the country \(by companies close to Orban\) for teams with little to no audience, for a cost of around £300 million, most of which was public money.
1.7.2.6. Pro: The Hungarian [healthcare system](https://www.boell.de/en/2018/05/31/vulnerability-and-chaos-hungarian-healthcare-system) is struggling; doctors' pay is the lowest among OECD countries, there is a growing lack of hospital staff, and government spending remains one of the lowest in Europe.
1.7.2.6.1. Pro: Hospital [financing](https://www.boell.de/en/2018/05/31/vulnerability-and-chaos-hungarian-healthcare-system) is insufficient, which results in a debt of around €120-200 million each year.
1.7.2.6.2. Pro: Due to the lack of sufficient funding and salaries, a system of expected [gratitude payments](https://www.boell.de/en/2018/05/31/vulnerability-and-chaos-hungarian-healthcare-system) developed, which sees citizens slipping envelopes full of cash to their doctors \(and nurses\) after every visit.
1.7.2.7. Pro: Hungary has been heavily criticised for its treatment of minorities such as the [Roma community](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-roma-peoples-hungarian-hell/).
1.7.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.4.
1.7.2.7.2. Pro: The European Commission has led an infringement case against the Hungarian government for the [segregation](http://www.errc.org/press-releases/eu-commission-probe-must-spell-the-end-of-romani-segregation-in-hungarian-schools) of Roma children within education.
1.7.2.7.3. Con: Hungary has been [praised](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-israel/hungarys-orban-welcomes-netanyahu-vows-to-fight-anti-semitism-idUSKBN1A312O) by Israel for its strong stance against Antisemitism.
1.7.2.7.3.1. Pro: Hungary recently met with the US to discuss [joint efforts](https://hungarytoday.hu/orban-meets-us-ambassador-for-religious-freedom/) to protect persecuted Christians and fight anti-Semitism in Europe.
1.7.2.7.4. Con: Hungary was the first country in the world to elect a [female Roma MEP](http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/european-parliament-elects-livia-jaroka-first-ever-vice-president-of-roma-origin/).
1.7.2.7.5. Pro: The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance \(ECRI\), in a [report](https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/council-of-europe-criticises-racism-in-hungary-poland/) on Hungary, says that "a radical right-wing populist party openly engages in anti-Roma, antisemitic, homophobic and xenophobic hate speech".
1.7.2.7.5.1. Con: The report refers to Jobbik, a party which is in opposition and has never been in power. Therefore, the views of this party are not representative of the country's leadership.
1.7.2.7.6. Pro: A [ruling](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-roma-peoples-hungarian-hell/) by the European Court of Human Rights highlights a pattern of persecution in Hungary against people of the Roma Community.
1.7.2.7.7. Pro: Police in Hungary treat [hate crimes](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-roma-peoples-hungarian-hell/) against the Roma community as normal crimes.
1.7.2.7.8. Con: The Hungarian PM has asked for support for a [Minority SafePack](https://emerging-europe.com/news/hungary-seeks-support-minority-safepack/), an initiative to protect minority rights throughout Europe.
1.7.2.8. Pro: The EU has constantly and consistently pressured Orban's government on controversial issues. With rapidly [declining freedom of media](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hungary-newspaper-stops-printing-1.4612656) in Hungary, the EU remains the only actor that is able to significantly do so.
1.7.2.8.1. Pro: In 2012, the European Union threatened Hungary with legal actions over its [controversial reforms](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/world/europe/hungary-eu-ruling/index.html) that included the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges, and the independence of the country's data protection authority.
1.7.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.1.
1.7.2.8.3. Pro: The deputy head of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, said on 11th of September, 2018, that he has concerns about [“fundamental rights, corruption, the treatment of Roma and the independence of the judiciary”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-hungary/hungarys-orban-vows-to-defy-eu-pressure-ahead-of-unprecedented-vote-idUSKCN1LR215) in Hungary under Orban.
1.7.2.8.4. Con: Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has been under criticism of the EU for years now, yet nothing significantly changes in either his support or his politics. It is very questionable if the pressure coming from the EU and its member states is really effective.
1.7.2.8.4.1. Pro: In September of 2018, speaking to the European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, in a debate on a resolution to initiate a process that could lead to political sanctions against Hungary — the so-called Article 7 proceedings, Orbán [showed no contrition and no willingness to back down](https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-unbowed-in-face-of-eu-criticism-hungary-president/).
1.7.2.8.4.2. Pro: Orban is one of the [most popular](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2018/09/13/hungary039s_orban_is_the_most_popular_leader_in_europe_453265.html) leaders in Europe.
1.7.2.8.5. Con: Many EU member states are divided between the East and the West of the EU, as the [debate](https://www.politico.eu/article/state-of-disunion/) on whether Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is trampling democratic freedoms and undermining fundamental rights showed in Strasbourg in September of 2018. The pressure from the EU is therefore ineffective.
1.7.2.8.6. Pro: Despite Orban's bluster, Hungary is not a particularly Euroskeptic nation and wants to stay in the EU, so it will have to be responsive to EU demands on some level.
1.7.2.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.7.2.9. Con: Under Orban's leadership, Hungary's credit rating has [risen](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-ratings-s-p/sp-upgrades-hungary-in-surprise-gift-to-pm-orban-idUSKCN11M20R), allowing it to be more attractive to investors.
1.7.2.10. Con: Orban's government has used taxation to [redistribute money](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-04-13/orban-s-economic-model-in-hungary-is-trump-s-dream) from foreign firms to domestic tax payers to make Hungary more equal.
1.7.2.11. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.7.3. Con: The EU does not restrict Hungary in these areas in any meaningful way - if other EU members are able to focus on their political, social and economic problems then Hungary should be able to as well.
1.7.3.1. Pro: EU countries are free to set their own [budgets](https://www.euronews.com/2018/03/15/what-do-different-eu-governments-spend-their-budgets-on-) and decide how much they want to spend on public services.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: The EU does impose [some constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact) on individual countries' fiscal policies.
1.7.3.2. Pro: EU countries are free to decide the content and organisation of their education systems, which is illustrated in the [myriad of different systems](http://eurydice.indire.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Structures_2017_18_diagrams_final_report.pdf) existing within the EU.
1.7.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.5.
1.7.3.4. Con: Hungary's concerns and problems are different from most EU countries.
1.7.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.2.
1.7.3.5. Con: Other EU members frequently flout or desire changes in EU rules in order to be able to focus on their own problems.
1.7.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.2.1.
1.7.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.6.
1.7.3.6. Con: Some members of the EU have exemptions from EU wide rules or mechanisms in order to accommodate their unique situation.
1.7.3.6.1. Pro: Ireland and the UK have an opt-out from the [Schengen Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Schengen_Agreement_–_Ireland_and_the_United_Kingdom).
1.7.3.6.2. Pro: Denmark and the UK have an opt-out from the [monetary union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Economic_and_Monetary_Union_–_Denmark_and_the_United_Kingdom) \(adopting the euro\). Some other states like Sweden have been able to delay the obligation to join the monetary union indefinitely by not meeting the convergence criteria.
1.7.3.6.3. Pro: Denmark has an opt-out from the [Common Security and Defence Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Defence_–_Denmark).
1.7.3.6.4. Pro: Poland and the UK have [secured limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union_–_Poland_and_the_United_Kingdom) to the extent that European courts could rule on issues related to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.
1.7.3.6.5. Pro: Denmark, Ireland and the UK have opt-outs from the [area of freedom, security and justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice_–_Denmark,_Ireland_and_the_United_Kingdom).
1.7.3.6.6. Con: Hungary has not chosen to negotiate any opt-outs upon joining the EU or upon ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, unlike countries like Poland, who are often viewed to be pursuing similar anti-EU policies on social and legal matters.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.1.1.
1.7.5. Pro: In the EU, Hungary isn't able to pursue its own interests. Decisions within the EU have to be consensual, which means many compromises need to be made.
1.7.5.1. Pro: The top argument favouring Brexit, prior to the referendum, was that the EU strips the UK of its sovereignty. [The voting procedures](http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-31/issue-4/comments/mechanisms-eu-undermine-national-interest-study-sanctions-regime.html) in the EU institutions often leave countries overruled.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: The EU is using the ["qualified majority"](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/qualified_majority.html) voting system, which often forces member states to adopt policies they don't necessarily agree with.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.6.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.7.7. Con: EU "restrictions" on social issues are often there to protect minorities from discrimination by their government.
1.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.
1.7.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.
1.7.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.8. Pro: Hungary would be better off economically outside the Single Market.
1.8.1. Con: Hungary would become less competitive as it would now be exposed to potentially higher transaction costs associated with crossing now regulated borders and different trade regulations.
1.8.1.1. Con: Hungary could negotiate a new trade deal with the EU.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: The UK is finding it extremely [difficult](https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/eu-plans-for-brexit-delay-as-talks-stall-on-trade-37016495.html) to come to an agreement with the EU; it is likely Hungary would find it as difficult.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hungary has even less leverage than the UK given that it is a smaller economy and landlocked.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: Hungary would have some degree of bargaining power because of its direct trade relationship with [China](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/hungarian-chinese-relations-have-never-been-as-good-as-they-are-today).
1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: China is [more interested](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhutt/2017/09/05/chinas-relationship-with-hungary-is-hitting-a-rocky-patch/) in its trade relationship with the EU than with Hungary.
1.8.1.1.2.2. Con: The EU is [not interested](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-china-eu-trade-sees-method-in-trumps-trade-madness-china/) in China, and is instead looking for means to diplomatically isolate it over its business practices.
1.8.1.2. Pro: The EU's [Common Customs Tariff](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/what-is-common-customs-tariff_en) would apply to Hungary if it left the EU. This would make its exports to the EU less competitive.
1.8.2. Con: Hungarian economy has a strong reliance on money coming from the EU.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Hungary [receives more EU funding](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/717015/hungary-leave-eu-european-union-referendum) per head of population than any other state apart from Lithuania. Leaving the EU would devastate the economy.
1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.1.
1.8.2.3. Pro: The [EU](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/hungary_en) spends a total of €4.546 billion in Hungary, while Hungary only contributes €0.924 billion to the EU budget.
1.8.2.4. Con: Due to Brexit, it is likely that this funding will decrease.
1.8.2.4.1. Pro: It is estimated that as a result of the UK no longer contributing to the EU's budget after Brexit, it is likely that the amount of money given to Hungary will [decrease](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/czech-republic--poland--hungary-face-tough-brexit-ride---ing-10928032).
1.8.2.4.1.1. Pro: As the UK is a rich state, it leaving will lower the [average GDP of the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/GDP_per_capita,_consumption_per_capita_and_price_level_indices). Due to this, Hungary's GDP will no longer be below average. As a result, their funding is [likely to be cut](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/czech-republic--poland--hungary-face-tough-brexit-ride---ing-10928032).
1.8.2.4.2. Pro: When the UK leaves, the EU will face a budget shortfall of €10 billion referred to as the "[Brexit Gap](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/17/brexit-will-bring-bitter-eu-budget-wars-report-warns/)". This will put increased pressure on it to make cuts.
1.8.2.4.2.1. Pro: Post Brexit, Hungary's contributions to the EU are set to [rise](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/17/brexit-will-bring-bitter-eu-budget-wars-report-warns/).
1.8.2.5. Pro: Hungary receives EU subsidies amounting to more than [3 per cent of its GDP](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/poland-and-hungary-could-threaten-the-eu-more-than-brexit-does-1.3211827) each year, the highest percentage of any EU member country.
1.8.3. Con: The value of Hungary's agricultural exports has more than doubled since they joined the EU \([p.88](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/183182/2/07-1407.pdf)\).
1.8.3.1. Con: Since joining the EU the Hungarian dairy industry has seen a [reduction](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/107654/2/No.105_7.pdf) in its domestic market share as a result of imports from the EU.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.8.5. Con: Hungary wouldn't be able to cooperate as usual with other EU countries like Austria, Hungary's [major ally](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/austria-is-one-of-hungary-s-most-important-allies).
1.8.5.1. Pro: Austria is Hungary's main partner in the field of [defense cooperation](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/cooperation-between-austria-and-hungary-gains-further-strength) and border protection. This cooperation would be much harder to achieve if there was a border between the two states.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Hungary's plans for cultural integration and [infrastructure links](https://dailynewshungary.com/hungary-burgenland-sign-declaration-on-infrastructure-cultural-cooperation/) with Austria would be much more difficult without the benefits of an open border.
1.8.6. Con: [81%](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/hungary_en) of Hungary's trade is within the EU.
1.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Hungary's top export destination is [Germany](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/hun/).
1.8.6.3. Con: It is a fallacy that one [needs to be inside](http://www.cityam.com/249559/why-single-market-problem-not-solution) the Single Market to trade with it. The US, China, Japan and Australia all enjoy access so long as their products meet Single Market regulatory standards.
1.8.7. Pro: The [euro](http://theconversation.com/can-the-eu-keep-the-peace-in-europe-not-a-chance-49267) has cemented and made visible the difference between productive and unproductive economies and made it easier to exert political influence on the latter, which comprise of countries such as Hungary.
1.8.7.1. Pro: -> See discussion #9649: The official currency of the European Union \(the euro\) should be abolished.
1.8.8. Con: The UK leaving the EU requires them to renegotiate over [100 trade deals](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/03/04/leaving-the-eu-would-mean-renegotiating-more-than-100-trade-agreements/), which is estimated to be massively time consuming. It is likely that Hungary would be forced to do the same if they leave.
1.8.8.1. Pro: [Trade deals](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/07/how-long-do-trade-deals-take-after-brexit/) can take months to negotiate and years to implement.
1.8.8.1.1. Pro: Hungary is an [export oriented economy](https://www.globaltenders.com/economy-of-hungary.php/). Delays in the ability to export could be hugely harmful to the economy.
1.8.9. Pro: New Hungarian industries would face less competition from larger companies in other European states.
1.8.9.1. Pro: By leaving the EU, Hungary would have the option of pursuing a variety protectionist policies to help domestic industries.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: Hungary could target tariffs on foreign imports that threaten the domestic development of Hungarian industry.
1.8.9.1.1.1. Con: This presumes that Hungarian industry will eventually be able to compete internationally and tariffs could be lifted. However, there is no reason to believe that [infant industries](https://www.focus-economics.com/blog/effects-of-trade-protectionism-on-economy) will ever grow to the point that they no longer need protection from their home government.
1.8.9.1.2. Pro: Hungary would have more freedom to subsidize growing industries when it does not have the EU [anti-subsidization regulations](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/accessing-markets/trade-defence/actions-against-imports-into-the-eu/anti-subsidy/).
1.8.9.1.3. Con: Protectionism undermines market economies, competition and consumer interests.
1.8.9.1.3.1. Pro: Protectionism [limits consumer choices](https://www.focus-economics.com/blog/effects-of-trade-protectionism-on-economy) if there are quotas of goods which can be imported.
1.8.9.1.3.2. Pro: Protectionism [raises prices](https://www.focus-economics.com/blog/effects-of-trade-protectionism-on-economy) for imported goods because of less competition.
1.8.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.8.10. Con: Hungary was the [third-highest recipient of European Union money in the 28-member bloc between 2008-2015](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-among-largest-beneficiaries-of-eu-funds/), and receives far more money from the European Investment Bank than it pays in.
1.9. Pro: Hungarian values are distinct from European or global values. Hungary should defend them against the globalisation agenda of the EU and others.
1.9.1. Pro: Hungary is a Christian country and should protect its right to not accept non-Christian immigrants or asylum seekers.
1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.5.2.1.
1.9.1.2. Con: According to the Pew Research Institute's [study](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-religion-and-politics/), only around 59% of Hungarians believe in God.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: Even though many Hungarians are no longer religious, the country is steeped in a distinctly [Christian culture](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/viktor-orban-hungary-preserve-christian-culture).
1.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Hungary has a [rich history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_in_Hungary) of being a Christian country, spanning over a millenium.
1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Hungary also has a [significant portion](https://theorangefiles.hu/ottoman-hungary/) of its history under the rule of a Muslim empire.
1.9.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Hungary in its entirety was never conquered by the Ottoman Empire, only a part of it was. The Habsburg [Kingdom of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary_\(1526–1867\)#Royal_Hungary_\(1526–1699\)) and the [Principality of Transylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Transylvania_\(1570–1711\)) never ceased to be Christian.
1.9.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire enjoyed [legal protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_Ottoman_Empire).
1.9.1.3. Con: According to the 2011 [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Hungary), only around 54% of Hungarians consider themselves Christian.
1.9.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.1.
1.9.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.
1.9.1.5. Con: Christianity is used as a tool of propaganda to drive a cultural rift between Hungary and Western culture based on fictitious and exaggerated differences.
1.9.1.6. Con: Many important Hungarian Christians do not believe that the movement to leave the EU is in line with [Christian values](https://www.euronews.com/2018/09/05/there-s-nothing-christian-about-orban-s-democratic-values-view).
1.9.1.7. Con: This does not mean that the country's values are at odds with the EU. Poland and Ireland are examples of EU members with a strong religious influence.
1.9.1.7.1. Pro: Portugal is one of the [most religious](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/ireland-still-one-of-the-most-christian-states-in-europe-1.3518269) countries in the EU, but its [recent elections](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-polish-and-portuguese-election-results-less-eurosceptic-than-they-seem) have not displayed meaningful Euroskeptic sentiment.
1.9.1.7.2. Con: Poland is also [at odds](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-poland/eu-lawmakers-back-action-against-poland-amid-democracy-concerns-idUSKCN1GD4KL) with the European Union.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.1.
1.9.3. Pro: Going far back to the Ottoman invasion, Hungary can be seen as a country that defends its freedom and values, and it should not accept European called values.
1.9.4. Con: Nationalists tend to label conservative political views as values of a certain nation, though those are indeed the kind of values of a certain political grupation. In such way they intentionally neglect and ignore the presence of the left leaning part of their own nation, ultimately distancing those people from the decision making processes.
1.9.5. Pro: Hungarians value homogeneity in their nation, which is shown by the large-scale [popular opposition](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) to a common European policy on migration. \(QA16\)
1.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.5.1.3.
1.9.5.2. Pro: The Hungarian government has plans to introduce a [25% tax on aid groups](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/hungary-anti-immigration-plans-ngo-tax-orban-bill-criminalise-aid) which support migration.
1.9.6. Con: [Support](https://hungarytoday.hu/support-for-eu-at-record-high/) for the EU in Hungary is at a record high.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.9.7. Pro: The EU stands for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of sexuality. If Hungary chooses to have different values, they should not be a part of the EU.
1.9.7.1. Con: EU do not stands for democracy, [referenda in regards EU treaties were repeated or ignored when outcome was rejecting proposals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_related_to_the_European_Union): Maastricht Treaty in Denmark or Treaty of Niece in Ireland.
1.9.8. Con: The EU is a reminder and the safeguard of [values Hungarians have chosen](https://www.princeton.edu/~jmueller/ELJ-Democracy%20Protection-JWMueller-pdf.pdf) to have, with 83.8% of the voters supporting the membership back in 2003. \(p. 11\)
1.9.8.1. Con: People's values can change, as demonstrated by [EU opinion polls](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/) which do not show this same level of support for the EU.
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.2.
1.9.10. Con: [Many](http://demografia.hu/en/publicationsonline/index.php/demographicportrait/article/download/892/662) EU nationals live in Hungary making the country's values European.
1.9.11. Con: Authoritarian leaders often cite protecting the culture of their nation in defending their authority and use national pride to build their own power.
1.10. Con: Other countries may follow if Hungary leaves, setting a dangerous precedent that could lead to the dissolution of the EU.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.4.4.1.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.2.1.
1.10.3. Con: The same claim was made prior to Brexit - and there was no country that followed UK on their path.
1.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.4.4.1.
1.10.3.2. Pro: Brexit has united the EU. As Finland's former PM said, he had never seen [the bloc so unified](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/brexit-brings-europe-together-as-britain-starts-packing-its-bags). As many observers have noted, if anything, it led to a renewed spirit of [togetherness and determination​](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/brexit-is-no-excuse-to-start-misunderstanding-the-eu-1.3458484).
1.10.3.3. Con: Not enough time has passed to evaluate this in 2018. The Brexit timeline stretches over many years, with the Conservative victory in the 2015 elections followed by the [European Union Referendum Act 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015) in May. The referendum only took place in June 2016, and Britain is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.
1.10.3.3.1. Pro: It is entirely possible that, once Brexit actually takes place, other Euroskeptic countries are inspired by and follow its example.
1.10.4. Con: The EU's acceptance of its own member states succumbing to authoritarianism is a greater existential threat than Hungary leaving.
1.10.4.1. Con: If Hungary is succumbing to authoritarianism, the EU has a responsibility to take all actions possible to stop it, rather than to cut it loose and no longer take responsibility.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Hungary's descent towards authoritarianism took place while being an EU member, so letting it leave does not diminish the EU's responsibility or set any less of a precedent.
1.10.4.2. Pro: The EU cannot maintain its identity as a [liberal democratic](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/) bastion if its members are actively succumbing to authoritarianism.
1.10.4.3. Con: Hungary leaving would make the EU appear to be an exclusive clique of states which cannot tolerate dissent against the centre, causing great damage to its image.
1.10.4.4. Pro: Allowing an authoritarian member state remain in the EU sets precedents for other member states to behave in an authoritarian manner. This decreases overall faith in the EU.
1.10.4.4.1. Pro: Having an illiberal member state while espousing liberal values makes the EU seem hypocritical.
1.10.4.4.1.1. Pro: The undemocratic handling of the [Catalan](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1282331) independence crisis made the EU appear to be hypocritical.
