Discussion Name: Should Italy welcome migrants?

1. Italy should welcome migrants.
1.1. Pro: Italy or any other western country cannot stop people from trying to enter, so they might as well welcome the newcomers so that those people actually try to integrate.
1.2. Pro: The birth rate is falling in Italy.
1.2.1. Pro: Italy's [population](https://www.thelocal.it/20180208/italy-birthrate-lowest-ever) is older than ever before, therefore immigrants can be very beneficial.
1.3. Con: Accepting migrants may hurt the Italian economy.
1.3.1. Pro: Italy's [unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/unemployment-rate) rate has risen in the last years.
1.3.2. Con: The correlation between migration and rising unemployment is unproven.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The [economic contribution](https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agi.it%2Ffact-checking%2Fimmigrati_pensioni_boeri_salvini-4107822%2Fnews%2F2018-07-05%2F) of regularized migrants is proven.
1.4. Con: Mass immigration from Africa or other countries could increase crime and terrorism.
1.4.1. Con: The link between immigration and crime is unclear.
1.4.1.1. Pro: There is no reason why a group of people looking for better economic prospects have to necessarily be more prone to crime than locals.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Migration in Italy \(including from African countries\) increased, but the number of crimes decreased. [This article](https://www.ilpost.it/2018/02/05/rapporto-immigrazione-criminalita/) summarises the main sources that demonstrate that there is no correlation between migration and crime.
1.4.2. Pro: Research seems to support certain correlation between immigration and terrorism.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/customsites/perspectives-on-terrorism/2018/issue-4/02-choi.pdf) concludes that "terrorism is likely to decrease when states impose immigration restrictions based on skill or wealth" as well as "when states offer immigrants limited legal rights that permit only restricted residence and designated employer".
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The study also concludes that the link between restrictive immigration policies and terrorism produce [mixed-results](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/customsites/perspectives-on-terrorism/2018/issue-4/02-choi.pdf), since terrorism may increase when there are no "procedures to recruit immigrants, or when states give workers citizenship only when they are born to a native parent".
1.4.2.2. Pro: When immigrants do not identify “with neither their heritage culture nor the culture they are living in” they are more likely to feel marginalized and that, coupled with experiences of discrimination, can increase their likelihood of [radicalization](https://behavioralpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BSP_vol1is2_-Lyons-Padilla.pdf).
1.4.2.2.1. Con: While the lack of cultural identification and belonging is an important factor, scholars also point that [exclusionary policies](https://behavioralpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BSP_vol1is2_-Lyons-Padilla.pdf) and anti-Muslim rhetoric, as well as counter-terrorism methods based on control and surveillance, can produce counter-productive results and can actually fuel more extremism.
1.4.2.3. Con: Preliminary research also suggests that restrictive and controlling policies actually offer mixed-results.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.1.
1.4.2.4. Pro: European studies suggest that "increased terrorism is linked to increased [migration](https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1026&context=channels) from terror-prone nations and regions".
1.4.3. Con: Creating a hostile environment for immigrants are arguably more likely to alienate them from the accepting country and push immigration towards more to the illegality.
1.5. Pro: International treaties oblige Italy to do it.
1.6. Con: Many migrants are not political refugees, but are economic migrants.
1.6.1. Con: People fleeing from their countries because of war or economic hardships do so to live better lives and thus it is morally right to provide them with that possibility.
1.6.2. Con: This is a [false and innacurate dichotomy](https://www.una.org.uk/magazine/1-2016/false-dichotomy-between-%E2%80%98economic-migrants%E2%80%99-and-refugees). Migrants cannot be reduced to ‘economic migrants’ on the one hand and refugees on the other. In fact, it is highly difficult in most cases to isolate a unique cause for the migration.
1.6.3. Con: This would pose a problem only if their average working know-how was comparable to the italian one. As a matter of fact, the average italian is more work-instructed and therefore [not likely to compete for a job](http://www.oecd.org/italy/jobs-for-immigrants-vol-4-9789264214712-en.htm) with a migrant.
1.6.4. Con: Italians have been economic migrants for centuries, and they still are. They have been treated miserably by other countries that claimed the same things now claimed for Africans and Arabs. Treating immigrants and refugees with respect and humanity is Italian's historical duty towards their migrant ancestors.
1.6.5. Con: Data from the Italian national pension agency \(INPS\) and other independent researchers demonstrate that migrants bring a net benefit to Italy's economy. They pay on average more taxes than Italians and are key contributors to the pension system in Italy, which is particularly fragile. [This article](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/impresa-e-territori/2018-07-04/immigrati-rapporto-costi-benefici-e-positivo-l-italia-ecco-perche-124003.shtml?uuid=AEltRrGF&refresh_ce=1) summarises the most important sources.
1.6.6. Pro: According to available data, among more than 300,000 migrants who arrived from the sea, in the last three years, only [less than half](https://openmigration.org/en/fact-checking/what-is-the-real-number-of-refugees-arriving-in-italy/) applied for asylum.
1.6.6.1. Pro: In fact, "out of 100[asylum requests](https://openmigration.org/en/fact-checking/what-is-the-real-number-of-refugees-arriving-in-italy/), only 10 actually end up being given refugee status" and the remaining 90 "are either rejected or accepted through others form of protection".
1.6.6.2. Con: Data shows that "while it is true that the majority of people who arrive in Italy do not apply for asylum", it is [incorrect](https://openmigration.org/en/fact-checking/what-is-the-real-number-of-refugees-arriving-in-italy/) to claim that "this group of people is made exclusively of economic \(and thus irregular\) migrants".
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: While only 1 request of asylum out of 10 get the refugee status, "the number of [requests](https://openmigration.org/en/fact-checking/what-is-the-real-number-of-refugees-arriving-in-italy/) for subsidiary or humanitarian protection that get approved is significantly bigger \(61% in 2013, 60% in 2014, 45% in the first two months of 2015\)".
1.6.6.3. Con: Applying to asylum and being a refugee limits one's ability to take a job and further isolate them from the accepting community.
1.6.7. Con: The western countries that today receive migratory flows, in this case Italy, often have wide margins of discretion to decide the legal status of migrants on its borders, and in the case of wars and famines due to international coalition interventions, they are the same countries that participated in the coalition to decide when to consider ended a war and therefore not to consider migrants as refugees. Therefore, the definition of economic migrants is often misleading.
1.7. Pro: Colonialist countries are the main one responsible for this.
1.7.1. Pro: Italy and most other European countries supported US intervention in the Middle East and North Africa. They must accept responsibility for what they did and take in the people who are fleeing their countries because of that.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Evolution of mankind has always gone in the direction of extending the boundaries of own convenience; problems that affect migrants cannot be considered as just being ‘their own matter’. Thus, the need to help them must be considered a priority over the redistribution of the burden among European nations.
1.7.2. Pro: Highly industrialised countries also play a role on climate change, a factor that might play huge role of immigration.
