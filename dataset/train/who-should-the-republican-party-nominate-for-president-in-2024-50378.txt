1.3.7.4.5. Con: A professor referred to as "Washington's oracle" has stated that it is "[very unlikely](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article250075649.html)" that Trump will be nominated, let alone elected into the White House.
1.4. Chris Christie
1.4.1. Pro: Chris Christie is [not](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/chris-christie-only-moderate-republican-politician-america/309760/) blindly driven by partisan interests.

Look at the record. I have a pretty conservative record.”)."
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Christie's beliefs, initiatives, and policies as governor were indubitably [conservative](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-happened-chris-christie-the-moderate-msna369691).
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Some of Christie's beliefs and actions ran [counter](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/chris-christie-only-moderate-republican-politician-america/309760/) to those of Republicans.

1.4.1.2.2. Con: Many Republicans doubt his [conservative credentials](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/10/chris-christie-presidential-campaign/80195170/)(Murray, who directs the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said Republicans’ doubts about Christie’s conservative credentials were easily stirred back up by opponents’ negative ads after he climbed in the New Hampshire polls in December.).
1.4.1.3. Pro: Some Republicans are [still holding grudge from 2012](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/10/chris-christie-presidential-campaign/80195170/) after Chris Christie declined to campaign for Mitt Romney; a number even blame him for Romney's eventual loss.
1.4.2. Con: Chris Christie was [not a strong contender](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/10/chris-christie-presidential-campaign/80195170/) in the 2016 presidential campaign.
1.4.2.1. Con: Christie could have been laying the groundwork for a future campaign by earning name recognition and public awareness.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Christie himself had [very modest expectations](https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2016/02/02/chris-christie-iowa-new-hampshire/79686226/)(Gov. Chris Christie fell short of the very modest expectations he had for success in Iowa, denying him a momentum-changing springboard that could revive his presidential campaign.) for his candidacy and did not expect to win the nomination.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Christie's Iowa campaign was a disaster.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: As the former head of the Republican Governors Association, he expected to at least beat out the other Governors in the running; he [finished fourth](https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2016/02/02/chris-christie-iowa-new-hampshire/79686226/) among them in Iowa.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Despite having [spent all or part of 42 days in Iowa](https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2016/02/02/chris-christie-iowa-new-hampshire/79686226/)(Christie had spent all or part of 42 days in Iowa since 2010 but wound up receiving slightly less than 2 percent of the vote, 3,278 votes according to unofficial results. He had turned the page on Iowa and was back holding town-hall meetings and a rally in New Hampshire before the votes were tallied.) in the years leading up to the primary, Christie received just 2% of the vote total, barely more than 3,000 votes.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: Christie was not focused on winning Iowa; he and a supporting super PAC [spent just $600,000](https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2016/02/02/chris-christie-iowa-new-hampshire/79686226/)("Iowa is now in the rearview mirror,” Christie said Monday night at Nashua Community College.\n\nChristie's campaign said it and a super PAC supporting the governor spent just $600,000 in Iowa and described New Hampshire as having "been the sole focus of our campaign.") in the state.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Despite being the "[sole focus of our campaign](https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2016/02/02/chris-christie-iowa-new-hampshire/79686226/)(Christie's campaign said it and a super PAC supporting the governor spent just $600,000 in Iowa and described New Hampshire as having "been the sole focus of our campaign.")," Christie lost badly in New Hampshire.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Governor Christie [finished sixth in the New Hampshire](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/chris-christie.html) primary, causing him to suspend his campaign the following day.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Christie spent a [significant amount of time in New Hampshire and received endorsements](https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2016/02/02/chris-christie-iowa-new-hampshire/79686226/)(Christie has spent 66 days in the state, held more than 155 events there and been endorsed by the area's two most conservative newspapers.\n\nChristie, kicking off his get-out-the-vote efforts Tuesday morning with an event at his campaign headquarters in Bedford, explained why he competed in Iowa but why New Hampshire is a better fit for him.\n\n"We’ve got a lot of institutional advantages here that we just never had in Iowa and we weren’t going to be able to make happen in Iowa. So, I'm a realist and that’s why I never looked you in the eye and said, 'Oh, watch out, big surprise in Iowa,'" Christie said.) from both of the leading conservative newspapers.
1.4.3. Pro: Christie's gubernatorial experience and [accomplishments](https://www.nj.com/politics/2018/01/13_best_moments_of_chris_christies_time_as_nj_governor.html) render him a worthy presidential candidate.
1.4.3.1. Con: When the "[Bridgegate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/10/chris-christie-presidential-campaign/80195170/)(This turning point is one nobody realized at the moment. A week of hours-long traffic jams on the lanes connecting local Fort Lee roads to the George Washington Bridge weren’t well-known among the public at large until months later, when emails revealed the woes were intentionally inflicted by people appointed to their jobs by Christie to punish a mayor who didn’t endorse Christie’s re-election.\n\n“Bridgegate just was too big a hurdle to overcome. It wounded him and looked like maybe it was a wound from which he could recover. It turned out" he couldn’t, said John Weingart, associate director of Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics.)" scandal broke, he began to lose credibility among Republican voters.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Eight years later, his campaign [still owes more than $1 million](https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/12/01/christies-2013-campaign-hasnt-paid-off-1m-in-debt-to-two-firms-1338545) stemming from Bridgegate.

Former GOP candidates Bret Schundler and the late W. Cary Edwards both had campaign debts for years.). Former GOP candidates Bret Schundler and the late W.

1.4.4.1. Pro: A number of local New Jersey newspapers united to [ask Chris Christie to resign](https://www.nj.com/opinion/2016/03/christie_resign_for_njs_sake_editorial.html) as Governor of the state of New Jersey.
1.4.4.2. Pro: New Jersey politicians have [called for his resignation](https://www.nj.com/politics/2016/03/another_gop_lawmaker_tells_christie_to_serve_nj_or.html) based on the amount of time and public money spent away from New Jersey.
1.5. Mike Pence
1.5.1. Pro: Mike Pence is one of the [most popular](https://today.yougov.com/ratings/politics/popularity/Republicans/all) Republicans of all time.
1.5.1.1. Con: A significant and passionate bloc of Republican voters have a [violent hatred](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/10/hang-mike-pence-twitter-stops-phrase-trending-capitol-breach) for Mike Pence.
1.5.1.2. Pro: As an [evangelical Christian](https://theconversation.com/in-mike-pence-us-evangelicals-had-their-24-karat-gold-man-in-the-white-house-148161), Mike Pence both represents and appeals to one of the most important contingents of the Republican Party.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: The evangelicalization of the Republican Party has been a [destructive and polarizing trend](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-christian-fundamentalists-took-over-the-republican-party/) within American politics.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the 1960s, Republican powerhouse Barry Goldwater could [already perceive the threat](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/777519-mark-my-word-if-and-when-these-preachers-get-control) that evangelicals posed to the Republican Party's integrity.
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: [Absorbing evangelicals into the Republican Party](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ushistory2os2xmaster/chapter/the-reagan-revolution/) helped to ensure the persistence of conservative values within the United States.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: The Republican Party [relies](https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-americans-politics-drives-their-religious-views/) on the votes of conservative Christians.
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: Prior to the 2016 presidential elections, Mike [Pence](https://theweek.com/speedreads/637487/mike-pence-im-christian-conservative-republican--that-order) had said, "I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican -- in that order."
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: His remarks about his religious affiliation appear to only be a [political ploy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-mike-pence/2019/10/11/5f8adb6c-e9f8-11e9-9306-47cb0324fd44_story.html)(But his most reliable political dogma isn’t about God; it’s about winning — and the latter trumps the former. . . . Four years later, . . . he signed a law allowing businesses to cite religious objections to discriminate against LGBTQ customers. . . . Pence stood firmly with his Christian-right supporters — until Republican billionaire and megadonor Paul Singer, a supporter of gay rights, phoned Pence. . . . Concerned about the prospect of losing a huge cash boost in a future campaign, the governor turned quietly and supported a “fix” that explained that the state would not allow discrimination. The fix passed, and he signed it into law.), as, in the past, contrary values have taken precedence in the face of threats to his political stronghold.
1.5.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Despite directly and indirectly supporting anti-LGBT legislation on multiple occasions, Pence has managed to convince his close aides and friends that he is not [homophobic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-mike-pence/2019/10/11/5f8adb6c-e9f8-11e9-9306-47cb0324fd44_story.html)(\[T\]he U.S. ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell, a gay conservative Republican, said he and his partner have been warmly accepted by the Pences in person: “Mike and Karen are great people, they’re godly people, they’re followers of Christ. They don’t have hate in their heart for anyone. They know my partner. They have accepted us.”).
1.5.1.3. Con: Mike Pence is [unpopular](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1149005/share-us-adults-favorable-opinion-mike-pence/) among Americans, and negative opinions [outweigh](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Mike_Pence) positive ones \(46% vs. 33%\).
1.5.1.4. Pro: Despite serving under one of the [most controversial presidents](https://www.ool.co.uk/blog/donald-trump-controversial-president-history/) in US history, Pence managed to keep his [reputation](https://www.liberty.edu/champion/2020/10/opinion-mike-pence-is-a-leader-and-a-loyal-right-hand-man/) intact.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: His controversial past is virtually unknown only because it was [outnumbered and drowned out](https://www.rollcall.com/2016/10/09/mike-pence-a-meteoric-rise-but-a-controversial-political-past/)(“Some of the things that might have made Gov. Pence controversial in Indiana might have been disqualifying in a different context,” said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University and a renowned vice presidential scholar.\n\n“I think in this instance what has happened is that Trump has made so many controversial statements that \[Pence’s\] record in Indiana hasn’t been deemed particularly interesting or relevant at this point,” Goldstein said.) by the many controversial statements made by Trump.
1.5.1.5. Con: Republicans view [Mike Pence as a traitor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57540611) due to his surrender during the 2020 election.
1.5.2. Pro: Mike Pence is a pinnacle of conservative values.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Mike Pence is committed to [preserving religious freedom](https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/28/pence-talks-religious-freedom-at-ave-maria/3249890002/).
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: In the absence of brisk opposition, outrage, and retaliation, the actions taken by the then-governor of Indiana in the name of religious freedom could have cost millions of Americans their right to [equal and fair treatment](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/04/25/rfra-indiana-why-law-signed-mike-pence-so-controversial/546411002/).
1.5.2.2. Pro: Mike Pence takes a strong, principled stand on [border security](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-welcoming-home-immigrants-human-history-vp-pence/story?id=56186098).
1.5.2.3. Con: Mike Pence is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, who has [consistently undermined](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/19/interview-stuart-stevens-republican-case-against-trump-397918) traditional conservative values.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: A defining feature of conservatism is trust in [authority](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/topics/authority). Thus, by supporting Trump, even when he undermined supposedly conservative values, Pence was paradoxically demonstrating this virtue.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: If Trump runs for president, Pence risks appearing disloyal by running against his former superior.
1.5.2.3.1.2. Con: His unquestioning support for Trump, especially on issues such as [climate change](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/24/politics/mike-pence-climate-crisis/index.html)(Trump has long been a prominent climate change skeptic -- asking why, if global warming is real, then it is still cold out. . . . Pence knows that his path forward -- in this administration or as a presidential candidate in his own right -- is directly tied to Trump. Pleasing Trump. Ensuring that Trump knows he is a good soldier. And, if Pence said that climate change was a threat to the country, Trump would have seen it \(or heard about it\) and not been happy about it.\nSo, Pence did what he did. And he'd do it again.), on which he is misinformed, could prove disastrous.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Pence was a [climate change skeptic](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/5-real-things-mike-pence-has-said-about-climate-change/), if not denier, long before he became vice-president.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: More generally, Pence is [anti-science](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pence-coronavirus-news-anti-science-hiv-epidemic-a9362766.html) and a threat to science.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Trump had entrusted [Pence](http://President Trump has put his No. 2 in charge of the U.S. response to the new coronavirus.) with the task of handling the COVID-19 pandemic. His handling of the outbreak was slow and ineffective, and, in many ways, exacerbated the [crisis](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/mike-pence-coronavirus-response-401862), at least partly because of his resistance to scientific opinion.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Between the time [Pence](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/mike-pence-2-botched-pandemic-responses) assumed this responsibility in February and October 2020, the virus infected more than 7 million Americans and killed more than 200 thousand Americans.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Pence's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is merely a reflection of his poor track record of managing public health crises, as evidenced by his exacerbation of the [HIV outbreak](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/02/how-mike-pence-made-indianas-hiv-outbreak-worse-118648)(Using a mathematical model of epidemic dynamics, we estimated that up to 127 HIV infections could have been averted if Pence had implemented public health measures like HIV testing and needle exchange proactively in 2013, when he had been urged to do so by experts in his state. . . . Was the outbreak avoidable? Public-health experts largely think it was. . . . the outbreak over which Pence presided was avoidable and preventable. Pence’s handling of the Indiana HIV outbreak is a case study in mismanagement of a public health crisis. His inaction as governor gave Austin, Indiana with a population of around 4,200, a higher HIV incidence than “any country in sub-Saharan Africa,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the CDC.) during his time as the governor of Indiana.
1.5.2.3.2. Con: Pence has publicly [disagreed](https://www.investopedia.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-mike-pence-5077702)(Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. The next day Pence tweeted in stark disagreement saying, “Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.”) with Trump on more than one occasion.
1.5.2.4. Con: This claim begs the question of whether conservative values are beneficial for society and, more specifically, [American democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/08/american-democracy-fighting-for-its-life-republicans).
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: In the name of conservative values, women and minorities have been oppressed by Republicans, and Pence is no [exception](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence).
1.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: As [governor of Indiana](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/4-reasons-mike-pence-is-the-absolute-worst-60984/), Pence signed bills that were detrimental to the interests of women, gender minorities, and immigrants.
1.5.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Pence is infamous for signing "[what many believed to be anti-LGBT legislation](https://www.rollcall.com/2016/10/09/mike-pence-a-meteoric-rise-but-a-controversial-political-past/)," and it was arguably the only time he drew national attention as governor.
1.5.2.4.1.2. Pro: Within the first [100 days](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/28/politics/president-biden-first-100-days/index.html) of his presidency, Biden signed executive orders and instituted policy-changes that were intended to empower women and minorities. Pence called these actions a "[war on American traditional values](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/biden-policies-threat-to-american-values-former-vp/2225593)."
1.5.2.4.1.3. Pro: Pence has made many [misogynistic comments](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pence-women-quotes-kamala-harris-debate-b724539.html).
1.5.2.4.1.3.1. Con: None of these comments were made during his vice-presidency. In fact, in the cited article, the only comment he had made during his [term](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pence-women-quotes-kamala-harris-debate-b724539.html)(Today, on #InternationalWomensDay - and ALL days - we recognize the countless contributions women have made to our economy, our communities, & our Nation.\n\n"The Trump Admin will continue to strive to empower women across America to keep making a profound impact.") supported women's empowerment. This change in perspective should be treated as evidence of personal growth.
1.5.2.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Well into his vice-presidency, Pence was reportedly following the [Billy Graham rule](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/02/522247794/beyond-the-mike-pence-misogyny-debate-the-3-billy-graham-rules-you-havent-read)(\[I\]t could easily enable discrimination. After all, it was created by men, in a male-dominated profession. \(And virtually all references to the rule refer to men, not women, practicing it.\) And it's easier to practice in a profession that's male-dominated — like, for example, Washington politics. Were a woman to act similarly, it would probably be tougher, perhaps even impracticable, in a heavily male Congress or White House. Congress, after all, has about the same share of women right now as the clergy.): the "practice, of avoiding alone time with another woman." This practice, especially among highly powerful state officials, alienates and excludes women from spaces in which they lack representation.
1.5.2.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: According to some reports, prior to assuming office, Pence had reportedly held Trump [accountable](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence)(Pence refused to take Trump’s calls and sent him a letter saying that he and Karen, as Christians, were deeply offended by his actions and needed to make an “assessment” about whether to remain with the campaign. They urged Trump to pray. When Trump and Pence finally did talk, Pence told him that his wife still had “huge problems” with his behavior. But in public Pence was forgiving, saying, “I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.”) for his infamous comments about how he "grabs" women.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: Unlike liberal moral values, conservative moral values are not based on [empathy](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201111122753.htm)(\[T\]hose moral foundations known to be more appealing to liberals than conservatives -- specifically, fairness and harm avoidance -- are linked to empathic motivation, whereas the moral foundations that are more appealing to conservatives than to liberals -- such as ingroup loyalty and deference to authority -- are not.).
1.5.2.4.3. Pro: Strictly speaking, conservatism is antithetical to [democratic values](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html).
1.5.2.4.3.1. Pro: This intuitively makes sense as conservative values often deprive individuals of the right and freedom to make their own decisions independently.
1.5.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: The term "pro-choice" exemplifies this principle. Conservative values deprive women of the right to choose for themselves, whereas liberal values empower women to independently make their own decisions.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Mike Pence has shown his commitment to US democracy by [disavowing the January 6th insurrection](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003228976/pence-distances-himself-from-trump-over-jan-6th-insurrection).
1.5.2.5.1. Con: While this is admirable, it most likely cost him his popularity among [Republicans](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/04/politics/mike-pence-donald-trump-2024/index.html)(What Trump has done is make acknowledging the truth of what happened on January 6 -- and his role in it -- a sort of loyalty test for ambitious Republicans. Tell the truth about that day and run the risk of becoming the next Liz Cheney, run out of her Republican leadership job. Lie about that day -- or try to downplay the actual danger the riot posed to lawmakers -- and keep your job a la Kevin McCarthy.\nPence appears to be putting himself, purposely, in the former category.).
1.5.2.5.1.1. Pro: Beyond presidency, his failure to support Trump following the insurrection appears to have already cost him his shot at a [second term](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-pence-white-house-bid-b1860877.html)(“I was disappointed with Mike on one thing . . . ,” Mr Trump said.\n\nHe did not specify the reason for his disappointment in the interview, but his reference could likely be on the lack of support from Mr Pence when he hoped the vice president would use his position as president of the Senate to help with his challenge to the Electoral College vote, following the 6 January Capitol riot.) as vice-president, should Trump decide to run for office in 2024.
1.5.2.5.2. Con: Pence's disagreement with Trump over the insurrection may have less to do with his commitment to US democracy and more to do with the fact that he was in "[mortal peril](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-s-actions-during-capitol-riot-put-pence-danger-national-n1257772)(One of the key questions asked in former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is whether he knew that his vice president was in mortal peril on Jan. 6. There are only two possible answers: Either he knew and didn’t care or he was deliberately and cruelly incurious — knowing that he could have easily asked about former Vice President Mike Pence and did not — because Pence’s safety did not matter to him as much as the ambient excitement of the insurrection apparently did.)" largely because of Trump's \(in\)actions.
1.5.3. Con: Mike Pence did not accomplish much during his time as vice-president to [convince](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/politics/pences-accomplishments-as-vp) the public that he is a worthy presidential candidate.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Even prior to his presidency, Pence had a "[troubling](https://www.rollcall.com/2016/10/09/mike-pence-a-meteoric-rise-but-a-controversial-political-past/)" track record as governor of Indiana.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.1.1.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.1.
1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.
1.5.3.3. Con: Under the Trump administration, Pence could not be his [true self](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/19/mike-pences-future-chances-running-president-hurt-trump/6640990002/)(Jim Atterholt, a Pence confidant who was his top aide when Pence was Indiana’s governor, said the “very strict message discipline” that Pence has had to maintain under Trump often prevented him from showing “the Mike Pence that I know – kind, empathetic, funny and self-deprecating.”\n\n“If the public ever gets to see that side of Mike Pence,” Atterholt told USA TODAY, “I believe he will some day be president.")--a man whom the general public is expected to very much like.
1.6. Tom Cotton
1.6.1. Pro: Senator Tom Cotton is the youthful injection the Republican party needs.
1.6.1.1. Pro: At just 44 years old, Senator Tom Cotton would likely be the youngest candidate.
1.6.1.2. Con: Youthful exuberance cannot make up for lack of life experience.
1.6.2. Pro: Senator Cotton has an impressive number of achievements.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The Arkansas Senator fought in the [wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/about).
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: His service record speaks for itself; he was awarded the [Bronze Star Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, and Ranger Tab](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/about).
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Military service is important, we need to support our troops; Senator Cotton would be the best option from that perspective.
1.6.2.1.3. Con: There is [no correlation](https://taskandpurpose.com/mandatory-fun/military-service-political-prerequisite/)(When you look at presidential ranking lists — not the public opinion lists, but ones conducted by highly qualified scholars and historians — you’ll see no correlation between those on that list and whether or not they served in any notable military capacity.) between effective political leadership and military service; many excellent leaders are civilians.
1.6.2.1.4. Con: Participation in two [failed wars](https://www.csis.org/analysis/americas-failed-strategy-middle-east-losing-iraq-and-gulf) does not make Cotton more qualified to be President.
1.6.2.1.5. Pro: 58% of Republican voters [consider military service to be an asset](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/20/more-republicans-than-democrats-see-military-service-as-asset-for-presidential-candidates/) for presidential candidates.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Senator Cotton is very intelligent.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Tom Cotton attended both Harvard and Harvard Law, and [reads Plato and Heidegger](https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cotton-laying-groundwork-2024-presidential-run-new-hampshire-2020-10).
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: Senator Cotton was on Trump's [shortlist of candidates](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/09/trump-releases-new-list-of-potential-supreme-court-nominees/) for the late Justice Ginsberg's Supreme Court vacancy.
1.6.3. Con: The [Tea Party endorses Tom Cotton](http://teapartyexpress.org/4466/tea-party-express-endorses-tom-cotton-in-arkansas), a sign that he might be an extreme-right candidate.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Political parties typically endorse candidates that espouse similar values.
1.6.4. Con: Senator Cotton often chooses violence to solve problems.
1.6.4.1. Con: His distinctive [military career](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/about) probably created the tendency to choose semi-violent rhetoric to provide clarity in his speeches though it is uncertain whether these seemingly violent statements would actually be backed up with physical violence down the road.
1.6.4.2. Pro: When the Black Lives Matter protests were going on in Summer 2020, he wrote an Op-Ed asking the federal government to "[send in the troops](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html)" to restore order.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Dictators and fascists are known for choosing violence to squash political and social uprisings.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: Restoring and maintaining law and order is essential to keep society functioning.
1.6.4.2.3. Con: The New York Times editor later added an editor's note and a number of clarifications. "The headline — which [was written by The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html)(Editors’ Note, June 5, 2020:\n\nAfter publication, this essay met strong criticism from many readers \(and many Times colleagues\), prompting editors to review the piece and the editing process. Based on that review, we have concluded that the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.\n\nThe basic arguments advanced by Senator Cotton — however objectionable people may find them — represent a newsworthy part of the current debate. But given the life-and-death importance of the topic, the senator’s influential position and the gravity of the steps he advocates, the essay should have undergone the highest level of scrutiny. Instead, the editing process was rushed and flawed, and senior editors were not sufficiently involved. While Senator Cotton and his staff cooperated fully in our editing process, the Op-Ed should have been subject to further substantial revisions — as is frequently the case with such essays — or rejected.), not Senator Cotton — was incendiary and should not have been used."
1.6.4.2.3.1. Pro: The director of the editorial page [resigned over the controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/07/new-york-times-editor-resigns-tom-cotton-oped-protests).
1.6.4.2.3.2. Con: In Cotton's editorial, he did indeed call for the deployment of troops to American cities, and Cotton's [official website](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/send-in-the-troops) uses the New York Times's original headline without comment.
1.6.4.2.4. Con: This actually turned into a positive for Cotton; he [quintupled his fundraising](https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1269792011361628162?s=20) immediately following the article fallout.
1.6.4.3. Pro: In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, Cotton used [unsettling rhetoric to drive his point across](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism)(“Let there be no doubt about this point,” Cotton said, in a recent speech to the Council on Foreign Relations. “If we are forced to take action, the United States has the ability to totally destroy Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. And, if they choose to rebuild it, we could destroy it again, until they get the picture. Nor should we hesitate if compelled to take military action.” In describing his preferred approach to negotiations with Iran, Cotton said, “One thing I learned in the Army is that when your opponent is on his knees you drive him to the ground and choke him out.” In response, a questioner pointed out that killing a prisoner of war is not “American practice.” \(It is, in fact, a war crime.\)), saying when "your opponent is on his knees you drive him to the ground and choke him out.”
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: The killing of prisoners of war is a war crime, something Cotton [alluded to having no problem](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism)(In describing his preferred approach to negotiations with Iran, Cotton said, “One thing I learned in the Army is that when your opponent is on his knees you drive him to the ground and choke him out.” In response, a questioner pointed out that killing a prisoner of war is not “American practice.” \(It is, in fact, a war crime.\)) committing.
1.6.5. Pro: Senator Tom Cotton is an honest man.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Unlike the majority of other Republican Representatives, Tom Cotton [did not enrich himself](https://ballotpedia.org/Tom_Cotton)(Cotton's net worth as of 2012 was estimated between $165,003 and $400,000. That averages to $282,501, which is lower than the average net worth of Republican representatives in 2012 of $7,614,097.96.) as a Representative.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Some of the other Republican representatives could have had money before they became representatives; they did not necessarily enrich themselves on the job.
1.6.6. Con: Intolerance is frequently associated with Senator Cotton.
1.6.6.1. Pro: He has [posted a number of conspiracy theories](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china) around COVID-19, including referring to it as the "China Flu," and saying it was created in a lab.
1.6.7. Con: At a glance, Senator Cotton is reminiscent of former President Trump.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Tom Cotton is a heavy Twitter user and frequently [tweets unfiltered opinions on a variety of subjects](https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cotton-laying-groundwork-2024-presidential-run-new-hampshire-2020-10)(He has become omnipresent on Fox News, embraced his own genre of trolling on Twitter, and demonstrated an attunement to online culture wars and an ability to capitalize on them with his controversial New York Times op-ed article that led to the resignation of the paper's editorial-page editor.); the United States does not need another "[Commander-in-Tweet](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-commander-in-tweet-returns-when-a-69344/)."
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Not having a filter could be a positive trait, Cotton would speak his mind on tough subjects; everyone would know where he stands.
1.6.7.1.2. Pro: Cotton has shown [certain violent tendencies](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/think-donald-trump-is-bad-president-tom-cotton-would-be-even-more-terrifying) and could end up committing many of the same violations Trump did, including [incitement of violence](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html).
1.6.7.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.6.7.2. Pro: It appears as though Cotton is actually [attempting to emulate Trump](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-tom-cottons-next-mission-carrying-trump-banner-after-trump-11591542001) in a variety of ways, especially their political views.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: When Trump [attempted to purchase Greenland from Denmark](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/tom-cotton-buy-greenland-idea-trump/index.html), Senator Cotton took credit for the idea.
1.6.7.2.2. Pro: Cotton [hardly ever criticizes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism)(Cotton has made a different bet, offering only the gentlest of criticisms of the President. When, in the course of several weeks of conversations, I asked Cotton about one or another of Trump’s controversial statements or tweets, he always responded in the same manner. “The President puts things sometimes in a way that I would not,” he said in early October. “But he was still nominated by our voters and elected by the American people to be our President, and if we want him to accomplish our agenda we need to set him up for success.”) anything Trump does.
1.6.7.2.2.1. Pro: Trump was rumored to have been [considering Cotton to head the C.I.A.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism)(Cotton has emerged as such a close ally of the Trump White House that one recent report suggested that the President would name him director of the C.I.A. if Mike Pompeo, the current director, were to replace Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. \(Trump is widely believed to be dissatisfied with Tillerson.\)) if he moved Mike Pompeo to State.
1.6.7.2.3. Pro: The repeal of the Dreamers Act was [largely influenced by Senator Cotton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism)(In September, President Trump repealed the Obama-era executive order known as daca, which protected the so-called Dreamers from deportation, but he said that he also wanted Congress to pass a law that would allow them to remain in the United States, even making a preliminary deal with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic congressional leaders. But, after Cotton spoke out against a quick deal to protect the Dreamers, Trump made a formal proposal to Congress that attached many strings Cotton had demanded. “I had dinner with the President and General Kelly on October 2nd, and we talked about daca,” Cotton told me. “They said that Chuck and Nancy had done some post-dinner spin, to go along with the post-dinner dessert, about what the President actually agreed to on daca. I think the fix that the President announced is a better step in the right direction.”).
1.6.7.3. Con: Senator Cotton is much more aligned with establishment politics than Trump.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: Karl Rove once said, “Cotton is not like a Steve Bannon, who wants to blow up the existing structure, uproot the ideology of the Republican Party and replace it with something new. He’s a rising star. [He’s capable of building bridges within the Party](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism). He wants to get things done.”
