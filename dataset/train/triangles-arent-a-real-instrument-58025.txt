Discussion Name: Triangles aren't a real instrument.

1. Triangles aren't a real instrument.
1.1. Con: You can make some music with triangles. So it’s a musical instrument.
1.1.1. Con: You can make music from almost anything that makes a sound if you are creative enough. So this line of reasoning can lead to a definition of instrument that is too broad.
1.2. Con: Triangles are like all other musical instruments: they make a certain noise, some enjoy the noise they make and have even been incorporated into some songs. Theoretically speaking, anything can be a musical instrument, if it creates a sound that some people like.
1.2.1. Pro: Even silence is considered music, as shown by John Cage's song "4'33", which consists of 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence. \(4'33 is OFFICIALLY recognized as a song\).
1.3. Pro: Musical instruments should be able to play different notes, whereas the Triangle can only play one note and is very stupid.
1.4. Con: Triangles have musical significance as instruments in some cultures.
1.4.1. Pro: In 18th-century Europe, triangles played an essential role in [Turkish Janissary music](https://www.britannica.com/art/triangle-musical-instrument).
1.4.2. Pro: For example, they are [prevalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_\(musical_instrument\)#Folk_and_popular_music) in Cajun music, as well as the Brazilian Forró style.
1.4.3. Con: Triangles being recognized as instruments in some cultures does not justify why they shouldn't be stripped off their title as a musical instrument based on objective criteria.
1.5. Con: If the triangle is not considered an instrument, hundreds of other percussive instruments such as the bass drum would also not be instruments.
1.5.1. Pro: [Several percussion instruments](https://www.britannica.com/art/instrumentation-music/Percussion-instrumentation) have an indefinite pitch, emitting the same sound every single time. In this regard, the triangle - which is also a percussion instrument - is no different.
1.5.2. Con: Whether a musical instrument should be regarded as such should be determined based on accepted definitions of this term, not based on the potential exclusion of other instruments that also fail to fulfill this criteria.
1.5.2.1. Con: Definitions of words should match how words are used and keep similar things together. A definition that excludes percussion instruments wouldn’t match how people use the word instrument, and if triangles are similar to other percussion instruments, a definition that keeps the others while removing triangles would be arbitrary.
1.5.2.2. Con: The accepted definitions include [percussion instruments](https://www.orsymphony.org/learning-community/instruments/percussion/) and, as such, should include triangles.
1.6. Pro: A triangle has next to no musical function and requires no skill to play.
1.6.1. Pro: The simplicity and uselessness of a triangle makes it no better than a table or piece of plastic for musical purposes
1.6.1.1. Con: Although they can be used to create music, tables and other objects have distinct primary purposes; in contrast, the primary and only purpose of the triangle is to create music. This distinguishes the triangle from other objects.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Plastic bottles will never be classified as an instrument.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: If a piece of trash was used to create sounds, its primary function would be to create music.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many have dedicated their lives to making [music from actual trash](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/building-musical-movement-trash)(Musician Shady Rabab had an idea: to get kids off the streets through making musical instruments from plastic waste.\n\nTwelve months after winning the Young Champion of the Earth prize for Africa 2018, his project is a reality. He is working with children from vulnerable backgrounds and marginal communities to make beautiful instruments, and a community which comes together to make new melodies.\n\nThe Garbage Music project, by Rabab Luxor, uses art and creative expression to counter plastic pollution. It motivates youth to build their knowledge and increase their awareness about the challenges threatening the environment and how that impacts their lives.) for philanthropic purposes. This doesn't reduce the value of these devices as musical instruments.
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: When a person looks at a piece of plastic on the ground, they don't think, "Oh what a nice instrument! I'm gonna make melodies out of this."
1.6.2. Pro: Hitting metal against metal is not music. If so, every kid having a temper-tantrum in a hardware store would be a composer, or whatever the term is.
1.6.2.1. Con: “Hitting metal against metal” is as accurate a description of the triangle as it is any number of percussion instruments as well as the banjo or any guitar played with steel picks.
1.6.3. Pro: Due to its simplicity, considering a triangle a musical instrument would be unfair to those who play more complex and harder-to-learn instruments.
1.6.4. Con: The triangle appears easy to play, but is actually [difficult to play well](https://www.npr.org/2014/07/05/328512620/how-to-be-a-professional-triangle-player-in-17-easy-steps)(The triangle is such a simple instrument," he tells NPR's Tamara Keith. "I mean it doesn't even have a name. Its name is its shape. But it's that simplicity that can exacerbate the details in one's playing.).
1.6.4.1. Pro: A [skilled player](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Triangle)(You can make any triangle very loud or very soft.\nYou can strike the triangle in different places to get a small range of sounds, described as "lighter" or "darker" and "thin" or "full.") can create a range of different sounds using the same triangle.
1.6.5. Con: The [simplicity of this instrument](https://www.musicgateway.com/blog/how-to/triangle-instrument)(Here is a step by step guide of how to make one at home:\n\n Get 2 hollow metal bars 5-8 inches long and then grab another hollow metal bar slightly shorter than the other 2.\n With a soldering iron \(be safe as they can get really hot\) connect the metal bars in a triangle shape. The shorter bar should only connect from one side leaving the other side not connected.\n Get a thin stick, ideally another metal piece that can be used to hit the triangle. You can also get a long metal road and bend it into the shape of a triangle by hitting it with a metal hammer, but that process might be too noisy. Different lengths of metal bars will change the audio pitch.\n\nThat’s it, you got yourself a DIY triangle instrument!) means that anyone can easily make a triangle at home and learn to [jam to tracks](https://www.musicgateway.com/blog/how-to/triangle-instrument)(Let’s get into the fun stuff of why the triangle instrument matters!\n\nFirst of all, it is quick to learn and requires little practice to be able to play along with any song. Jamming with live musicians or recorded music is a fun activity. Being able to play along a melodic instrument such as piano or guitar requires the rhythmic and melodic understanding of music. \n\nHowever, percussive instruments such as the triangle just need to be rhythmical. As humans, we are naturally rhythmical. Even the people who think they cannot dance can still internalise a simple 4/4 beat!), regardless of affordability and musical talent.
1.6.5.1. Con: Simplicity and affordability are not the defining criteria for what constitutes a musical instrument.
1.6.6. Con: Like any other percussive instrument, the player needs to keep time with the rhythm of the background music. This makes the triangle a musical instrument like any other.
1.6.7. Pro: Most musical instruments can be used in isolation to create music \(e.g., guitar, piano, drums\). However, a triangle solo would simply be a series of clanging sounds.
1.6.8. Pro: Unlike other instruments, the triangle has [an indefinite pitch](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Triangle)(Triangles have an indefinite pitch, the notes will appear on the same line often as some of the other such instruments, such as bass drum and cymbal.), meaning the same sound is emitted each time it is struck. This cannot be used to create music, which is essentially a collection of notes.
1.6.8.1. Con: Most percussion instruments have an indefinite pitch, as is noted by the article cited.
1.7. Pro: Removing the triangle from the list of music instruments would have no impact on music created in the past, present, or future. This proves its insignificance.
1.7.1. Con: The simplicity of the triangle makes it [excellent comedy fodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_\(musical_instrument\)). Not recognizing this instrument would mean losing out on a lot of funny content.
1.7.2. Pro: Due to the nature of the sound emitted by the triangle, it should be [used quite sparingly](https://answersmore.com/why-does-a-triangle-make-sound/)(A single stroke on the triangle clearly penetrates the full force of an orchestra, and it is perhaps most effective when used sparingly.). Given that its usage is already sparse, not including it in a musical arrangement is unlikely to be noticed.
1.7.2.1. Con: Even instruments that have only small roles in a musical arrangement are still included on purpose by the composer. A casual listener might not notice their absence, but they still contribute to the overall arrangement. A lot of percussion instruments fit this description.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Even if a similar sound is necessary, one does not need a triangle to create this sound. Other musical instruments or common household objects like an [empty wine glass](https://www.musicgateway.com/blog/how-to/triangle-instrument) can be used to create this sound.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: Ease of replication using household objects is not a valid reason to disqualify the triangle as a musical instruments. The sound produced by many other instruments can also be replicated using such objects.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: Many percussion sounds can be easily produced using [common household objects](https://musictech.com/tutorials/make-sampled-drum-kit-household-items/) including salt shakers, buckets, and pans.
1.7.3. Con: Certain instruments may be less frequently used in musical arrangements because they are less popular and under-recognized, meaning there are fewer people to teach how they should be played. This is not a valid reason to strip them of their status as musical instruments.
1.8. Pro: The triangle makes [a "clangy" sound](https://www.musicgateway.com/blog/how-to/triangle-instrument), comparable to the sound produced by many other metal objects. This sound is often annoying to listeners and should, therefore, be classified as noise rather than music.
1.8.1. Con: Any noise can become music if you can get a pleasing rhythm from that noise.
1.8.2. Pro: A similar sound can be created by tapping a metal piece of cutlery against a champagne glass, yet this combination of glass and metal is not considered a musical instrument.
1.8.3. Con: The difference between "noise" and "music" is subjective, even as per objective definitions.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The [tapping of a shoe](https://www.musicabilitylessons.com/blog//the-difference-between-music-and-noise)(Someone nearby is tapping their toe. Is this an irritating noise or a musical sound? As it turns out, the difference depends almost entirely upon the listener.), for example, may be noise to one person but rhythmic beats to another.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: There are many forms of dance where the shoes are used as [percussive instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance). In all such instances, the tapping of the shoe is music, regardless of what one may feel or think.
1.8.3.2. Con: There are absolute differences between noise and music. This is why a person can study music and reproduce a musical score; in contrast, one cannot study or reproduce noise.
1.8.3.2.1. Con: Noise is simply a loud or unpleasant sound that causes a disturbance. As such it can be studied and reproduced just as well as any other sound, including music.
1.8.3.3. Pro: [Many famous numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_\(musical_instrument\)) feature the triangle, meaning many people like how this instrument sounds.
1.8.4. Con: [Cymbals](https://www.britannica.com/art/cymbal) also create a "clangy" sound, but they are considered to be "a real instrument."
1.9. Con: Triangles are classified as instruments.
1.9.1. Con: The triangle is so unremarkable that it has been named after how it looks: a triangle. This is a feature that is shared by no other musical instrument.
1.9.1.1. Con: The name of an instrument has no bearing on its quality as a musical instrument.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Renaming the triangle as something else would not eliminate questions about whether the triangle is a "real" instrument.
1.9.1.2. Con: [Shakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaker_\(musical_instrument\)), [handpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handpan), and [steelpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelpan) are musical instruments with names that describe their appearance and function, yet these are not a legitimate reason to not regard them as such.
1.9.1.3. Con: The name "triangle" is a misnomer.
1.9.1.3.1. Pro: The triangle is not entirely a triangle. One of the corners is [left open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_\(musical_instrument\)) to allow it to create an indefinite pitch.
1.9.1.3.2. Pro: In earlier times, the triangle sometimes took the shape of a [trapezoid](https://www.britannica.com/art/triangle-musical-instrument).
1.9.1.4. Pro: Other instruments have unique names \(e.g., piano, guitar\) that differentiate them from other entities. With the triangle, the fact that the name of the instrument has not been differentiated from the shape underscores its insignificance.
1.9.1.4.1. Con: [Drumsticks](https://www.britannica.com/art/kettledrum) share their name with a [vegetable](https://recipes.timesofindia.com/articles/features/what-are-drumsticks-and-8-interesting-ways-to-cook-them/photostory/73701172.cms) as well as a [chicken body part](https://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--38073/drumstick.asp), yet this does not mean that they are unremarkable.
1.9.2. Pro: Accepted definitions suggest that any object capable of making a musical sound is [a musical instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument). By this definition, a triangle is an instrument.
