Discussion Name: The mainstream news media in the USA is, in aggregate, corrupt.

1. The mainstream news in the USA is, in aggregate, corrupt.
1.1. Con: It is only corrupt if the purpose of a given news company is expressed by themselves as doing one thing, but then subverts that one thing to do something else.
1.1.1. Pro: The burden of proof would be to show that a given news company did subvert their own intent. Outside of rare anecdotal leaks this doesn't seem to be provable.
1.1.1.1. Con: [Project Veritas](https://www.projectveritas.com/) is doing just this with under cover videos of cnn and being privy to leaked facebook documents about algorithm manipulation to suppress certain views.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: [Project Veritas is not a reliable source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Veritas). It has been founded by an American far-right activist group, in an effort to discredit mainstream media organizations.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Project Veritas is not a reliable source because it's biased. It serves a [conservative political agenda](https://aftmichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/what-is-project-veritas12.pdf) without adhering to basic journalistic ethics. \(p.1\)
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Project Veritas is not a reliable source because it has frequently been [criticized for editing its videos to deceive its audience and misrepresent its subjects](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/projectveritasbackgrounder_may2018.pdf).
1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Being "right wing" doesn't imply they are corrupt in their investigation and coverage of other news agencies.
1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: "Far-right" is a subjective, possibly slanderous, description that may be implicitly interpreted as meaning "too far to be rational".
1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: According to the [dictionary](http://"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20far%20right), far-right is an objective and socially agreed word used to describe "the group of people whose political views are the most conservative."
1.1.1.2. Pro: [CNN mission statement](https://mission-statement.com/cnn/#:~:text=CNN%20\(Cable%20News%20Network\)%20Mission%20and%20Vision%20Statements%20Analysis&text=CNN%20mission%20statement%20is%20%E2%80%9Cto,empowering%20the%20people%20through%20information.) is “to inform, engage and empower the world.”
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Corruption on this account would then be to prove that CNN is subverting the goal of "informing," "engaging," and "empowering" for some other goal contrary to these.
1.1.1.3. Pro: [NBCUniversal mission statement](https://mission-statement.com/nbcuniversal/#:~:text=NBCUniversal%20mission%20statement%20is%20%E2%80%9Cto,being%20the%20best%20there%20is.) is “to be the premier content provider for television and digital platforms, spanning all television.”
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: It would appear that NBC has no desire to assert any goal into the realm of media other than being premier. This low bar would allow for disingenuous news reporting as long as it was, "premier."
1.1.1.4. Pro: [FOX News Channel \(FNC\) is](https://press.foxnews.com/) a 24-hour all-encompassing news service dedicated to delivering breaking news as well as political and business news.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: This low bar allows for Fox to underwhelm and mislead so long as it was breaking news or related to politics or business.
1.1.1.5. Pro: [CBS News is](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/CBS-News/about#:~:text=CBS%20News%20is%20the%20news,set%20in%20today's%20digital%20age.) the news and information division of ViacomCBS, dedicated to providing the best in journalism.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: CBS at least talks about journalism in their mission statement. This should give hope for disenfranchised viewers that perhaps they can be swayed by feedback regarding their news while reflecting on "dedication to the best in journalism".
1.1.2. Con: The purpose of any news company i[s to spread information on a wider scale](https://www.sociologygroup.com/purpose-news-functions-journalism/), otherwise it wouldn't be categorized as a news company.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Corruption in news companies happens when the information that is spread has ulterior motives tied to economic benefits.
1.1.2.2. Con: A company's intent cannot be determined by the use of the word "news" anymore than "service center" can be used to determine if they can change tires.
1.2. Con: This is private "corruption", which is made of voluntary actors who have broken no law in conspiracy with each other and/or in excess. Media companies are private entities and can therefore set their own agenda.
1.2.1. Con: To the extent that government and other big businesses exert significant influence over media companies to shift that agenda, the [media are not honestly performing their advertised function](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/377116). At a minimum, this is a conflict of interest, which means there are likely to be cases of outright fraud.
1.2.2. Pro: "Mainstream news" is a misnomer. It is a free market of numerous competing actors.
1.2.3. Pro: Private media companies are f[or-profit and sustained by commercial revenues](https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/me/meb/meb03a/meb03a02), therefore their agenda depends on economic profit.
1.2.3.1. Pro: [15 billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2016/06/01/these-15-billionaires-own-americas-news-media-companies/?sh=2b64cf4d660a) own the US media companies.
1.2.3.2. Con: All media, private or non-private, have their own agenda, whether it is for economic profit, or political benefits.
1.2.4. Con: Because [media companies are private entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_cross-ownership_in_the_United_States) and set their own agenda for their own benefits, the news are not produced for the benefit of US society.
1.2.5. Con: Whether someone or something is corrupt does not depend on the freedom to set one's own agenda. This is therefore irrelevant.
1.3. Con: The US mainstream media is not corrupt, they are biased as a consequence of their [traditional gatekeeper role.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2020/02/17/were-not-biased-were-liberals-how-cultural-leftism-will-slant-social-media-regulation/?sh=1ff6afa1503c)
1.3.1. Pro: US mass media plays an important role in [strengthening society, promoting knowledge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273309150_Process_of_Gate_Keeping_in_Media_From_Old_Trend_to_New), and disseminating different types of information.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Mass media in the USA play a significant role in the process of foreign policymaking "[through their contribution as observer, participants, and catalysts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327744957_American_Mass_Media_and_Foreign_Policy_A_Study_about_the_Role_of_Whitehouse_and_Main_Stream_Print_and_Electronic_Media_in_effecting_the_Process_of_Development_of_American_Foreign_Policy)".
1.3.1.2. Con: US mass media also plays an important role in weakening democracy by [strengthening racism](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/enduring-whiteness-of-american-journalism).
1.3.1.3. Con: [When the media is corrupted by ideological or political bias](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-0242-8_26-1), they weaken society by promoting the uptake of negative stereotypes and bigotry on all sides of the debate.
1.3.2. Con: Mainstream media are partisan and untrustworthy because they seek profit, therefore their '[gatekeeper](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/medias-moment-of-truth-who-are-the-gatekeepers-in-the-trump-era)' role is corrupt.
1.3.2.1. Con: While they are heavily partisan no proof of corruption has been uncovered. Corruption is defined as: "a willingness to act dishonestly in exchange for the fulfillment of selfish interests."
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The media has an important role in [fighting corruption](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/anti-corruption/module-10/key-issues/the-role-of-the-media-in-fighting-corruption.html).
1.3.2.2. Con: Following this logic, any profit-seeking enterprise, from bakeries to social networks, is corrupt. But that is hardly a convincing definition of corruption.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Within a capitalistic society, the aim of most [institutions and companies is to seek profit](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102914/main-characteristics-capitalist-economies.asp).
1.3.2.2.2. Con: While other profit-seeking enterprises exchange a good or a service for money, mainstream media is meant to provide information and facts, therefore corruption can't be comparable.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: According to the [definition of corruption](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/corruption)(Illegal, bad, or dishonest behaviour, especially by people in positions of power.), mainstream news media hold a position of power, therefore they can be corrupted.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Media could be defined as a broad term encompassing a variety of content provided to the public, or sectors of the public, over a range of platforms, therefore media corruption could directly [affect our human's rights to freedom of expressions](https://www.kas.de/documents/285576/11521648/MLHSA+2021+-+1+The+role+of+the+media.pdf/f54a092e-1f2d-543d-291a-9603556b3773?t=1612258525961). \(p.11\)
1.3.2.3. Pro: The [media plays an important role in society](https://usa.usembassy.de/media.htm) as a source of information, therefore if that information is "bought", their role becomes corrupt.
1.3.3. Pro: Journalists are creating news they think the public would find most interesting, regardless of truth, and [led by sensationalism](https://reporter.rit.edu/news/sensationalism-media).
1.3.3.1. Pro: Because media companies are private and their aim is to make a profit, all the topics covered are chosen depending on their potential reach.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Journalism has been experiencing a decline in [readership](http://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/), [revenue](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/01/circulation-and-revenue-fall-for-newspaper-industry/) and [public trust](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trust-in-media-down.php).
1.3.3.1.2. Con: The fact that news are chosen depending on their potential reach doesn't prove that media companies are corrupt.
1.3.3.2. Con: Because mainstream media compete for the news, journalists can't publish their work regardless of the truth, as otherwise, their work would be proven false by other journalists.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Media companies play an [important role in the dissemination of fake news](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23808985.2020.1759443).
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: The [media company Fox](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/the-data-is-in-fox-news-may-have-kept-millions-from-taking-the-coronavirus-threat-seriously/2020/06/26/60d88aa2-b7c3-11ea-a8da-693df3d7674a_story.html) published misleading information about COVID-19.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Con: The rise of ‘[the fake news genre](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23808985.2020.1759443)’ which refers to "the intentional spread of false information, masked as traditional news" helps media companies advance political goals or generate ad revenues.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: [Investigative journalism](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2014/10/20/ten-noteworthy-moments-in-u-s-investigative-journalism/) has historically uncovered many false claims or hidden truths.
1.3.4. Con: The role of the media in society is to provide information and be the conduit by which news and perspectives are exchanged in society. That's why when media bias objectively damages their ability to perform their primary role, their function is corrupted by definition.
1.3.4.1. Con: [Objective damaging bias](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/trust.pdf) would imply misrepresenting the facts, suppressing facts or just lying, which is very different from ideological bias which is not damaging. \(p.1\)
1.3.4.2. Pro: [Subjective biased news articles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005620300102) can condition negatively the opinions of citizens.
1.4. Pro: There are institutional/structural incentives towards corruption which are ingrained, entrenched, or natural within America.
1.4.1. Con: [Capitalism is based on incentives](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5002/economics/pros-and-cons-of-capitalism/), therefore following this logic every single institution that exists in our societies could be corrupt.
1.4.2. Pro: The media is largely owned by huge corporations with a profit motive. This motive is what drives most corruption.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Most of the US mainstream media that reach a large audience are owned by for-profit corporations–institutions, which obligates them by law to put the [profits of their investors ahead of all other considerations](https://fair.org/about-fair/whats-wrong-with-the-news/).
1.4.2.2. Pro: [Advertisers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460787) play a strong influence in for-profit mainstream media corporations.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: One of the [basic principles of a free press](https://www.grin.com/document/154259) demands form the media to operate in a competitive market, where they depend on advertising to make profit.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: [Advertising negatively impacts on media bias](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228137391_The_Impact_of_Advertising_on_Media_Bias), because their editorial content is controlled by their advertising clients.
1.4.2.3. Con: Mainstream news media need profit in order to pay their staff and fund their journalistic investigations.
1.4.2.4. Con: Mainstream media has also used their influence to fight corruption.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: The illegal activities of the Central Intelligence Agency were disclosed by [the New York Times](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/39731NCJRS.pdf). \(p.1\)
1.4.2.4.2. Con: Even if mainstream media might have uncovered some scandals, it still suffers from [mistrust from the public](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/the-fall-rise-and-fall-of-media-trust.php).
1.4.2.5. Pro: 6 corporations control [90% of the media outlets in the U.S](https://techstartups.com/2020/09/18/6-corporations-control-90-media-america-illusion-choice-objectivity-2020/).
1.4.2.6. Con: Media concentration in big corporations is due to a natural trend of [consolidation of the sector](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199987238.001.0001/acprof-9780199987238-chapter-18).
1.5. Pro: The purpose of the media is keeping the populace well-informed. Deviation from this suggests corruption.
1.5.1. Pro: Mainstream news doesn't focus enough on important things.
1.5.1.1. Con: Talking about important and deep issues takes a lot of work and money.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Yet there are many instances whenever one or [few practically unpaid Youtubers](https://futurism.com/the-byte/teens-trust-youtubers-journalists) do much better reporting than the mainstream media.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Mainstream news media are now being [challenged by technology giants](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-media-idUSKCN1TC2WV), and they need more financing to provide with higher quality investigations.
1.5.1.2. Pro: US mainstream media still follow the rules of the '[agenda-setting](https://www.communicationtheory.org/agenda-setting-theory/)'.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: The [news doesn't represent the "truth"](https://hbr.org/1995/05/why-the-news-is-not-the-truth) but just a chosen narrative for a specific fraction of reality.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: The 'agenda-setting' is an old concept that has been [challenged by social media](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316171954_The_impact_of_social_media_on_traditional_media_agenda_setting_theory_-_the_case_study_of_Occupy_Wall_Street_Movement_in_USA).
1.5.1.3. Con: [Selection bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias)(Selection bias is the bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect.) makes it impossible to cover what's "important" to everyone. What's important to some may not be important to others.
1.5.2. Con: To be well-informed in a society with [information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload) becomes very subjective.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Information overload has helped the [circulation of fake news](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/information-overload-helps-fake-news-spread-and-social-media-knows-it/)(We prefer information from people we trust, our in-group. We pay attention to and are more likely to share information about risks—for Andy, the risk of losing his job. We search for and remember things that fit well with what we already know and understand. These biases are products of our evolutionary past, and for tens of thousands of years, they served us well. People who behaved in accordance with them—for example, by staying away from the overgrown pond bank where someone said there was a viper—were more likely to survive than those who did not.).
1.5.2.2. Con: [News literacy skills](https://newslit.org/)(programs and resources for educators and the public to teach, learn and share the abilities needed to be smart, active consumers of news and information and equal and engaged participants in a democracy.) are becoming increasing available to people.
1.5.3. Con: From the media's perspective, the purpose is to generate revenue, like all profit firms. Most revenue is generated when acting on customers demand. The mentioned deviation could suggest a different customer demand than being well-informed. Maybe the customer \(subconsciously\) likes pessimistic news or easy-to-read news more. Acting on this, although potentially harmful for society, could be the logical thing to do from an organization's perspective. And does not have to indicate corruption.
1.6. Pro: There is evidence that the mainstream media is manipulating democratic processes.
1.6.1. Pro: The ideals of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy)(Deliberative democracy or discursive democracy is a form of democracy in which deliberation is central to decision-making. It adopts elements of both consensus decision-making and majority rule.) are being undermined by the mainstream media.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In a deliberative democracy, [each participant should have an equal voice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy) This ideal is harmed by the mainstream media.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: [Participants take their deliberation to be capable of determining actions and to be unconstrained by prior norms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy) This ideal is harmed by the mainstream media.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: In a deliberative democracy, the majority rule means that citizens choose the type of society they want, mainstream media included.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Democracies with a mainstream media that is not sufficiently aligned with the ideals of deliberative democracy are weakened or even falsely democratic.
1.6.1.3. Con: Thanks to mainstream media, deliberative democracy can be shared within the [public sphere](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092321?seq=1).
1.6.1.4. Con: The ideals of deliberative democracy are also being undermined by [social media](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337960606_Deliberative_Democracy_in_the_Age_of_Social_Media_Democracia_deliberativa_na_Era_das_Redes_Sociais).
1.6.2. Con: As long as there is [media plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_pluralism), democratic processes are more difficult to manipulate.
1.6.2.1. Con: Media plurality alone is insufficient as the electorate are not necessarily exposed to the available diversity of opinion.
1.6.2.2. Con: The democratic process can be manipulated by others means, including gerrymandering and insecure voting mechanisms.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Perception of media plurality is strongly associated with [satisfaction with democracy](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/docs/CIMA-Media-Perceptions-in-the-Americas_web_150ppi.pdf)(Perceptions of media pluralism and trust in the media are strongly linked to satisfaction with democracy.43 Citizens who perceive the media as accurately representative of different viewpoints or who have high trust in the media are far more likely to report being satisfied with the way democracy is functioning in their country.).
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Satisfaction with democracy is not necessarily indicative of a democratic process free from manipulation; people may be unaware of the many other ways in which their democratic process is manipulated. One cannot be unsatisfied about what one doesn't know.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: The existence of free media and "a plurality of voices in society and in the media" act as [safeguards for a healthy democracy](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/74281af8-d3dc-11e6-ad7c-01aa75ed71a1).
1.6.2.4. Con: There are [solid theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) showing that media plurality isn't as prevalent in society as it would be expected.
1.6.3. Con: Mainstream news media [participate in capitalism](https://countercurrents.org/2020/07/oligarchs-of-mainstream-mass-media-in-service-of-capitalism/), but that doesn't mean they are corrupt.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Mainstream news media have a [political economy](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/another-look-at-the-political-economy-of-the-mainstream-and-newmedia-the-capitalists-influence-2165-7912-1000341.pdf) that deals with the generation and distribution of resources that is affected by capitalism, because it classifies information by selling it and copyrighting it.
1.6.3.2. Con: [Crony capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism)(Crony capitalism is an economic system in which businesses thrive not as a result of free enterprise, but rather as a return on money amassed through collusion between a business class and the political class.) shows how mainstream media that participates in capitalism can become corrupt.
1.6.4. Pro: Their coverage of elections suggests they are trying to manipulate them, especially presidential elections.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Mainstream media has a strong influence in making potential voters believe that their vote will not be capable of determining actions.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Participants in the USA's democracy are forced to doubt that well informed, well intentioned votes will be cast by all other capable intelligent citizens of the democracy. They know that everyone with enough intelligence has this same doubt.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the case of the presidential elections, capable intelligent citizens must conclude that they must wait for another 60 million or so voters to stop voting for the 2 big candidates and instead chose a rational candidate. There is an infinitesimal chance of this happening.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Pro: It leads to a positive feedback loop of people believing \(knowing\) their fellows believe \(know\) they will lose.
1.6.4.1.1.3. Con: If some citizens see themselves as more intelligent than other citizens, [it could just be arrogance](https://www.becomeanindividual.com/arrogance/), which can make someone delusional about their own intelligence.
1.6.4.2. Con: Manipulating the presidential elections isn't corrupt if it is done for ideological reasons.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: The purpose of the media is to foster the exchange of information and perspectives - not to pick winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas based on their own biases.
1.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: Bias in and of its self is unavoidable because the human condition is defined by limited perspective, however the goal of journalism in general is to connect the world through shared understanding.
1.6.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: When some perspectives are excluded from the discourse or others are favored by accident of limited perspective on the part of the journalist, that's a forgivable mistake. But doing that intentionally when purporting ones self to be an objective source of information is journalistic malpractice.
1.6.4.2.1.1.2. Con: The task of connecting the world through a shared understanding is not the goal of journalism. Instead, journalism aims at giving "[people the information they need to make better decisions about their lives and society.](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/what-is-journalism/elements-journalism/)"
1.6.4.2.1.2. Con: The purpose of the media is not to foster the exchange of information, but to share information from a given perspective, ie. their [editorial line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_board).
1.6.4.2.2. Con: It would have to be proven that they are doing it for ideological reasons for them to regain trust. And proving that is nearly impossible.
1.6.4.2.3. Con: Any type of manipulation is against the [transparency that is needed in a democracy](http://Any type of manipulation is against the transparency that is needed in a democracy.).
1.6.4.2.4. Pro: There's a [political bias in media](https://theconversation.com/political-bias-in-media-doesnt-threaten-democracy-other-less-visible-biases-do-144844), but it is not corrupt because it doesn't threaten democracy.
1.6.4.3. Pro: In the 2020 presidential race Andrew Yang was [systematically ignored by some media outlets](https://vocal.media/theSwamp/a-visual-history-of-the-yang-media-blackout).
1.6.4.3.1. Con: Yang saw [little popular support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang_2020_presidential_campaign#2020) in polls. Thus, it was warranted for the media to focus on other candidates with better propects.
