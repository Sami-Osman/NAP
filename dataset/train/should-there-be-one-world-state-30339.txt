Discussion Name: Should there be One World State?

1. All nations should come together to form one world state.
1.1. Pro: The formation of a one world state would lead to immense economic and material benefits.
1.1.1. Pro: This would allow for the formation of a singular world currency.
1.1.1.1. Pro: There would be no [exchange rate risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp), which has several advantages.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Global investment will increase, because the barriers towards it [will be lessened](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/082515/how-avoid-exchange-rate-risk.asp).
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Profits and losses for investors and businesses will be [easier to predict](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp), leading to more stable and predictable investments.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: [Ownership and control restrictions](https://www.pc.gov.au/research/supporting/service-trade-foreign-direct-investment/servtrad.pdf) could still exist depending on the economic policies of the new state. \(p. 36\)
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Foreign exchange transaction costs will be [eliminated](https://www.gfmag.com/magazine/december-2007/cover-story-universal-currency-could-hold-key-to-stability-and-growth), leaving more money for investment.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Organizations like the [International Monetary Fund \(IMF\)](https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm), which employ [exploitative practices](https://dailybruin.com/2000/05/03/world-bank-imf-exploit-develop/), will no longer need to exist.
1.1.1.2. Pro: A single union or government using one currency would put an end to the relative currency [strength fluctuations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2011/12/01/what-determines-the-strength-of-a-currency/#24aefc316c6f) that happen as a result of each nations' economic policies, interest rates and stability, thus boosting the global economy.
1.1.1.3. Pro: This would prevent [currency wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_war) between countries, which inherently [undermine growth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/randybrown/2019/08/15/in-a-us-china-currency-war-who-wins/#29495c52751c).
1.1.1.4. Pro: Currency manipulation for personal gain - such as that allegedly done by [China](http://time.com/5644297/trump-china-yuan-currency-manipulation/) and [Japan](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2017/03/09/a-case-for-japan-as-asias-other-big-currency-manipulator/#40454d047545) - will decrease.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Currency manipulation can [benefit](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/exchangerate/effects-devaluation/) everyone. By devaluing its currency, a country can boost its exports while providing everyone else with cheap imports.
1.1.1.5. Con: A single currency means the same monetary policy would have to be adopted by the entire world, which would be extremely harmful because interest rates could not be tailored to the specific economic conditions of each region.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Universal interest rates would make it difficult to incentivize investment in areas that need it more.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: The adoption of the euro has been [extremely harmful](https://qz.com/1377098/why-the-euro-failed/) to poorer EU member states like Greece, since they cannot lower their interest rates during recessions.
1.1.1.6. Con: New forms of currency, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, could function as a [global currency](https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/03/06/lightning-dev-explains-why-bitcoin-is-poised-to-become-the-global-currency/) without having to be created by a one world state.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: People do not appear to be adopting Bitcoin at high enough rates for it to be considered a viable global currency.
1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The number of active Bitcoin users globally is estimated to be 5.8 million. In [comparison](https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/how-many-people-use-bitcoin/), PayPal has 235 million active users.
1.1.1.6.1.2. Con: [Data](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#is-bitcoin-really-used-by-people) suggests that Bitcoin adoption is on the [rise](https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/how-many-people-use-bitcoin/).
1.1.1.6.2. Pro: Like many technology stocks, digital currencies such as Bitcoin derive value from [network effects](https://www.prescouter.com/2018/11/will-bitcoin-be-the-worlds-single-currency-in-10-years/) created by large user bases, meaning that they need not be tied to a central government or regulatory body to function successfully.
1.1.1.6.3. Con: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin might be unable to function as a global currency because they are difficult to [regulate and control](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/042015/why-governments-are-afraid-bitcoin.asp).
1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: It is in the [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/042015/why-governments-are-afraid-bitcoin.asp) of the state to regulate and control currencies so that they track currency movement, collect taxes on it, and trace criminal activity. All of this control is likely to be lost if cryptocurrencies are used.
1.1.1.6.4. Con: The fact that a digital global currency may successfully function [independent](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/042015/why-governments-are-afraid-bitcoin.asp) of a central banking system could trigger the elimination of the latter, which would have many disadvantages.
1.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: The mandate of a central or global banking system is to maintain [price stability](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/role-european-central-bank) by setting key interest rates. The absence of interest rates will have a detrimental effect on [borrowing, lending and investments](https://thewest.com.au/business/your-money/what-happens-after-interest-rates-hit-zero-ng-b881225169z) around the world.
1.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: Central banks such as the European Central Bank \(ECB\) have [helped](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/role-european-central-bank) countries alleviate debt crises through steps such as [purchasing government bonds](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me-more/html/asset-purchase.en.html). In the absence of a central or global banking system under the one world state, economic crises are likely to be worsened.
1.1.2. Con: This will eliminate competition between states, which has several disadvantages.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Less competition between states would lead to less innovation.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Research shows that overseas competition spurs domestic industries to invest in [research and development](https://www.innovationexcellence.com/blog/2016/04/29/the-role-global-competition-plays-in-your-innovation-efforts/).
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Research has shown that innovation - particularly in developing countries - is not necessarily positively [correlated with competition](https://www.innovationexcellence.com/blog/2016/08/09/does-competition-drive-us-to-innovate/).
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Some of the greatest scientific and technological advancements in human history were the product of competition between countries. Without any competition, a global state may lack the motivation to invest in such projects.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Cooperation could potentially lead to technological gains to rival competition.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Competition can lead to excessive spending in areas such as advertising and espionage that would be otherwise far less unnecessary. In a context of collaboration and cooperation, this budget could be used solely and directly for technological advances.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 2013, the USA spent [$52.6bn](https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4672414/leaked-snowden-documents-reveal-details-of-surveillance-budget) on a “black budget” solely used to fund its intelligence-gathering operations and spy agencies.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Competition frequently leads to less useful but more visible forms of technological growth e.g. the space race. A cooperative framework for developing science is less likely to squander resources on these novelties and focus on human needs.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Countries have a clear incentive to attract scientists, who bring many economic benefits. This incentive causes countries to compete with each other to give scientists the most resources, resulting in a greater pool of resources for science.
1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The [Age of Exploration](https://www.thoughtco.com/age-of-exploration-1435006) was endorsed and funded as a way for countries to gain an advantage over their competitors.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: The Age of Exploration, as the [driver](https://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/age-of-exploration-bring-more-harm-than-good-americas-australia-columbus-captain-cook/) of centuries of intercontinental slave trade and the pillaging of resources by European colonisers, may be alternatively viewed as a reason not to encourage international competition.
1.1.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: Portugal funded the voyage of [Vasco da Gama](https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/vasco-da-gama) from Europe to India in the hopes of gaining control of the spice trade.
1.1.2.1.3.4. Pro: The moon landing was a result of the [space race](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race) - a competition between the US and the USSR to develop the most impressive space programmes.
1.1.2.1.3.5. Pro: State [militaries](https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/143526-how-military-tech-changed-our-lives) often invest in science and technology in order to gain an advantage over the militaries of other countries. These projects can have tangential benefits for the civilians and societies of those countries.
1.1.2.1.3.5.1. Pro: The development of the internet was [funded](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet) by the US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.
1.1.2.1.3.5.2. Pro: Drones were [created](https://theiotmagazine.com/evolution-of-drones-7216e7e5a9d2) through research and investment by the US and Israeli militaries.
1.1.2.1.3.6. Con: Competition would not cease just because all countries belonged to the same world state.
1.1.2.1.3.6.1. Pro: States within the U.S. or member countries within the EU still compete with one another.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2. Pro: Governmental initiatives can spur intranational competition by promising rewards for regions that score most highly on the formers' chosen metrics of progress.
1.1.2.1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The US' [Race to the Top](https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/race-to-the-top-education-competitive-grant-in-the-us/) initiative offered large grants to the states who most effectively improved their education systems. As a result, [46](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/education/k-12/race-to-the-top) states took part and planned comprehensive educational reforms.
1.1.2.1.3.6.3. Con: Ultimately, even competition created within nation states is often pushed with a wider view to achieving [international superiority](https://www.ed.gov/k-12reforms). Without this external driver, intranational competition is unlikely to continue in a global state.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Less competition implies less pressure to [lower prices](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/as-weve-been-saying-competition-really-does-lower-prices), increasing the possibility of exploiting consumers by hiking prices.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Less fierce competition would mean that states would no longer feel pressure to lift social and environmental standards or to lower taxes on companies simply because other states had done so. As a result, the global population would benefit from all-round higher standards.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Currently, many governments allow Multinational Companies \(MNCs\) to [exploit](https://www.epi.org/blog/true-cost-of-low-prices-is-exploited-workers/) their workers by paying them below minimum wage levels and exposing them to dangerous working conditions, as they depend on their business, and do not want these MNCs to relocate elsewhere.
1.1.2.3. Con: States do not compete with each other economically, since states do not produce or sell consumer products. Rather, companies compete with each other both within and across states, and will continue to compete with each other even if there is a one world state.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The economic policies of states - such as [corporate tax](https://www.dw.com/en/irelands-low-tax-rates-attract-big-corporations/av-43074208) or labor and environmental standards - can either attract or repel companies. By manipulating their economic policies, states compete with one another to attract businesses. This would no longer be possible if economic policy were centrally controlled.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: In a one world state, the competition between companies is likely to be fairer and less exploitative.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.6.
1.1.3. Pro: Currently, companies \(and wealthy individuals\) shift profits to lower taxing countries as a [tax avoidance strategy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324062993_The_Role_of_Tax_Havens_in_Tax_Avoidance_by_Multinationals) \(p.113\). Having a one world state and collecting taxes at a global level would render this strategy impossible.
1.1.4. Pro: [Economists estimate](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/08/06/open-borders-economy-workers) that the removal of borders could double the world's GDP.
1.1.4.1. Con: The removal of borders would greatly reduce [technical innovations](https://openborders.info/kill-goose-golden-eggs/) in developed countries. Since these nations have a disproportionately high influence on global GDP, any knock to their economies as a result of border removals would have a highly negative impact on the world's economy.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Total GDP and welfare are increased by [international segregation](https://openborders.info/blog/open-borders-and-the-economic-frontier-part-1/) by IQ and other traits that contribute to productivity, which is only possible in a world with borders and controlled immigration.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Although the removal of borders may provide a short term stimulus to global GDP, in the [long term](https://openborders.info/blog/open-borders-and-the-economic-frontier-part-1/), the slowing down of innovation leads to a massively reduced GDP and quality of life for future generations.
1.1.4.2. Con: The actual felt effect of doubled global GDP is likely to be far smaller than this figure would suggest.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: A sudden explosion of GDP would likely go hand in hand with a spike in [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/why-does-inflation-increase-gdp-growth.asp).
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Most of the people who would benefit from this doubling are the small minority who are currently already the world's wealthiest, as they already own the [majority](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/13/half-world-wealth-in-hands-population-inequality-report) of the assets, stocks, and shares that would be affected most significantly by this GDP increase.
1.1.4.3. Con: Global economic growth on this scale is usually coupled with unsustainable resource consumption and pollution, which would ultimately result in net economic cost for the world population.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: There was a [66%](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/145989/economics/environmental-impact-of-economic-growth/) rise in CO2 emissions per capita between 1960 and 2014, a period of strong global economic growth; this slowed in 2011-14, a period of low economic growth in many Western economies.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: Large-scale economic growth could facilitate rapid global transition to a [post-industrial economy](https://www.internetgeography.net/topics/the-uks-post-industrial-economy/), which could in turn generate more research and development into the environmental and biotechnology sectors.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Countries that are already considered as having achieved post-industrial status have arguably only done so by [exporting](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120515/infinite-economic-growth-finite-planet-possible.asp) much of their resource-intensive and environmentally damaging economic activity to poorer nations. This casts doubt on whether global post-industrialisation would be wholly possible for a one world state.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: A comprehensive 2006 report estimated that there was a cost to the global economy of [$85 per ton](https://www.climatecentral.org/news/climate-economists-stern-review-20827) of carbon dioxide emitted.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Military expenditure would decline, allowing other areas to flourish.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Military spending can have a highly positive effect on GDP.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Expenditure on the military in many developing countries has led to the building of [extensive infrastructure](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/154941468766463442/pdf/multi0page.pdf) to facilitate military movement \(p.3\), thereby vastly improving national transport networks.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Though the military has often, historically, been used as a pretext for infrastructural investment, it is [trade](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/anrep_e/wtr04_2b_e.pdf) \(p.114\) and not the military that truly drives such development.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Allowing the military's role in developing nations to continue in this way could lead to their governments' over-reliance on the military as a driver for such improvements, viewing its continued operation as a necessary condition on which vital national improvements are made.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Enhanced military spending improves national security and the [security of property rights](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016407049700044X), encouraging private investment and economic growth.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: In the context of a one world state, property rights and security would not be at risk from other states, so the redundant military protection of these would have a negligible effect on economic growth.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Expenditure on military training in a developing nation can contribute to [improving](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/154941468766463442/pdf/multi0page.pdf) the education and skillsets of its workforce \(pp. 2-3\).
1.1.4.4.1.3.1. Con: This military spending could be instead used to directly fund [all levels of state education](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b9b87f340f0b67896977bae/K4D_HDR_The_Contribution_of_Education_to_Economic_Growth_Final.pdf) and training, which could help improve GDP more widely and rapidly \(p.2\).
1.1.4.4.2. Con: The beneficial effects of military spending cuts for other sectors would likely have a [long lag](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/154941468766463442/pdf/multi0page.pdf), making them hard to separate from other variables that could influence economic growth \(p.3\).
1.1.4.4.3. Con: There may still be a need for global-scale military spending in a one world state context.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: The one world state might manufacture internal threats, such as terrorists or separatists, in a bid to justify a continued military budget.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: The state would still need to have a defence force to protect against non-state actors such as terrorist groups, insurgency cells, and potential dissidents from the state.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: Global defence spending is at [a record high](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/4-charts-that-show-the-state-of-global-military-spending-now-at-its-highest-since-the-cold-war/) right now.
1.1.4.4.4.1. Pro: In 2018, total global military spending rose to its [highest level since 1988](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/world-military-expenditure-grows-18-trillion-2018), the first year for which consistent global data is available.
1.1.4.4.5. Pro: There would be no need for [national defense budgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget), which form a large portion of [many governments' spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures), freeing up that money for other projects and investments by the singular state.
1.1.4.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.5.
1.1.4.4.5.2. Pro: For the fiscal year of [2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States), the US Department of Defense' budget was approximately $693 billion.
1.1.4.4.5.3. Pro: In [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China), the Chinese defense budget was $147 billion, increased by over 11% since 2014.
1.1.4.5. Pro: A literature summary by [Clemens](https://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/) estimates that free global labor mobility would increase gross world product \(GWP\), also called “world GDP”, by somewhere in the range of 67-147%.
1.1.4.6. Pro: According to experts, the supply of global labour would nearly [double](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/08/20/want-a-global-economic-boom-open-the-borders/?noredirect=on) with the removal of borders due to the incentives that this removal would create, which would in turn nearly double GDP.
1.1.4.7. Pro: The elimination of all trade barriers would facilitate absolutely free trade.
1.1.4.7.1. Pro: Free trade eliminates unfair practices such as [dumping](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dumping.asp) and [predatory pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/predatory-pricing.asp).
1.1.4.7.1.1. Pro: China's alleged dumping in the textile industry has cost [several foreigners their jobs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/free-market-dumping.asp), which will be an avoidable harm to [job security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_security) in a one world state.
1.1.4.7.1.2. Con: Large companies could still practice dumping and predatory pricing in an attempt to secure a monopoly over a particular market.
1.1.4.7.1.3. Pro: The dumping of steel in India [by several countries](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/six-countries-including-china-japan-and-russia-dump-steel-in-india-dgad/articleshow/51803024.cms?from=mdr) has caused India's domestic industry to suffer as competing has become more difficult.
1.1.4.7.2. Pro: Free trade is an inalienable human right.
1.1.4.7.2.1. Pro: People should be able to exchange the fruits of their labour in voluntary transactions without outside interference.
1.1.4.7.2.2. Con: Completely free trade often violates other human rights. Therefore, free trade is a conditional right, at best.
1.1.4.7.2.2.1. Pro: Free trade [disregards](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/03/14/whats-problem-free-trade) the rights of employees and the protection of the environment in its pursuit towards maximum efficiency.
1.1.4.7.3. Pro: Free trade leads to economic growth.
1.1.4.7.3.1. Pro: Free trade reduces [imported input costs](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/trade-and-immigration/benefits-free-trade-addressing-key-myths), reducing business production costs and consequently increasing growth rates.
1.1.4.7.3.2. Pro: Over time, free trade works with other [market processes](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/trade-and-immigration/benefits-free-trade-addressing-key-myths) in shifting workers and resources to more productive uses, allowing more efficient industries to thrive.
1.1.4.7.3.3. Pro: Free trade forces competition onto every industry, completely stripping them of the capacity to be complacent and driving them to be as efficient as possible.
1.1.4.7.4. Con: Developing countries often need to use [protectionism](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/162/27898.html) within some industries in order to develop them before opening them up to international markets. A global state with absolutely free trade would not allow this staggered development.
1.1.4.7.4.1. Con: A one world state could implement some form of protectionism on a regional/provincial level.
1.1.4.7.4.2. Con: With a world-state, there would be no "developing countries", only poorer areas of the same country, and poor areas of one country do not have cause to use protectionist policies to develop industries at the expense of richer areas; citizens can just move.
1.1.4.7.4.3. Pro: [Brazil](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44902104) developed many of its industries by pursuing strict protectionist policies and continues to do so today.
1.1.4.7.4.4. Pro: Free trade is a policy primarily pursued by wealthy nations in an attempt to keep emerging nations [uncompetitive.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44902104)
1.1.4.7.5. Pro: Free trade is good for consumers.
1.1.4.7.5.1. Con: Consumer needs should not be considered more important than those of producers, who are directly harmed by free trade.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1. Con: Consumers are more important actors than producers.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: The ultimate goal of all production is to create goods and services for consumers.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: If the rights of producers were to be respected over the rights of consumers, then we would never allow technological innovation \(because it creates unemployment\) and would never be able to enjoy the benefits of cheap goods \(as wages would be high.\)
1.1.4.7.5.1.1.2. Pro: All producers are also consumers, but all consumers are not producers.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Furthermore, free trade helps consumers [more](https://fee.org/articles/free-trade-isnt-killing-jobs/) than it harms producers.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1.3. Con: Even if this is true, it does not mean that a consumer's access to the luxury of cheap products should trump the violation of a producer's rights. Rights are more important than luxuries.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1.4. Con: We must protect and help our local producers. If we keep buying from across the world our local producers will fail.
1.1.4.7.5.2. Pro: [This would](https://bizfluent.com/list-7644042-disadvantages-trade-barriers.html) significantly reduce the prices of goods for consumers, and lower the cost of producing them for businesses.
1.1.4.7.5.2.1. Pro: Free trade allows for the [comparative advantages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp) of countries to be utilized to their fullest extent, massively increasing efficiency and reducing costs.
1.1.4.7.5.2.1.1. Pro: Different countries are better able to produce certain goods and services than others and have developed economies of scale surrounding them. Allowing them to be the major suppliers of said goods and services ensures that they are cheaper for everyone in the market.
1.1.4.7.5.2.1.2. Pro: Taking advantage of these comparative advantages is also important because it frees countries up to focus solely on the object of their expertise.
1.1.4.7.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: In the absence of free trade, a country with a highly developed electronics sector would have to make its own clothes. The time spent inefficiently making these clothes would take away from the time that could have been spent developing electronics, and further innovating in the field.
1.1.4.7.5.3. Pro: A unified global state would lead to a [wider](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-integration.asp) and more accessible selection of goods and services, increasing consumer choice as trade barriers are [removed](https://www.economicshelp.org/trade2/benefits_free_trade/).
1.1.4.7.6. Pro: Free trade would allow for better [employment opportunities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-integration.asp) due to market expansion, technology sharing, and cross-border investment flows.
1.1.4.7.6.1. Con: Free trade actually leads to the destruction of jobs.
1.1.4.7.6.1.1. Con: The only jobs lost as a consequence of free trade are inefficient ones that represent a downward pressure on economic growth.
1.1.4.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: Free trade privileges and benefits the most competitive and efficient industries.
1.1.4.7.7. Con: Free trade is exploitative.
1.1.4.7.7.1. Pro: Free trade exploits the poorest people in the system.
1.1.4.7.7.1.1. Pro: Free trade leads to situations in which poorer people and countries have no choice but to accept paltry wages and recompense for their labour.
1.1.4.7.7.1.1.1. Con: In the [absence](https://fee.org/articles/does-trade-exploit-the-poorest-of-the-poor/) of free trade and open borders, however, these people and countries would not even have access to this little sum of money.
1.1.4.7.7.1.1.2. Con: The poor may not see the low wages as a form of exploitation, but instead as an opportunity.
1.1.4.7.7.2. Pro: Free trade on an international scale leads to situations in which large multinational corporations are able to dominate markets at the expense of less wealthy local companies.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1. Con: There is no inherent value to the survival of small scale industries.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.1. Con: Small scale local industries provide jobs for people that would otherwise be lost as multinational corporations took over the market.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.2. Pro: Small businesses are often actively worse than large businesses.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.2.1. Pro: Small businesses usually do not offer the same opportunity for workers to form [massive unions](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/01/small-businesses-workers-wages) and express their power as a bloc.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.2.2. Pro: Small businesses pay [lower wages and offer fewer benefits](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/01/small-businesses-workers-wages) to workers.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: In 2016, around [20%](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/01/small-businesses-workers-wages) of firms with zero to nine employees offered health insurance, compared to 99.8% for firms with a thousand or more employees.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: In 2017, firms with five to nine employees paid an average weekly wage of [$849](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/01/small-businesses-workers-wages), compared to $1,793 for firms with a thousand or more employees.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.3. Pro: The only value that exists would be in a world with nations, where the destruction of local industry at the hands of a foreign competitor would directly affect the ability of a specific nation to raise money through taxes. This issue would not affect a one world state.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.4. Con: Small scale industries often represent the hard work of the local community in raising money, hiring employees, and generally putting their labour into an enterprise. Even if they do not provide a distinct economic value, their loss is culturally tragic.
1.1.4.7.7.2.1.4.1. Pro: Multinational corporations, in comparison, are distant, foreign, and do not relate to local communities in any meaningful way beyond offering employment.
1.1.4.7.7.2.2. Pro: After [NAFTA](https://ourfuture.org/20160313/whats-the-problem-with-free-trade), small Mexican farms were wiped out by larger and more efficient American-owned agricultural MNCs.
1.1.4.7.7.2.3. Con: [Economists argue](https://ourfuture.org/20160313/whats-the-problem-with-free-trade) that this process is good, because it lowers costs, which in turn allows the economy to apply its resources more efficiently and increases investment, giving the displaced workers new and better jobs.
1.1.4.7.7.2.3.1. Con: In reality, however, this situation creates [downward wage pressure](https://ourfuture.org/20160313/whats-the-problem-with-free-trade), which in turn reduces demand, consequently creating an unconducive atmosphere for investment.
1.1.4.7.7.3. Con: The argument that free trade involves taking advantage of inconsistent labour and environmental protection laws would not apply in a one world state.
1.1.4.7.7.3.1. Pro: A one world state could impose a uniform minimum wage and labor-protection laws.
1.1.4.7.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.2.2.1.
1.1.5. Con: Because incomes around the world are [highly unequal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita), the citizens of this state would demand massive redistribution, which would require extremely high rates of tax on the wealthiest and most productive people and companies. This would result in a slowdown in economic growth.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Attempts to reduce inequality through taxation and redistribution are inefficient and inevitably lead to resources being lost in the ['leaky bucket'](http://oecdinsights.org/2014/12/09/is-inequality-good-or-bad-for-growth/) of bureaucracy and administration.
1.1.5.2. Con: Studies show that, on average, even extreme redistributive fiscal policies do [not](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf) usually have net harmful effects on economic efficiency \(p.26\).
1.1.5.3. Con: Large-scale redistribution would speed up economic growth by giving poor people [access](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/can-redistributing-wealth-also-be-good-for-growth/) to resources that they can use for education, or to start businesses.
1.1.5.4. Con: Income inequality is rife in [America](https://www.thebalance.com/income-inequality-in-america-3306190), however they have very little, and [little demand](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/americans-reject-wealth-redistribution/404806/) for, significant redistribution of wealth.
1.1.6. Pro: The formation of this state would lead to incredible advancements in science and technology.
1.1.6.1. Pro: A one world state would have the ability to optimally allocate and coordinate all scientific and technological resources.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Centralized governments are often bureaucratic and inefficient, whereas markets are [often better](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/perfect-competition-topic/perfect-competition/a/efficiency-in-perfectly-competitive-markets-cnx) at allocating resources.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Currently, borders block many skilled workers in more niche sectors from moving to the places where they could best make use of their talents.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: Border blocking that prevents talented professionals from immigrating to wealthier or more developed countries may be of net benefit, if it incentivises them to create, develop and teach in their poorer home nations.
1.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: In a one world state, the fruits of technological development and science would be globally shared, so there would be no distinct value to this development in home nations.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: Similarly to how globalization has [fueled the pace](https://www.nap.edu/read/18816/chapter/3) of science and technology, a unified one world state will eliminate the restrictions to scientific development that borders have posed. \(p. 7\)
1.1.6.1.2.3. Con: Many scientists are facilitated by current governments because of the nature of their work and the importance of their contribution.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.2.
1.1.6.1.2.3.2. Pro: The [United Kingdom](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/08/uk-to-ease-visa-restrictions-on-top-scientists-post-brexit) is set to ease visa restrictions for top scientists post-Brexit to support their talent and attract the very best minds from around the world.
1.1.6.1.2.4. Pro: The [United States](https://issues.org/streamlining-the-visa-and-immigration-systems-for-scientists-and-engineers/) often inhibits and discourages talented scientific visitors, students, and potential immigrants from coming to and settling in the United States.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The world's total nominal Research and Development spending was approximately [one trillion dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending) in 2010. The combined control of a single world government over this budget will ensure that its results benefit the global population at large, rather than a select few groups.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Con: This number includes private-sector spending; the combined control of a one world state over this budget would only be possible under a global, centrally-planned economy, which would be bad.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3172228/) shows that problems associated with scientific and technological resource allocation and management can cause viruses to spread rapidly. Optimal allocation and coordination of these resources would allow quicker and more efficient tackling of such viruses.
1.1.6.2. Con: Most scientific and technological advancements are made by private businesses and universities, not by governments.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: According to the [OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-2015_sti_scoreboard-2015-en), about 60% of scientific funding is given by industry, with another 20% by universities.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: Universities are [often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university) government-funded, and a one world state would be better able to allocate funding to the right universities.
1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.
1.1.7. Con: A world without borders would result in severe economic harms.
1.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Individuals in the [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide) would be incentivised to carry out a mass migration to the Global North in hopes of a better life, negatively impacting the prosperity of developing regions in the Global South.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: This isn't necessarily an overall evil, as these individuals will be able to seek better lives for themselves.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: The needs of these people's communities matter more than what the individuals themselves want.
1.1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: These individuals usually represent the privileged top brass of these communities. Ethically speaking, the needs of the poor, who have no options, should come before the luxuries of the better off.
1.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: These people should not have their ambitions and dreams held hostage by the communities they came from.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: From 2000 to 2017, [half](https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/migration-myths-and-the-global-south/) of the total increase in international migration took place in developing countries of the Global South and half in developed countries of the Global North. This suggests that the current predominant discourse on international migration overemphasises the flow of migrants from the Global South to the Global North.
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: Mass migration will cause a massive [brain drain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brain_drain.asp) for the developing regions in the Global South, further crippling development in those regions.
1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: As developed regions in the Global North are likely to have [a limited number of jobs](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_627189/lang--en/index.htm), many skilled workers may choose to stay in or even immigrate to the Global South for employment.
1.1.7.2.3.2. Pro: Studies have shown that brain drain can significantly harm the countries that individuals emigrate from.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1. Con: [Research](https://www.cgdev.org/article/myth-brain-drain-how-emigration-can-help-poor-countries-harvard-political-review) has shown that brain drain actually has a positive effect on the country of origin.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Much research indicating possible positive effects of a brain drain does not necessarily vouch that it is net beneficial or that there are no negative effects, but rather that the negative effects can be [exaggerated](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20170321102746248).
1.1.7.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: Young people that immigrate to developed countries acquire education and experience, and then return home to add to the stock of human capital.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: In a [study](https://theconversation.com/when-migrants-go-home-they-bring-back-money-skills-and-ideas-that-can-change-a-country-118093) on migrants returning to Central America from the USA, it was found that the returning migrants were both highly common and invaluable for the local economy in their home country, using their US-acquired skills to promote economic development.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Many people only return to their home country because of the stipulations of [specific scholarships](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/the-impact-of-studying-abroad-and-of-being-made-to-return-home-again) - it is very possible that these scholarships would no longer force these conditions upon them in a world without nations.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: [A study](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/Cpapers/optimalmigrationduration.pdf) of Turkish migrants from Germany shows that about half of them started their own business following their return. \(pp. 352-353\)
1.1.7.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: Emigrants often send large flows of [remittances](https://ig.ft.com/remittances-capital-flow-emerging-markets/) back to their families in their home country.
1.1.7.2.3.2.2. Pro: [One study](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1143665#) showed that India lost as much as $2 billion a year on technical investment due to brain drain.
1.1.7.2.3.2.3. Pro: A [report](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7031) by the British Medical Journal notes that weak healthcare systems in sub-Saharan African countries are greatly threatened by the emigration of doctors to wealthier countries.
1.1.7.2.4. Pro: As of 2017, nearly 710 million adults around the world stated that they wanted to permanently migrate to another country, with the [majority](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/these-are-the-countries-migrants-want-to-move-to/) of their top desired destinations worldwide being countries in the Global North.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Small scale local industries could go out of business in a failed attempt to [compete](https://hbr.org/1999/03/competing-with-giants-survival-strategies-for-local-companies-in-emerging-markets) with big, large-scale industries, which would be able to expand their operations without any added cost.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: The only reason these smaller-scale industries can survive right now is because countries are able to pursue [protectionist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp) economic policies.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.7.2.1.
1.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.2. Pro: The formation of a one world state would solve [collective action problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem) more effectively.
1.2.1. Pro: Global pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak could arguably be mitigated or resolved much more efficiently in a one world state context.
1.2.1.1. Con: National and regional borders can be crucial in slowing the spread of infectious diseases that could otherwise develop into disastrous global pandemics.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Some studies indicate that [moderate delays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878213/) in geographic spread of infectious diseases may be possible with stringent restrictions on movement across borders.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: In the case of events such as these, the one world state could impose emergency restrictions on movement. Borders are not necessary.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: If borders were not already up and running when such an event struck, there would inevitably be a delay in the enforcing of emergency restrictions while the one world state was having to set up potentially hundreds or thousands of temporary border controls. This delay could be pivotal for the outcome of global infection spread.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: In some cases, borders that curtail movement between nations can actually impede efforts to reduce the spread of infection.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.4.
1.2.1.1.4. Con: [Research](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/92/12/14-135590/en/) has shown that travel bans, facilitated by border control, generally have little impact on slowing the spread of disease unless transmission is also on the decline within a community itself.
1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Border control was an important part of national responses to fighting the outbreak of [COVID-19](https://martenscentre.eu/news/what-are-effects-national-border-closures-containing-covid-19-infection).
1.2.1.2. Pro: Pandemic protocols [vary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52109792) widely from country to country, which makes the slowing or complete halt of transmission worldwide much less possible. These dangerous disparities could be avoided in a global state.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Nationalism often exacerbates problems and slows resolutions in the context of global pandemics. In a global state, this issue would be removed.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Efforts to develop and distribute vaccines are often [slowed](https://www.ft.com/content/6d542894-6483-446c-87b0-96c65e89bb2c) due to international tensions as different countries strive to serve their own citizens first.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: International skirmishes have begun over [protective equipment supplies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand) during the coronavirus pandemic, leading to many countries suffering worse shortages than others. In a global state, equitable distribution could be enforced.
1.2.1.3.3. Con: While actual nations would not exist, similar problems could be caused by a sense of provincial or regional loyalties.
1.2.2. Pro: Pollution and climate emissions create [negative externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) which states don't take into account when deciding how much to emit. This leads to all states polluting too much, which results in climate change and environmental degradation.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Many shared territories such as the oceans have been [carelessly overused and polluted](https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/oceans/problems/) because individual countries have refused to take [ownership](https://theconversation.com/whose-job-is-it-to-clear-up-all-the-rubbish-floating-in-the-oceans-25082) and treat them respectfully.
1.2.3. Con: Local and international institutions and can solve collective action problems through agreements like the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement). The creation of a one world state is not necessary.
1.2.3.1. Pro: There are numerous historical and contemporary examples of international, non-governmental support organised by local communities to successfully reduce collective action problems such as [famines](https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/meet-native-american-tribe-selflessly-sent-money-ireland-great-famine-170734) or the plight of vulnerable citizens during global [pandemics](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/173-years-170-why-irish-people-are-donating-help-native-n1200811).
1.2.3.2. Con: These agreements \(such as the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) and many UN resolutions\) are usually non binding, or unenforceable, which would presumably not be the case under a one world state.
1.2.4. Pro: Environmental regulations often [increase](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-going-green-corporation-3318.html) the cost of operation for companies. States are therefore often unwilling to implement such policies for fear of losing business to other countries that do not have such restrictions. This would not happen if these policies were universal.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The most environmentally friendly type of mining is [underground mining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878522015000818). However, this is more expensive than surface level or strip mining, both of which are significantly [worse](https://www.environment.co.za/mining/effects-of-mining.html) for the environment.
1.2.4.2. Pro: States and voters often [oppose](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2018/12/27/economists-love-carbon-taxes-voters-dont/#1688adce4338) carbon taxes for fear that they would significantly increase prices and drive employers away from the country.
1.2.4.3. Con: [Trade deals](https://www.ft.com/content/6d026308-9f0e-11e9-b8ce-8b459ed04726) often include agreements to standardise environmental regulations between countries. This decreases the number of states in which exploitative companies could operate freely, leaving them with fewer places to move to.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: While trade deals can be useful in dealing with the issue of standardizing environmental regulation, they are clearly a less far-reaching and effective solution than a one world state.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The [EU](https://www.ft.com/content/6d026308-9f0e-11e9-b8ce-8b459ed04726) has made commitment to environmental policies a core aspect of its recent trade deals with Vietnam and the [MERCOSUR](https://eu.boell.org/en/2020/02/06/eu-green-deal-trade-policy-and-environment) countries.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: The [Chinese](http://www.china-un.ch/eng/bjzl/t176940.htm) government has committed to protecting its domestic environment as well as the global environment, and advocates for stricter regulations in international deals.
1.2.5. Con: The lack of action on climate change can be attributed to [misinformation](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/news-corporation-climate-science-coverage-event.html) and climate change denial, which would still exist under a one world state.
1.3. Con: Forming a one world state is impractical.
1.3.1. Pro: The state would be too large to be meaningfully representative.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Extremely centralised global leadership would likely result in a [reduction](http://benefitof.net/benefits-of-decentralization/) of the wider public's participation and thus representation in decision-making, increasingly alienating them as their perceived influence over political matters lessened.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The existence of many governments allows policies to be tailored to the preferences of people in different areas. A one world state would impose the same set of policies on everyone in the world, even people who dislike those policies.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Universal policies are not a necessary by-product of a one world state. It is entirely possible for many powers to be devolved to regional/provincial assemblies.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: It would be impossible to have a global set of laws that every religious group found acceptable. Constructing and implementing global policies would therefore likely spark religious unrest and violence.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Many religions preach tolerance of others' differences, and take action to put this into practice.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: There is a growing worldwide Christian movement to promote [ecumenism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Ecumenism).
1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The World Council of Churches is a global fellowship of churches committed to increasing the [unity](https://www.oikoumene.org/en/about-us/self-understanding-vision/cuv/signs-of-growth-towards-christian-unity) of the different Christian denominations, of which almost every one is now involved in the movement.
1.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: For Hindus, cows are a [sacred symbol](https://intpolicydigest.org/2019/05/01/beef-down-implications-of-beef-ban-on-indian-communities/), and the consumption of its meat or slaughter of the animal is considered unacceptable. Thus, [cow vigilantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_vigilante_violence_in_India_since_2014) is likely to produce [violent outcomes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-20/cow-vigilantes-in-india-killed-at-least-44-people-report-finds), especially because the one world state is likely to allow its consumption and sacrifice as [other communities](https://beef2live.com/story-world-beef-consumption-per-capita-ranking-countries-0-111634) do not share the same ideological beliefs.
1.3.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Many countries differ in the provision of [holidays](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/religious-commemorations-around-world/) for religious festivals and events. Because the one world state would have to choose between the holidays it grants, due to practical reasons, this might cause disputes and protests.
1.3.1.1.1.2.4. Con: When religious communities live together, they learn to compromise with regards to religious objections. Hindus living in the United States choose not to consume beef, regardless of its availability and consumption by many groups around them.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: In some areas of the world, it is highly important for citizens to have their religious beliefs represented in the laws of their country. In such areas, the implementation of global policies at odds with their beliefs could therefore be met by severe public outcry.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Modi's government in India has been tightening legislation around the humane [treatment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/modi-s-drive-to-protect-india-s-sacred-cows-divides-voters) of cattle, as cows play an important [role](http://ayurveda-sedona.com/knowledge-center/spirituality/holy-cow/) in Hinduism.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Many religious groups, such as evangelical Christians in the US, desire [abortion bans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/13/donald-trump-evangelical-christians-republicans-abortion-supreme-court) to be included in federal legislation.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5.3. Pro: For [Muslims](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/islam-governing-under-sharia), it is very important that Shariah law dictates regulations that pertain to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and custody.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5.4. Con: Enshrining religious beliefs in law tends to result in the oppression of religious \(and other\) minorities, which causes conflict, so the removal of religious laws might actually reduce the incidence of conflict.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: The [Iranian theocracy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/03/irans-forgotten-ethnic-minorities/) persecutes ethnic minorities.
1.3.1.1.1.2.5.4.2. Pro: The recent dominance of Hindu nationalist parties in India has led to a [spike](https://time.com/5617161/india-religious-hate-crimes-modi/) in hate crimes against Muslims.
1.3.1.1.1.2.6. Con: The one world state could simply allow people to practice their religion freely.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: There are drastically [different](https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights) views on what constitutes a fundamental human right around the world. It would be impossible for a global state to combine all these beliefs into one set of policies.
1.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The vast majority of countries have similar views on what constitutes human rights.
1.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been signed by all [192 members](https://www.youthforhumanrights.org/what-are-human-rights/universal-declaration-of-human-rights/introduction.html) of the United Nations.
1.3.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: While some countries [recognise](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/619/abortion-laws-worldwide) a woman's right to bodily autonomy and termination of pregnancy, others recognise a [right to life](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/maltas-abortion-rights/593845/) of the unborn.
1.3.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Approximately [25%](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/619/abortion-laws-worldwide) of the world's population lives in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws.
1.3.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: A number of countries - including Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan - do not recognise or protect a right to [freedom of religion](https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/the-10-countries-in-2017-with-the-least-religion-freedom).
1.3.1.1.1.3.4. Pro: The right to free speech and freedom of [expression](https://rsf.org/en/ranking) is not protected in all countries.
1.3.1.2. Con: A one world state would make it much easier to implement grassroots [local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government), which are considered [more meaningfully representative](https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/25724/03chapter3.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y) than central governments in nation states \(p. 15\).
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Creating local governments and giving them control over policy would defeat the purpose of creating a world state, since it would create de facto separate states.
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.4. Con: Even if some representativeness is lost in the creation of this state, an imperfect democracy for all is preferable to the continued existence of autocratic, dictatorial states.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: In comparison to democracies, autocratic states generally have much higher rates of political [corruption](https://www.justsecurity.org/70568/what-fuels-autocracies-fuels-corruption/), economic [damage](https://qz.com/1688397/data-proves-it-authoritarian-leaders-are-bad-for-the-economy/), decline in population [health](https://www.cfr.org/article/autocracy-hazardous-your-health), and severe human rights violations. Shifting to a global democracy would thus have a pivotally positive impact on the citizens of currently autocratic states.
1.3.1.4.2. Con: Past and current evidence shows that rapidly-erected, imperfect democracies are vulnerable to the kind of corruption and antiliberal movements that often lead to autocratisation. Thus, there is no guarantee that an imperfect, global democracy would last.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Analysis](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2019/democracy-retreat) indicates, for example, that many of the national democracies rapidly set up in the wake of the Cold War have experienced a significant erosion of their state's democratic values in recent years.
1.3.1.4.3. Con: In 2018, there were only [slightly more](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) democracies in the world than there were autocracies. There is no guarantee that a new world state would be a wholly democratic one.
1.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: Some of the most powerful countries in the world, such as [China](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/china_politics/government/html/1.stm) and [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/vladimir-putin-russian-election-iran-zimbabwe), are either complete bureaucracies, autocracies, or do not possess strong democratic institutions. They would have no incentive to use their power to make this global state a fully democratic one.
1.3.1.4.3.2. Con: It would be very difficult for an autocrat to take control of a one world state, since power is much more widely dispersed between countries than it is within countries.
1.3.1.4.3.2.1. Con: A one world state would be one country, not several countries, so the dispersal of power between different countries would cease to be.
1.3.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: In a single country, an autocrat can take control simply by winning the loyalty of the military. By contrast, an autocrat looking to take control of the world government would have to win the support of the militaries in many different regions.
1.3.1.5. Con: There is no fundamental upper limit to the size of a democracy.
1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Democracies can continue to evolve new creative mechanisms to deal with the procedural problems they face as they grow in size.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: Proposals have been made to explain how even variants of [direct democracy](https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0101-31572016000200430) could be implemented in very large societies.
1.3.1.5.2. Con: It is possible that a country can have elections and democratic institutions \(and thus be a democracy\) and also be too large for that democracy to be meaningfully representative.
1.3.1.5.3. Pro: The size of current democracies range from populations of 10,000 in [Nauru](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/nauru), to over 1.3 billion people in [India](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/).
1.3.1.5.3.1. Con: The one world state would be over [five times](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) the size of the current largest democracy. Therefore, the feasibility of existing large democracies would not necessarily translate into the feasibility of the new democracy.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Meaningful representation should entail the preservation of all current identities around the world. A one world state may seek to homogenise only mainstream identities into a singular global identity, meaning it would not be meaningfully representative.
1.3.1.6.1. Pro: Minorities that existed within nation states may become even more underrepresented in this one world state.
1.3.1.6.1.1. Con: Conversely, minorities which have antagonistic relationships with their current nation states may find themselves better able to express themselves and use their freedoms under a one world state.
1.3.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: A one world state is unlikely to carry on the current Chinese government's policy of oppressing the [Uighur Muslim](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-repression-uighurs-xinjiang) community in Xinjiang.
1.3.1.6.1.1.2. Con: If the one world state inherits the political structures of pre-existing nation states, it is likely that some form of oppression and marginalization will continue, as these minorities are unlikely to occupy important positions.
1.3.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: These minorities may be able to take advantage of the one world state to ally with other disgruntled groups and form a unified political bloc.
1.3.1.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: This bloc could fight for the rights of different groups around the world, such as land rights for indigenous communities in the Americas.
1.3.1.6.1.2. Pro: Homogenisation towards a single global identity would [harm](https://www.iiu.edu.pk/wp-content/uploads/downloads/ird/GLOBALIZATION_AND_ITS_IMPACT_ON_INDIGENOUS_CULTURES.pdf) indigenous peoples.
1.3.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Already-endangered indigenous languages may become [extinct](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/04/Indigenous-Languages.pdf) as the new state will have an incentive to standardise communication by limiting it to a handful of languages.
1.3.1.6.2. Pro: Identities from the developed world are likely to form a greater part of a singular global identity than identities from the developing world, given the historic socio-economic disparity between the two.
1.3.1.6.2.1. Pro: Globalization has seen the [dominance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/12/africa-failed-by-westernisation-must-cast-off-its-subservience) of Western values, narratives, and cultures throughout the world. This will only be worsened in a one world state.
1.3.1.6.3. Con: [Globalisation](https://www.eurozine.com/national-identity-culture-and-globalisation/) is already moving the world towards a homogenised and mainstream cultural identity.
1.3.1.7. Pro: [James Madison](https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/713) theorized that as a republic grows larger in size, elites at the center would be able to control, divide and rule diverse groups throughout the state.
1.3.1.8. Pro: Around the world, there are a multitude of different educational curricula being offered. Agreeing upon a uniform standard might be difficult for the one world state, and so many people are likely to be denied the type of education they want.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: Increasingly, many countries around the world are offering their students the option of enrolling in standard curricula such as [International GCSEs](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-international-gcses-and-edexcel-certificates/about-international-gcses.html) and the [International Baccalaureate \(IB\)](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/). This will make it easier for the one world state to adopt a uniform educational curricula around the world.
1.3.1.8.2. Pro: India follows the [CBSE curriculum](http://superior-minds.com/indian-curriculum/) which has been designed and developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training. This curriculum has a strong focus on teaching Indian history and religion.
1.3.1.8.3. Con: There would be no need for a global state to adopt a uniform curriculum. If different parts of the world desired different curricula, they could simply adopt them.
1.3.1.8.3.1. Pro: Many countries already do not have uniform curricula across their nation.
1.3.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: The education system in the United States is [state-based](https://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2448/State-Educational-Systems.html), so individual states - and sometimes local school districts within states - have [differing](https://isss.umn.edu/publications/USEducation/2.pdf) educational programmes \(p.2\).
1.3.1.8.3.1.2. Pro: In Pakistan, [different provinces](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/367767-one-curriculum) offer their own educational curriculum, and many educational institutes and boards across the country have significantly differing [religious education](https://www.iiu.edu.pk/?page_id=13519) programmes.
1.3.1.8.3.1.2.1. Con: [Concern](https://www.iiu.edu.pk/?page_id=13519) has been raised in Pakistan as to whether differing educational streams should become more uniform so as to encourage greater social cohesion and tolerance.
1.3.1.8.3.2. Con: A lack of standardisation across the global state would make it difficult to objectively compare student skill levels across different regions, rendering the accurate identification of disparities or unmet educational needs extremely challenging.
1.3.1.8.3.3. Pro: Countries also offer religious educational curricula based on an individual's faith. It is likely that the global state may carry forward the same standard.
1.3.1.8.3.3.1. Pro: In [Iranian schools](https://www.nap.edu/read/10700/chapter/6#20), students take mandatory religion classes throughout primary and secondary school in any of the state recognized religions, depending on their professed belief and background.
1.3.1.8.3.3.2. Pro: [In Ireland](https://www.veritasbooksonline.com/brand/religious-education-curriculam-of-ireland/), Catholic schools provide religious education for students on a primary and secondary level.
1.3.2. Pro: The state would be too large to be governed effectively.
1.3.2.1. Con: The [Roman Empire](https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/world-history/10-long-lived-empires10.htm) existed for almost 1,500 years and encompassed a large and diverse population in an era where statecraft and bureaucracies had not evolved to develop their modern day capacities.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The Roman Empire was often [not](https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2018/08/11/the-low-point-of-the-third-century-roman-empire-and-reforms-of-gallienus/) governed effectively, and went through several radical [changes](https://www.ancienthistorylists.com/rome-history/worst-ancient-roman-emperors/), [civil wars](https://www.history.com/news/6-civil-wars-that-transformed-ancient-rome) and reformulations over its 1,500 years.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The prominent political scientist Leopold Kohr asserted that the primary cause of social misery - including war, crime, and political corruption - is an [excessive size](https://academyofideas.com/2017/08/breakdown-of-nations-leopold-kohr/) of the social unit.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: An excessively large state would make the creation of a highly centralised government almost inevitable, which would have negative social consequences.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Replacing many governments with one centralized government could make a [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) more likely, as there is only one government that may intervene and regulate supply and demand.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.2.2.1.4. Pro: Centralised governments are particularly prone to Kohr's [power theory of aggression](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/leopold-kohr-prophet-of-a-coming-decentralization/), whereby social brutality and cruelty worsen as leaders become - and perceive themselves to be - too powerful to be held accountable.
1.3.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: Human rights groups unanimously agree that North Korea leader Kim Jong-un's government, which is [highly centralised](https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea/Pages/democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea-north-korea-country-brief), has become one of the [most oppressive](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/north-korea-human-rights.html) and brutal in the world.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Kohr argues that if political units remain small in size, their capacity to do damage also remains [small](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/leopold-kohr-prophet-of-a-coming-decentralization/) because power is kept in check by similarly-sized external parties.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: There are many ways to keep a check on powerful actors to ensure that their interests do not end up dominating the interests of the powerless.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [free media](https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/10/532241/free-media-keeps-powerful-check) is a very useful tool for ensuring the accountability of powerful actors. In a one world state, media accountability is likely to be even more effective than the present.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: In a one world state, whistleblowers would have no other country to flee to, and would therefore be much more vulnerable to state retaliation. This would drastically reduce the accountability of the state.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The media are [influenced and manipulated](http://www.changecommunications.org/docs/dib/dibengunpan010194.pdf) by different interest groups in society, so they are unable to ensure effective accountability \(p. 3\).
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Media corporations are largely controlled or owned by [a relatively small group of powerful individuals](https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/95365_Chapter_4_Political_Influence_on_Media.pdf) whose interests usually align with those of other powerful actors \(p. 109\).
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: In a one world state, as all media outlets would be focusing on the actions of a singular state as opposed to their own nation states, there would be more scrutiny on the state's actions.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Media outlets would not have to spend as much on investigating facts related to the actions of a one world state as they would on multiple states. Therefore, more resources would be targeted towards [opinion journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_journalism), thereby increasing scrutiny.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: In a one world state, media outlets will have a competitive incentive to transform into international news organisations in order to survive, since they will be unable to create regional monopolies within the countries they were originally operating in.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Assuming the state would have an international judicial system, the judiciary could keep a [check](https://www.bccourts.ca/documents/Why_is_Judicial_Independence_Important_to_You.pdf) on powerful actors \(p.15\).
1.3.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Current international courts, such as the [International Criminal Court](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/apr/05/international-criminal-court-fit-purpose) and the [International Court of Justice](https://www.icj-cij.org/), have been heavily criticised for being ineffective.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: These courts are reliant on the consent of various sovereign states and therefore do not have powers of their own, limiting their effectiveness. This issue would not exist in the one world state.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The states in dispute before the ICJ have to agree to appear before it and be bound by its decisions. In [many cases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/13/law.features11), the states have simply refused to do so, ignoring the rulings of the ICJ.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: In a one world state, there would likely be institutional processes in place to reduce the external influence of powerful actors and interest groups.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Members of opposition political parties can keep a [check](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/unal-cevikoz/the-role-of-the-opposition-in-democratic-systems-115348) on powerful actors.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: Elected members of this state will have [a re-election incentive](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228978383_Do_Politicians_Respond_to_Reelection_Incentives_Evidence_from_Gubernatorial_Elections) to keep a check on powerful actors, interest groups, and themselves.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3.2.1. Con: This incentive clearly does not prevent interest groups from amassing considerable power in the status quo of national governments.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.3.
1.3.2.2.2.1.4. Con: Powerful actors could use their influence to rig the state's checks and balances in their favour.
1.3.2.2.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.1.3.1.
1.3.2.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: Powerful countries have used their power to rig the international organisations that currently exist to operate in their favour.
1.3.2.2.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: The [veto system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power) of the UN Security Council ensures that no UN action which undermines the interests of its most powerful countries \(China, USA, Russia, France, UK\) can ever take place.
1.3.2.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: Powerful actors derive their power from the [economic and political clouts](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-powerful-people-in-the-world-2015-11) that they have established, and these are unlikely to disappear even after the formation of a one world state.
1.3.2.2.2.1.4.4. Pro: In the US, the pharmaceutical lobby has successfully [made it illegal](https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/) for the government to bargain prices downward with pharmaceutical companies. Influential lobby groups could similarly convince the one world state to implement laws that privilege powerful interest groups.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Kohr states that excessive size of the social unit leads to aggressive Othering and [dehumanisation](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/leopold-kohr-prophet-of-a-coming-decentralization/) of some demographics by others, because in a state of such magnitude it is impossible for all to be known to all.
1.3.2.2.4. Con: Given that there has never been a state of this size with no external states, it is difficult to assess the veracity of Kohr's argument as applied to a one world state.
1.3.2.2.5. Con: A significant portion of Kohr's theory leans on examples of [expansionist empires](https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/review/leopold-kohr-prophet-of-a-coming-decentralization/) violently clashing, which would necessarily never happen in a one world state context.
1.3.2.2.5.1. Pro: Unlike national governments, a one world state would not face any external threats to its stability.
1.3.2.2.5.1.1. Con: Conversely, a one world state would consequently have to deal with many more internal threats than any national government.
1.3.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Internal threats to a state are much easier to combat, since they arise within the state's jurisdiction. Thus, these would be unlikely to pose as great a security risk to a one world state as external threats would.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The state would consist of different religions, ethnicities and [linguistic groups](https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/ethnicity/ethnic_5.htm). Governing them together is likely to be an extremely difficult, if not impossible, job.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: This phenomenon is not unique to a one world state: many existing states have [high](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-ethnically-diverse-countries-in-the-world.html) national ethno-cultural diversity.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: The [correlation](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145015363.pdf) between a state's successful governance and its societal culture is strong: countries with more heterogeneous societies tend to operate more successfully when their organisational culture reflects this heterogeneity \(p.3\). Thus, as long as a one world state's governing culture reflected the diversity of its population, it would likely overcome the challenges such diversity can pose.
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: The coexisting of contending ethno-linguistic identities [results](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/92e6/065361bb177d3c9d645cbb2683387d9559aa.pdf) in conflict and riots that become difficult to manage \(p. 63-64\).
1.3.2.3.4. Pro: Religious intolerance is on the rise.
1.3.2.3.4.1. Con: As there will be a large number of religions with millions or billions of [followers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) in this new state, it would be unlikely for one religion to completely dominate the others.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: There are [comparable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) numbers of Christians, Muslims, and atheists in the world.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: There are [about](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-religions-with-the-most_b_853000) 2.4 billion Christians as compared to 1.5 billion Muslims and about 1 billion atheists, indicating that their followers are not comparable in number.
1.3.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: If this state were to be a democracy, it would be unlikely that policies persecuting such a large portion of the population would have sufficient support to pass.
1.3.2.3.4.2. Pro: The rise in religious intolerance has led to an [increased](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2018-hate-crime-recording_en.pdf) number of hate crimes and hate incidents around the world.
1.3.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: Despite [increasing globalization](https://hbr.org/2019/02/the-state-of-globalization-in-2019-and-what-it-means-for-strategists) in the 21st century, religious violence has been [on the rise](https://psmag.com/news/religious-violence-is-on-the-rise-around-the-world) all over the world.
1.3.2.3.4.2.1.1. Con: What is often called "religious" violence can equally be explained through other [reasons](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-karen-armstrong-religious-violence-myth-secular): material, political, and economic. The role of religion in this violence is often exaggerated and overblown to disguise other motivations.
1.3.2.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: In 2018, [more than a quarter](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/how-should-faith-communities-halt-the-rise-in-religious-violence/) of the world's countries experienced a high incidence of hostilities motivated by religious hatred and mob violence related to religion.
1.3.2.3.4.2.1.3. Pro: One of the major contributors towards [decreased peace](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Peace-and-Religion-Report.pdf) over the years has been religious terrorism and extremism. \(p. 1\)
1.3.2.3.4.2.1.4. Pro: Violence against Christians in Africa is [on the rise](https://www.dw.com/en/violence-against-christians-on-the-rise-in-africa/a-49187879).
1.3.2.3.4.2.2. Pro: In the United States, hate crimes have risen by [9% in 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/30/us-hate-crime-rising-report), and have been on a consistent rise since 2015.
1.3.2.3.4.2.3. Pro: In the United Kingdom, [record numbers](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/how-to-tackle-islamophobia-the-best-strategies-from-around-europe/) of Islamophobic hate crimes were recorded in 2017.
1.3.2.3.4.2.3.1. Con: Muslims - as [24%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) of the global population - would make up a large minority of the population of this state. It is less likely that they would experience persecution in such a state than in one where they are a significant minority, such as the UK \([5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom) of the population\).
1.3.2.3.4.3. Con: Religious tolerance in Canada is [on the rise](https://www.catholicregister.org/features/featureseries/item/24887-canada-s-religious-tolerance-is-on-the-rise), according to a survey.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Different regions of the world have very different economic and demographic characteristics. As a result, the optimal economic and social policies vary from region to region.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: For instance, it could be the case that certain societies would have aging populations, and would need to create incentives for people to have children, while other societies might suffer from an overpopulation problem.
1.3.2.4.3. Pro: Some economies might require special protections to be able to develop and flourish, while others might require the flexibility and ease of access provided by a purely free market economy.
1.3.2.5. Con: Many extremely large states, like China or India, are governed fairly effectively. There is no reason to think that effective governance of [1.4 billion](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-population/) people is feasible, but the effective governance of [7.7 billion](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) people is impossible.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.
1.3.2.5.2. Con: Most national governments do not have to accommodate hugely diverse populations with conflicting political goals, while a one world state would have to do so.
1.3.3. Con: There are successful precedents for supranational bodies.
1.3.3.1. Con: Most existing international institutions, like the IMF, World Bank, and UN Security Council, are [dominated by wealthy Western countries](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/international-organizations-tools-powerful-countries/).
1.3.3.2. Pro: The European Union is an example of a supranational body that has been extremely [successful](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/03/6-things-the-eu-has-achieved-60-years-on-from-its-founding-treaty-7609e02c-01bb-4763-8cbf-716d2287a647/) since its inception.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Europe is much more [ethnically homogeneous](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/16/a-revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse-countries/?noredirect=on) than the rest of the world, so it would be much more difficult to unite the entire world politically than it would be to unite Europe.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Despite being ethnically homogenous, Europe has seen thousands of years of [conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe) between different countries and groups. The ability of the EU to unify such people suggests that this model could be extended to other areas of the world that have seen conflict and tension.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Historical disputes between certain countries based on factors such as culture will make uniting them an arduous task.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Con: While history may make this union harder, it will still be possible.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Countries are able to establish good relations even after having periods of intense warfare in the past.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Pakistan [separated from](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40961603) India based on factors such as culture and religious differences, and the two nations have constantly been [in conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts) ever since.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: According to the BBC World Service poll in 2017, [around 85%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Pakistan_sentiment) of Indians have a negative view of Pakistani influence.
1.3.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: [Ethnic tensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) between Azerbaijan and Armenia throughout their history will make them unlikely to want to unite with each other.
1.3.3.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: According to a [2012 opinion poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Armenian_sentiment_in_Azerbaijan), 91% of Azerbaijanis perceive Armenia as "the biggest enemy of Azerbaijan."
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: The EU has [been able to](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/what-the-eu-does-for-its-citizens_en) overcome ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences to create an organisation which represents the joint goals of its members without eroding their cultural identities.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: The European Union has been plagued with a multi-year [debt crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis) since 2009.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: Eurozone countries have faced [slow economic growth](https://www.thebalance.com/eurozone-debt-crisis-causes-cures-and-consequences-3305524) because they were forced to [cut back spending and increase taxation](https://hbr.org/2013/06/the-european-union-a-failed-ex) in order to prevent the debt crisis from turning into a global recession.
1.3.3.2.4. Pro: In [nominal terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union), the European Union is the second-largest economy in the world.
1.3.3.2.5. Pro: The EU is currently an extremely [powerful political force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_as_an_emerging_superpower) in the world.
1.3.3.3. Pro: The UN is a supranational organisation of [193 countries](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-in-the-un/) who come together to agree on political, social, and developmental [goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The countries of the UN have supported the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/universal-declaration-of-human-rights/), the [Declaration on the Rights of Minorities](https://www.equalrightstrust.org/content/united-nations-declaration-rights-minorities), and the [Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief](https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/explainer-the-united-nations-and-religious-liberty).
1.3.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.1.4.2.1.
1.3.3.4. Con: Most existing multilateral institutions have very little formal power, and cannot impose policies on unwilling countries. A one world state would have to do so.
1.3.4. Pro: Nation states that have come to [rely](https://psmag.com/economics/why-is-public-trust-in-federal-government-at-an-all-time-low) on their national governments for governance will have difficulty transitioning to a one world state.
1.3.4.1. Con: The world government could allow the nation states to retain whatever parts of their old government they rely on.
1.3.4.2. Con: There are many examples of countries [getting by](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42570823) without a government.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Northern Ireland [survived](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42570823) for 3 years without a functioning government after a power-sharing argument between the two governing parties led to its dissolution.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: The absence of political leadership [did not result](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42570823) in public services collapsing, allowing the majority of the country to continue day-to-day functioning normally.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Germany went without a new coalition government for [nearly 6 months](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43276732) following an inconclusive federal election in 2017.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Spain spent the first 10 months of 2016 without a formal government after two inconclusive elections. In spite of this, its economy [grew](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/spain-to-get-government-after-10-month-political-impasse-mariano-rajoy) by 0.7% during the 2nd quarter of 2016.
1.3.4.2.4. Con: Somalia had no government to speak of for a 15-year period in the 1990s and 2000s, during which time it was [ripped apart](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42570823) by clan militias, pirate gangs and Islamist extremists.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The majority of people in countries around the world who are [dependent](https://www.dailysignal.com/2012/02/08/dependence-on-government-at-all-time-high/) in some way on their current national governments may get hurt during this transition.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that the functions of national governments will be destroyed during this transition.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: It is far likelier that these functions will be absorbed and continued by the one world state.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Terrorist organisations may take this opportunity to [fill the temporary power vacuum created](http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/03/violence-power-vacuum-in-mideast-fertile-ground-for-terrorism/) during any transitioning with a state of their own.
1.4. Pro: The formation of a one world state would lead to an immediate reduction of conflict and violence.
1.4.1. Con: Factors that contribute significantly to conflict - such as [culture](https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/culture_conflict), race, and religion - will continue to exist in the same way.
1.4.1.1. Con: Trade barriers and sanctions are likely to decrease with one world state, increasing the [interconnectivity](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-the-golden-arches-theory-of-conflict-prevention/)(Friedman thinks it's because countries that are economically tethered have too much at stake to go to war. The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention has its critics and its fans, but the overarching premise is that globalization is a sure-fire step towards peace.) of the global economy. This may decrease violence.
1.4.1.2. Pro: [Religious violence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/world/australia/christchurch-sri-lanka-religion-violence.html) will continue to exist, as religion is unlikely to change even in a one world state.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Any state-sponsored religious violence is likely to decline or become non-existent.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: A great number of nations have been suspected of, or found to be, funding religious terrorism, including countries commonly viewed as vehemently anti-terrorist.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The US has been accused of [funding and arming](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/how-cia-created-osama-bin-laden) Afghan jihadists from 1979 to 1989 under the CIA's Operation Cyclone, which arguably contributed to the creation of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
1.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Saudi Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/05/wikileaks-cables-saudi-terrorist-funding), Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, [Turkey](https://archive.vn/20140912231632/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11093478/Turkish-government-co-operated-with-al-Qaeda-in-Syria-says-former-US-ambassador.html), [Sudan](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-sponsors-sudan), and [Pakistan](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5190244.stm) have all been said to fund al-Qaida, the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and/or other religious terrorist groups.
1.4.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Much of this terrorism was funded with the purpose of achieving [political goals](https://www.e-ir.info/2019/05/28/violent-non-state-actors-in-the-middle-east-origins-and-goals/) against other states. Given that these states will no longer exist, it is unlikely that these terrorist groups will continue to receive funding.
1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: Currently, [a small number of states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism_\(U.S._list\)) sponsor or harbor terrorists. A one world state would be able to arrest the terrorists currently residing in those states, since the state would not have to worry about the sovereignty of those states.
1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The list of '[state sponsors of terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism_\(U.S._list\))', the only widely-disseminated one of its kind, is maintained by the USA. For the one world state to arrest people based primarily on this list would be a blatant overexertion of power by the USA.
1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The US list has been [criticised](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2020.1738682?journalCode=uter20) for being [outdated](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2014/01/26/the-united-states-outdated-terror-list/), politicised, and analytically unclear.
1.4.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Many countries would consider prominent Western statesmen such as George W. Bush and Tony Blair to be the moral equivalent of the terrorists likely to be prosecuted by the one world state. Attempting to prosecute one such group of people, but not the other, would likely lead to tensions between different regions in the state.
1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: It is highly unlikely that the forces in the one world state pushing for the arrest of terrorist groups such as ISIS or the Taliban would similarly push for the arrest of Western war criminals.
1.4.1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Despite reports that George Bush's violent War on Terror in Iraq [increased](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/world/middleeast/24terror.html?auth=login-email&login=email) the threat of global terrorism, with Bush himself admitting that it was an [unwinnable](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2004/09/20/is-war-on-terror-an-immoral-quagmire/) war, Bush fuelled its continuation throughout his presidency. This led many to question and [criticise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_war_on_terror) his motives for such a war.
1.4.1.2.1.2.3. Con: It is often the case that the 'terrorists' described in these lists are actually rebel groups caught up in civil wars. In such a case, capturing terrorists would actually mean imprisoning freedom fighters who had been combating authoritarian regimes.
1.4.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: According to some, the Spanish government has long since wrongly labelled and treated the [ETA](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11183574), a Basque separatist group, as terrorists simply in order to further [marginalise](https://www.e-ir.info/2018/04/19/terrorists-or-freedom-fighters-a-case-study-of-eta/#_ftnref24) and silence the group, and uphold a veneer of its own governmental stability and control.
1.4.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: There is an ongoing international boycott of Qatar for its alleged funding of terrorist groups and figures. In spite of this, the 3-year crisis continues unresolved as Qatar refuses to ["surrender \[its\] sovereignty"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40173757).
1.4.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: The US has accused [Iran](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/iran-leading-state-sponsor-terror-180919182356527.html) of sponsoring terrorist groups and supporting conflicts in the Middle East, West Africa, and Europe.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Most religions are based in belief of the [supernatural](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iv-drip/why-are-supernatural-beliefs-so-important-to-religion-8450302.html). These beliefs will not be shaken by worldly changes.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.2.1.
1.4.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.2.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Despite the existence of a unified one world state, people's race - which is a [significant contributor to violence](https://theconversation.com/how-violence-and-racism-are-related-and-why-it-all-matters-65738) - will not change.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Many nations are currently built on relatively homogenous racial groups, making them susceptible to xenophobic and racist nationalism. Once a one world state is created, this nationalism will necessarily no longer exist.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Statistics show a significant disparity in violence against different races, which suggests that race influences violence.
1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: [In the US](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/23/health/gun-deaths-in-men-by-state-study/index.html), black men were more likely than white men to die by guns in homicides between 2008 to 2016.
1.4.1.4. Con: Similar to globalization's creation of a [homogeneous culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_homogenization), a one world state is likely to move towards a singular culture, which is likely to reduce violence and conflict.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: This homogeneous culture should already be resulting from globalization. The fact that it is [not](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/28/is-globalization-creating-a-single-world-culture/#5963ebcc3bd3) is evidence that this singular culture is unlikely to exist in any world.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Animosity between groups can often be rooted in past conflict. This is unlikely to simply be forgotten once they are incorporated into a single state.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Many nations have been able to come together again after polarizing and dividing civil wars.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: America successfully recovered from its [civil war](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts), which killed hundreds of thousands of people.
1.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: An [NGO](https://fambultok.org/) that started reconciliation work in Sierra Leone 6 years after its decade-long, brutal civil war ended found that efforts to restore social cohesion were [successful](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/787).
1.4.1.5.1.3. Con: While countries are very able to recover practically from civil war, the evidence suggests that lingering ethnic divisions and civil discord are [much harder](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/business/worldbusiness/20scene.html) to resolve.
1.4.1.5.1.4. Pro: A 2008 [study](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2245/papers1/aer2009.pdf) conducted in Liberia after its civil war showed that social cohesion could be successfully reinstated via community-driven reconstruction \(p.291\).
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: The [conflict](https://www.history.co.uk/history-of-the-northern-ireland-conflict) that existed between Catholics and Protestants in Ulster simply translated into conflict between Nationalists and Unionists after the [creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland) of the state of Northern Ireland.
1.4.2. Pro: The creation of a global police force would make it much easier to catch terrorists and violent criminals.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Academics have argued that the challenges of the modern world already require global policing, but that we do not have a truly global police force to meet them \([p. 8](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/45138_Bowling_and_Sheptycki.pdf)\). Establishing a global police force would therefore help us meet the needs of the era.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Criminal groups already [transcend borders](https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Organized-crime).
1.4.2.2. Con: The creation of a global police force may actually end up making policing less effective.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: People are less likely to trust and cooperate with an abstract and humongous global police force than they are with their national forces.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Police forces are usually strongly identified with the nation and their credibility boosted through national propaganda, which would not be possible with a global police force.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The public's approval of the police is often greatly influenced by people's perception of police and crime in their specific locality; a global police force would, logically, be less likely to be able to garner approval in this way than a smaller-scale, nationally-run police force.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Los Angeles survey results have indicated that police participation in community meetings, visibility in neighborhoods, and talking informally with members of the community [increased](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/197925.pdf) residents’ positive perception and approval of them \(p.4\).
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: If this is the case, then whether a local police force forms part of a national or global institution would surely make little difference to public perception.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2. Con: There are much more influential factors dictating public perception of the police force than its links to national identity.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Ethnicity has been found to have a pivotal role in public perception of the police.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A [2013 paper](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PIJPSM.18136daa.004/full/html) on racial and ethnic differences in police perception found that citizens stopped by minority officers are more likely to believe they are being wrongly stopped for illegitimate reasons than those being stopped by white officers.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: According to a 2014 McClatchy-Marist Poll, only [22%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2016/09/01/143357/the-intersection-of-policing-and-race/) of African Americans have a great deal of confidence in US law enforcement, compared to 50% of their white counterparts.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.3. Con: This would be likely to have a much lesser influence in more ethnically homogenous nations.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Since ethnicity is a [social construct](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/16/a-revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse-countries/), even citizens in what may appear to be an ethnically homogenous nation may perceive themselves as having a wide range of ethnicities, and could still therefore be influenced by ethnicity in relation to their police perception.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.4. Con: If ethnicity has a key role in public perception of the police, this would not necessarily mean that a global police force would fare better in terms of public perception than a national force would.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: If members of a global police force started to be deployed anywhere in the world irrespective of their nationality, local public perceptions of visibly or audibly 'foreign' police being swayed by ethnic, racial or cultural bias would likely be a more frequently-occurring phenomenon.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: This could easily be solved if the global police force chose not to randomly deploy officers, but instead had region-specific units who fit the cultural mores of the area.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: A [2009 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10439463.2010.540655?scroll=top&needAccess=true&journalCode=gpas20) found that consumption of crime-related media increased confidence in the US police among white respondents, but had no effect on Latinos or African-Americans. This suggests that ethnicity is so important a factor in police perception that it can even override other potentially influential variables.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.6. Con: One study found that, after adjusting for the amount of crime and disorder in a neighbourhood, ethnicity no longer meaningfully affected public perception of the police. This implies that ethnicity itself does not play an important role. \([p. 8](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/197925.pdf)\)
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: People's view of the police is most influenced by how they view the level of crime and disorder in their neighbourhoods \([p. ii](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/197925.pdf)\).
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Public perception of the police force is far more strongly linked to factors such as their performance.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.6.1.
1.4.2.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Public perception of the police is also influenced by how embedded the institution is in the community, or how many people have 'informal police contacts'. \([p. ii](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/197925.pdf)\)
1.4.2.2.1.1.3. Con: Police can be identified with a 'community' just as easily as they can with a nation, therefore invalidating the need for the latter.
1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: A global police force is not necessarily impersonal or abstract - it would still require local and regional policing in order to operate successfully.
1.4.2.2.1.3. Con: There are nations in which large demographic groups or peoples have a deeply problematic or irreconcilable relationship with their national or local police force. Overhauling this with a global network would allow such nations to start afresh and rebuild more positive civil-police relations.
1.4.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Policing in the USA began in colonial times with centralized municipal policing and slave patrols; both were renowned for their brutality and ties to white supremacist groups even after slavery was abolished. This [racist history](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2016/09/01/143357/the-intersection-of-policing-and-race/) is reflected in the comparatively poor perception of US police still held by ethnic minorities 200 years later.
1.4.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.2.1.2.
1.4.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: [Pakhtuns](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/613010-court-summons-dig-east-in-naqeeullah-murder-case) in Pakistan have a historically fraught relationship with the police, as they have often been unjustly killed in encounters with them.
1.4.2.2.1.3.3. Con: The globalization of the police force wouldn't necessarily lead to local level policing fundamentally changing in its racial/ethnic character.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: None of the harms of creating a global force could compare to the benefit of the absolute intelligence sharing which would result from it.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Information sharing](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/fight-against-terrorism/foreign-fighters/) can be crucial for stopping terrorist attacks and catching criminals. It will be much easier to pass information on to other regions when states no longer have to fear that it could be used against them in the future.
1.4.2.3. Con: The creation of a one world state would not necessarily lead to the creation of a global police force.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: In existing [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police_\(United_States\)) nation states such as the USA, individual states have their own separate police forces. It is possible for the one world state to similarly have different, disjointed police forces corresponding to different regions in the world.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Countries that currently take particular pride in their police force might not be willing to let these be subsumed into a global force that they perceive to be of inferior quality.
1.4.2.3.3. Con: From a logistical point of view it would make more sense to have a global police force, or at least larger regional police forces, than it would to have hundreds of disjointed forces operating across the world.
1.4.2.4. Pro: The creation of a global police could lead to more innovation and development in policing techniques.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: The experiences of police in one part of the world could be directly relevant to those in another, and their collaboration could lead to better policing decisions.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: Unlike in many other industries, where competition drives innovation, police forces are not in active competition with one another. Therefore, removing the element of competition and instead relying on cooperation is likely to produce the most innovation.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: In the same way, creating a global police would allow for the possibility of problematic policing techniques being all the more universalised and perpetuated.
1.4.2.4.3.1. Pro: Racist police brutality is a significant problem in the [US and Europe](https://www.euractiv.com/section/non-discrimination/news/beyond-the-us-police-brutality-structural-racism-are-a-problem-in-europe-too/). If the systemic protocols and training that facilitate such racism were brought into a global police force, this could lead to global proliferation of what is already a serious issue in the West.
1.4.2.4.4. Con: There is much [international variance](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-police-compare-different-democracies) in policing systems and techniques. Attempting to bring these together and decide upon one global system may result in irreconcilable clashes rather than innovation.
1.4.2.5. Con: If a global police force were corrupt, the impacts would be far worse than if a few national police forces were corrupt.
1.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.4.2.7. Con: International organisations, such as [Interpol](https://www.interpol.int/en), already work at a supranational scale in order to prevent crime.
1.4.2.7.1. Con: This does not mean that a one world state with unified policing resources would not be more effective.
1.4.2.7.1.1. Pro: Interpol is terribly funded, having had a budget of only [90 million USD](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/interpol-the-global-police-force-that-isnt/362086/) in 2012. In comparison, the USA alone spent [115 billion USD](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/police-and-corrections-expenditures) on policing in 2017.
1.4.2.7.1.1.1. Con: These numbers are misleading, as Interpol's function is not to act as a substitute for local police, but as a network which connects them and enhances their capacities.
1.4.2.7.2. Con: Interpol is not the equivalent of a global police force - it is merely meant to [facilitate international collaboration](https://www.interpol.int/en/Who-we-are/What-is-INTERPOL) between different police forces so that these can perform their duties more effectively.
1.4.2.7.2.1. Pro: Because of this limitation, Interpol is unable to help police forces in [non-member](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/02/10/2003348400) countries.
1.4.2.7.2.2. Pro: Interpol cannot conduct [investigations or make arrests](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/interpol-the-global-police-force-that-isnt/362086/). The organization just helps the local police know where to look for the suspects.
1.4.2.7.3. Pro: Interpol has been largely successful in its attempts to tackle global crime.
1.4.2.7.3.1. Pro: Interpol rescued over 50 child trafficking victims from the [Côte d’Ivoire](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2015/Traffickers-arrested-in-Cote-d-Ivoire-operation-targeting-child-trafficking-and-forced-labour) in 2015.
1.4.2.7.4. Con: Authoritarian states abuse Interpol's ['Red Notice'](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/interpol-the-global-police-force-that-isnt/362086/) system to pursue dissidents overseas.
1.4.2.7.5. Pro: Interpol has improved the [efficiency](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/interpol-international-policing-974516) of policing all over the world.
1.4.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.1.
1.4.3. Con: [Most](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1900/RR1904/RAND_RR1904.pdf) modern conflicts are intra-state conflicts; inter-state conflicts are very rare. Thus, moving to a one world state would not eliminate most conflicts.
1.4.3.1. Con: Many of the rebels involved in intra-state conflicts act as proxies for and receive funding from foreign powers.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The United States funds and backs the FSA and YPG in the [Syrian civil war](https://qz.com/625389/us-backed-rebel-groups-are-ready-to-turn-on-each-other-in-syria/).
1.4.3.2. Pro: International warfare is now relatively [insignificant](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/908361468779415791/310436360_20050007005532/additional/multi0page.pdf) in the context of all conflict, lasting an average of just 6 months. By contrast, in 2001, all but 1 of the world's wars were civil wars, with an average duration of 7 years.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Given this, the formation of a one world state would have a minimal effect on the reduction of political violence.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Civil wars may be fuelled by a desire for a separate state and land control, as with the [Sudan civil war](https://www.vox.com/world/2016/12/8/13817072/south-sudan-crisis-explained-ethnic-cleansing-genocide)(The 2005 agreement laid out a timetable for a referendum on whether Sudan should be split in two, with South Sudan becoming a separate country. That vote was held in January 2011 and passed overwhelmingly, with nearly 99 percent of South Sudanese voting in favor of independence. On July 9 of that year, the Republic of South Sudan formally came into existence.). Eliminating the [zero sum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-sumgame.asp) mentality of statehood may alleviate this.
1.4.3.3. Con: There is [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235082078_Conventional_Warfare_Still_Relevant) suggesting that conventional warfare between nations is likely and an increasing possibility in the coming years.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: [Increased tensions](https://www.cfr.org/report/military-confrontation-south-china-sea)(The risk of a military confrontation in the South China Sea involving the United States and China could rise significantly in the next eighteen months, particularly if their relationship continues to deteriorate as a result of ongoing trade frictions and recriminations over the novel coronavirus pandemic.) in the South China Sea may make squirmishes between international superpowers more likely.
1.4.3.4. Pro: According to a 1993 [report](https://www.unhcr.org/3eeedcf7a.pdf) by the UNHCR, almost all refugee-producing conflicts that took place earlier that year were internal, not external. \(p. 2\)
1.4.4. Pro: All conventional wars between countries would stop as they came together to form a one world state.
1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The threat of conflicts such as those anticipated in the wake of the US assassination of [Qasem Soleimani](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50979463) would no longer be relevant.
1.4.4.3. Pro: The looming [threat](https://www.cfr.org/blog/lingering-specter-nuclear-war) of a nuclear war will reduce.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Over the past few years, countries have [dramatically reduced](http://It is true that both Russia and the US have reduced their stockpiles of nuclear weapons dramatically, from highs of around 27,000 and 25,000 respectively. Today, the global grand total, counting weapons known to be held by the US, Russia, France, China, the UK, Israel, Pakistan, India and North Korea, is believed to be around 17,000, with 10,000 of those actually in ready stockpiles, and the rest slated for dismantlement) their stockpiles of nuclear weapons, which indicates that the threat of conflict involving nuclear weapons has already reduced.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: The concept of [Mutually Assured Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) \(MAD\) makes it unlikely, even though nuclear weapons exist, that they will ever be used again.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: Since their initial use in 1945, nuclear weapons have never been used offensively against another nation.
1.4.4.3.2.2. Con: MAD is reliant on different nuclear systems having roughly equal levels of sophistication. If one nation's nuclear technologies were to dramatically exceed another's, MAD would no longer hold true.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: [Currently](https://thediplomat.com/2013/07/why-countries-build-nuclear-weapons-in-the-21st-century/), states develop nuclear weapons and invest in nuclear technology so that they can be superior to other nations and have greater bargaining power.
1.4.4.3.3.1. Con: Different groups within this state would still have an interest in privately owning such weapons in order to ensure their interests are not overlooked or undermined by the one world state.
1.4.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Those nations that feel they received an unfair deal in the formation of the one world state are likely to become breeding grounds for discontented groups of this manner.
1.4.4.3.3.1.2. Con: While true, it is unlikely that the impetus to own weapons in the one world state will be comparable to the motivations that countries have in the status quo, and the net amount of weapons will still likely be reduced.
1.4.4.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: By the logic of the parent claim, provinces or states in existing federations would be motivated to possess weapons of their own to prevent the federal centres from exerting undue authority over them. This is obviously not the case.
1.4.4.3.3.1.3. Pro: [Terrorists or other non-state actors](http://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/understanding-nuclear-weapon-risks-en-676.pdf#page=85) would have an active interest in acquiring existing nuclear weapons and technology, or developing newer versions \(p. 85\).
1.4.4.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: [In the past](https://www.nti.org/gsn/article/al-qaeda-wants-nuclear-strike-on-us-obama-warns/), Al-Qaeda has shown an active desire to acquire nuclear weapons.
1.4.4.3.3.2. Pro: [Israel’s decision](https://thediplomat.com/2013/07/why-countries-build-nuclear-weapons-in-the-21st-century/) to acquire a nuclear weapon was the surest way to negate the inherent conventional imbalances \(population and military strength\) it had as compared to its Arab neighbors, and thereby ensure the Jewish state’s survival.
1.4.4.3.3.3. Pro: [Pakistan](http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Pakistan/PakOrigin.html) developed its nuclear weapons so that it would be able to stand against a nuclear armed neighbor, India.
1.4.5. Pro: A one world state would bring along a unique shared culture and sense of belonging. Individuals would feel more compassionate towards all human beings since they would be part of this larger group.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Some psychological theories suggest that bringing people from different groups together under egalitarian circumstances and with shared goals is a key strategy in [increasing empathy](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/07/how-to-increase-empathy-and-unite-society) and uniting society globally.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Studies have shown that unconscious prejudices exist at a basic level towards [outside groups](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090630173815.htm). In a global state, there would be no 'outside' nation, logically reducing the instances in which this phenomenon could be triggered.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.
1.4.5.3. Con: A large one world state would likely lead to increased multiculturalism, instead of one unified culture. This does not necessarily breed compassion.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: People would be unlikely to abandon their varied identities with regards to political ideology, religion, sexuality, and ethnicity, so the same [conditional tolerance](https://time.com/5392510/pluralism-religion-democracy-lgbt/) that many practise and experience in multicultural societies today would likely become all the more prolific.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: Homophobia, racism, sexism, and violence do not go away regardless of how diverse the population of a state is.
1.4.5.3.2.1. Pro: Despite being one of the [most diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level) countries in the world, the Democratic Republic of Congo is plagued with ethnic violence.
1.4.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: In DR Congo, nearly 900 people were killed in [ethnic clashes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46896159) in December 2018.
1.4.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: In June 2019, nearly 300,000 people were [forced to flee](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/06/1040711) due to inter-ethnic violence in north-east DR Congo.
1.4.5.3.2.2. Pro: [Studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1477370818775294) have found that ethnically diverse nations are not necessarily less likely to be violent than ethnically homogenous nations.
1.4.5.3.2.3. Con: Populations are likely to remain in their original locations for social, cultural, or familial reasons, and so the creation of a global state is unlikely to see a mass redistribution of ethnic populations. There will not be a significant increase in exposure between groups, and so no increase in violence is likely.
1.5. Pro: Given historical and present global inequalities, there is a strong moral imperative to create a one world state.
1.5.1. Con: Inequality is not always bad.
1.5.1.1. Con: There are strong links between inequality and many social ills.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: More unequal societies tend to be more [violent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15817728).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: [Teenage motherhood](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/teenage-births) - an established part of the inter-generational cycle of deprivation and social exclusion - is much more prevalent in more unequal, rich countries.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: A 2011 UK study showed a strong tendency for [illicit drug use](https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/15639/) to be more common in more unequal countries.
1.5.1.1.4. Pro: A 2007 report by the British Medical Journal found that countries with higher levels of income inequality scored much more poorly on most markers of [child wellbeing](https://www.bmj.com/content/335/7629/1080).
1.5.1.1.5. Con: In many cases, it is hard to know to what extent poverty, rather than inequality, causes or exacerbates social ills.
1.5.1.1.6. Pro: Studies show that the greater a country's income inequality, the [less happy](https://hbr.org/2016/01/income-inequality-makes-whole-countries-less-happy) its citizens are.
1.5.1.1.6.1. Con: Some studies suggest that the link between income inequality and personal happiness is more [complex](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02052/full) than this, proposing an inverted U-shaped trend rather than a straightforward negative relationship. Thus, greater income inequality may not always necessarily correlate with reduced happiness.
1.5.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: These researchers propose that when income inequality is moderately high, many individuals tend to be unhappily jealous of wealthier peers; however, when income inequality is higher still, many poorer citizens view this inequality as a [signal](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02052/full) of social mobility and thus anticipate their own upward mobility, which increases their happiness.
1.5.1.1.6.2. Con: [Recent data](https://www.nber.org/papers/w14282.pdf) on a broad array of countries has established a clear and consistently positive link between average levels of subjective well-being and GDP per capita irrespective of income inequality \(p.2\).
1.5.1.1.7. Con: Even if there are strong links between social ills and inequality, a one world state will not fix inequality.
1.5.1.1.7.1. Con: While true, the one world state is likely to at least remove national inequalities, which in themselves are a powerful form of privilege and dispossession.
1.5.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: For example, national inequalities cause different [passports](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php) to have different amounts of "power".
1.5.1.1.7.2. Pro: The one world state would likely be dominated by the interests of powerful actors.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: This state would likely be dominated by the interests of powerful Western actors.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.6.2.1.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.3. Con: Europe and North America contain [less than 20%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_world#Population_distribution) of the world's population. If the state were democratic, it would not be dominated by the West.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.3.1. Con: The dominance of the West has never been through numerical strength, but via other factors.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: The West has overwhelmingly [more soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power#Research) than other parts of the world.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Wealthy voters [typically](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/billionaire-stealth-politics-america-100-richest-what-they-want) [hold](https://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5624310/martin-gilens-testing-theories-of-american-politics-explained) disproportionate influence in most democracies. The same principle would hold for wealthy states or segments of the population under a one world state.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: If the rich are able to [dominate](https://medium.com/s/story/unraveling-the-global-web-of-corruption-thats-destroying-democracy-cd87f69ff6e2) the politics of individual countries in the status quo, then there is no additional harm from creating a global state.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.4. Con: China, the [second largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China) economy in the world, has economic and diplomatic power to rival that of the US or the EU.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.4.1. Con: China's [diplomatic soft power is weak](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/07/03/the-state-of-chinas-soft-power-in-2020/) - its culture has limited global appeal and it is frequently viewed as a dangerous hegemon.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.4.2. Pro: China's financial investment in media campaigns and tactics has given it a large amount of [soft power](https://intpolicydigest.org/2019/04/23/china-s-global-influence-is-expanding/) over the past few years.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.4.3. Pro: China's [Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2142266/belt-and-roads-aim-promote-chinese-interests-and) is increasing its political power and influence.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.5. Con: The domination of the interests of Western actors is likely to make the one world state more [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy).
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.5.1. Pro: [Same sex marriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage) and [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_Kingdom) will be legalized, which will reduce the suffering of many currently living under strictly religious or conservative governments.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.5.1.1. Con: It is possible that the legalization of these will vary across the world - similar to how same-sex marriages were legal in some states and illegal in others in the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States) until 2015.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.5.1.3. Pro: Same sex marriages are currently prohibited in Islamic countries such as [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Iran) and [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Pakistan), where people are killed or ousted for engaging in the same.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.6. Con: Ten countries in the [Middle East](https://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2010/07/why-so-much-oil-in-the-middle-east) contain 48% of world's known oil reserves and 38% of natural gas reserves, which means that Western domination is unlikely, as oil and gas are important political tools.
1.5.1.1.7.2.1.6.1. Con: In spite of this, the current world order is far more heavily influenced by Western countries than by the Middle East, implying that the mere distribution of natural resources does not grant overwhelming political power.
1.5.1.1.7.2.2. Pro: The state would be a fertile ground for domination by the global rich.
1.5.1.1.7.2.2.1. Pro: [Analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/oct/04/few-us-politicians-working-class) shows that the majority of powerful politicians are from very wealthy backgrounds, and are unlikely to promote working-class political candidates. In a unilateral global state system without the diverse range of political protocols and ideologies seen around the world today, this classist system would likely become more unshakeable.
1.5.1.1.7.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.2.1.3.1.2.
1.5.1.1.7.2.2.3. Con: The rich are able to [manipulate](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/27/how-big-money-corrupts-the-economy/) governments and economies through bribes and close ties with those at the top. In a one world state where organisations would grow in scale, it would become much harder to bribe those institutions or use nepotism to influence their decisions.
1.5.1.1.7.2.2.4. Con: It is likely that there will be rifts among rich individuals and lobbies from all around the world in their attempts to influence politics of a one world state. This would make elite capture difficult and more fractious.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3. Pro: This state is likely be dominated by the interests of the most powerful religion.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1. Pro: Christianity is the most powerful religion, and so would be likely able to influence the one world state far more than other faiths.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.1. Pro: Christianity holds far more wealth than other religions, which may mean that it is more easily able to dominate in a one world state context.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: A 2015 study found that [more than half](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/14/the-religion-of-millionaires-.html) of the world's millionaires identify as Christians.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: A report attributed [55%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/christians-hold-largest-percentage-of-global-wealth-report/articleshow/45886471.cms?from=mdr) of worldwide wealth to Christians.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.1.3. Con: According to a large 2014 study, American [Jews](https://money.com/religion-wealth-income-jewish-hindu-atheist-episcopalian/) are the most likely to live in a household with a total income of $100,000 or more.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.2. Con: Christianity has numerous [denominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination#/media/File:Major_Divisions_Within_Christianity.png), many of which have a history of [conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarian_violence_among_Christians) with each other. This lack of cohesion makes it unlikely that Christianity would be the most powerful religion in a one world state.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3. Pro: Christianity, which has about [2.4 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups) followers, is likely to influence the policies of the one world state.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.1. Con: The population of Muslims around the world is growing at a fast pace, and Islam is expected to be the largest religion in the world by [2070](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/01/islam-will-largest-religion-world-2070-says-report/). This indicates that there is a rise of other influential religions that will cut down the influence of Christianity over the policies of the one world state.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Islamophobia is significantly more [common](https://www.statista.com/statistics/737660/number-of-religious-hate-crimes-in-the-us-by-religion/) than Christophobia. Thus, even if the population of Muslims grows, this does not necessarily indicate that its influence will surpass that of Christianity.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: According to a 2014 [Pew Research Center survey](https://www.pewforum.org/2014/07/16/how-americans-feel-about-religious-groups/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+pewresearch%2Fall+\(PewResearch.org+%7C+All+Feeds\)), US citizens have colder, more negative views about Muslims than they have about any other religious group.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.1.2. Con: The two main factions of Islam, Sunni and Shia, have a [1400-year-old](https://www.history.com/news/sunni-shia-divide-islam-muslim) history of conflict that has become extremely [violent](https://www.cfr.org/interactives/sunni-shia-divide#!/sunni-shia-divide) in some areas of the world. This power struggle would likely weaken the influence that the religion as a whole could have over other religions, regardless of absolute numbers of followers.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: US-based [Pew Research Centre](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/01/islam-will-largest-religion-world-2070-says-report/) analysed demographic change among the world's major religions, and found that the world's population of Muslims will grow by 73 per cent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 per cent for Christians, while the overall population of the world will grow by 37 per cent over the same period.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.1.4. Pro: Muslims also have various [demographic factors](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/06/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/) \(female fertility rate, youngest median age, concentration in high population growth regions\) in their favor that continue to contribute to their fast growth.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.1.3.2. Con: This influence will be undermined by [religious switching](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/06/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/), which is expected to hinder the growth of Christians by an estimated 72 million followers between 2015 and 2060.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.
1.5.1.1.7.2.3.3. Con: As long as the state maintained a strict legal separation of church and state \(as [many states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state) do currently\), no religious group could substantially influence politics.
1.5.1.1.7.2.4. Con: All states are dominated by interest groups. This is not a problem unique to the one world state.
1.5.1.1.7.2.4.1. Con: This problem does not need to be unique to a one world state to serve as a rebuttal to the idea that the world state would fix global inequalities.
1.5.1.1.7.2.4.2. Pro: The USA is [known](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/americangovernment/chapter/interest-groups-defined/) for its interest group culture: the multi-layered federal structure of the US government allows for multiple points of access to law-makers by countless interest groups and their lobbyists, meaning these can have a large influence on national policy.
1.5.1.1.7.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.1.
1.5.1.1.7.2.6. Pro: The creation of a one world state could empower large international corporations by allowing them to ignore domestic regulations. This could lead to a concentration in power among a few companies, and a resulting increase in inequality.
1.5.1.1.7.2.6.1. Pro: National governments [already](https://www.oxfam.org/en/5-shocking-facts-about-extreme-global-inequality-and-how-even-it) frequently undertax large international corporations, leading to the underfunding of vital public services and disproportionately impacting the poorest. If the few domestic regulations in place to reduce this were removed with the advent of the one world state, it would likely become an even larger-scale issue.
1.5.1.1.7.3. Pro: The one world state would likely oppress those with marginalised identities.
1.5.1.1.7.3.1. Con: Unlike in individual countries, this state would have a number of large minority racial groups, with no one group constituting the overwhelming [majority](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/16/a-revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse-countries/) of the population. Such a state is less likely to be structurally racist, as power would be distributed amongst groups.
1.5.1.1.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.2.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3. Con: There has been a [global increase](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/13/good-news-gender-inquality-developing-world-education-maternity-women-hillary-clinton) in gender equality, suggesting that the world is changing in favour of accepting and uplifting previously marginalised and oppressed identities.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.1. Con: According to the World Economic Forum, women earn 63% of what men earn as a global average, with this pay gap narrowing so [slowly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/global-gender-pay-gap-will-take-202-years-to-close-says-world-economic-forum) that it will take a predicted 202 years to close.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.2. Con: Political leadership is still extremely [male-dominated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/global-gender-pay-gap-will-take-202-years-to-close-says-world-economic-forum) worldwide, with just 18% of ministerial and 24% of parliamentarian positions filled by women.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.2.1. Con: UN statistics suggest that there has been a slow [increase](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures) in female national parliamentarians since 1995.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.3. Pro: More women and young girls are being [offered](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/girlseducation#3) education.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.3.1. Con: Women and young girls face a number of social, religious and cultural barriers that prevent them from achieving education.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Despite being offered chances to avail education opportunities, an estimated [131 million](https://www.globalpartnership.org/focus-areas/girls-education) girls worldwide remain out of school and face multiple barriers to education.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: According to [UNESCO estimates](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/girlseducation), 15 million girls of primary-school age, half of them in sub-Saharan Africa, will never enter a classroom because of the challenges that they face.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.4. Pro: The number of girls forced into marriage is [decreasing](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/06/health/unicef-child-marriage/index.html).
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.4.1. Pro: Ten years ago, a South Asian girl's risk of getting married as a child was about 50%, but now that has [fallen to about 30%](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/06/health/unicef-child-marriage/index.html).
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.4.2. Con: In [sub-Saharan Africa](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/06/health/unicef-child-marriage/index.html), one in three recently married brides are minors, compared to one in five a decade ago. This indicates that the situation of child marriages is worsening in the region.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.4.3. Pro: [Globally](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/25-million-child-marriages-prevented-last-decade-due-accelerated-progress-according), the proportion of women who were married as children decreased by 15% in the last decade, from 1 in 4 to approximately 1 in 5.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.5. Pro: The number of girls who are forced to undergo female genital mutilation \(FGM\) has [seen](https://time.com/5447132/africa-female-genital-mutilation-decline-fgm/) a "huge and significant decline".
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.6. Con: The decrease in gender inequality around the world is primarily a phenomenon in developed countries. [Developing countries](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/charts-gender-inequality-women-deliver) are still struggling to achieve gender equality due to socio-political and religious reasons.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.6.1. Con: As long as the overall global view towards gender equality were improving, the contrasting aversion of leaders or sects of developing nations towards this would not have influence over the way a one world state governed with regards to gender equality.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.6.2. Pro: The absence of contraception and family planning in developing countries resulted in the deaths of [76,000 women](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/charts-gender-inequality-women-deliver) in 2017 from pregnancy-related causes.
1.5.1.1.7.3.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.3.3.4.2.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4. Pro: Such a state will want to represent the view of the majority of the people of the world, and as the world is becoming increasingly intolerant, the institutions that this state will govern will reflect this.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1. Con: The world is not becoming increasingly intolerant.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.1. Pro: Studies indicate that perceived increases in intolerance are likely to be an effect of [prevalence-induced concept change](https://quillette.com/2020/06/19/the-purity-paradox-how-tolerance-and-intolerance-increase-at-the-same-time/), and are not actually indicative of absolute increases.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.2. Con: According to independent experts reporting to the UN's Third Committee, racism and xenophobia are [increasing](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/gashc4182.doc.htm) globally.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.3. Con: Even if global intolerance is not consistently on the increase, the universal lack of drive to combat this systemically leaves the world highly susceptible to uncontrolled surges in intolerance over time.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: 15 years after the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the UN's team of independent experts overseeing implementation of the policies proposed still had [vacant](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/gashc4182.doc.htm) posts.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: The sudden increase in xenophobia worldwide following the COVID-19 outbreak was often [incited](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/12/covid-19-fueling-anti-asian-racism-and-xenophobia-worldwide) by national leaders.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.4. Pro: [Globalisation](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/globalization/) means that individuals work with people from all around the world on a day-to-day basis, which can help build relationships between people from different countries and cultures.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.5. Pro: [Mass migration](https://graylinegroup.com/urbanization-catalyst-overview/) to urban centres has helped to diversify populations, making them less homogenous and fostering [multiculturalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/multiculturalism).
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.6. Pro: Increasingly, the rights of cultural and ethnic minorities are being respected in the law of countries, while discriminatory laws are being replaced with [equality acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law).
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7. Pro: Many countries around the world have displayed a trend towards increased tolerance.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.1. Pro: Successive generations of British people are [increasingly tolerant](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1468796817723682).
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.1.1. Con: [In the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/homophobic-and-transphobic-hate-crimes-surge-in-england-and-wales), reports to the police regarding anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime have increased by 144% from 2013/14 to 2017/18.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.1.2. Con: Boris Johnson - known for his [racism, sexism, and homophobia](https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6) - was elected as the Prime Minister for the UK in [July 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/boris-johnson-elected-new-tory-leader-prime-minister).
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.2.3.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.2. Pro: The US is becoming [increasingly](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-08-27/america-s-getting-more-tolerant-and-haters-hate-it) tolerant.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.2.2.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.2.2. Con: Donald Trump, a man who has been extremely vocal about his [racist views](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/08/14/trump-and-racism-what-do-the-data-say/), was elected as the [45th President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) of the United States.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Despite winning the 2016 election, Trump did [not](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/nov/11/clinton-won-more-votes-trump-won-the-election-and-its-not-the-first-time) win the popular vote: a higher total number of Americans voted for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.3. Con: The number of far-right extremist hate groups in [Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/features/right-wing-extremist-groups-and-hate-crimes-are-growing-in-canada) increased by 30% from 2015 to 2019.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.4. Pro: A [large and growing](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/gay-marriage-around-the-world/) number of countries have legalized same-sex marriage.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.4.1. Con: The [vast majority](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-where-gay-marriage-is-legal/) of countries still don't allow same-sex marriages.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.2.1.5.1.3.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.4.2. Pro: According to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/30-countries-sex-marriage-officially-legal-56041136), 30 out of 195 countries have passed laws allowing gay marriages in 2019, and this trend is likely to [increase](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/same-sex-marriage-global-comparisons).
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2. Pro: Homophobia and homophobic hate crimes are on the rise around the world.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.1.1.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.2. Con: The rise in homophobic hate crime statistics are due to the [improvements](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/06/19/homophobia-is-not-on-the-rise/) made by the police in their identification and recording of hate-crime offences, and more people coming forward to report these crimes, rather than a genuine increase in the crimes in general.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.2.1. Con: If prior identification and recording of such crimes was inadequate, it is necessarily impossible to know for definite that these crimes have not increased in absolute number, too.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.2.2. Pro: In many countries, homosexuality was only [recently](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40459213) [legalised](https://www.oireachtas.ie/ga/debates/debate/seanad/2018-06-19/11/). Any attacks on members of the LGBTQ+ community prior to legalisation would not have been counted as a hate crime, given that it was a view point legally endorsed by the state.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.3. Con: The world is becoming [increasingly accepting](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/blog/charting-changing-attitudes-%E2%80%93-same-sex-relationships) of same-sex marriages.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: According to [NatCen’s British Social Attitudes survey](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/06/19/homophobia-is-not-on-the-rise/), a major long-term study of public opinion, 64 percent of respondents in 2017 said that same-sex relationships were ‘not wrong at all’, up from 59 percent in 2015, and 47 percent in 2012.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.4.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.3. Pro: The rise of [right-wing populists](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2018/11/02/460498/rise-far-right-populism-threatens-global-democracy-security/) that have historically used [bigoted rhetoric](https://www.history.com/topics/us-politics/populism-united-states-timeline) is reflective of how people and states are becoming more culturally, racially, and religiously intolerant.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.3.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.3.2. Con: Several right-wing populists have [under-performed](https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/26/populists-fall-short-of-expectations-in-the-european-elections) in recent European elections.
1.5.1.1.7.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: Eurosceptic and right-wing seats have only [increased by 2%](https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/26/populists-fall-short-of-expectations-in-the-european-elections) in the European Parliament over the past 5 years, despite the worsening of the migrant crisis, the Brexit phenomenon, and increase in terror attacks - all of which are major right wing talking points.

1.5.1.1.7.3.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.3.4.1.7.1.2.
1.5.1.2. Pro: It is poverty rather than inequality that is inherently bad.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: In a study released in 2014 by State of Working America, it was found that income inequality was the [largest poverty-increasing factor](https://www.epi.org/blog/inequality-main-persistent-poverty/) in the 3 decades leading up to the Great Recession.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: Poverty and inequality are [intrinsically linked](https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/3876.pdf) \(p.5\). Along with economic growth, they interact with one another through multiple sets of two-way links, meaning it is difficult to assess which has the greater negative influence.
1.5.1.2.2.1. Con: Since they are so closely interlinked, if either poverty or inequality is left unchecked, one will exacerbate the other and so both will contribute to social ills over time. Thus, inequality is likely always linked to social ills, regardless of whether poverty was the initial or more significant perceived trigger for these.
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: There is no clear moral problem with some people having more than others, so long as everyone has enough to live a full and satisfying life.
1.5.1.3. Pro: In [dependency theory](https://ncca.ie/media/2831/andre-gunder-frank.pdf), it is argued that wealth inequality between nations is precisely what has led, for better or worse, to the successful development of currently wealthy nations.
1.5.1.4. Con: The world's richest people and corporations hold a growing and extremely [disporportionate share](https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/) of global wealth. This is often at the expense of the world's poorest people.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: Many of these individuals have used their wealth and influence to benefit society as a whole.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: A [majority](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rainerzitelmann/2019/05/14/no-the-rich-didnt-get-rich-at-the-expense-of-the-poor/#1502702a38ca) of the world’s top ten richest people are self-made entrepreneurs who have given back to society with hardware and software inventions that are free to use, such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.
1.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: [39](https://www.forbes.com/top-givers/#d7d55eb66ffb) of America's 50 top financial donors of 2018 were on the Forbes 400 list at the time.
1.5.1.4.1.3. Pro: Bill Gates, currently the [2nd richest person in the the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-bill-gates-net-worth-spending-2018-8?r=US&IR=T), is investing $1.7bn in US public education, stating that [fixing systemic inequality](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/30/bill-gates-is-spending-1-point-7-billion-on-fixing-education-in-the-us.html) within this sphere is a "moral and economic imperative".
1.5.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Bill Gates has an estimated net worth of [102 billion USD](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaire-bill-gates-net-worth-spending-2018-8). Thus, the amount that he invests in such causes, though seemingly impressive, represents less than two percent of his total fortune.
1.5.1.4.1.4. Con: According to 2018 data compiled by a prominent economist, [18](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/how-much-do-billionaires-donate-to-charity) of the U.S.' 20 richest people gave away less, relative to their collective net worth, than the average American did the year before.
1.5.1.4.1.5. Con: The fact that a handful of billionaires spend small percentages of their money on altruistic purposes should not excuse the billionaire class at large for its exploitation of the poor.
1.5.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Amazon, whose founder is the [richest](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2019/03/04/this-is-the-richest-person-in-the-world/#2414488036db) person in the world, is routinely [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/14/amazon-fines-depot-workers-driver) of fostering zero hours contracts, unpaid overtime, sickness and holiday periods, and unfair penalties for its delivery drivers.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: A [2018 Oxfam report](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/billionaire-fortunes-grew-25-billion-day-last-year-poorest-saw-their-wealth-fall) showed that while the poorest half of humanity's wealth dropped by 11% that year, billionaires’ increased by 12%. Such a correlation may suggest a causative link.
1.5.1.4.3. Con: According to [supply-side economic theory](https://money.howstuffworks.com/trickle-down-economics3.htm), maintaining the wealth of the world's richest people incentivises them to continue making investments and running businesses, which improves the economy and thus benefits the less wealthy.
1.5.1.4.3.1. Con: Many [economists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/why-are-we-still-pretending-trickle-down-economics-work) have argued that supply side economics does not work.
1.5.1.4.3.2. Con: Supply side economics have frequently led to the poorest becoming poorer, as the benefits of the economy's growth accumulate [at the top](https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572).
1.5.1.4.4. Pro: Many large corporations maintain their wealth through exploiting the poorest of their workforce.
1.5.1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.1.5.1.
1.5.1.4.4.2. Pro: Many corporations exploit and underpay workers in [developing countries](https://glassclothing.com/western-countries-third-world-workers/) as a means of maximizing profits while minimizing costs.
1.5.1.4.4.3. Con: Equally, many others do not. [Google](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-Salaries-E9079.htm) is a very rich company, and pays its workers very high wages.
1.5.1.4.5. Pro: The world is anticipating its first [trillionaire](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-worlds-first-trillionaire-6410884/) by 2026.
1.5.1.5. Pro: Wealth inequality is a healthy and necessary [component](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/15/why-wealth-inequality-isnt-a-bad-thing-commentary.html) of a growing economy.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: In the film [Inequality for All](http://inequalityforall.com/), Bill Clinton's former labour secretary Robert Reich notes that wealth inequality in the US was at its highest levels in 1928 and 2007, one year before its [two biggest financial crises](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85).
1.5.1.5.2. Con: The IMF has reported that inequality can actually [undermine the sustainability](https://www.businessinsider.com/inequality-impact-economic-growth-2017-9) of economic growth.
1.5.1.5.2.1. Pro: If inequality rises too heavily, it can cause people to be unable or unwilling to invest in the [development of their skills](http://oecdinsights.org/2014/12/09/is-inequality-good-or-bad-for-growth/), leading in the long term to a less skilled labour force, which is injurious to growth.
1.5.1.5.2.2. Con: The mass levels of inequality identified by the IMF should not be considered typical of the sort of limited and healthy inequality which stimulates economic growth.
1.5.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: The relationship between inequality and growth is a ['U' shaped graph](https://www.nber.org/digest/aug99/w7038.html): inequality stimulates growth up to a certain point, beyond which it becomes limiting and harmful.
1.5.1.5.3. Pro: Inequality creates incentives for [entrepreneurship](http://oecdinsights.org/2014/12/09/is-inequality-good-or-bad-for-growth/).
1.5.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.5.1.5.5. Con: When coupled with wealth inequality, economic growth does not have as positive an impact.
1.5.1.5.5.1. Pro: A recent [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615596713) found that economic growth is associated with lower levels of happiness specifically in nations with higher income inequality.
1.5.1.5.6. Con: Inequality does not have to be a given for economic growth to occur.
1.5.1.5.6.1. Pro: [Analysis](https://www.citylab.com/life/2015/01/inequality-and-the-growth-of-cities/384571/) from the Martin Prosperity Institute has identified not a single trade-off between inequality and economic performance, but rather many distinct paths to economic growth that do not all involve high income inequality.
1.5.1.5.6.2. Pro: The [Nordic countries](https://theconversation.com/what-the-world-can-learn-about-equality-from-the-nordic-model-99797) are among the most equal in the world in terms of income distribution, yet all have a per capita GDP that is equal to or higher than many of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies.
1.5.1.5.7. Pro: An increasingly polarised labour market - and therefore increasing wealth inequality - is essential for successful technological development and thus economic growth in the modern world.
1.5.1.5.7.1. Pro: There has been a rapid increase in highly-skilled, highly-paid jobs in recent years to meet the demands of [skill-biased technical change](https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/violante/Books/sbtc_january16.pdf), and a [decrease](https://www.citylab.com/life/2012/02/where-find-blue-collar-job-2020/1255/) in mid-range blue-collar jobs. This leads to greater returns for the highly-skilled, highly-paid work that facilitates development and generates economic growth, while necessarily widening the wealth gap between high and low-skill job-holders.
1.5.1.5.7.2. Pro: Analysis shows that over the last 3 decades in the U.S., inequality has grown fastest in states with [more advanced, knowledge-based economies](https://www.citylab.com/life/2014/05/mapping-three-decades-income-inequality-state-state/9067/) such as California, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.2.
1.5.3. Pro: Given the magnitude of global inequality [caused by colonialism](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4868197_The_Colonial_Origins_of_Inequality_The_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Land_Distribution), it is moral to create a one world state - making future colonialism impossible.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The [Industrial Revolution](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/02/how-colonialism-shaped-modern-inequality.html), arguably the beginning of British dominance in the world, was only made possible because of the money made from the colonial territories of the British Empire.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Colonists often set up [extractive systems](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/02/how-colonialism-shaped-modern-inequality.html) in the colonies, causing them to steadily grow poorer over the period of their subjugation, ultimately causing them to emerge into independence much poorer than they would have been had they never been colonized.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: India's share of the global [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India_under_the_British_Raj) declined from 24.4% in 1700 to 4.2% in 1950.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: India's share of [global industrial output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India_under_the_British_Raj) declined from 25% in 1750 to 2% in 1900.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: Economists have estimated that a [third](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/02/how-colonialism-shaped-modern-inequality.html) of income inequality in the world today can be explained by the varying impact of European colonialism on the economic insitutions of the countries they colonised.
1.5.3.2.4. Con: Colonialism has also been credited for bringing development to the colonies and setting them up for modernity and industrialization.
1.5.3.2.4.1. Pro: The [railways](https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/analysis/entries/how-britians-colonial-railways-transformed-india/) created by the British in India have been argued to be economically transformative for the region's productivity and wealth.
1.5.3.2.4.1.1. Con: These railways were created to facilitate the transport of stolen [Indian resources](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/india-britain-empire-railways-myths-gifts) toward Britain.
1.5.3.2.4.2. Con: Development was usually not intentional, and merely an accidental side effect of the colonial enterprise.
1.5.3.3. Pro: In Latin American countries, modern inequality based on land ownership is directly linked to the colonial capture and distribution of land centuries ago \([p. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4868197_The_Colonial_Origins_of_Inequality_The_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Land_Distribution)\).
1.5.3.4. Con: It is impossible to conclusively link modern inequality to colonialism, as this would require the reduction of centuries of political, economic, and social events to a single causal link.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: The early [industrialization](https://users.wfu.edu/watts/w04_industr.html) of the Western world has been argued to be the reason for its massive transformation and early advent into modernity.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Colonialism frequently created internal inequality within the colonies through the colonisers' preferential treatment of certain ethnic/racial/religious groups that aided them, often referred to as colonial '[intermediaries](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/african-intermediaries-in-early-colonial-nigeria-brokering-colonial-rule-political-agents-in-northern-nigeria-18861914-by-afeadi-philip-saarbrucken-germany-vdm-verlag-2008-pp-184-45-paperback-isbn-9783639070941/77D00EB05FC0E54B1458AFB89CF57BAE)'.
1.5.3.6. Con: A one world state may increase the likelihood of [neo-colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism) - where previously wealthy nations could use capitalism, cultural imperialism and most importantly globalisation to exploit previously poorer nations.
1.5.3.6.1. Con: This is still preferable to the imperial colonialism of the past, as it is at least bound by the rules and laws of the one world state.
1.5.3.6.1.1. Pro: This form of colonialism would not share the same legacy of violence, bloodshed, and mass murder that its historical counterpart was notorious for.
1.5.3.6.2. Pro: Nation states are already able to treat certain regions within them in a manner similar to colonies.
1.5.3.6.2.1. Pro: Pakistan has been accused of treating the [Gilgit-Baltistan](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwi5h-rW_LjpAhWeA2MBHXu_AtAQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fworld%2Fpakistan%2Fpakistan-treats-gilgit-baltistan-like-colony-alleges-activist%2Farticleshow%2F64234733.cms&usg=AOvVaw0uUEQuYbhIuUN2UDUm2siX) region like a colony.
1.5.3.6.2.2. Pro: [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Puerto_Rico) has been argued to be functionally a colony of the United States.
1.5.3.6.2.3. Con: These are typically exceptional and controversial cases, and do not represent the norm.
1.5.3.6.3. Pro: As a one world state is likely to lead to reduced or non-existent trade barriers, it will become even easier for former colonial powers to exert economic influence over their former colonies.
1.5.3.6.3.1. Con: Meaningfully speaking, those former colonial powers would no longer exist as separate political entities from the former colonies. It does not make sense that they would even be capable of "aiming to exert" influence over what would now fundamentally be part of the same unit.
1.5.3.6.3.2. Pro: This economic influence is [incentivised](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/international-politics/top-6-reasons-of-emergence-of-neo-colonialism/48500) by the continuous need for former colonial powers to get raw materials and markets for selling their goods.
1.5.3.6.3.3. Pro: The economic incentive of former colonies to sell raw materials and purchase industrial goods from former colonial powers creates a cycle of dependence - [perpetuating](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/international-politics/top-6-reasons-of-emergence-of-neo-colonialism/48500) the economic influence.
1.5.3.6.3.4. Pro: Currently, former colonies use protectionism to [curb](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/08/28/the-causes-and-effects-of-economic-protectionism/) neo-colonialism. However, a one world state would make protectionism virtually impossible.
1.5.3.6.4. Pro: The monopoly of former colonizers over the means of communication and dissemination of information may further increase in a single global state as the need to standardise communication would increase. This may increase cultural imperialism.
1.5.3.7. Con: A world state would be a system of institutionalised colonialism, since it would allow voters in region A to impose their preferences on region B.
1.5.3.7.1. Pro: This would be particularly true for regions with sparser population densities, as their total vote share would be far less compared to heavily populated countries.
1.5.3.7.1.1. Con: This could be accounted for by having a system similar to the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) in the United States, to find a way to balance out the overwhelming power certain voting regions have.
1.5.3.7.2. Con: This is not exclusive to colonial politics: it applies to any system of voting in a federated, majoritarian democracy.
1.5.4. Pro: Given the geographically random [distribution](http://www.eschooltoday.com/natural-resources/distribution-of-natural-resources.html) of natural resources around the world and their [contribution](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-018-09161-z) to global inequality, it is only fair that a one world state be created to oversee these resources.
1.5.4.1. Con: The profits from natural resources could be reallocated to countries on a per capita basis. This way, each state would benefit a proportionate amount from the existence of natural resources without the need to dissolve national governments and states into a one world government.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: This allows for a solution to the problem of global inequality without sacrificing the unique cultural, political, and historical diversity of the world's myriad nation states.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: This demands supervision to ensure that such reallocation is carried out to improve equality. A global governing body would, therefore, be necessary for such projects to operate in the long run.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.3.
1.5.6. Pro: Most contemporary inequality is due to inequality [between countries](https://ourworldindata.org/global-inequality-of-opportunity). The creation of a one world state would massively decrease this inequality, since it would allow individuals from poor countries to more easily migrate to wealthier ones.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.6. Con: A one world state would lead to a world without borders, which would be harmful.
1.6.1. Con: It is possible to have a one world state that still has checkposts and similar constructs at certain territorial demarcations, even if formal borders do not exist.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.6.5. Pro: A world without borders will facilitate an increase in criminal activity.
1.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.6.5.2. Pro: If there were no borders, it would be much harder to track and catch criminals or suspects as they moved across them.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: It could still be possible to have some manner of security checks at regional boundaries, even if formal national borders no longer existed.
1.6.5.2.1.1. Pro: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to [checkpoints](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/covid-19-checkpoints-at-state-and-local-borders-bring-lawsuit-aclu-warning) being set up which can monitor and restrict inter-state travel within the USA. It would be possible for similar mechanisms to be set up in a one world state.
1.6.5.2.1.2. Con: In order for this to be effective, synchronised ways of operating checks, communicating and record-keeping across all areas of the world would have to be put in place. Achieving this on a global scale would be highly challenging.
1.6.5.2.1.2.1. Con: This is true for the current system of national borders, too. By contrast, however, a one world state's checking systems would have the additional advantage of information sharing not being disrupted by national rivalries, making it more effective than the alternative.
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Borders and border control have been integral to some of the most successful crime reduction programmes in the world.
1.6.5.2.2.1. Pro: Operation Del Rio is a border security operation along the Texas-Mexico border. After this initiative began, there was a [76% reduction](https://www.govtech.com/em/safety/Border-Security-Operation-Reduces.html) in major crime in Val Verde County, Texas, when compared to the same 30-day period the previous year.
1.6.5.2.3. Pro: The [UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2018/September/key-border-control-strategies-identified-at-unodcs-annual-law-enforcement-experts-meeting.html) identified border control as crucial to controlling smuggling, and drafted strategies on how to best perfect said controls.
1.6.5.2.4. Con: Without borders, police would be able to pursue suspects well past the boundaries which would previously have hindered them.
1.6.5.3. Pro: [Drug trafficking](https://www.unodc.org/easternafrica/en/illicit-drugs/drug-trafficking-patterns.html) would become much easier in the absence of border control.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Human trafficking would become much [easier](https://www.unodc.org/westandcentralafrica/en/newrosenwebsite/TOC/border-control.html) in the absence of border control.
1.6.5.5. Pro: Arms trade would most likely go [undetected](https://www.unodc.org/westandcentralafrica/en/newrosenwebsite/TOC/border-control.html) in the absence of border control.
1.6.5.6. Pro: Money laundering may go [undetected](https://www.unodc.org/westandcentralafrica/en/newrosenwebsite/TOC/border-control.html) in the absence of border control.
1.6.5.6.1. Con: A universal currency gets rid of currencies that do not have strong protective mechanisms in place \(such as holograms or scanning protections\). This makes money laundering overall harder.
1.6.5.6.2. Con: Money laundering can be avoided through the digitalization of currencies.
1.6.5.7. Con: Law enforcement agencies will exchange information and thus catch suspects more easily.
1.6.6. Pro: If national borders disappeared, there would likely be an immediate mass migration of people to wealthy and politically stable former nations. This would trigger a political crisis.
1.6.6.1. Pro: One of the major reasons that people migrate is to find better [job opportunities](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8x6wxs/revision/2), which are inherently better in wealthy nations.
1.6.6.2. Con: It is likely that there would only be one massive wave of migrations after the initial transition away from borders. Once a world without borders becomes the new normal, constant mass movement and the problems it causes will not be likely.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: If the world were led by one single government, it would follow that many of the reasons for which mass migration usually occurs - poverty, warfare, and other human rights violations - would be weakened or removed altogether.
1.6.6.2.2. Con: [Colonial mentality](https://medium.com/the-decolonization-of-fela-kuti-a-meditation-on/introduction-the-colonial-mentality-aaeef3c17fa1) is deeply ingrained in many citizens of formerly colonised countries; thus, it is unlikely that the 'West is better' rhetoric and the migration it idealises would dissipate quickly.
1.6.6.3. Con: If borders are preventing people from migrating to escape harmful conditions and seek better lives in the status quo, then the removal of these borders, even if it comes with certain harms, is a moral good.
1.6.6.3.1. Pro: Many people migrate to stable nations to escape the [persecution and war](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8x6wxs/revision/2) that have devastated their homelands.
1.6.6.3.2. Con: If mass migration ends up causing people already living in wealthy countries to suffer unnecessarily, then it is immoral, because it is hurting people who have no role to play in the migrants' suffering.
1.6.6.4. Con: Many people cannot afford to travel to other nations, or do not speak languages that would enable them to successfully migrate.
1.6.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.6.6.6. Pro: Large population influxes and exoduses make effective planning and the allocation of resources difficult.
1.6.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.6.6.2.
1.6.6.6.2. Pro: Cities that have seen rapid influxes of people have developed [slums](https://www.thoughtco.com/massive-urban-slums-1435765) as the existing city resources are unable to cater for the exploding population.
1.6.6.6.2.1. Pro: As climate change grows worse, there will be an increased number of [climate refugees](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20849369/julian-castro-climate-refugee). Without border control, it will be impossible to stop mass migration to particular regions or control where these displaced peoples end up.
1.6.6.6.2.2. Pro: The existence and development of slums around major cities in the world have resulted in problems such as [illness and diseases](https://borgenproject.org/6-negative-impacts-of-slums/) which spread like wildfire and are difficult to contain.
1.6.6.6.2.2.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279302733_How_urbanization_affects_the_epidemiology_of_emerging_infectious_diseases) show that the overcrowding and poor living conditions characteristic of urban slums are a primary factor in the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases and tropical parasitic diseases \(pp. 3-4\).
1.6.6.6.2.2.2. Pro: In [2015](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/12/conditions-liberias-urban-slums-helped-fuel-ebola-spread), poorer neighborhoods and slums in Liberia's capital were linked to a more intense and widespread transmission of the Ebola virus around the region.
1.6.6.6.2.2.3. Pro: In [Kenyan slums](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/28/kenya-slums-poor-sanitation-disease-exploitation), a lack of water and improper waste disposal proves to be a big threat to the lives of not just the slum dwellers, but also to the residents of other parts of the country, as it exposes them to the risk of water-borne diseases.
1.6.6.6.2.3. Pro: There are high rates of [criminal activity](https://www.refworld.org/docid/52a5a7354.html) and violence in slums. The density of people makes policing hard, and the level of violence makes it hard for services to reach people living in the slums.
1.6.6.7. Pro: An influx of refugees into Europe in the past decade has led to the [rapid rise of right-wing populism](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/insights/28008/the-popular-backlash-against-global-migration-is-making-the-problem-worse) in many European countries. The mass migration precipitated by a removal of national borders would be tens of times larger than the refugee crisis, and would therefore lead to even more severe political consequences.
1.6.6.7.1. Pro: The [AfD](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36130006), a far right wing party, has become increasingly popular in Germany due to its slogans against unchecked immigration.
1.6.6.7.2. Pro: [Vox](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36130006), a far right wing party, has become increasingly popular in Spain because of its anti-immigration stances.
1.6.6.7.3. Pro: Apart from Germany, no European country is currently in the world's [top 10 refugee hosting countries](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/global-refugee-crisis-statistics-and-facts/). Effects of the refugee crisis are therefore, in fact, relatively mild in Europe, despite the severe political backlash this has provoked. This suggests that a much larger wave of migration would lead to an exponential increase in xenophobic, right-wing nationalism, triggering political and social crisis.
1.6.6.7.4. Con: It is more probable that, in a world without borders, immigration to Europe would increase to such a degree that the political influence of immigrant communities would entirely drown out the political influence of right wing populists.
1.6.6.7.4.1. Pro: It would be unwise for politicians and public figures to preach far right exclusionary ideals when the demographics of their region are changing to dramatically hurt the success of such ideals.
1.6.6.7.4.1.1. Pro: Studies show that there is a considerably strong [negative correlation](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/02/what-makes-some-cities-vote-democratic/4598/) between the foreign-born percentage of residents in a given geographical area, and that area's vote share for right-wing, exclusionary political candidates. Thus, the more diverse a region, the less likely it is to vote for such politicians.
1.6.6.7.4.2. Con: If the far right did suffer a relative decrease in numbers in such a context, this could in fact galvanise it all the more, fuelling more radical and possibly violent actions to further the cause outside of the political arena.
1.6.6.7.4.2.1. Pro: The European far right has been growing steadily [more violent](http://www.esisc.org/publications/analyses/the-rise-of-the-right-wing-violent-extremism-threat-in-germany-and-its-transnational-character).
1.6.6.7.4.3. Con: Social media, news outlets, and the fake or sensationalised news they spread can be used effectively by such political parties, even if they are few in number relative to a region or nation's population. This can exert an effective, insidious political influence.
1.6.6.7.4.3.1. Pro: Studies have shown that the propagation of right-wing anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook can [predict](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fanning-the-Flames-of-Hate%3A-Social-Media-and-Hate-M%C3%BCller-Schwarz/9f485915c0e5860a61eb58c14e826375369536c9) anti-refugee hate crimes in municipalities with high social media usage.
1.6.6.7.4.4. Con: Existing research shows local cultural attitudes towards foreigners are enormously [persistent](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8c69/9d10f45c23ce56ddb6fe55ca5596e879eee5.pdf) \(p. 42\); it seems therefore unlikely that the increasing presence of immigrants would have much political influence.
1.6.6.7.5. Pro: White people in many wealthy countries are already afraid of being "[culturally replaced](https://www.gq.com/story/white-replacement-conspiracy-theory)" by immigrants from poor or non-Western countries. These fears would intensify and result in extreme backlash if national borders were removed.
1.6.6.8. Con: Any backlash or dissatisfaction among residents of wealthy countries would be politically harmless, since those residents are a [minority of the world population](http://www.oecd.org/sdd/01_Population_and_migration.pdf), and would therefore be unable to influence the one world state.
1.6.6.8.1. Pro: Under the status quo, backlash against immigration is harmful because it empowers right-wing nationalist parties in wealthy countries. However, nationalist parties would have virtually no power in a global system that transcended national politics.
1.6.6.8.1.1. Con: Nationalist parties in empires have often had little, if any, power in the political system of the empire subjugating that nationality; however, that [has not necessarily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_of_independence) made them powerless.
1.6.6.8.2. Con: The backlash could manifest itself in ways other than formal political action - for example, the backlash could spark an increase in hate crimes and violence against immigrants.
1.6.6.8.3. Con: A one world state openly not caring about the concerns of the nationalities it has subsumed would inherently be politically damaging; it would be betraying the trust placed in them when those subjugated nations joined, which harms the government's legitimacy.
1.6.6.9. Con: There is already a [mass migration](http://journey.caritas.org/?myth=people-poor-countries-migrate-rich-ones) of people from poorer countries to wealthier ones. The one world state is likely to equip itself to deal with this phenomenon.
1.6.6.9.1. Pro: The [UN Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees](https://www.unhcr.org/uk/protection/basic/3b66c2aa10/convention-protocol-relating-status-refugees.html) is the globally recognized standard for treatment of refugees. At present, its principal limitation is that only around [75%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees#Parties) of the world's countries have signed it; a one world state, having the authority to enforce worldwide implementation, would avoid this issue.
1.6.6.9.2. Con: The only way to deal with mass migrations is some form of border control. Unless the one world state imposes draconian laws on internal movement, it will not be able to deal with them.
1.6.6.9.3. Pro: In [2013](http://journey.caritas.org/?myth=people-poor-countries-migrate-rich-ones), 82 million migrants from the Global South migrated to developed countries.
1.7. Con: The possible failure of a one world state would have grave effects on people all over the world.
1.7.1. Pro: If the political union proved untenable and dissolved, it would likely do so violently, and this would necessarily lead to another world war with all the concomitant suffering and death.
1.7.1.1. Con: It is entirely possible and likely that the dissolution of said union could be peaceful.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: It is equally possible that the union could be ended through peaceful referenda or secessions, with different regions reverting to the countries that they had once been.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Czechoslovakia's breakup into two states in the '[Velvet Revolution](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/01/world/czechoslovakia-breaks-in-two-to-wide-regret.html)' was entirely peaceful.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: The breakups of most unions, countries, and empires are typically violent.
1.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: The breakup of [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia) led to a series of violent Yugoslav wars.
1.7.1.1.3.2. Pro: The breakdown of the Mughal Empire in India was a long and bloody affair that has since become known as "[The Anarchy](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-anarchy-9781408864371/)."
1.7.1.2. Con: The memory of past international conflicts makes it extremely unlikely that the world will go down such a path again.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: In spite of the world wars teaching the need for European solidarity, many European nations today are [Euro-sceptics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism) and inclined towards exiting the European Union.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Britain](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887) voted to leave the EU in 2016.
1.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: Pew found that Euroscepticism was growing within the [European parliament](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/22/euroskeptics-are-a-bigger-presence-in-the-european-parliament-than-in-past/) itself.
1.7.1.2.2. Pro: World War II is an integral part of and has permeated almost all of [modern American culture](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/world-war-ii-and-popular-culture), and, by virtue of globalization, the rest of the world.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: The memory of World War One was still fresh in Europe at the onset of World War Two, suggesting that memory of the horrors of war is only a weak factor protecting against future conflict.
1.7.1.3. Pro: The central government of a one world state could develop into a cosmopolitan elite who would likely be detached and indifferent to a surge in nationalism and separatism, thus allowing violence and suffering in lower social echelons.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: There is existing academic evidence which suggests that [elites](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/struggle-over-borders/why-are-elites-more-cosmopolitan-than-masses/1474BDC7856C75F8A691004F2F9F28C4) are more cosmopolitan than other groups in society.
1.7.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.7.2.2.1.
1.7.1.3.3. Pro: The destructive effects of violent warfare and political dissolution have, historically, been most acutely felt by the poor; in contrast, the rich and powerful usually have little to lose.
1.7.1.3.3.1. Pro: In the US Civil War, the wealthy could simply [pay](https://www.fords.org/blog/post/civil-war-150-a-rich-mans-war-and-a-poor-mans-fight/) a commutation fee or use financial bribery to avoid going to war.
1.7.1.3.3.2. Pro: The cosmopolitan rich became [even richer](https://www.historynet.com/the-profiteers-of-the-civil-war.htm) in the US Civil War by selling counterfeit goods to poor soldiers.
1.7.1.3.3.3. Con: Data on the American soldiers killed in the Vietnam War suggests that wealthier US communities had only [marginally lower](https://www.jstor.org/stable/171812?seq=1) casualty rates than the nation as a whole.
1.7.1.3.3.4. Con: Analysis implies that total war and political turmoil can significantly [impact](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/scheidel-great-leveler-inequality-violence/517164/) the wealth of the rich and powerful.
1.7.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: During and after the two World Wars, there was a period of [Great Compression](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/scheidel-great-leveler-inequality-violence/517164/) whereby government intervention took from upper-class wealth in order to provide resources to workers.
1.7.1.3.3.4.2. Con: If a rich and powerful elite led the one world state, any sanctions or new regulations introduced would likely be created in the best interests of the rich and powerful.
1.7.1.3.3.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.1.
1.7.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.3.4.
1.7.1.3.5. Pro: Historians have noted that the US cosmopolitan elite adopted even more decadent lifestyles in [response](https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/1930s-high-society/) to the Great Depression of the 1930s, despite this being allegedly caused and exacerbated by socioeconomic inequalities.
1.7.1.4. Pro: Nationalistic secession movements in a world state would likely form alliances against the global government, becoming a large-scale and dangerous source of conflict as opposed to a single, containable struggle for independence in one region.
1.7.1.4.1. Pro: Alliances between secessionist movements would be logical by virtue of the fact that they would have a shared \(and incredibly powerful\) adversary.
1.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: Without sharing their intelligence and resources, no individual secessionist movement would be likely to have a chance at success.
1.7.1.4.2. Con: Such alliances would not necessarily form: many of these secessionist movements would be based on different ideologies and beliefs, and would not share common ground with one another.
1.7.1.4.2.1. Con: Ideological opponents can and historically have allied with each other when politically necessary.
1.7.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The United States and the Soviet Union, in spite of their strongly opposed socioeconomic ideologies, [allied with each other](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Allied-Powers-international-alliance) in the fight against Nazi Germany.
1.7.2. Con: A one world state would be much less likely to fail than national governments.
1.7.2.1. Con: Regions and groups of people that are powerful under the status quo would be dissatisfied with a global system that causes them to lose much of their power, and would therefore be incentivized to try to break up the global state.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The US would lose much of its current power, since it comprises only [4%](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/) of the world's population. This would frustrate the American public and American political leaders, many of whom are [already suspicious](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/incredible-shrinking-us-multilateralism) of internationalism.
1.7.2.2. Pro: A one world state would have branches and offices all over the world. This means that a shock at one, or even several, locations would not significantly harm its ability to function. By contrast, national governments are often concentrated within one city and are therefore much more vulnerable.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: National governments typically have various branches and offices distributed throughout the nation; the centralisation of many government functions in a capital city happens despite this, and there is no particular reason to think a one world state would have no capital city any more than other nations of the past or present.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that a one world state would have a singular 'capital city' as this might indicate preference or bias in favour of certain peoples or regions, damaging the reputability of the state.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1. Con: There are many countries formed from the union of previously separate states, peoples or regions. Nonetheless, these countries all have capital cities.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The UK is composed of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Despite the possibility of indicating bias in favour of the English, the UK has a capital city in England.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The founders of the USA didn't want to indicate preference in favour of a particular state with their choice of capital, but rather than not having a capital city, they founded a [capital](https://www.britannica.com/place/Washington-DC/History#ref282698) on land ceded by the states to the federal government, which does not belong to any one state.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: [Switzerland](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-capital-of-switzerland.html) does not officially have a capital city, so as not to indicate preference in favour of any one of the Swiss cantons, but nevertheless has a de facto capital city in Bern.
1.7.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.5.2.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Given how large and powerful a one world state would be, it would be almost impossible for a single group of rebels or criminals to overthrow it.
1.7.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.
1.7.2.4.2. Con: A military coup by a unified global military could still easily topple the one world state.
1.7.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.5.1.
1.7.3. Con: At worst, the failure of the one world state would lead to a return to the status quo, just like the breakup of empires has led to the \(re\)formation of autonomous states.
1.7.3.1. Con: The breakup of empires has often led to a period of warfare and unrest before a return to the pre-empire state of affairs.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: [The fall of the Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire) involved a lot of conflict and civil unrest.
