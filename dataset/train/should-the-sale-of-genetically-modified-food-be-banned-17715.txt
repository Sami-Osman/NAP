Discussion Name: Should the sale of genetically modified food be banned?

1. The sale of genetically modified food should be banned.
1.1. Con: GMOs are more [cost effective](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/04/29/3-ways-gmos-keep-cost-of-food-down/#32e9a3201261) than unmodified foods, bringing many benefits.
1.1.1. Con: There are other effective methods to reduce the cost of food.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Increasing farming subsidies could reduce [the cost of food production](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/9009-study-finds-link-between-farm-subsidies-food-prices), reducing its final price.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The effect of such subsidies on food cost is [too small](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/do-farm-policies-make-foo_b_594030) for this to be used as a primary strategy in reducing food costs.
1.1.2. Con: [Monoculture cropping](https://www.propagate.org/research/2017/9/4/biosecurity-vulnerabilities-in-crop-monocultures), a common practice in selective GMO farming, entails the mass production of genetically identical crops. This leaves large yields of crop vulnerable to the same diseases and blights, carrying the risk of wiping out a massive amount all at once.
1.1.2.1. Con: [Monocultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture) can be genetically modified to be disease-resistant.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The American chestnut is vulnerable to [chestnut blight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_chestnut), which has radically reduced the species population. Genetic modification could help to protect this endangered species from disease.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The modified gene codes for the production of an enzyme that [detoxifies the blight](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2019/10/02/controversial-gmo-american-chestnut-could-provide-blueprint-for-saving-endangered-species/) - an adaptation not seen in any of the four billion American chestnut varieties.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Genetically modified American chestnuts are currently flourishing on a [research farm in Syracuse](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2019/10/02/controversial-gmo-american-chestnut-could-provide-blueprint-for-saving-endangered-species/), indicating that the revival of the species is proving successful.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: In 1992, the [papaya ringspot virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya_ringspot_virus) \(PRSV\) significantly reduced Hawaii's papaya yields. The introduction of a genetically modified virus-resistant version of the crop in 1998 [reversed](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/7#101) \(p. 101\) the decline in papaya yield caused by PRSV.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The [corn blight of 1970](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/labexercises/PlantBiotechnology/Pages/History.aspx) killed more than 15% of all corn crops in the USA, due to almost 85% of US corn fields being planted with one type of corn.
1.1.2.3. Con: Monoculture farming is [not exclusive to](https://gmoanswers.com/do-gmo-crops-foster-monoculture) or fuelled by GMO farming, but by commercial farming in general.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Monoculture cropping has been shown to generate sustainably increased crop yields and a lower cost output overall than other farming methods. This makes it common practice in [any agricultural system driven by profitability](https://blog.agrivi.com/post/is-simple-monoculture-better-for-crop-production).
1.1.3. Con: The foodstuffs gained from GM crops are primarily [unhealthy](https://www.momsintofitness.com/fast-food-and-gmos/), thus GM crops lower the cost of predominantly unhealthy foods. This may exacerbate the current health crisis among impoverished people, who already follow less nutritious diets due to the [lower cost](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11149644/Healthy-diet-costs-three-times-that-of-junk-food.html) of these relative to health foods.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Genetically modified crops have been linked to weight gain. Because the crops are [bred for higher yields](https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a20433466/gmo-foods-linked-to-weight-gain/), they are less nutrient-dense and require high levels of consumption to meet nutritional needs.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The above study involves rats. Obesity in humans is not primarily a [result](http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) of nutrient deficiency.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Nutrient deficiencies can lead to impaired glucose metabolism and subsequent insulin resistence, both of which are linked to obesity \([p. 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313629/pdf/ISRN.ENDOCRINOLOGY2012-103472.pdf)\).
1.1.3.2. Pro: Genetically modified corn is commonly used to produce foodstuffs such as [high-fructose corn syrup and corn starch](https://time.com/3840073/gmo-food-charts/). These are key ingredients in many unhealthy [processed](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/high-fructose-corn-syrup-questions-and-answers) foods and drinks.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Genetically modified [canola, cotton, and soy](https://time.com/3840073/gmo-food-charts/) are made into a large proportion of the cooking oils primarily used for frying by restaurant chains in the USA.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: [Studies](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-gm-soybean-oil-obesity-insulin.html) conducted on mice suggest that [genetically modified soybean oil](https://www.healthyoils.corteva.com/about/plenish.html) is healthier than conventional soybean oil since it contains fewer saturated fats and does not cause insulin resistance.
1.1.3.4. Con: [Genetically modified wholefoods](https://time.com/3840073/gmo-food-charts/) are also all highly common in the US, suggesting that GM crops also contribute to reducing the cost of some healthy produce.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: GM alfalfa in the US is mainly used as [hay for cattle](https://time.com/3840073/gmo-food-charts/), thus it may be seen to indirectly reduce the cost of red meat.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: [Over 93%](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/18092748/how-widespread-are-gm-foods) of corn and soy grown in the US is genetically modified in some way.
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: Almost all commercial papaya consumed in the US is grown from genetically modified [seed](https://www.thedailymeal.com/travel/8-most-genetically-modified-crops-slideshow/slide-5).
1.1.3.5. Pro: More than half of the US' [granulated sugar](https://time.com/3840073/gmo-food-charts/) production comes from genetically modified [sugar beets](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/business/worldbusiness/26iht-sugar.4.8485003.html).
1.1.3.6. Con: Crops can be nutritionally enhanced using biotechnology, granting the possibility of increasing an impoverished population's intake of vital nutrients at a lower or equal cost \([p. 3897](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346933/pdf/ijms-16-03895.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.1. Pro: Genetic modification of wheat can be used to produce versions of the crop with increased zinc and selenium content \([p. 3896](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346933/pdf/ijms-16-03895.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Selenium deficiency can cause [Keshan disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshan_disease) and [Kashin-back disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashin%E2%80%93Beck_disease).
1.1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Zinc deficiency places children at risk of illness and [infectious diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12730449) in low-income nations.
1.1.3.6.2. Pro: Genetic modifications to increase levels of β-carotene in several types of grain could help mitigate [vitamin A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346933/) deficiency, which presents a serious public health problem for [developing](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/vitamin_a_deficiency/WHO_NUT_95.3_summary_globalmap.pdf) countries in Africa and South-East Asia.
1.1.3.6.2.1. Pro: Cassava is a staple for a quarter of a billion Sub-Saharan Africans. The use of genetically modified cassava with high levels of β-carotene could greatly aid the fight against vitamin A deficiency within the region \([p. 3897-9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346933/pdf/ijms-16-03895.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.2.2. Con: There are many fruits and vegetables that provide [natural sources](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/#beta-carotene) of β-carotene.
1.1.3.6.2.2.1. Pro: The WHO has noted that for vulnerable rural families, for instance in Africa and South-East Asia, growing fruits and vegetables in [home gardens](https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en/) is one way of combatting vitamin A deficiency.
1.1.3.6.2.2.2. Con: An increase in the consumption of vitamin A rich foods would require social marketing, improved maintenance of carotene concentrations, and greater recognition of which foods are locally available and acceptable \([p. 106](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/72/2/106.full.pdf)\). This may not be feasible to achieve.
1.1.3.6.2.2.2.1. Con: At the end of a 3-year project in Thailand using [social marketing techniques](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Social-marketing-vitamin-A-rich-foods-in-Thailand%3A-Smitasiri-Attig/6c0ac6769c8d8dd8ecb4196e4635f26fec99a69d) to promote the consumption of vitamin A-rich foods across 134 villages, a substantial improvement was obtained in the vitamin A and nutritional status of the target population.
1.1.3.6.2.2.3. Con: In spite of this, vitamin A deficiency [remains a large problem](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why1_vad.php), indicating that there are large barriers to ensuring sufficient natural intake.
1.1.3.6.2.3. Con: There are alternative ways of providing supplementary vitamin A where this cannot be obtained in the diet.
1.1.3.6.2.3.1. Pro: Taking vitamin A supplements has been found to decrease mortality by an average of 23% among children aged 6 months to 7 years of age \([p. 106](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/72/2/106.full.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.2.4. Con: [Vitamin A](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/vitamin-a-and-your-bones) is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning the body can store enough vitamin A to last for months. As a result, the risk of consuming excess vitamin A is arguably larger than the risk of deficiency.
1.1.3.6.2.4.1. Pro: In developed nations, toxic or excess levels of vitamin A are [more of a concern](https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/nutrition-food-safety-health/fat-soluble-vitamins-a-d-e-and-k-9-315/) than deficiencies.
1.1.3.6.2.5. Pro: [Golden Rice](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content3-Why/why1_vad.php) is a GM crop designed specifically for consumers in the developing world as a [source of vitamin A](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4386933.stm). Since rice already forms a [central part](http://ricepedia.org/rice-as-food/the-global-staple-rice-consumers) of the diet of millions of impoverished people around the world, uptake is likely to be successful.
1.1.3.6.2.6. Pro: Vitamin A deficiency can lead to increased incidences of visual impairment, as well as a weakened immune system \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/pdf/nihms-291217.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.2.6.1. Pro: Vitamin A deficiency is the [leading](https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en/) cause of childhood blindness in [developing countries](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/vitamin_a_deficiency/WHO_NUT_95.3/en/).
1.1.3.6.2.6.2. Pro: [Vitamin A deficiency](http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en/) causes around [670,000 children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A_deficiency#cite_ref-11) under the age of 5 to die per year.
1.1.3.6.3. Con: Studies suggest that biofortification of crops may be achieved just as successfully through application of [fortified fertilisers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-017-3295-9).
1.1.3.6.3.1. Con: The generation of micronutrient-dense biofortified crops through genetic modification is [more cost-effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346933/) \(see 2.1\) than using fortified fertilisers.
1.1.3.6.4. Con: As GMOs have been controversial in many developing countries, successful uptake of these foods in such nations is not guaranteed.
1.1.3.6.4.1. Pro: The negative attitude to GM crops in Europe has strongly influenced African politicians and contributed to their fears regarding the impact it would have on [trade](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/why-is-africa-reluctant-to-use-gmo-crops/) with other countries. As a result, GM crops are grown commercially in just 3 African countries.
1.1.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: In 2019, the [government of Zimbabwe](https://www.organicwithoutboundaries.bio/2019/08/29/zimbabwean-government-gmo-stance/) confirmed it will continue to prohibit the growing of GM crops, despite growing concern that its reasons for doing so are vague and unsupported.
1.1.3.6.4.1.1.1. Con: Zimbabwe’s policy on GMO foods does [not](https://www.organicwithoutboundaries.bio/2019/08/29/zimbabwean-government-gmo-stance/) prohibit consumption, only production.
1.1.3.6.4.2. Con: Many of the crops primarily modified for nutritional enhancement are staple foods for developing countries, meaning they are more likely to be accepted and incorporated into diets in these regions.
1.1.3.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.6.2.1.
1.1.3.6.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.6.2.5.
1.1.3.6.4.3. Pro: In 2002, the Zambian government [rejected 35,000 tons](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/195377245.pdf) of food aid because of the possibility that it could be genetically modified, despite suffering a nationwide famine \(p. 1\).
1.1.3.6.5. Pro: Genetic modification of wheat to produce [high fiber versions](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831790-400-pink-pineapples-and-healthy-fries-the-new-gm-foods-made-for-you/) of the crop enables the creation of white flour that contains [twice](https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/news/scientists-prove-high-fibre-white-loaf-possible) as much fiber as standard white flour.
1.1.3.7. Pro: [In the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/kis-junk-food-dont-blame-parents) 25% of children in low-income areas are obese, compared to around only 11% in more affluent areas.
1.1.3.8. Pro: Genetically modified crops can [reduce the cost of meat](https://www.thebalance.com/can-genetically-modified-food-feed-the-world-375634) if these crops yield more and thus cheaper feed for commercially raised cattle. Eating processed and red meat regularly is associated with a range of [serious health problems](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/meat-nutrition/).
1.1.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.
1.1.3.8.2. Pro: Genetically modified soy, corn, potato, and cottonseed are all commonly used as [livestock feed](https://www.bio.org/blogs/gmos-and-animal-feed-getting-facts), thereby lowering the cost of red meat.
1.1.4. Con: Patents on GM seeds legally oblige farmers to [repeatedly repurchase](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/vandana-shiva-corporate-monopoly-seeds) these from multinational companies instead of reproducing their own, raising costs of food production.
1.1.4.1. Con: There are multiple [benefits](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/isnt-it-better-farmers-harvest-and-reuse-their-own-seeds) and guarantees associated with bought seeds that make them a preferred option to [saving seeds](https://www.myfearlesskitchen.com/dont-farmers-save-seeds/).
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Purchased seeds are less likely to contain [pathogens and disease](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/isnt-it-better-farmers-harvest-and-reuse-their-own-seeds).
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Purchased seeds are more likely to have [hybrid vigor](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/isnt-it-better-farmers-harvest-and-reuse-their-own-seeds).
1.1.4.2. Con: This claim is referring to Vandana Shiva in her opposition to GMO crops. She has been widely discredited as [unethical and unscientific](https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/letter-regarding-dr-vandana-shivas-anti-scientific-and-unethical-stances/) by the scientific community.
1.1.4.3. Pro: [Terminator seeds](https://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology), patented GM seeds whose crops produce exclusively sterile seeds, completely prevent farmers from saving or replanting GM seeds themselves.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Terminator seeds may help prevent genetically modified crops from [contaminating](http://www.progressio.org.uk/content/what-terminator-technology) nearby species, which might otherwise be detrimental to neighbouring farmers' crops.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: Terminator seeds have [not](https://www.worldseed.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Genetic_Use_Restriction_Technologies_20030611_En1.pdf) yet been commercialised, and opposition from the public, NGOs and many governments means this is [unlikely](https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165017/http://www.banterminator.org/Glossary/Moratorium) to happen.
1.1.4.3.3. Con: This is not unique to GM organisms: many hybrid species produced by traditional cross-breeding techniques are [sterile](https://sciencing.com/plant-hybrids-sterile-5619428.html). In such cases, seed companies have always had the ability to control the supply and market price of a particular hybrid strain.
1.1.4.4. Pro: [Leading scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/jan/23/gm-crops-genetically-modified-food-crisis) have warned that the dependency on large corporations that genetically modified seed patents encourage leaves farmers in developing countries incredibly vulnerable to sudden price hikes or seed withdrawals.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: If this is the case, then abolishing GMO patents or changing the powers they grant their owner could be a solution of equal or greater efficacy.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: As they are now, patents provide an [incentive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patent.asp) for companies to continue developing innovative products or services without the fear of proprietary and financial loss. Without this guarantee, the development of GM products is likely to be slowed.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: The anticipation of receiving patents provides companies with vital motivation for useful invention. The absence of a patent is thus the absence of a key driver for new GM product development \([p. 17-18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK233537/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK233537.pdf)\).
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: There are other ways to incentivise development that do not involve patents. For example, plant variety rights also protect intellectual property, but with an exemption allowing crop developers to use a protected crop variety in order to develop new, further improved varieties without requiring permission from the original right-holder \([p. 6](https://www.eesc.europa.eu/resources/docs/r_ces1425-2011_apa_en.pdf)\).
1.1.4.4.1.1.3. Con: Patents can also have [adverse effects](https://theconversation.com/do-patents-promote-innovation-5443) on innovation.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Patents are in place to provide vital [legal rights to the inventors](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/the-importance-of-patents.html) of a new product: to abolish them would leave inventors vulnerable to exploitation. Thus, removing GMO patents would not eradicate exploitative practices in the industry, but shift or widen the group of individuals affected by them.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Most GMOs are utility patented, which prevents the replanting of seeds harvested from a licensed plant. Were GMOs instead exclusively [plant patented](http://perennialpatents.com/plantpatent-v-utility-patents/) - allowing licensees to sexually reproduce the plants providing they do not sell or provide the seeds to others - this would prevent corporations from having a [detrimental amount of control](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/the-patent-landscape-of-genetically-modified-organisms/) over certain GMOs.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: Farmers would be unlikely to repurchase patented seeds unless they were more cost-effective than the alternative, suggesting that GMO seeds must generally produce [better yields](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/gmo-faq/does-big-ag-dominate-crop-research-and-the-global-seed-supply-controlling-the-world-food-market/) and thus make up for the higher cost that repurchasing incurs.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: Some pharmaceutical companies offer their products at a reduced cost to developing nations. Therefore, it may be plausible that biotech companies could be persuaded to offer the same with GM crops.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Syngenta states that they "do not [enforce](https://www.syngenta.com/how-we-do-it/corporate-responsibility/frequently-asked-questions/intellectual-property-faq) patents in seeds or biotechnology in Least Developed Countries \(LDCs\) by subsistence farmers for private or non-commercial use."
1.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Golden rice, a genetically modified version of rice that contains increased vitamin A, has been made [freely available](http://www.goldenrice.org/Content1-Who/who4_IP.php) in developing countries for humanitarian purposes.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: GM cotton has been widely [blamed](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jun/24/gm-crops-african-farmers) for an epidemic of suicides among Indian farmers, due to debt problems from high seed and pesticide costs, and failing crops.
1.1.4.4.4.1. Con: The International Food Policy Research institute found that [primary data](http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/14501/filename/14502.pdf) \(p. 8\) does not support the conclusion that farmer suicides have increased since the introduction of genetically modified cotton.
1.1.4.4.4.2. Con: The wider context surrounding the plight of Indian farmers suggests it may be [inaccurate](https://issues.org/keith/) to blame genetically modified crops alone for high suicide rates among this demographic.
1.1.4.4.4.2.1. Pro: A [lack of access to institutional credit](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/) may cause many small-scale farmers to resort to private lenders with exorbitant interest rates. The inability to repay these loans, as opposed to the purchasing of GM seeds, is what may lead to financial problems and accompanying mental health difficulties.
1.1.5. Pro: Genetically modified foods can be designed so as to reduce food waste, in turn reducing the amount of money both producers and consumers spend and waste on food.
1.1.5.1. Pro: GMO produce, such as non-browning apples and bruise- and black-spot-resistant potatoes, can [eliminate](https://gmoanswers.com/infographic-how-gmos-help-reduce-food-waste-loss) the cosmetic reasons for which consumers and food producers unnecessarily throw fresh, edible food away.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: [Arctic Apples](https://www.arcticapples.com/arctic-apples-r/arctic-apples-benefits/) have been developed so as not to brown after being bruised, sliced or bitten into.
1.1.5.2. Pro: As much as [40%](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/7128622/Scientists-create-GM-tomatoes-which-stay-fresh-for-a-month-longer-than-usual.html) of harvested fruit can be wasted due to rapid ripening. Genetically modifiying this produce so that it takes longer to ripen can greatly reduce this waste.
1.1.5.3. Con: Food waste is not only a production issue, but is a result of a number of factors. [Consumer habits](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/07/why-waste-food-home) and over-buying contribute heavily.
1.1.6. Pro: Farmers require [fewer](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/01/11/gm-herbicide-tolerant-crops-reduce-overall-herbicide-use/) herbicides and pesticides to grow genetically modified crops, which lowers costs of food production.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Monsanto’s ['Roundup Ready'](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/35/13010) corn and soy contain a gene which makes plants immune to ['Roundup'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_\(herbicide\)), a potent broad-spectrum herbicide that kills nearly all other exposed flora. This means that farmers need only use this one herbicide for all such crops.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Increased use of glyphosate-containing herbicides in conjunction with herbicide-resistant GMO crops causes the development of [glyphosate-resistant "superweeds"](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/), leading to a [renewed increase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/07/02/gmo-crops-mean-more-herbicide-not-less/#3d3f81393cd5) in economically and environmentally costly herbicides and farming practices.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Herbicide-resistant "superweeds" require [frequent plowing](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-05/roundup-resistant-superweeds-invade-us-fields/) to kill, thereby increasing soil erosion, the runoff of chemicals into waterways, and the use of expensive and environmentally unfriendly tractor fuel.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: In 2010, weed scientists estimated that the total amount of US farmland afflicted by such resistant weeds was still relatively small \([p. 73](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PsZEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=total+amount+of+US+farmland+affected+by+such+resistant+weeds+was+still+relatively+small&source=bl&ots=YhrfrVyAR9&sig=ACfU3U3H-dp02Z5Dm7jopBJJuZLm-UMj4w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiI58bZufzpAhWRa8AKHfN-CusQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=total%20amount%20of%20US%20farmland%20affected%20by%20such%20resistant%20weeds%20was%20still%20relatively%20small&f=false)\).
1.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: It is estimated that GM crops are responsible for an increase of [383 million](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/roundup-ready-crops/) pounds of herbicide use in the US.
1.1.6.1.1.4. Pro: Practices of tilling and herbicide use in 2015 were reported to be [similar](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/roundup-ready-crops/) to what they were 20 years previously, due to the increase in herbicide-resistant weeds.
1.1.6.2. Pro: [Insect resistance genes](http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/6/default.asp) can be inserted into crops from other species, negating the need for insecticide whilst also protecting crops.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Insects are evolving to develop [resistance](https://celebritywizz.com/insects-are-increasingly-evolving-resistance-to-genetically-modified-crops/) to GM crops engineered to deter them.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: [Biotech companies](https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gene/default.asp?GeneID=24) are combating the resistance to GM crops by developing a [variety of Bt strains](https://ejbpc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41938-018-0051-2)(Varieties of Bt corn and Bt cotton registered in the USA were producing 18 different combinations of 11 Bt toxins. Each variety produces 1–6 Bt toxins that kill caterpillars, beetles, or both \(Tabashnik et al. 2009\).) targeting Bt-resistant insects.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Some insects in the southern US are also developing resistance to "final Bt stronghold" altered strains, [nearly definitively proving the superiority of insects](https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2019/08/01/caterpillar-feeding-vip3a-cotton)(Now, entomologists across the South are reporting increased feeding and survival in Bt corn and cotton fields expressing the Vip3A protein, once believed to be the final Bt stronghold against this pest. Texas scientists are testing some of these suspect bollworm populations for resistance.) over these Bt-altered genetic crops.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Insect resistance to GM crops is [becoming so pervasive](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/22/495043248/as-a-gmo-pillar-wobbles-biotech-companies-promise-new-insect-killing-genes)(These genes are a pillar of the entire industry. But that pillar is wobbling. Three of the four Bt genes that are supposed to fend off one particularly important pest, the corn rootworm, are showing signs of failure. Corn rootworms have evolved resistance to them.) that it threatens the entire industry.
1.1.6.2.1.3. Con: The benefits can be sustained so long as farmers maintain refuge areas, where non-GM crops are planted in order to maintain a non-resistant gene in the local insect population \([p. 13](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/3#13)\).
1.1.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: It is also helpful to use the technology sparingly in crops where it is less effective; for example, altering [Bt in cotton crops](https://ejbpc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41938-018-0051-2)(However, In November 2009, Monsanto Company declared that P. gossypiella could develop resistance on Bt cotton producing Cry1Ac in four districts in India. As a solution for this problem the company produced another Bt cotton expressing Cry1Ac + Cry1Ab \(Bagla 2010\).) is more effective than Bt-altered corn.
1.1.6.2.1.4. Pro: In China, the Pink Bollworm, a harmful pest, has developed [resistance](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029975) to the protein produced by the Bt gene.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: It is important to keep a balance between insect-resistant GM crops and non-GM crops in order to avoid "[selection pressure](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/29/927111009/as-biotech-crops-lose-their-power-scientists-push-for-new-restrictions)(if a few rare insects happened to be genetically capable of surviving Bt proteins, they would be the sole survivors, quickly mate with each other, and produce a new strain of resistant insects. Biologists call this "selection pressure.")," causing surviving insects with natural immunity to modified genes to mate with each other and increase the likelihood that future generations will also inherit the same immunity.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Independent scientists have tried to appeal to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/) to [reduce the amount of land available](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/29/927111009/as-biotech-crops-lose-their-power-scientists-push-for-new-restrictions)(Even before Monsanto started selling the first Bt crops, independent scientists pushed the Environmental Protection Agency to limit the amount of land that farmers could devote to Bt crops. If these crops were planted everywhere, the scientists argued, it would create a situation in which, if a few rare insects happened to be genetically capable of surviving Bt proteins, they would be the sole survivors, quickly mate with each other, and produce a new strain of resistant insects. Biologists call this "selection pressure."\n\nThe solution, they said, was a requirement that farmers devote some of their land to non-Bt crops. This would allow plenty of non-resistant insects to survive, and make it less likely that the rare resistant insects would mate with each other.) to Bt-modified plants in order to avoid "selection pressure."
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: The bacterial [Bt gene](http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/6/default.asp) produces a protein toxic to insects. Scientists have successfully transferred this gene into certain genetically modified crops, enabling them to produce insecticidal proteins.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: In regions where the use of genetically modified crops containing the Bt gene is high, there has been a significant reduction in the size of insect-pest populations \([p. 11-12](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/3#11)\).
1.1.6.2.4. Pro: When compared to fields where conventional insecticides are used, fields containing insect-resistant GM crops harbour many more [useful insects](https://www.insectidentification.org/helpful-insects.asp) \([p. 4](http://www.vib.be/en/news/Documents/vib_fact_genetisch%20gewijzigde%20gewassen_ENG_2016_LR.pdf)\).
1.1.7. Pro: Genetically modified crops are engineered to grow in a [greater range of environments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560252/pdf/f1000research-4-7021.pdf) than their natural competitors. This results in more affordable food and extends the growing season \(p. 1\).
1.1.8. Con: Despite [increased adoption](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fes3.100) of genetically modified crops in recent years, there has been [no sustained cost reduction](http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/) for consumers.
1.1.8.1. Con: Very few GM foods have entered the market. There are only 10 GM crops [approved in the US](https://gmo.geneticliteracyproject.org/FAQ/which-genetically-engineered-crops-are-approved-in-the-us/), from which only small quantities are sold directly to consumers as food.
1.1.8.2. Con: Food costs are dependent on a variety of [factors](https://www.thebalance.com/why-are-food-prices-rising-causes-of-food-price-inflation-3306099), including weather, subsidies, overseas suppliers, tariffs, economic conditions, and consumer trends.
1.1.9. Pro: Genetically modified farming can [increase crop yield](https://medium.com/\@debunkingdenialism/five-ways-gmos-benefit-the-environment-c48eee7e2765), meaning it can require substantially less land, water, and other resources to grow the same amount of food as compared with conventional or organic methods.
1.1.9.1. Pro: A recent [report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/04/29/3-ways-gmos-keep-cost-of-food-down/#ea2fd141261d) estimated that the use of genetic modification to increase yield has reduced the cost of corn-based products by 6% and the costs of soybean-based products by 10%.
1.1.9.2. Con: Some analysis shows that there is [no discernible increase](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/gmo-promise-falls-short.html) in yield of GM crops relative to non-GM crops.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: Western Europe grows no GM maize, whereas the USA does. A recent paper comparing the 1961-2010 maize yields of each found that their average yields and yield increases were not significantly different \([p. 83](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14735903.2013.806408#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8xNDczNTkwMy4yMDEzLjgwNjQwOD9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw)\).
1.1.9.2.2. Con: There are many [other factors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/11/11/farmer-explains-gm-crops/#3ca8ae4e1a23) that can impact yield, such as climate, soil type, or local pest populations.
1.1.9.2.3. Con: Not all GMO crops are designed to produce [higher yield](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/11/07/economists-assess-gm-crops/#286c96be130a).
1.1.9.3. Pro: Regions with rapidly growing populations must often resort to [greenfield development](http://www.prres.net/papers/Karantonis_Population_Growth_and_Housing_Affordability.pdf) in order to keep housing affordable \(p.2\). Genetically modified crops can help to this end by occupying [less land](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/02/gmo-crops-increasing-yield-20-years-progress-ahead/) while maintaining a high yield.
1.1.9.4. Pro: Multiple researchers are developing GM crops that can carry out [photosynthesis more efficiently](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608535/to-feed-the-world-improve-photosynthesis/). These could increase yields and require less water and fertilizer to grow.
1.1.9.5. Pro: GM corn varieties can increase crop yield between [5.6 and 24.5 percent](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/02/19/gmo-corns-yield-human-health-benefits-vindicated-21-years-studies/) compared to their non-GM equivalents.
1.1.10. Con: Farms may have to be [restructured](http://www.geneticallymodifiedfoods.co.uk/what-are-cost-benefits-gm-foods.html) and farmers upskilled to accommodate changes in growing practices and crop management, reducing the economic benefits of lower food production costs.
1.1.10.1. Con: The initial, short-term costs of restructuring and training required for these changes to occur would be likely negligible compared to the long-term savings associated with GMO farming.
1.2. Con: A universal ban is not the right approach to addressing any potential problems with genetically modified foods.
1.2.1. Pro: There is no guarantee that any universal ban would be enforced in the interests of public protection.
1.2.1.1. Pro: In [Cambodia](http://www.devex.com/news/what-are-the-political-drivers-for-gmos-in-developing-countries-92091), no GMO plant has been approved for production simply due to the risk of negative impact on exports because of foreign ill-perception of GMOs.
1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.6.4.1.
1.2.1.3. Con: Even if a law is made primarily to protect a nation economically or politically, this would still filter down to protect that nation's population in various ways: direct health impacts are not the only source of risk to public national safety and security.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Countries in the EU have banned the cultivation and importation of most GMOs due to [economic protectionism](https://www.biofortified.org/2013/10/eu-opposition-to-gm-crops/), rather than out of concern for public safety.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: The EU’s [anti-GMO](https://www.biofortified.org/2013/10/eu-opposition-to-gm-crops/) stance reflects their politics of food security and self-sufficiency, emanating from the European agricultural policies active since the beginnings of the EU.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: More than half of EU-member countries requested to opt-out of growing GM crops in their countries, on account of [not trusting EU safety assessments](https://www.rt.com/news/317638-eu-gmo-cultivation-opt-out/). This suggests these EU countries are primarily concerned with public safety.
1.2.2. Con: A GMO ban would likely accelerate progress in developing alternative, non-GM techniques that could achieve comparatively better results.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The [reverse breeding](http://www.epsoweb.org/file/2183) of plants, discovered in 1998, facilitates the selection of [superior](https://www.slideshare.net/shruthibelliappa155/reverse-breeding) hybrid plants while removing the randomness of earlier hybrid breeding techniques.
1.2.2.2. Pro: [Ionizing radiation](https://www.iaea.org/topics/mutation-induction) can be used to induce hereditary changes in plants by increasing the natural mutation rate by a factor of up to 1 million.
1.2.2.3. Pro: [DNA fingerprinting and molecular marking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_breeding#Marker_assisted_selection) can be used to map the genome of any particular crop that features traits of interest. This is more precise than relying on visual identification and allows for production of new crop varieties using conventional methods with greater efficiency than previously possible.
1.2.2.4. Con: Conventional breeding techniques can take [years](https://www.farmprogress.com/management/traditional-plant-breeding-vs-genetic-engineering-primer) to produce the desired combination of genes in a species in order to grow new crop varieties. Genetic modification is a much more [rapid](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-does-gm-differ-from-conventional-plant-breeding/) process, since genes from a wide variety of other species can be directly inserted into the new crop.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Genetic modification of crops is not as quick as its supporters claim, due to [limitations](https://www.gmwatch.org/en/news/archive/2013/15227-is-gm-quicker-than-conventional-breeding) inherent to the process.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: [According to](https://www.gmwatch.org/en/news/archive/2013/15227-is-gm-quicker-than-conventional-breeding) Dr Doug Gurian-Sherman from the Union of Concerned Scientists, it takes as long to create a successful GM crop as it does to develop one through conventional breeding techniques.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: Regardless of whether it is produced by genetic modification or by selective breeding, [years](https://www.gmwatch.org/en/news/archive/2013/15227-is-gm-quicker-than-conventional-breeding) of field testing are needed to ascertain how the new crop responds in various environments.
1.2.2.4.1.3. Pro: GM crops may suffer from unexpected [epigenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) changes and/or mutations. Subsequently rectifying these errors can take many [years](https://www.gmwatch.org/en/news/archive/2013/15227-is-gm-quicker-than-conventional-breeding) of [backcrossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcrossing).
1.2.2.4.1.3.1. Con: Epigenetic changes and mutations can [occur naturally](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.45) and thus are not unique to GM organisms.
1.2.2.4.1.4. Con: The seemingly slow rate of genetic engineering is offset by the fact that many plant species are being engineered to [mature more quickly](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/08/the-gmo-debate/).
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Which and how many genes are affected when using non-GM, conventional methods is [unclear](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/are-there-any-alternatives-gmo). Genetic modification is a much more precise technique, making it more efficient in producing new crop varieties.
1.2.3. Pro: Bans are difficult to enforce, especially when they are so far-reaching.
1.2.3.1. Pro: [Genetic contamination](https://permaculturenews.org/2009/04/17/the-global-spread-of-gmo-crops-2/) through natural pollination has the potential to eventually render entire species 'genetically modified' in some way. It would be impractical and illogical to place a ban on an entire species.
1.2.3.2. Con: The difficulty of enforcing a ban doesn't indicate that it should not be attempted if it has popular support.
1.2.4. Con: Corporations can utilize genetically modified products to engage in exploitative practices. A blanket ban on GM food would be the surest way to put a stop to this.
1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Genetically modified seeds and associated research technologies are patented by a minority of large corporations \([p. xix](https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/GM-Crops-Discussion-Paper-2003.pdf)\). These can be used to financially exploit smaller-scale players in the GMO industry.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Some small companies own the patents to GM crops, like the [Arctic Apple](https://foodservice.arcticapples.com/our-story/).
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Banning the sale of GM crops would not stop financial exploitation: large multinational companies would still be able to patent [DNA, complementary DNA, and new plants.](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/the-patent-landscape-of-genetically-modified-organisms/)
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: If patented GMO seeds [contaminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,_Inc.#cite_note-MonsantoResponse-25) neighbouring land and grow there, the owners of this land can be [sued for patent infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_legal_cases) by Monsanto.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: In 1997, Monsanto took legal action against [Percy Schmeiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Schmeiser), who had found individual herbicide-resistent canola specimens growing on his own land and then encouraged their propagation.
1.2.4.2.3.1.1. Con: The [actual details](https://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/38991/index.do) of this court case cast doubt over Schmeiser's innocence and do not match the [public perception](https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/magazine/entry/percy_schmeiser_vs._monsanto/) of the incident.
1.2.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.4.2.5. Pro: In 2018, two large biotechnology firms controlled and sold patented seeds for [75-80%](https://gmo.geneticliteracyproject.org/FAQ/do-monsanto-and-big-ag-control-crop-research-and-world-food-supply/) of all GMO corn and soybeans planted in the US.
1.2.4.2.6. Pro: Multinational corporations can charge large [licence fees](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/) that may be prohibitive for smaller-scale plant breeders and researchers.
1.2.4.2.7. Con: Patents typically [expire](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/the-patent-landscape-of-genetically-modified-organisms/) after 20 years. Since the first GMOs were patented in the early [1990s](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/from-corgis-to-corn-a-brief-look-at-the-long-history-of-gmo-technology/), some are thus already patent-free and farmers have begun purchasing and replanting [generic](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/07/30/166919/as-patents-expire-farmers-plant-generic-gmos/) GMO seeds at much lower prices.
1.2.4.2.7.1. Con: After two decades, any significant advantages of a particular gene variation would have likely dissipated significantly or problems would have developed with overuse, thus this would be unlikely to be beneficial.
1.2.4.2.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.2.5. Con: Compared to other products, there is insufficient research into GMOs. They should be banned until they can be unequivocally confirmed to be safe for people and the environment.
1.2.5.1. Con: Genetically modified food is subject to [rigorous safety checks](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-technology/faq-genetically-modified-food/en/) that are often more thorough than those of its non-GM counterparts.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: The [research demanded](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-technology/faq-genetically-modified-food/en/) for the creation and commercialisation of GM food means their genetics and possible side effects are well understood by the time of their market release. In comparison, new unmodified crop strains undergo no equivalent testing and their safety is assumed simply on grounds of their non-GM status. This means that new and approved GM crops carry fewer health risks for consumers than new, non-GM crops.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: The National Research Council has supported this theory, stating that non-GM [mutation breeding](https://www.nap.edu/read/10977/chapter/5) is not routinely evaluated for unintended effects at the molecular level even though it has an equal, [if not higher](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/5971063/traditional-crop-breeding-isnt-nearly-as-traditional-as-you-think), risk of producing these than genetic modification does.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: [Lenape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape_potato), a non-GM potato cultivar released in 1967, had to be withdrawn from the market 3 years later following the discovery of its toxic [glycoalkaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoalkaloid) content.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Historically, large institutions with investments in the GMO industry have conducted [biased](http://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/2-science-regulation/2-1-myth-gm-foods-strictly-tested-regulated-safety/) research or ensured the removal of published studies or test results that suggest a link between GMOs and health risks.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Many studies performed by GMO companies on their own products focus on findings that are [tangential](https://corporateeurope.org/food-and-agriculture/2016/06/gm-crops-rebuttal-claims-safety-and-benefits) to assessing the safety of commercialised GM foods.
1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: In a [review](https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-015-0052-7) of 15 animal feeding studies on glyphosate-tolerant GM crops, 6 were by researchers with an industry affiliation and 9 by independent researchers. All 6 industry studies and 1 independent found the GM feed to cause no significant negative effects. Meanwhile, the remaining 8 independent studies found the opposite.
1.2.5.1.2.3. Con: Regulatory bodies like the FDA review the testing procedures used by GMO companies. Since such bodies have the power to [stop any food from going to market](https://grist.org/food/the-gm-safety-dance-whats-rule-and-whats-real/), it is in the best interests of biotech companies to cooperate and ensure their products pass safety requirements prior to their release.
1.2.5.1.2.4. Pro: Mexican scientists found that the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology had [withdrawn](https://gmwatch.org/en/news/archive/2013/15225) a study on the toxicity of transgenic maize in rats due to pressure from multinational GMO companies.
1.2.5.1.2.4.1. Con: The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology retracted a study on the harmful effects of GM maize on rats because the study used was found to be [objectively invalid](https://www.nature.com/news/study-linking-gm-maize-to-rat-tumours-is-retracted-1.14268).
1.2.5.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: One of the studies' authors is [Gilles-Éric Séralini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles-Éric_Séralini), a proponent of homeopathy and a pseudoscientist who has been discredited in the past for other studies.
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: Genetically modified crops can only be grown if they are [approved](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-are-gm-crops-regulated/) for use by the appropriate regional agency, who will only do so if there is scientific evidence that they will not harm the environment or people.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Before a GM crop can be cultivated commercially in the European Union, it has to undergo a risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) \([p. 4](http://www.vib.be/en/news/Documents/vib_fact_genetisch%20gewijzigde%20gewassen_ENG_2016_LR.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.4. Con: The US does not require genetically engineered plants to be proven safe. The FDA claims that GM foods can be [marketed](https://usrtk.org/the-fda-does-not-test-whether-gmos-are-safe/) without prior testing because they are GRAS, meaning “generally recognized as safe”.
1.2.5.1.4.1. Con: The FDA's [website](https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GEPlants/ucm461805.htm) clearly states that: "Foods from \[genetically modified\] plants must meet the same food safety requirements as foods derived from traditionally bred plants."
1.2.5.1.5. Pro: Prior to release, all genetically modified foods are subject to thorough [in vitro and in silico tests](https://grist.org/food/genetically-engineered-food-allergic-to-regulations/), as well as [human trials](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/04/18/are-gmos-causing-food-allergies/#3eb5237e431e), that test for the presence of allergens. Any GM product that fails these tests is not released.
1.2.5.1.5.1. Pro: GM soybeans that contain the allergen [2s albumin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8594427/) were [not](https://grist.org/food/genetic-engineering-vs-natural-breeding-whats-the-difference/) commercially released since testing revealed the presence of allergens. This demonstrates that existing testing procedures are adequate and ensure that only safe genetically modified products are made available to consumers.
1.2.5.2. Pro: The European Commission cites the lack of [long term research](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6122/883.full?rss=1) into genetically modified food as the reason for delaying authorization to EU states to grow some genetically modified crops.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: GMOs only entered grocery stores in [1994](https://gmo-awareness.com/all-about-gmos/gmo-timeline-a-history-of-genetically-modified-foods/). There is therefore no substantial research yet available that studies the long-term effects of GMO consumption.
1.2.5.3. Pro: The state should abide by the [precautionary principle](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/140214-gm-foods-and-application-of-the-precautionary-principle-in-europe/). Genetically modified crops should not be used unless it is certain that no harmful consequences will be caused by their use.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: No one can ever guarantee that the use of new technologies will be completely without risk, so adopting the precautionary principle would result in a ban on any form of new technology.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: As with GMOs, there is still much controversy and uncertainty surrounding the [safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4350886/) of mobile phones. However, since the known benefits are so vast, these concerns have not led to a ban.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Refusing to adopt genetically modified crops would result in many people facing a greater risk of [starvation](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2014-10-14/gmos-research-says-theyll-help-end-starvation-americans). Adopting the precautionary principle would thus increase, not decrease, the risks they face.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: Climate change will make it [difficult](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-climate-change-could-heighten-risk-global-food-production-shocks) for many parts of the world to continue to grow conventional crops. New genetically modified crops are needed to ensure these regions can [continue to produce](https://massivesci.com/articles/crispr-gmo-food-shortage-climate-change/) sufficient food.
1.2.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Climate change is predicted to [reduce](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27308720) nutrient levels in staple crops consumed by impoverished communities. The production of crops genetically engineered to contain high levels of these nutrients could mitigate this effect.
1.2.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Nearly 2 billion people worldwide get [at least 70%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27308720) of their iron and zinc from wheat and rice. Reductions in the iron and zinc levels of these crops are therefore highly likely to significantly increase corresponding nutrient deficiencies and their associated health problems around the world.
1.2.5.3.2.1.2. Con: Changes to [cropping systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8709-7_7) can be used to help agriculture adapt to climate change. For example, growing several crops at one time can help crops exhibit greater durability during periods of climate related stress \([p. 2](https://www.soils.org/files/science-policy/caucus/briefings/climate-change.pdf)\).
1.2.5.3.2.1.3. Con: [Not all crops](http://climatechangeconnection.org/impacts/agriculture-impacts/agriculture-crops/) will suffer as a result of climate change. Wheat, canola, and soybeans grow better when exposed to increased CO2 levels.
1.2.5.3.2.1.4. Con: Climate change will increase the rate at which soil microbes decompose organic matter. This might make soils more fertile, since the amount of nutrients available to crops will [increase.](http://climatechangeconnection.org/impacts/agriculture-impacts/agriculture-crops/)
1.2.5.3.2.1.5. Pro: Climate change will worsen soil conditions \([p. 2-3](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/climaterealityproject.org/files/Soil%20Health%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf)\). [GE](http://pknewby.com/2012/11/06/faqs-on-gmos-what-the-science-says/) crops can mitigate or adapt to this phenomenon \(see point 5\).
1.2.5.3.2.1.5.1. Pro: GM crops could be modified to grow in [salty soils](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166913007192) that unmodified crops cannot tolerate. Since salty soils reduce the agricultural potential of an estimated 45 million hectares of irrigated land and are an [increasing](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-making-soils-saltier-forcing-many-farmers-to-find-new-livelihoods-106048) issue due to climate change, this could significantly increase the amount of arable land worldwide.
1.2.5.3.2.1.5.2. Con: Traditional cross-breeding is proving [more](https://www.nature.com/news/cross-bred-crops-get-fit-faster-1.15940) successful at adapting crops to drought and poor soils than GM techniques.
1.2.5.3.2.1.5.3. Pro: Eastern Cottonwood trees were genetically engineered to [remove mercury](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2006.00236.x) from soil, a problem [exacerbated](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191016124557.htm) by climate change. This can both maintain safe mercury concentrations and decontaminate soil previously rendered unusable by toxic mercury levels.
1.2.5.3.2.1.5.4. Pro: Conventional [tilling](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/tilling-soil-mean-43382.html), needed to keep non-GM crop fields weed-free, strips the soil of many nutrients, increases [erosion](https://www.farmanddairy.com/columns/the-benefits-of-not-tilling-fields-and-gardens/599548.html) and run-off, and harms [earthworm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170508095152.htm) populations. Herbicide-resistant GMOs reduce the need for this.
1.2.5.3.2.1.5.4.1. Con: [Tilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-till_farming) is not a hard requirement for farming non-GMO produce: a [number of farms](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2014/Highlights_Conservation.pdf) growing non-GMO crops support less mainstream methods of land management that reduce or eliminate the need to till.
1.2.5.3.2.1.6. Pro: A global temperature increase of just one degree will cause crop yields to decrease by [3-7%](https://massivesci.com/articles/crispr-gmo-food-shortage-climate-change/), in part due to increased [droughts and floods](https://www.soils.org/files/science-policy/caucus/briefings/climate-change.pdf) \(p.1\). GM crops can be engineered to mitigate this effect.
1.2.5.3.2.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.5.2.
1.2.5.3.2.1.6.2. Pro: Crops can be engineered to be [heat tolerant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550655/), meaning they could withstand global temperature increases without decreasing in yield.
1.2.5.3.2.1.7. Pro: Climate change facilitates the [spread](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1990) of [pests](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23899019), pathogens, and weeds. Genetic modification will be increasingly needed to protect crops while keeping use of pesticides and herbicides low.
1.2.5.3.2.1.7.1. Pro: Carbon dioxide concentrations are projected to increase significantly in the next 50 years, which could lead to greater growth of [C3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_carbon_fixation) weed species. Genetic modification will be needed to ensure crops can continue to thrive despite increased pressure from such weeds \([p. 1-2](https://www.soils.org/files/science-policy/caucus/briefings/climate-change.pdf)\).
1.2.5.3.2.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.2.5.3.2.1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.2.5.3.2.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.2.5.3.2.1.7.5. Pro: Bt corn and soy can lead to [decreased](https://pknewby.com/2012/11/06/faqs-on-gmos-what-the-science-says/) use of pesticides and herbicides.
1.2.5.4. Con: 90% of scientists believe that GMOs are [safe](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/well/eat/are-gmo-foods-safe.html) to consume.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Medications that were on the market for up to [55 years](https://prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005528) - much longer than GMOs - have been later banned because of undiscovered side effects, or consequences that require long-term usage to manifest.
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.2.6. Pro: In terms of satisfying both pro- and anti-GMO groups, [GMO labelling laws](https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/66700/usda-gmo-labelling-guidelines/) offer a better solution than an outright ban.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Making GMO labelling mandatory guarantees transparency so that people can make [informed](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/19/why-we-need-mandatory-labeling-of-gmo-products/) buying choices regardless of their personal views on GMOS.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: The public are [not](https://www.growingproduce.com/farm-marketing/consumers-dont-really-know-what-gmo-means-new-study-finds/) necessarily already aware of the potential pros and cons of GM foods. Simply labelling products to signal GMO presence is therefore insufficient to ensure informed buying choices are made.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: While labelling improves transparency, it does not negate the fact that GMOs comprise a large percentage of produce currently on offer in some areas of the world, making them difficult to avoid entirely.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: It has been estimated that at least [75%](https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/311/ge-foods/about-ge-foods) of processed foods on supermarket shelves in the US contain genetically engineered ingredients.
1.2.6.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.2.6.2. Pro: [Americans](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97567&page=1) are divided on whether to support genetic modification of food, but the vast majority support labelling laws.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Regardless of public opinion, American courts are likely to find the compulsory labelling of genetically modified foods unconstitutional.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: There is Supreme Court precedent to show that GMO labelling is a form of "compelled corporate speech" which violates the First Amendment \([p. 28](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2016/9/regulation-v39n3-2.pdf)\).
1.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: Similar legislation, including a [Vermont law](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1210635.html) requiring the labelling of milk produced from cows treated with synthetic growth hormone \(rBST\), has been struck down by federal courts.
1.2.6.2.1.3. Con: The US Supreme Court only extended constitutional protection to commercial speech - under which product labelling is categorised - in 1976, and its protection is said to occupy a '[subordinate position](https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/39-2-04_kimbrell_34873.pdf)' in the hierarchy of First Amendment values \(p. 388\).
1.2.6.3. Pro: There are precedents for [food labelling](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_14_2560) so this type of action is relatively easy to implement.
1.2.6.4. Con: In its current form, GMO labelling is not an effective way of informing consumers.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: In the US, a law passed to standardise labelling for [genetic modification](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12111346/gmo-labeling-bill-congress) still allows companies to only provide QR codes or telephone numbers in place of a physical product label, meaning potential information on GM ingredients is not accessible to all.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Pro: QR codes are [discriminatory](https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/66700/usda-gmo-labelling-guidelines/) against the third of Americans without smartphones or internet access, as well as against rural, low-income, or elderly populations.
1.2.6.4.1.2. Con: Digital [smart labelling](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/6/9846162/gmo-labels) gives customers a much more well-rounded and detailed view of a foodstuff's production process than basic physical GMO labels.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.2.6.5. Con: Labelling does not address the risk of GMOs [spreading](https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/articles.00/GMO_Issues-000307.html) and 'contaminating' non-GMO environments and food through accidental cross-pollination, so this would be unlikely to satisfy anti-GMO groups as a solution.
1.2.6.5.1. Pro: In a 2013 survey, [1 in 3](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/heavy-price-tag-gmo-contamination) organic farmer respondents indicated that their land had suffered GMO contamination, suggesting that even people who actively avoid GMOs may unknowingly consume them as long as they continue to be grown.
1.2.6.6. Con: GMO labelling will negatively impact the food market for both pro- and anti-GMO parties.
1.2.6.6.1. Pro: Labelling genetically modified crops as such [intensifies the misconception](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/labels-for-gmo-foods-are-a-bad-idea/) that there is something meaningfully different or inherently risky about GM products, so is just as poor a solution for pro-GMO parties as an outright ban.
1.2.6.6.1.1. Pro: Stigmatizing GMO products \(via labelling\) weakens [market efficiency](https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2048-7010-3-8) by reducing demand for GM products or inflating demand for their conventional or organic counterparts.
1.2.6.6.1.2. Con: A study found that when some countries switched to mandatory labelling for GM food products, this did not substantially affect consumer behaviour and the purchasing of GM foods did not reduce overall \([p. 112, p. 116](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rWUuIcRNCkAC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=GM+food+labels+netherlands+china&source=bl&ots=O5iHdXo0u_&sig=R7aZDIAV2WicJG2I34wnsqS2m-w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VVeUUKCuGe7h0wHX2IGYDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=GM%20food%20labels%20netherlands%20china&f=false)\).
1.2.6.6.1.3. Con: In [Vermont](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/gmo-labeling-study/563699/), support for genetically modified foods increased after a labelling law was passed, suggesting that increased transparency through labelling may actually benefit the pro-GMO cause overall.
1.2.6.6.2. Pro: Demand for GMO-free products is [significantly enhanced](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223910) with the introduction of GMO labels, which negatively impacts GMO producers.
1.2.6.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.6.1.2.
1.2.6.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.6.1.3.
1.2.6.6.3. Con: Any sudden mass removal of products in a market will inevitably impact supply, demand, and price of other products; thus, the food market would just as likely be equally or worse affected in ways that could negatively impact all parties if an outright ban were implemented, too.
1.2.6.6.4. Pro: Labelling raises the price of all food marked as either ["organic" or "non-GMO"](https://www.scimoms.com/2018/04/11/high-price-food-labels/), negatively impacting anti-GMO consumers.
1.2.6.6.4.1. Con: Labelling of organic or non-GMO food is already highly common: given the desirable image of organic and non-GMO produce, it is in these companies' financial interests to [label](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/12/01/americans-views-about-and-consumption-of-organic-foods/) and thus emphasise their products as such regardless of whether GMO-labelling is compulsory.
1.2.6.6.4.1.1. Con: In a survey, it was found that only around [23%](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/05/consumers-unwilling-pay-non-gmo-organic-foods/) of respondents would be willing to spend an extra 50 cents on a $5 grocery item if it was labeled GMO-free or organic, despite over 45% saying that they found organic and GMO-free products more desirable. Thus, organic labelling does not necessarily increase the profit of organic companies.
1.2.6.6.4.1.2. Pro: Consumers are willing to pay more for products that are labelled as "[natural](https://www.farmfutures.com/farm-life/consumers-will-pay-more-products-positively-perceived-labels)" or "[organic](https://hrcak.srce.hr/ojs/index.php/ekonomski-vjesnik/article/view/5316)".
1.2.6.6.4.2. Pro: A consumer report comparing more than 100 product pairings has shown that on average, organic foods are already [47%](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/03/cost-of-organic-food/index.htm) more expensive than their conventional counterparts.
1.2.6.6.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.6.4.1.2.
1.2.6.6.4.2.2. Con: Many organic foods are getting [rapidly cheaper](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/1/11822658/organic-food-cost-more).
1.2.6.6.4.3. Con: This assumes that there is an inherent public good in providing "organic" or "non-GMO" foods at reasonable prices due to the presupposition that they are more nutritious than GMO foods. This is not necessarily the case.
1.2.6.6.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.2.6.6.4.4. Pro: Analysis has shown that GM-free certification raises the price of food products by an average of [34%](https://www.agwest.sk.ca/index.php/blog/posts/the-cost-of-eating-nongm.html).
1.3. Pro: Genetically modified food endangers the health of people who consume it.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.2. Con: Many of the processes employed in genetic modification have occurred, in nature and in traditional agriculture, for years without any identifiable health risks. As such, it seems unlikely that GMOs pose a greater risk than non-GMOs.
1.3.2.1. Con: Genetically modified animals sometimes contain genes derived from [other species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/19/gmo-salmon-approved-canada). This would likely not be possible to achieve in nature, or by using conventional agricultural techniques.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: [AquAdvantage Salmon](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-aquabounty-salmon-genetically-modified-food-1.3589613) contains genes from the eel species [ocean pout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_pout).
1.3.2.1.2. Con: This phenomenon, otherwise known as [horizontal gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer), can occur naturally between different plant and animal species with no human interference.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Researchers believe that this process, as triggered by the natural bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, has cultivated the modern-day [sweet potato](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150421084204.htm).
1.3.2.1.2.2. Con: While there is evidence for the occurrence of natural plant-animal HGT, this has not been commonly recorded with animal species more complex than [invertebrates](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2148) such as [sea slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer#Plants_to_animals).
1.3.2.2. Pro: [Atomic gardening](https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/atomic-gardening/), which has been around since the 1950s, involves safely exposing plants to gamma rays in order to genetically alter them. Experts have directly [compared](https://interestingengineering.com/atomic-gardens-how-plants-were-bred-with-gamma-radiation) its methodology to that of modern-day genetic engineering.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Much of the data from previous gamma garden research and methods is [unknown](https://interestingengineering.com/atomic-gardens-how-plants-were-bred-with-gamma-radiation), thus it cannot be cited as proof that genetic modification is safe and acceptable.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Humanity has been creating and using GMOs throughout history via [selective breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding#History), a form of [monoculture](https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/monoculture). As a result, [many species](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/what-fruits-and-vegetables-looked-like-before-humans-starting-growing-them-a6849036.html) are now significantly different from their wild ancestors in ways that are more beneficial to humans.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: As a result of selective breeding, farmed turkeys and chickens have increased in size over [200%](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/11/turkey-bigger-thanksgiving-butterball-antibiotics/) and 400% \([p. 543](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n31_CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA543&lpg=PA543&dq=farmed+chickens+increase+400%25+in+size&source=bl&ots=6aA73nhGfv&sig=ACfU3U158aeRav7NYqBPA135LbGzhw-pTg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWvq3u_9npAhVSTsAKHbxaBjwQ6AEwDHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=farmed%20chickens%20increase%20400%25%20in%20size&f=false)\) respectively since the middle of the last century.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: [Historically,](http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2016/02/cattle-domestication-from-aurochs-to-cow/) detailed records on the frequency, volume, and composition of individual cows’ milk has been used to selectively breed animals for optimum milk production. Contemporary cows produce four times the amount of milk of cows from the 1940s.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.2.3.4. Pro: The evolution of plants by natural selection does not necessarily result in desirable or practical crops for humans. Their modification has thus been a necessary practice throughout history in order to cultivate ones more suitable for human consumption.
1.3.2.3.4.1. Pro: Corn, watermelon, brassica cultivars, and many other crop species have all been selectively bred over thousands of years to be [vastly different](https://listverse.com/2016/08/22/10-foods-that-exist-because-of-ancient-genetic-engineering/) from their original ancestors, some of which were almost [inedible](https://phys.org/news/2005-05-scientists-corn-ancestry-ancient-grass.html) before being modified by human beings via such techniques.
1.3.2.3.4.2. Pro: [Seedless grapes](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/question349.htm) have to be cloned and cannot come about by natural selection.
1.3.2.4. Con: While many agricultural practices may be seen as similar to modern-day genetic modification, the former have often been used throughout history, while the latter is a recent phenomenon. With this in mind, the similarities are not enough to conclude that modern GMO foods pose no greater risks than long-established, non-GMO ones.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Some agricultural methods used today have roots in practices which originated at least [8000 years](https://www.easy-irrigation.co.uk/a-history-of-agricultural-page-29?zenid=sdsac0ujmspu42fdush9siong4) ago.
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Crop rotation was used by both the ancient [Romans](https://www.allotment-garden.org/crop-rotation/history-principles-crop-rotation/) and the ancient [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_ancient_Rome#Farming_practices).
1.3.2.4.3. Con: Many 'conventional' agricultural practices, such as mutation or radiation breeding, were only introduced relatively [recently](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/5971063/traditional-crop-breeding-isnt-nearly-as-traditional-as-you-think) or have changed significantly over time, meaning they cannot be seen as less risky to human health by virtue of their longevity.
1.3.2.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.3.4. Pro: Genetically modified organisms may have irreversibly harmful impacts on the efficacy of vital medicines and treatments.
1.3.4.1. Con: Insulin - a vital hormone that diabetic humans cannot produce naturally, and must therefore inject themselves with regularly - can be made artificially by genetic modification of a [common bacterium](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/fromdnatobeer/exhibition-interactive/recombinant-DNA/recombinant-dna-technology-alternative.html#:~:text=insert%20the%20human%20insulin%20gene,to%20begin%20producing%20human%20insulin.) using a human gene.
1.3.4.2. Con: Many diseases cause unnecessary health complications and deaths due to a [lack](https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/WHO_DI_30-2_Medicines.pdf?ua=1) of available vaccines \(p. 1\). Genetic modification could create [plant-based, edible vaccines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/edible-vaccine) that are cheaper and more accessible, safeguarding millions of otherwise vulnerable people against such diseases.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The increased use of genetically modified food may result in increased [antibiotic resistance.](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/fury-as-eu-approves-gm-potato-1915833.html)
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Antibiotic resistance marker genes are used in genetic modification of plants. There is some concern that these genes could [transfer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4176670/) to microorganisms via horizontal gene transfer, causing them to develop resistance to antibiotics.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: Most genes from a genetically modified crop will be destroyed as a result of cooking and/or digestion. Small fragments of DNA may survive: however, it is very [unlikely](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/could-eating-gm-food-have-an-effect-on-my-genes/) that these would successfully transfer to other microorganisms.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: GMOs are usually individually assessed by regulatory bodies for associated risks, including any potential risk from antibiotic-resistant genes. If the risk were more than negligible, the GMO would [not be approved](https://www.government.nl/topics/biotechnology/antibiotic-resistant-genes) for use in practice.
1.3.5. Con: Much [scientific evidence](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/is-it-safe-to-eat-gm-crops/) shows that GMOs have negligible, if not beneficial, effects on human health as compared with their non-GM counterparts.
1.3.5.1. Pro: All [major health organizations](http://bcp.org.ph/contentarea/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Global-Scientific-Consensus-on-Safety-of-GM-Foods.jpg) worldwide, including the WHO, BMA and the [EU](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/gmo) \(the latter of which has the largest independent database of GM crop research worldwide\), have found no GM food health concerns.
1.3.5.2. Pro: In some cases, GM foods are specifically engineered in ways that reduce the health risks normally associated with their non-GM counterparts.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Crops that are genetically modified to [fix atmospheric nitrogen](https://www.iaea.org/topics/improving-soil-fertility) require fewer synthetic fertilisers, the presence of which when leached into drinking water for human consumption is linked to an [increased incidence](https://www.environment.co.za/environmental-issues/how-do-fertilizers-affect-the-environment.html) of blue baby syndrome, cancer, and other chronic diseases.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: Potatoes can be genetically engineered to have a lower concentration of free asparagine \([p. 230](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/8#230)\). Asparagine is converted to acrylamine, a compound [potentially carcinogenic](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/what-acrylamide-and-it-cancer-risk) in humans, when potato is cooked at high temperatures.
1.3.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.
1.3.5.2.4. Con: Countless [studies](http://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/3-health-hazards-gm-foods/3-1-myth-gm-foods-safe-eat/) show that GM foods can be toxic, allergenic, or cause unintended nutritional changes.
1.3.5.2.4.1. Pro: Increased consumption of genetically modified crops has been linked to an increase in [food allergies](https://responsibletechnology.org/genetically-engineered-foods-may-cause-rising-food-allergies-part-one/).
1.3.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: When soybeans were genetically modified to include genes from Brazil nuts, the resulting GM beans contained [2s albumin](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Identification-of-a-Brazil-nut-allergen-in-Nordlee-Taylor/90b40e8997a011f5b4b038d459db940d7d60faf6), an allergen derived from the Brazil nuts.
1.3.5.2.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.5.1.
1.3.5.2.4.2. Pro: Some genetically modified foods may have higher levels of toxicity, because the process of genetic modification itself can create or increase toxins and anti-nutrients.
1.3.5.2.4.2.1. Con: These same risks are also inherent in non-GM crops manipulated by coventional agricultural methods.
1.3.5.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.2.
1.3.5.2.4.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/possible-health-risks-gmos-gmo-foods) found that genetically modified soybeans contained up to 7 times the normal level of a natural soy allergen and double the normal amount of soy lectin, which can block nutrient absorption.
1.3.5.2.4.3. Con: Innovations in genetic modification could result in the [removal](https://www.eufic.org/en/food-today/article/gm-crops-could-bring-allergy-relief-in-the-future) of many common allergens and allergic reactions.
1.3.5.2.4.3.1. Pro: Scientists are in the process of removing the protein allergen Ara h 2 from [peanuts](https://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/53/default.asp) via genetic modification.
1.3.5.2.4.3.2. Con: Many allergens are proteins within species and products that have very complex structures. Even if all potential allergens could be removed from trigger foods, it is likely that their [nutritional content](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/allergy-free-peanuts-not-so-fast/) would be detrimentally altered in the process.
1.3.5.2.4.3.3. Pro: Scientists have developed rice that [reduces](https://www.livescience.com/7775-genetically-modified-rice-fights-allergies.html) allergies to Japanese cedar pollen, which affects 20% of the Japanese population.
1.3.5.2.4.3.4. Pro: Many allergenic proteins do not have a [vital function](https://www.eufic.org/en/food-today/article/gm-crops-could-bring-allergy-relief-in-the-future), meaning that genetic modification can be used to remove the genes which [code for them](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/genetic_code.htm) without harming the crop.
1.3.5.2.4.3.4.1. Con: Many minor panallergens are [involved in vital functions](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-6-1) in both plants and animals.
1.3.5.2.4.3.5. Pro: Genetic modification is being used to create a wheat variety which does [not contain](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2148596-genetically-modified-wheat-used-to-make-coeliac-friendly-bread/) the types of gluten which sufferers of coeliac disease find harmful.
1.3.5.2.4.3.6. Pro: By preventing [β-lactoglobulin](http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/fulltext/RDv30n1Ab203) from being produced, genetic modification of cows could help individuals with milk allergies.
1.3.5.2.4.4. Pro: GM crops have been shown to have a negative effect on the human microbiome \(gut flora\). [Horizontal gene transfer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1364539/) can alter the behavior of microbes responsible for a plethora of functions.
1.3.5.2.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.1.1.
1.3.5.2.4.5. Con: [Almost all](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-genetically-modified-food/) articles that claim that genetically modified foods are unsafe for human consumption have since been [discredited](https://www.nature.com/news/study-linking-gm-maize-to-rat-tumours-is-retracted-1.14268) by [scientists](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2016/05/gmo-safety-debate-is-over/).
1.3.5.2.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.4.1.
1.3.5.2.4.5.2. Pro: In 1998 Árpád Pusztai claimed that rats fed genetically modified potatoes experienced damage to their immune system, stunted growth and brain damage. The study has since been [discredited](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/science-pusztai-the-verdict-1071729.html).
1.3.5.2.4.5.2.1. Pro: The rats in this study were fed a diet which contained [inadequate levels of protein](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/science-pusztai-the-verdict-1071729.html), causing the rats to develop the health problems that the study falsely attributed to genetically modified potatoes.
1.3.5.2.4.5.3. Con: Scientists who publish legitimate findings that suggest harmful effects of GM foods are often instantly attacked by other, pro-GMO scientists or entities with conflicts of interest \([p. 27](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/gm-crops-battlefield-7287905)\). Thus, it is possible that many studies highlighting potential GMO health concerns are left unpublished.
1.3.5.2.4.5.3.1. Con: Papers that critique genetically modified foods which contain bad science should be refuted, otherwise they might exert a disproportionate [influence](https://www.nature.com/news/2009/090902/full/461027a.html) on public policy and opinion.
1.3.5.2.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: A campaign based on flawed science [delayed](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/golden-rice-opponents-should-be-held-accountable-for-health-problems-linked-to-vitamain-a-deficiency/) the introduction of golden rice. A large number of [preventable](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environment-and-development-economics/article/economic-power-of-the-golden-rice-opposition/F31EE0E5B6044B86B5223FF20C409158) deaths and disabilities have occurred as a result of this.
1.3.5.2.4.5.3.1.2. Pro: Dr Oz, one of the most influential doctors in America and a national TV personality, propagates [non-evidence-based](https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7346) anti-GMO information that has already significantly influenced many followers \([p. 29](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fz1oDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=dr+oz+influences+many+followers&source=bl&ots=eVmmLRT3lX&sig=ACfU3U0VPOwK6z4Ddsn5DhO9cbTl331cdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAtpWcm_3pAhUwTxUIHY5zDpwQ6AEwD3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=dr%20oz%20influences%20many%20followers&f=false)\). Without fellow doctors [decrying](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/22/dr-oz-respond-doctors-dismissal-quack-treatments) the baselessness of such claims, this influence would likely be even greater.
1.3.5.2.4.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Some believe that the villifying of figures such as Dr Oz can [martyrise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/20/the-dr-oz-truthers-who-think-hes-saving-them-from-monsantos-gmos/) their public image and circulate their controversial opinions to an even wider audience, further [increasing](https://www.iatp.org/news/crusades-unlikely-highland-martyr-jailed-gm-rebel-becomes-a-prisoner-of-conscience-as-frankenfo) their influence and perceived validity.
1.3.5.2.4.5.3.2. Pro: Evidence suggests that biotech company Syngenta pressured the [University of Berkeley](https://grist.org/food/is-extremism-in-defense-of-gm-food-a-vice/) not to give [Ignacio Chapela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacio_Chapela) tenure after he claimed that genes from GM crops could contaminate wild species, and also that biotech firm Monsanto hired a PR company to covertly [smear](https://www.monbiot.com/2002/05/14/the-fake-persuaders/) Chapela within the scientific community.
1.3.5.2.4.5.4. Pro: Greenpeace falsely claimed that the large doses of β-Carotene ingested through consumption of golden rice could have [harmful](https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-international-stateless/2013/10/08786be5-458-golden-illusion-ge-goldenrice.pdf) health effects \(p.6\), when β-Carotene is in fact [only](https://intpolicydigest.org/2014/02/18/sorry-greenpeace-golden-rice-is-a-win-for-nutrition-and-health/) split into vitamin A by the human body when required. This led to [over 100 Nobel laureates](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/30/12066826/greenpeace-gmos-nobel-laureates) calling on Greenpeace to stop their campaign.
1.3.5.2.4.5.5. Pro: There have been claims that increased consumption of genetically modified crops is linked to the increased prevalence of autism. However, there are no peer-reviewed scientific [studies](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/possible-link-autism-gmos) that support this.
1.3.5.2.4.6. Con: [Studies](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/will-gmos-hurt-my-body/) have shown that GMOs do not cause organ toxicity or other adverse health effects.
1.3.5.3. Pro: An extensive US study found [no evidence](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/05/genetically-engineered-crops-experiences-and-prospects-new-report) of a higher rate or severity of health risks associated with GMOs than with conventionally bred crops.
1.3.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.3.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.4.
1.3.5.6. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.4.
1.3.5.7. Pro: A 2018 [meta-analysis](https://www.sciencealert.com/after-two-decades-and-6-000-studies-scientists-find-gmos-in-corn-are-actually-good-for-you) of 6,000 studies across two decades concluded that GMOs pose no risk to human health.
1.3.5.8. Con: There are often significant [conflicts of interest](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919210001302) in research done on the health risks and nutritional assessment of genetically modified products.
1.3.5.8.1. Pro: A [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172317) found that there were financial conflicts of interest among the twenty invited committee members who wrote the 2016 report on genetically engineered \(GE\) crops for NASEM.
1.3.5.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.
1.3.5.8.3. Con: While this may be true, it does not prevent independent scientists from publishing findings showing GMOs are harmful to human health; that there are very few such studies published is a good indicator that GMOs do not present a health risk.
1.3.5.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.4.5.3.
1.3.5.8.4. Con: An independent analysis of the GENetic Engineering Risk Atlas \([GENERA](https://genera.biofortified.org/wp/)\) found that [over 50%](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/09/01/monsanto-shill-alert-industry-funded-gmo-research-bias-findings/) of the research on genetically modified foods has been funded by universities and governments, not biotechnology companies.
1.3.6. Con: It is contradictory to ban GMOs when there are many other provably harmful products that continue to be available on the market.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Cigarettes are still available on the market with labels despite the fact that they are proven to be [unhealthy](https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/why-quit/smoking-health-problems).
1.3.6.3. Pro: Weapons manufacturing and export is one of the [biggest](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/weapons-sales-in-2016-exceeded-the-total-gdp-of-all-but-26-of-the-worlds-nations-818241.html) industries in the world despite its facilitating of violent crime and warfare.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Fast food is legal even though it causes [obesity](https://universityhealthnews.com/daily/nutrition/fast-food-and-obesity-the-cold-hard-facts/) and other long term health problems.
1.3.7. Pro: Use of the herbicide glyphosate has dramatically [increased](https://detoxproject.org/glyphosate/whats-the-connection-between-glyphosate-and-genetically-modified-crops/) since the introduction of GM glyphosate-tolerant crops. Glyphosate can be linked to many [health problems](https://usrtk.org/pesticides/glyphosate-health-concerns/).
1.3.7.1. Con: Glyphosate has [replaced other herbicides](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/show_map.php?year=2012&map=ALACHLOR&hilo=L&disp=Alachlor), such as Alachlor, which are potentially more toxic.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6136926/) observed a strong positive association with use of Alachlor and laryngeal cancer, and a slight association with myeloid leukemia.
1.3.7.2. Con: Multiple [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705608/) linking glyphosate to numerous health risks have been discredited as unsupported by the available scientific evidence.
1.3.7.3. Pro: The recent rise in [celiac](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3945755_ITX-6-159-g001.jpg) disease correlates with the increased use of glyphosate on wheat crops and the presence of gluten proteins.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: The referenced study contains multiple flaws in its methodology and conclusions.
1.3.7.3.1.1. Pro: While the study referenced above shows correlation and argues possible mechanisms of causation, it does not prove and conclude that these mechanisms are in play.
1.3.7.3.1.2. Pro: The referenced study acknowledges other possible causes, but does not significantly investigate their impact to determine how they might instead have contributed to the rise in incidence of celiac disease.
1.3.7.3.1.3. Pro: The levels of glyphosate used in the study were thousands of times higher than those present in genetically modified foods, the latter of which are too low to alter gut bacteria \([p. 1](https://celiac.org/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-04.pdf)\).
1.3.7.3.2. Pro: The first study referenced above suggests that, for those with a genetic predisposition, the glyphosate found on genetically modified foods may exacerbate, or trigger the onset of, celiac disease \([sections 1, 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/)\).
1.3.7.3.2.1. Pro: Glyphosate destroys beneficial gut bacteria, [causing an imbalance of gut flora](https://www.ecowatch.com/can-genetically-modified-foods-trigger-gluten-sensitivity-1881829579.html). It has been suggested that such an [imbalance can lead to](https://www.viome.com/blog/why-celiac-disease-rise-answer-gut-microbiome) the onset of celiac disease.
1.3.7.4. Pro: A [study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx1001749) has shown that glyphosate-based herbicides could disturb foetal development, causing birth defects.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: In the cited study, the authors state that the results are [preliminary](http://pesticidetruths.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Reference-glyphosate-2010-00-00-Response-to-Paganelli-Allegations-Mullet.pdf) and must be confirmed.
1.3.7.5. Pro: Scientists have found a causative link between glyphosate and non-alcoholic fatty [liver disease](http://non-gmoreport.com/articles/scientists-ground-breaking-research-uncovers-new-risks-gmos-glyphosate/).
1.3.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.4.1.1.
1.3.7.6. Pro: The [WHO](https://www.who.int/)’s cancer research agency [IARC](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer/) has found glyphosate to be a probable cause of cancer.
1.3.7.6.1. Con: Several external organisations have found major [flaws](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/07/07/infographic-understanding-hazard-vs-risk-illustrates-lack-science-behind-iarcs-glyphosate-cancer-designation/) and evidence of [unreported](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/who-iarc-glyphosate/) non-carcinogenic findings in the IARC's study that may significantly affect the conclusions drawn.
1.3.7.6.1.1. Pro: [Animal studies](https://slate.com/technology/2018/01/years-of-testing-shows-glyphosate-isnt-carcinogenic.html) were the primary source of evidence for the IARC's conclusion that glyphosate may cause cancer. These animal studies were not consistent with multiple human studies.
1.3.7.6.2. Con: [Most](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/glyphosate) experts and regulatory authorities [do not](https://echa.europa.eu/-/glyphosate-not-classified-as-a-carcinogen-by-echa) classify glyphosate as a carcinogen.
1.3.7.7. Con: Glyphosate use is not intrinsically linked to GMOs, thus if it is glyphosate and not GM food that has dangerous side effects, it would be far more logical to ban glyphosate than GMOs.
1.3.7.7.1. Con: Since glyphosate use seemed to become prevalent only in conjunction with the widespread adoption of GM crops \([p. 175](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/pdf/ITX-6-159.pdf)\), it follows that if GM crops were phased out, glyphosate use would likely be reduced or eradicated along with it.
1.3.7.7.1.1. Con: There are [other key reasons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/pdf/ITX-6-159.pdf) for the global increase in glyphosate that are not entirely linked to the rise of GMOs: its perceived lack of toxicity, relatively low price \(p. 175\), and its use in the growing practices of both pre-harvest crop desiccation and ripening sugar cane \(p. 159\).
1.3.7.7.2. Pro: Glyphosate is not used only in relation to GMOs, and so banning GMOs would not prevent damage caused by glyphosate: glyphosate is [sprayed](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/genetically-engineered-foods/gmos-glyphosate-dangers/) on non-GM crops in order to dry them out before harvest.
1.3.7.7.2.1. Pro: Pre-harvest weed control using glyphosate on non-GM crops is widespread, leading to the presence of [glyphosate residue in non-GMO foods](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fda-tests-confirm-oatmeal_b_12252824?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlc3BhdGguY29tL2VuLXVzL2Jsb2cvYXJlLXlvdS1lYXRpbmctZ2x5cGhvc2F0ZS1vcmdhbmljLWZhcm1pbmctY2FuLWhlbHAv&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGeStDDg2khEh4Wz-inuwPBgoUs-75Xp4eHB_GvR4vHr95Ivupp5QE5feYze3O45eSyx-SkKKOFJgyvzZ1LoKYx6V3rFGc-h04IxLtY5zlFMkVidVCHgCictxM3eiqEtpYtvDQj6tk1AqvtAF1akmIUajki2JqYLRJh3K4T1jntI).
1.4. Pro: Genetically modified foods can be harmful to the environment and ecosystems.
1.4.1. Pro: Genetically modified crops threaten biodiversity.
1.4.1.1. Con: It is [intensive agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065250416300204) as a whole, and not specifically GMO farming, that threatens biodiversity.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.4.1.2. Con: Genetic modification can be used to prevent certain crops from becoming [extinct](https://nypost.com/2018/07/06/bananas-are-facing-extinction/), fighting against biodiversity loss.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: If a species is going extinct naturally, humans should not intervene: such [extinction](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2017/12/01/biologist-argues-that-we-dont-need-to-save-endangered-species-because-extinction-is-natural/) is a natural part of evolution.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Mass extinctions](https://www.techexplorist.com/global-warming-wiped-95-marine-life-252-million-years-ago/19253/) periodically wipe out up to 95 percent of all species in one fell swoop: these come every 50 million to 100 million years. Natural selection prunes the poorly adapted and allows the hardiest to flourish.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4.1.3. Con: GMO crops could lead to more [artificial biodiversity](https://theconversation.com/should-genetically-modified-organisms-be-part-of-our-conservation-efforts-66508) as researchers experiment with strain combinations that would otherwise not exist within nature.
1.4.1.4. Con: Natural fluctuations in biodiversity have inevitably been a contributing factor to the extinction of [99%](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/mass-extinction/) of all organisms that have ever lived on Earth. The effect caused by interactions between GMOs and their surrounding environment is similar, with older species fading away as new ones prove more able to face changing ecological challenges.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: GMOs simply [accelerate or generate](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/161011_evolutiongmo) processes of natural selection and the survival of the fittest, thus there are unlikely to be any unnatural, long-term effects on biodiversity.
1.4.1.5. Con: Genetically modified crops lead to more natural biodiversity because less agricultural space is needed for the same yield, allowing fields to stay fallow.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: If such fallow fields have previously accommodated GM crops, their soil may still contain high concentrations of herbicide or pesticide for [years](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/how-long-does-it-take-fertilizers-pesticides-herbicides-and-fungicides-break-down-soil-or-do) after, impeding natural biodiversity.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.
1.4.1.5.3. Con: [Permaculture](https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/7-small-scale-intensive-systems/) farming practices can be used to create a biodiverse, high output operation without utilizing GMO products.
1.4.1.6. Pro: The supposedly targeted insect- and pest-resistant effects of some genetically modified crops can have a much wider adverse impact on biodiversity than intended.
1.4.1.6.1. Pro: GM crops designed to kill pest insects logically cause a reduction in the number of those insects present in the local environment. This could [adversely affect](http://www.geneticallymodifiedfoods.co.uk/are-gm-foods-destroying-biodiversity.html) multiple other flora and fauna in any food chain of which those insects are a part.
1.4.1.6.2. Con: Crops can be engineered in ways that imitate very narrow-spectrum insecticides, producing, for example, the [pheromones](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/07/sexy-plants-on-track-to-replace-harmful-pesticides-to-protect-crops) specific to just one species of insect to prevent it mating.
1.4.1.6.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/20338) indicated that some insect-repelling GM crops kill not only the pest insects they were genetically modified to poison, but also a different species of insect larvae.
1.4.1.6.4. Pro: It has been demonstrated that genetically modified Bt corn containing the 'event 176' gene causes increased mortality in the Peacock butterfly population \([p. 9](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.872.6960&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.4.1.6.4.1. Con: This variety of Bt corn known as 'KnockOut' has since been [withdrawn](https://www.nature.com/news/2001/010912/full/news010913-12.html) by its manufacturer.
1.4.1.7. Pro: If genetically modified animals are released into the wild or accidentally escape, they could threaten the continued survival of their wild, non-GM counterparts.
1.4.1.7.1. Con: This can be of benefit, as in the case of mosquitoes that are genetically modifed to pass on a self-limiting gene to the wild population, thus [reducing the transmission](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/24/genetically-engineered-animals-the-five-controversial-science) of mosquito-borne diseases.
1.4.1.7.2. Pro: The accelerated growth rates of some genetically modified fish may mean they could [outcompete](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/accumulating-glitches/are_gmo_fish_safe_for/) the wild population for food if released.
1.4.1.7.2.1. Con: The general scientific consensus is that it is [not yet clear](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/accumulating-glitches/are_gmo_fish_safe_for/) whether accelerated growth rates of GM fish would increase or reduce their ability to compete with native fish in the wild.
1.4.1.7.3. Con: Measures can be [implemented](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/AGRI/Reports/RP8674228/agrirp04/agrirp04-e.pdf) to make it unlikely that genetically modified animals will reproduce with wild species \(p. 5\).
1.4.1.7.3.1. Pro: A type of fast-growing GM Atlantic salmon engineered by biotechnology company AquaBounty is [carefully contained](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/challenging-evolution-how-gmos-can-influence-genetic-diversity/) to prevent it from propagating in the wild: AquaBounty’s salmon are all female, grown in land-based tanks, and are sterile due to increased chromosome number.
1.4.1.8. Pro: Most GM crops are engineered in ways that give them a [fitness advantage](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/challenging-evolution-how-gmos-can-influence-genetic-diversity/) over non-GM plants. This may lead to the former reproductively outcompeting the latter, endangering the latter's continued survival and thus threatening biodiversity.
1.4.1.9. Pro: [Out-crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcrossing) or hybridisation can easily occur, whereby a GM crop cross-pollinates with a reproductively compatible non-GMO species. This may lead to reduced biodiversity.
1.4.1.9.1. Pro: [Pollen](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6421-wind-carries-gm-pollen-record-distances/) can travel large distances and overcome obstacles such as barrier crops, meaning it easily and indiscriminately spreads genes between conventional crops and genetically modified crops.
1.4.1.9.1.1. Pro: [Scotts Miracle-Gro](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/challenging-evolution-how-gmos-can-influence-genetic-diversity/) genetically engineered golf course grass that was resistant to herbicide. Only one year after it was planted, this herbicide-resistant gene was found in wild grass nine miles from the origin.
1.4.1.9.1.2. Con: Crops could be altered so that the pollen produced by the plant doesn't contain the modified gene \([p. 268](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kdAiDItm5_EC&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=pollen+does+not+contain+the+modified+gene&source=bl&ots=Iq6JDwe_GF&sig=ACfU3U2VvG-mw9aQ23I7TdyylqwnmF7veQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjd2PqD0f_pAhWTN8AKHYr8B6YQ6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=pollen%20does%20not%20contain%20the%20modified%20gene&f=false)\).
1.4.1.9.2. Con: Out-crossing is already a naturally-occurring and vitally beneficial phenomenon in a diverse range of land plants with [self-incompatibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11814052), encouraging the essential generation of new genotypes in plants for continued successful survival.
1.4.1.9.3. Pro: The GM crop's engineered gene may impart a [fitness advantage](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/challenging-evolution-how-gmos-can-influence-genetic-diversity/) in the hybrid species, meaning that the latter would likely begin to out-compete other natural species in its successful reproduction. This would lead to the proliferation and spread of the engineered gene throughout the overall population, reducing genetic diversity.
1.4.1.9.4. Con: Those conducting genetic modification can carefully monitor and control GM species to prevent this happening.
1.4.1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.7.3.1.
1.4.1.9.4.2. Pro: There are various existing and developing technologies for transgene containment in genetically modified crops and weeds, including maternal inheritance, male sterility, and seed sterility \([p. 2-5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471138/pdf/nihms-411968.pdf)\).
1.4.1.9.4.2.1. Con: As the above research identifies, there are [limitations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471138/) to all strategies, with no method having ever proved itself broadly effective for all crop species.
1.4.1.9.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.9.1.2.
1.4.2. Con: GM crops are often modified in ways that can make them better for the environment than their unmodified counterparts.
1.4.2.1. Con: Though GM crops typically reduce the need for multiple different herbicides, they have greatly [increased](https://www.ewg.org/agmag/2016/03/are-gmos-bad-environment) the use of [glyphosate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate), which can have immediately harmful environmental effects.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Glyphosate has been found to impact the toxicity of soil which has adverse effects on wildlife and on crop yields \([p. 1-4](https://www.soilassociation.org/media/7202/glyphosate-and-soil-health-full-report.pdf)\).
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: [Studies show](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/09/24/common-weed-killer-linked-to-bee-deaths) glyphosate found in Monsanto's [Round-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_\(herbicide\)) herbicide is directly linked to the reduction of bees.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Genetically modified crops reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilisers, and other chemical additives.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Independent field trials found that genetically modifying crops to fix atmospheric nitrogen resulted in higher crop yields while requiring [up to 60%](https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/03/02/establishing-symbiotic-nitrogen-fixation-cereals-non-legume-crops-greener-nitrogen-revolution/) less synthetic nitrogen fertiliser, thus bringing both environmental and global food security benefits.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: Using less fertilizer decreases the chances of [eutrophication](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466) occurring.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Nitrous oxide is a [powerful greenhouse gas](https://theconversation.com/meet-n2o-the-greenhouse-gas-300-times-worse-than-co2-35204) that thus contributes heavily to global warming. In the UK, agricultural nitrogen fertilizer accounts for [66%](https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/03/02/establishing-symbiotic-nitrogen-fixation-cereals-non-legume-crops-greener-nitrogen-revolution/) of nitrous oxide emissions.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.4.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.4.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.4.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.
1.4.2.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.7.5.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Farm animals can be genetically modified so as to cause less harm to the environment.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: On average per year, cows produce [70kg to 120kg](https://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2) of methane, which is a [powerful greenhouse gas](https://foodsource.org.uk/building-blocks/agricultural-methane-and-its-role-greenhouse-gas). Genetically modifying cows to emit less methane could thus greatly [reduce](http://www.thatsfarming.com/news/gentically-modern-cows) global greenhouse gas emissions.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Farmers can use [anaerobic digesters](http://adbioresources.org/about-ad/how-ad-benefits-everyone/farming) to harvest the methane produced by their livestock so that it can be used as a farm energy source.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: The manure of genetically modified [Enviropigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enviropig) contains 30%-70% less phosphorus than that of their non-GM counterparts, reducing [eutrophication](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466) caused or exacerbated by livestock manure.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Genetically modified crops need fewer scarce resources such as land and water to grow, making them more [environmentally friendly](https://medium.com/\@gmoanswers/6-ways-gmos-agriculture-environmentally-friendly-15a9262d4f8d).
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Successfully cultivating GM crops requires a greater amount of [fossil fuel energy](https://earthopensource.org/gmomythsandtruths/sample-page/5-gm-crops-impacts-farm-environment/5-14-myth-gm-crops-reduce-energy-use/).
1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: GM crops can be grown in a wider range of environments and locations \([p. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560252/pdf/f1000research-4-7021.pdf)\). This could reduce the carbon footprint associated with food transportation when crops can be produced locally.
1.4.2.4.1.2. Con: The cultivation of herbicide-tolerant GM crops has led to a reduction of 16.8 million metric tons in CO2 emissions and 6.3 billion litres in fuel use \([p. 4](http://www.vib.be/en/news/Documents/vib_fact_genetisch%20gewijzigde%20gewassen_ENG_2016_LR.pdf)\).
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.4.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.5.
1.5. Pro: Many people are against genetically modified food. Where they constitute a significant public opposition, this should be reflected accordingly in the law.
1.5.1. Con: Even if based on a public vote, a blanket ban of GMOs could infringe upon the rights and freedoms of the individual.
1.5.1.1. Pro: For those who do not vote or else vote against a ban, to create a law forbidding GMOs would be a form of [harmful](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/maybe-its-just-me/201303/whats-wrong-paternalism-and-the-nanny-state) [paternalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/) that removes individual bodily [autonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2156058/).
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Governments are [obligated](http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/) to protect their citizens. Thus, if GMOs were found to be harmful, governments would have a duty to ban them regardless of public opinion.
1.5.1.2. Pro: People should be able to choose what to buy by [voting with their money](https://www.ecowatch.com/how-to-vote-with-your-wallet-1882010161.html).
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Some countries, such as [Canada](http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/labelling/food-labelling-for-industry/method-of-production-claims/genetically-engineered-foods/eng/1333373177199/1333373638071), have voluntary labelling laws, so people don't necessarily know what they are choosing.
1.5.2. Pro: Numerous [ethical concerns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078015/#__sec7title) surrounding the genetic modification of animals have led [animal welfare groups](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2014/08/six-reasons-why-gm-animals-are-a-bad-thing) to oppose this.
1.5.2.1. Con: This only justifies banning GM animals, not plants, the latter of which constitutes the large majority of GM foods currently consumed.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The first ever genetically modified animal approved for human consumption - GM salmon - only passed the vetting process in 2015, and constitutes just [0.05%](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kbx3jv/the-fda-just-approved-the-worlds-first-genetically-modified-meat) of the Atlantic salmon eaten in America every year.
1.5.2.2. Con: Genetic modification of animals could, in some cases, be more ethical than allowing animal agriculture to continue as it is currently.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: In some cases, genetic modification of animals is undertaken to [reduce the pain and distress](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19shriver.html) of farm animals.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Genetically modifying dairy cows to be [born without horns](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216542) would avoid the need to [dehorn](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/factory-farming/cows/dairy-industry/dehorning/) them, a farming practice often carried out without analgesia or anaesthesia.
1.5.2.2.1.2. Con: This technology is still in its experimental infancy and, as such, [has yet to be proven](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19shriver.html) to work on larger mammals.
1.5.2.2.1.3. Pro: Genetically modifying pigs to be immune to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome \([PRRS](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/20/scientists-genetically-engineer-pigs-immune-to-costly-disease)\) can prevent them from suffering breathing difficulties, miscarriages, and premature death.
1.5.2.2.1.4. Pro: The pig is one of the few mammals unable to use [thermogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenesis) to protect itself from the cold. When [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) was used to incorporate the gene required for this into pig embryos, the pigs born enjoyed better body temperature regulation and [lower mortality](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/10/23/559060166/crispr-bacon-chinese-scientists-create-genetically-modified-low-fat-pigs) rates.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Genetically modifying farm animals to reduce their risk of contracting [disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16110895) is an ethical practice.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Outbreaks of disease among livestock can lead to farmers having no choice but to kill large numbers of infected animals to prevent further transmission. Genetic modification for disease resistance would avoid these deaths.
1.5.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Foot and mouth disease and mad cow disease resulted in [millions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35581830) of animals being killed in order to limit the spread of infections \([p.3239](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2817163/pdf/rspb20090427.pdf)\).
1.5.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: The number of cattle in the UK that had to be slaughtered because of outbreaks of Bovine Tuberculosis [increased](http://www.thebreaker.co.uk/environment/2018/02/22/tb-cattle-cullings-highest-in-2017/) from around 39,000 in 2016 to 43,000 in 2017. Genetically modifying cattle to create [TB resistance](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38810073) could prevent these deaths from occurring.
1.5.2.2.2.2. Con: Animal [vaccines](https://www.noah.co.uk/briefingdocument/vaccination-farm-animals/), [antibiotics](https://www.farmantibiotics.org/), and other medicines can often effectively prevent or resolve infections.
1.5.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Genetic modification is [preferable](https://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D1949.PDF) to giving livestock antibiotics, since it avoids the risk of bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics with excessive or inappropriate use \(p. 276\).
1.5.2.2.2.3. Pro: Genetic modification to prevent livestock becoming ill is ethical because it reduces the risk of [zoonotic](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html) infections being [transmitted](https://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D1949.PDF) to human beings \(p. 276\).
1.5.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: [Genetically modified chickens](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/archive/2011/gm-chickens-that-dont-transmit-bird-flu-developed) have been developed that prevent outbreaks of bird flu within poultry flocks, and lower the chances of new strains of flu being transmitted to humans.
1.5.2.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.1.3.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Animals that are genetically modified often experience pain and distress.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Animals can also experience pain and distress as a result of selective breeding.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: The [Belgian Blue](https://www.google.se/search?q=belgian+blue&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjm3b365szeAhXhp4sKHY8TBVAQ_AUIDigB&biw=1920&bih=938) cow is the result of [mutation-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myostatin#Double_muscled_cattle) breeding. The resultant and extreme double-muscling of these cows can cause many [serious health problems](https://www.peta.org/blog/belgian-blue-cattle/) for them.
1.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: As a result of intensive breeding to select animals with increased muscle mass, pigs can suffer from the stress-induced condition, porcine stress syndrome \(PSS\) \([p. 51](https://www.nap.edu/read/10977/chapter/5#51)\).
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Genetic modification of animals typically entails invasive and painful surgical procedures for the 'first generation' \([p. 546](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078015/pdf/cvj_05_544.pdf)\).
1.5.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.1.
1.5.2.3.4. Pro: Pigs that were genetically modified to grow faster were found to be [arthritic, partially blind, and infertile](https://www.yourgenome.org/debates/is-it-ethical-to-genetically-modify-farm-animals-for-agriculture) as a result of the human growth hormone introduced into their genome.
1.5.3. Pro: Genetic modification is opposed by the public in a number of democratic countries.
1.5.3.1. Pro: A 2018 [nationwide survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0018-4.pdf) indicates that a much larger percentage of Chinese citizens have a negative view of GMOs than an actively positive one \(p. 1\).
1.5.3.2. Pro: The majority of people in the [United States](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97567&page=1) believe that genetically modified food is unsafe.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Recent public opinion in the United States is [mixed](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/01/public-opinion-about-genetically-modified-foods-and-trust-in-scientists-connected-with-these-foods/) and cannot be fairly characterised as anti-GMO.
1.5.3.3. Con: There is growing support for genetically modified foods in the [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dramatic-change-as-two-thirds-now-support-gm-crop-testing-7973432.html).
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.5.5. Con: Governments are not obligated to act upon majority opinion.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Public opinion is sometimes [misinformed](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7662) and not supported by factual evidence. It would therefore be imprudent to make legislation banning GMOs based on pubic opinion.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: A prolific former anti-GMO activist publicly [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/09/mark-lynas-truth-treachery-gm) that the anti-GMO movement was based on a foundation of problematic misguidance and corruption.
1.5.5.1.2. Con: The same could be said of any politician or government.
1.5.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.6.4.1.1.
1.5.5.1.3. Pro: Many [nations](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070218134322.htm#:~:text=Approximately%2028%20percent%20of%20American,1990s%2C%20according%20to%20Miller's%20research.) have insufficient numbers of scientifically literate people within their population. If the population is scientifically illiterate, it would be unwise to give weight to their opinions on scientific topics when law-making.
1.5.5.1.3.1. Pro: Expert [analysis](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/7/4/824/5828268) suggests that Chinese media outlets and scientific research institutions do not effectively propagate objective and accessible scientific information to the Chinese public, leading to a widespread problem of both scientific misinformation and illiteracy.
1.5.5.1.4. Pro: As income level and education level rise, people are [more supportive](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/gmo-poll-education_n_570ea20de4b0ffa5937e0124) of GMOs. This suggests that it is specifically the less well-informed and -educated in society who are the main opponents of GMOs.
1.5.5.1.4.1. Pro: Education allows people to better understand the [science](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2019/01/study-suggests-science-education-improves-attitudes-gmo-food/) of GMOs, preventing them from readily believing sensationalist or false claims.
1.5.5.1.4.2. Con: In a democracy, a person's level of education does not make their views more or less valid: it is, rather, which opinion forms the majority that matters.
1.5.5.2. Pro: In states that are [representative democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy), elected representatives are not required to always follow majority opinion.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: The state's primary obligation is to ensure [citizens' welfare](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/). This obligation is more important than deferring to what citizens may or may not want.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: While governments should generally heed public opinion, decision making should be driven by expert opinion.
1.5.5.2.2.1. Pro: Politicians often [do not possess](http://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/20/top-20-things-politicians-need-to-know-about-science) the skills to effectively interpret and analyse science. It makes no sense to give them ultimate control in regards to the public's private decision on what to eat.
1.5.5.2.2.2. Con: Experts are not exempt from bias, and may be funded and/or influenced by industries that [profit from](https://www.nap.edu/read/23395/chapter/1#xiii) \(p.xiv\) genetically modified crops.
1.5.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Many former corporate biotechnology associates and lobbyists have been appointed to [high level advisory roles](https://www.globalresearch.ca/monsanto-controls-both-the-white-house-and-the-us-congress/533642) in the food and agricultural departments of the US government.
1.5.5.3. Con: Since public opinion has political influence in democratic societies, [most governments](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/21/do-the-rich-call-the-shots-13/dont-underestimate-the-power-of-public-opinion) in such states tend to respond to public majority demands even though this is not an obligation.
1.5.6. Pro: Many religious communities are against the genetic modification of food.
1.5.6.1. Con: Many [Islamic scholars](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741429/) say that genetically modified foods are theologically permissible.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: The Islamic Jurisprudence Council \(IJC\) and The Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America \(IFANCA\) have stated that genetically modified foods are [halal](http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/halal.html).
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Islam [permits](http://www.muslimamerican.com/gmos-the-islamic-perspective/) genetically modified foods because they can be used to prevent world hunger and to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: The prophet Muhammad observed farmers crossbreeding date plants. Initially he told them to stop, but yields decreased. In response, the prophet told the farmers to restart crossbreeding. This is cited by Muslims who support GM foods as it demonstrates that Muhammad did not oppose 'interfering with nature' so long as it [benefits humanity](http://www.muslimamerican.com/gmos-the-islamic-perspective/).
1.5.6.1.3. Con: Some Islamic scholars state that genetically modified foods which contain genes from [haram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haram) species are [not](http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/religion/halal.html) theologically permitted.
1.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.1.3.
1.5.6.3. Con: Many Jewish scholars state that genetically modified foods are theologically [permitted](http://www.jcpa.org/art/jep2.htm).
1.5.6.3.1. Pro: Many Jewish philosophers and scholars have noted that, based on the Jewish law of [halacha](https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-698X-9-18), GMOs are permissible if they are not directly prohibited by God and their existence will benefit mankind.
1.5.6.3.2. Pro: Even when genetically modified foods contain genes from non-kosher species such as pigs, most rabbanic authorities still consider GM foods to be [kosher](http://www.jcpa.org/art/jep2.htm), as the genetic material exists in such small quantities.
1.5.6.3.3. Con: The medieval Jewish scholar [Nachmanides](https://forward.com/food/176162/are-gmos-kosher/) believed that interfering with the work of God was equivalent to denying God as a creator.
1.5.6.3.4. Con: The organisation [Natural Food Certifiers](https://nfccertification.com/about-us/) \(NFC\) does not consider genetically modified foods to be [Kosher.](https://nfccertification.com/kosher-certification/)
1.5.6.3.4.1. Pro: According to the NFC's [founder](https://forward.com/food/176162/are-gmos-kosher/), a Torah-based law gives instruction to ‘guard your health’. Owing to the health concerns surrounding GMOs, these cannot, therefore, be considered Kosher.
1.5.6.3.5. Con: Judaism permits humanity to alter the natural world so long as these alterations "bring the world closer to perfection and not further away". Thus if genetically modified foods cause more harm than good, they would be [forbidden](http://www.jcpa.org/art/jep2.htm) by Judaism.
1.5.6.4. Con: Many Christian scholars have argued that genetically modified foods are permissible.
1.5.6.4.1. Pro: The Vatican expressed approval of genetic engineering in 1999, [stating](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/nov/28/food.gm) that it "\[could not\] agree with the position of some groups that say it is against the will of God to meddle with the genetic make-up of plants and animals".
1.5.6.4.2. Pro: [Genesis 1:25-26](http://Genesis 1:25-26) suggests that humanity has the right to alter animals and plants according to its own needs.
1.5.6.4.3. Con: [Genesis 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A15&version=NIV) suggests that humans have [a duty of care](http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/gmo.pdf) towards the earth and towards other species \([p. 4](http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/gmo.pdf)\), including showing respect for the 'distinct nature' of each of God's creations.
1.5.6.4.4. Con: The principle of the 'good neighbor' - derived from the parable of the [Good Samaritan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan) - instructs Christians to avoid acts or omissions which could harm their neighbor \([p. 4](http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/gmo.pdf)\). Some churches thus believe that an evaluation of the potential indirect long-term effects of GM crops on the health, environment and society of others is required before these can be readily accepted.
1.5.6.4.5. Con: Christians reject the utilitarian view of [other species](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A24-25&version=NIV) as 'merely' resources to be used by humanity. God’s creations have intrinsic value, and genetic modification promotes a reductive and disrespectful view of them \([p. 4](http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/gmo.pdf)\).
1.5.6.4.6. Pro: Humans were [condemned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man) to Earth as punishment for having sinned in paradise. Genetic modification is thus viewed by some Christians not as an attempt to 'play God', but as a [means](https://petersonfarmblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/my-perspective-as-a-christian-on-gmos/) to work with the deliberately challenging environment.
1.5.6.5. Pro: Some religious institutions often view massive scientific advances, including the creation of GMOs, as evidence of humans sinfully '[playing God](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/05/07/playing-god-many-faiths-agree-that-tinkering-with-genes-is-out-of-bounds/)'.
1.5.6.5.1. Con: The opposition of religious institutions to science is an [outdated misconception](https://newrepublic.com/article/122016/catholic-church-not-enemy-science): most popular religions now greatly support scientific advances.
1.5.6.5.1.1. Pro: The Catholic church has a [long history](https://www.chicagocatholic.com/vatican/-/article/2018/07/05/church-has-long-history-of-supporting-science) of supporting scientific advancements.
1.5.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: There are [many](https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/science/catholic-contributions/the-church-opposes-science-the-myth-of-catholic-irrationality.html) staunch Catholics who have made great scientific contributions.
1.5.6.5.1.2. Pro: Islamic civilisations have a [rich history](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/26/baghdad-centre-of-scientific-world) of supporting science and being [hubs](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/cross-cultural-diffusion-of-knowledge/a/the-golden-age-of-islam) of knowledge.
1.5.6.5.1.3. Con: [62%](https://www.cabi.org/agbiotechnet/news/523) of Evangelical Christians oppose argricultural biotechnology.
1.5.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.5.1.3.
1.5.6.7. Pro: Some within the Jewish community oppose GMOs on the basis of ancient Jewish scholars.
1.5.6.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.3.3.
1.5.6.8. Con: [More than half](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/14/more-than-half-of-countries-are-democratic/) of all countries are [democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy) and many of these are [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state), meaning that they would be unlikely to accommodate such religious perspectives when deciding on national law.
1.5.7. Pro: The [food](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/how-does-food-impact-health) people eat has a significant impact on their health. Any factors that influence food choices must therefore be decided by the general public in democratic states.
1.6. Con: Genetically modified crops can work towards mitigating world hunger and nutritional deficiencies.
1.6.1. Pro: Crops are often genetically modified in ways that allow for increased crop yields, increasing the amount of food that the world is able to produce.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Introducing [dwarf genes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/secret-of-high-yield-crop-gene-identified-1106672.html) into genetically modified crops reduces the height of crops, increasing the amount of nutrients available for grain production. This can increase yields.
1.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.
1.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.2.
1.6.1.5. Con: There are ways to increase crop yield that do not involve genetic modification.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: The process of [aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics) has been shown to [increase](https://vigyanashram.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aquaponics-farming-techniquc.pdf) crop yield.
1.6.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.3.
1.6.1.6. Pro: Genetically modified crops are often more resistant to disease, weeds and pests, which helps to [prevent](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2016/05/17/scientists-say-gmo-foods-are-safe-public-skepticism-remains/) crop losses due to these factors.
1.6.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.6.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.6.1.7. Pro: Genetic modification enables crop growth in previously unfavorable locations \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560252/pdf/f1000research-4-7021.pdf)\), increasing the amount of arable land worldwide.
1.6.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.5.1.
1.6.1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.5.2.
1.6.1.7.3. Pro: Inserting antifreeze genes from cold water fish into crops such as potatoes can increase the ability of crops to tolerate cold temperatures \([p. 67](https://www.farmingsmarter.com/wp-content/files/2017/08/Duman-antifreeze-proteins-for-frost-in-crops-2014.pdf)\).
1.6.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.5.3.
1.6.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.
1.6.2. Con: The world already produces [enough food](https://www.nature.com/articles/35005264) to feed the global population. Equitable distribution of existing non-modified food supplies paired with food waste reduction is thus a more logical long-term solution to world hunger.
1.6.2.1. Pro: There has been a global [surplus](https://www.dw.com/en/the-global-food-surplus/a-15452289) of food for the past five decades.
1.6.2.2. Pro: There has been a significant global increase in efforts by large commercial sectors to [redistribute food](http://www.fruitnet.com/fpj/article/176128/food-redistribution-gets-govt-boost​) in order to reduce food waste and therefore mass undernourishment. This suggests that these issues are agreed to be the most central to solving the world hunger problem.
1.6.2.3. Con: Solving world hunger via food waste reduction can be [facilitated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gmoanswers/2016/11/18/gmos-help-reduce-food-waste/#5e9abf7443bc) by GMO farming.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: GMOs designed to have a longer shelf life are easier to preserve and [transport over long distances](https://vittana.org/12-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-genetically-modified-foods), thereby facilitating global food redistribution.
1.6.2.4. Pro: Limiting food waste globally is [key](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/09/16/food-waste-a-key-to-ending-world-hunger/#375809ae4865) to solving world hunger, potentially reducing the need for more food production by 60%.
1.6.2.4.1. Pro: If less than a quarter of the food thrown away in Europe, the UK, and the USA were redistributed to those in need, 1 billion people could be [lifted out](https://www.tristramstuart.co.uk/food-waste-facts/) of malnourishment.
1.6.2.5. Con: There are barriers to successful and effective food redistribution and food waste reduction. GMOs offer an alternative solution where these fail.
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: In the UK, a survey of 218 charities involved in redistributing surplus food found that these organisations are being prevented from successfully redistributing more due to a [lack of essential infrastructure and storage](https://resource.co/article/survey-reveals-what-s-holding-back-uk-food-redistribution-11224).
1.6.2.5.2. Pro: The CEO of UK-based food redistribution charity [FareShare](https://fareshare.org.uk/) noted that demand for surplus food is still [far outstripping supply](https://resource.co/article/charities-urgent-need-surplus-food-action-11167) due to a lack of further food company partners and volunteers: the organisation has long waiting lists for all 20 of their regional redistribution centres.
1.6.2.5.3. Pro: Effective and large-scale food redistribution often relies on government backing that is not always in place.
1.6.2.5.3.1. Pro: The UK Food Waste Reduction Bill, which would have legally obliged supermarkets to donate unsold food to redistribution charities, was ultimately [unsuccessful](https://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/food-waste-bill-misses-parliamentary-slot/).
1.6.2.6. Con: While we may produce enough food now, the United Nations [predicts](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/from-corgis-to-corn-a-brief-look-at-the-long-history-of-gmo-technology/) that by 2050, humans will need to produce 70% more food than we currently do in order to adequately feed the global population. It seems logical that multiple strategies should be put in place to meet this demand.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.6.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.2.1.
1.6.5. Con: The World Bank sponsored [IAASTD Report](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/Investment/Agriculture_at_a_Crossroads_Global_Report_IAASTD.pdf), one of the most comprehensive reports on the future of agriculture, did not endorse GMOs as a solution to world hunger.
1.6.5.1. Con: While genetically modified crops alone may not resolve world hunger, they nonetheless constitute a [significant tool](https://www.popsci.com/article/science/core-truths-10-common-gmo-claims-debunked/) to improve food security for the rapidly growing world population.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.6.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.6.7. Pro: According to the World Food Programme, 1 in 9 people are [undernourished](http://www.foodaidfoundation.org/world-hunger-statistics.html) worldwide.
