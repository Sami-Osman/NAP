Discussion Name: Should religion be involved in politics?

1. Religion should be involved in politics.
1.1. Pro: The involvement of religion in politics is necessary to ensure laws and policies are ethical.
1.1.1. Pro: Religion provides moral guidance, while politics provides the decision-making framework to implement it.
1.1.1.1. Con: There are many non-religious ideologies that have moral elements.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Soviet Union codified a set of moral rules relevant [at all levels, from political to interpersonal](https://soviethistory.msu.edu/1961-2/moral-code-of-the-builder-of-communism/)(The “Moral Code of the Builder of Communism,” its compilers asserted, was superior to all other ethical systems. Presented as part of the official program at the twenty-second Communist Party Congress in 1961, the code consisted of twelve tenets. First and foremost was “devotion to the Communist cause, love toward the Socialist Motherland and to Socialist countries.” The remaining eleven principles were meant to govern human relations on all levels, from international to interpersonal.).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Capitalism has been described as a [secular religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_religion), as its economic theory has [intrinsically moral, quasi-theological elements](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/assets/pdf/SER/2012/Capitalism%20as%20Religion.pdf)(...thinkers from various fields of studies including anthropology, sociology, philosophy and even economists such as Fogel, laureate of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993, acknowledge that capitalism and economics convey religious or theological dimensions.).
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Fascism has a number of moral and ethical ideals, such as [patriotism and fascist 'moral virtue'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_and_ideology)(Fascist opposition to capitalism was based on the perceived decadence, hedonism and cosmopolitanism of the wealthy, in contrast to the idealized discipline, patriotism and moral virtue of the members of the middle classes.).
1.1.1.1.4. Con: As religion and politics both concern themselves with ethical and moral judgement, it is impossible to fully separate the two.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Religious institutions do not have the power to create legally binding rules in most societies. Only the political system can create such laws.
1.1.2. Con: The values involved in politics should stand on their own, without necessary subscription to a belief system in order to be deemed valuable
1.1.2.1. Pro: Laws based on religious beliefs rather than ethical ones aren't justice at all. Theocracies are authoritarian, and they disregard the masses. When religion is used to justify morally incorrect political ideas, it becomes a problem.
1.1.3. Pro: Politics are driven by the beliefs of the population. If a significant portion of the population subscribes to a belief system then it is already in some form involved.
1.1.4. Con: Compared to religion, using philosophy is a better approach to formulate ethical principles for politics, without involving dogmas.
1.1.5. Con: The blending of politics and religion has been detrimental to the country because it blurs the borders between what is and is not acceptable.
1.1.6. Con: Religion may support political actions that are not valuable or harmful to individuals outside of its community.
1.1.6.1. Con: One societal group can support political actions that are harmful to those outside the group, even in a democracy. This is not limited to religion.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The racist [Jim Crow laws](https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws)(im Crow laws were a collection of state and local statutes that legalized racial segregation. Named after a Black minstrel show character, the laws—which existed for about 100 years, from the post-Civil War era until 1968—were meant to marginalize African Americans by denying them the right to vote, hold jobs, get an education or other opportunities. Those who attempted to defy Jim Crow laws often faced arrest, fines, jail sentences, violence and death.) were supported by white lawmakers in the US, despite harming POC.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Many religions treat non-believers differently, which is problematic in societies where equality is valued.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Jizyah is a tax levied on [non-Muslims by Muslim governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya)(Jizya ... is a per capita yearly taxation historically levied in the form of financial charge on dhimmis, that is, permanent non-Muslim subjects of a state governed by Islamic law.).
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Jewish law makes the [distinction between Jews and non-Jews](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-non-jew-in-jewish-law/)(Jewish law tries to separate Jews from gentiles, in order to prevent Jews from adopting idolatrous behaviors.), and [discourages interaction](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-non-jew-in-jewish-law/)(There are exceptions and loopholes, but the general force is to discourage interaction between Jews and non-Jews.) between the two groups.
1.1.6.2.3. Con: If believers of one faith are given more rights than others, then it would encourage people to convert to the most legally beneficial faith, harming free choice and religious freedom.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Con: The Quran teaches that there is [no compulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baqara_256#Text_and_meaning)(There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.) in religion, and that nobody can be forced to follow a certain faith.
1.1.6.3. Pro: [Absolute morality](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z9c4srd/revision/2) is an extremely common concept in monotheistic religions. Religious beliefs can and have influenced legislation predicated on faith in a moral framework.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Whilst no religion is \(lawfully\) mandated in Saudi Arabia, it is a religious theocracy which restricts the practice of religions other than Islam.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: This is inherently un-Islamic, as the Qur'an strongly supports freedom of [choice and religion](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/religious-freedom-in-islam/10419798)(The Qur'an emphasises free choice. "The truth \[has now come\] from your Sustainer: Let, then, him who wills, believe in it, and let him who wills, reject it," it says \(18:29\). And also: "Whoever chooses to follow the right path follows it but for his own good; and whoever goes astray goes but astray to his own hurt" \(17:15\). Resoundingly, the Qur'an declares that "there shall be no coercion in matters of faith" \(2:256\). Belief is an individual choice ― or, rather, it is a choice involving the individual and God.).
1.1.7. Con: Religion creates divides in the people, and often leads to viewing those outside the community as lesser or not deserving.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Many so-called religious individuals reduce God to something little, petty, and intolerant.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Religion has been a significant contributor to [homophobia](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2018.1522809) around the world.
1.2. Pro: Many countries have deeply religious histories and cultures.
1.2.1. Pro: According to the Pew research center, [43 countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/)(Among the 43 countries with official state religions, only three – all in Europe – meet these criteria: Liechtenstein, Malta and Monaco.) worldwide have an official state religion.
1.2.1.1. Pro: [Four-in-ten countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/pf_10-04-17_statereligions-00/) worldwide have an official or preferred religion.
1.2.1.2. Con: [106 countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/pf_10-04-17_statereligions-03/) worldwide have no official or preferred religion, making them the majority.
1.2.2. Con: Just because something is traditional or popular does not mean that it is beneficial.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Gender roles are often traditional and popular, yet they are regarded as a contributor to [gender inequality](https://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/how-gender-norms-impact-boys-and-girls). Given that many gender roles have [religious foundations](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0202.xml), limiting religious expression would rectify some of these inequities.
1.2.2.2. Con: Challenging what is traditional or popular can be counterproductive as it can lead to opposition or backlash. For this reason, maintaining the status quo might be prudent.
1.2.3. Con: Modern history has become increasingly secular, and many new countries do not have a religious foundation.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Turkey has secularism enshrined within its [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_Turkey#Constitutional_principles)(The Constitution asserts that Turkey is supposed to be a secular and democratic republic, deriving its sovereignty from the people. The sovereignty rests with the Turkish Nation, who delegates its exercise to an elected unicameral parliament, the Turkish Grand National Assembly. Moreover, \n\nArticle 4: declares the immovability the founding principles of the Republic defined in the first three Articles:\n\n 1. "secularism, social equality, equality before the law").
1.2.3.2. Pro: France is outwardly a secular nation, and passed a law in 1905 ensuring the [separation of church and state](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/france-facts/secularism-and-religious-freedom-in-france-63815/article/secularism-and-religious-freedom-in-france)("France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic, guaranteeing that all citizens regardless of their origin, race or religion are treated as equals before the law and respecting all religious beliefs" states the Constitution of 1958. The “freedom to practice religion” has been recognised since 1905 when the Law on the Separation of the Church and State \(la loi sur la séparation de l’Église et de l’État\) came into effect.).
1.2.3.3. Con: In recent times, some countries, like [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution)(The Iranian Revolution 1978-79 ... also known as the Islamic Revolution ... was a series of events that culminated in the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the replacement of his government with an Islamic republic under the rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a leader of one of the factions in the revolt. The revolution was supported by various leftist and Islamist organizations.), have returned to their religious roots.
1.2.3.4. Pro: In the Philippines, [Article II, Section 6](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Philippines_1987?lang=en) of the 1987 Constitution requires separation of the church and state, so religion and politics should not be blended.
1.2.4. Pro: The USA was founded on religious beliefs.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The overwhelming [majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)(Christians represent 65% of the total adult population, 43% identifying as Protestants, 20% as Catholics, and 2% as Mormons.) of the US population hold religious beliefs. If the US was a true democracy representative of it's people, it religion would be involved in politics.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The US constitution guarantees [freedom of religion](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/)(Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.).
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: If politicians are not able to act in a way that coincides with their religious beliefs, then they are being stripped of their inalienable right to practice their religion.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Freedom of an individual to practice a religion is not the same as involving religion in legislature that applies to the masses.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: What the Constitution says has no bearing on whether something "should" be. Its purpose is to serve as a basis for the Law, not a moral guidebook as the Bible is for Christians.
1.2.4.2.4. Con: Freedom of religion includes the freedom to not subscribe to one.
1.2.4.3. Con: Past value in religious beliefs does not concern the value in those beliefs today
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Religious beliefs are not a think of the past. Only [26% of the US population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)(Christians represent 65% of the total adult population, 43% identifying as Protestants, 20% as Catholics, and 2% as Mormons. People with no formal religious identity form 26% of the total population.) identify as having no formal religious identity.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Allowing the foundations of a state to dictate the present and future governance of the people limits innovation and change, violating the concept of a [living constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution)(I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.).
1.3. Con: The involvement of religion in politics would prove detrimental to all religions other than the dominant one claiming monopoly over the truth.
1.3.1. Pro: Religion shouldn't be allowed in politics because every religion cannot be true.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Many religions claim to have a [monopoly on truth](https://www.scientifique-en-chef.gouv.qc.ca/en/impacts-of-research-cat/lapparition-du-monopole-de-la-verite/)(At the heart of religion lies the certainty of possessing absolute truth, an understanding of world order and the place occupied by humans within it.), meaning that multiple religions cannot be true or correct at once.
1.3.1.2. Pro: If one religion was allowed to become dominant in a society, and it turned out that another religion was true, then all of society risks divine condemnation or punishment.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: In the Old Testament, the Abrahamic God destroys the cities of [Sodom and Gomorrah](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sodom-and-Gomorrah)(Sodom and Gomorrah, notoriously sinful cities in the biblical book of Genesis, destroyed by “sulfur and fire” because of their wickedness \(Genesis 19:24\).) for their sins.
1.3.1.3. Con: Democracy doesn't mandate that beliefs are true, merely that the beliefs of the population should be represented
1.3.1.4. Con: Religion's involvement in politics does not need to be premised on its truth, but rather its social and cultural importance.
1.3.2. Con: Allowing the involvement of religion in politics does not limit involvement to only one religion. In a democratic system, members of all faiths could express their religion in politically.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Those of no religion, such as agnostics or atheists could also elect politicians who reflect their views on religion. Allowing religion in politics only increases democratic expression.
1.3.3. Con: It is unlikely that only one religion would become involved in politics, as many modern societies consist of multiple [religious groups](http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/regions/europe)(Roughly three-quarters of Europeans are Christians \(75%\), almost one-in-five do not identify with any religion \(18%\), and about 6% are Muslims. Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, followers of folk or traditional religions, and adherents of other religions each make up less than 1% of Europe’s total population.), who could each have political influence.
1.3.3.1. Con: The US constitution is built on [Biblical principles](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/351540-liberty-under-law-was-always-rooted-in-biblical-principles/). It does not include principles from other religions.
1.3.4. Pro: In the past, governmental structures were able to corrupt original meanings conveyed in holy books for self-serving, political, and influence-boosting purposes.
1.3.5. Con: Instead of seeking to remove any religion, safeguards should be enshrined and enforced to negate any one religion from having its way.
1.3.6. Pro: People have significantly lesser control over their government than over religion \(e.g., they can leave the faith or convert\). Therefore, to ensure neutrality, religion should not influence government actions, which would be binding on all people, regardless of their religious affiliation.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.3.8. Pro: Religion shouldn't be a deciding factor in government for people who are not religious.
1.3.8.1. Con: [84% of the global population identify with a religious group](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/27/religion-why-is-faith-growing-and-what-happens-next)(Faith is on the rise and 84% of the global population identifies with a religious group.). Religion should be involved in politics in order to better represent the majority, who are religious.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: Identifying as a religious group does not mean that an individual is religious. In some places, religion is an [ethnic identifier, with no content or belief involved](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0038038506069854)(Religion as an Ethnic Marker\nIt is where religion provides the labels of identity, but no content or values.).
1.3.8.2. Pro: Citizens are becoming [increasingly non-religious](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/04/america-politics-religion/618072/). This should be reflected in global political systems.
1.4. Con: Involving religion in politics is antithetical to the principles of a secular democratic society.
1.4.1. Pro: Many religions include provisions that relate to personal matters and minority groups, which would violate the rights of privacy and self-expression if made into law.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Many religions are critical of homosexuality and same-sex marriage.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: All major Islamic schools [disapprove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion#Islam)(All of the major Islamic schools disapprove of homosexuality. Islam views same-sex desires as an unnatural temptation, and sexual relations are seen as a transgression of the natural role and aim of sexual activity.) of homosexuality.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Torah states that [homosexuality is a sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_homosexuality)(The subject of homosexuality and Judaism dates back to the Torah. The book of Vayikra \(Leviticus\) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a to'eivah \(something abhorred or detested\) that can be subject to capital punishment by the currently non-existent Sanhedrin under halakha \(Jewish law\).), and could be subject to capital punishment.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Many modern Jewish authorities accept gay people, and [permit same-sex marriages](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2012/12/07/religious-groups-official-positions-on-same-sex-marriage/)(The Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements have supported gay and lesbian rights, including same-sex marriage, since the mid-1990s. In June 2012, the Conservative Jewish movement approved a ceremony to allow same-sex couples to marry.).
1.4.1.1.3. Con: The interpretive nature of many religions and religious texts means that opinions on homosexuality and same-sex marriage can vary greatly from congregation to congregation.
1.4.2. Pro: Although someone may not agree with an idea of a politician, they may feel restricted to support them because their religion is same.
1.4.3. Con: Religion is a [identifier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128172049000159)(Religion is often a defining feature of the personal and social selves, with both individual and collective outcomes.) for many in society. To deny any inclusion of the beliefs of a group is anti-democratic.
1.4.3.1. Con: Secularism \(the separation of religion and politics\) is still compatible with democracy.
1.4.4. Pro: The intertwining of religion and politics has the potential to give rise to totalitarian theocracies.
1.4.5. Pro: Separation of the state from religion allows the two actors to objectively monitor and regulate how each other functions.
1.4.5.1. Con: The separation of church and state is beneficial because it allows the opposite to happen: the [state cannot interfere in religion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Separation-of-church-and-state)(The first, as implied in the Constitution of the United States, was supported by a tendency to leave to the church, set free from state supervision, a maximum freedom in the realization of its spiritual, moral, and educational tasks. In the United States, for example, a comprehensive church school and educational system has been created by the churches on the basis of this freedom, and numerous colleges and universities have been founded by churches.), nor can [religion interfere in the operation of the state](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Separation-of-church-and-state)(The separation of church and state by the French Revolution and later in the Soviet Union and the countries under the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence was based upon an opposite tendency. The attempt was ... to restrict the public role of the church ...).
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: If the church and state are truly separate, then they cannot interact and regulate each other.
1.4.6. Con: Many politicians are religious. Thus, instead of feigning objectivity, it would be more prudent to encourage politicians to be more transparent about their religious beliefs and implications for governance.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Enabling politicians to be open about their religious beliefs would lead to better democratic expression, as voters can vote for candidates that more accurately reflect their ethical and religious views.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Many people in the US currently view their elected officials as [dishonest](http://xhttps://rdi.org/reflections-on-honest-abe-the-degradation-of-trust-and-the-need-to-renew-political-integrity/)(Despite the clear enthusiasm for political integrity, a 2015 report found that only 8% of Americans think that the term “honest” suitably describes our elected officials. On top of that, three-quarters of Americans believe that elected officials put their own interests before that of their constituents.). Allowing them to be open about their religious convictions and motivations would improve this.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: Politicians should be chosen by their character and talent, not their religious views.
1.4.6.2. Pro: It is impossible to separate religion \(belief in a higher power\) from politics \(people governing others\), if the people and the belief are a package deal.
1.4.6.3. Con: Separating religion from politics doesn't mean that wisdom can't be extracted from religion, merely that ethically sound legislation should not derive it's value from faith in a single moral framework or religious authority
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: 'Thou shalt not kill' is a concept protected in legislation because it has moral utility outside of Christianity
1.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: The Islamic belief that you should [pray 5 times a day](https://www.reviewofreligions.org/20026/why-muslims-pray-5-times-a-day/) has no utility to a secular individual
1.4.6.4. Con: Religion is subjective and its significance to individual politicians varies greatly. It is a personal choice that one makes on whether or not to include it in their lives.
1.4.6.4.1. Pro: Religious beliefs are personal matters; therefore, people should be free to choose and practice the religious beliefs that appeal to them. The state should not interfere in such personal and private matters.
1.4.7. Con: Stopping politicians \(or political candidates\) from expressing religious belief in politics, could lead to greater restrictions on expression in politics.
1.4.7.1. Pro: The right to speech and expression includes the right to [religious expression](https://www.humanrights.is/en/human-rights-education-project/human-rights-concepts-ideas-and-fora/substantive-human-rights/the-right-to-freedom-of-expression-and-religion).
1.4.7.1.1. Con: The right to \(religious\) expression is not absolute and can be curtailed, for example, when it is misused to incite [hatred or violence](https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2012/10/striking-balance-between-freedom-expression-and-prohibition-incitement-hatred).
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: Prohibiting the right to religious expression would be futile as the beliefs, values, and opinions of many people may be shaped by religion. As such, any form of expression is implicitly religious expression.
1.4.7.2. Pro: When running for public office, [many candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/02/usa.religion) reference their faith as an integral part of their character and lifestyle. Limiting this self-expression would be unjust.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: Many candidates use religion to their advantage to enhance their image. Removing it from political discourse would draw a halt to this behaviour.
1.4.7.3. Con: Unlike universally applicable ideologies like the protection of fundamental human rights or adherence to democratic principles, religion in a multicultural society is inherently partisan.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: Mere religious belief alone does not guarantee a certain political stance. There is nothing inherently partisan in religious belief.
1.4.7.3.2. Pro: If there is a dominant religion, citizens are divided into two broad groups: those aligned with the dominant religion, and all "others."
1.4.7.3.3. Pro: People are almost never practising members of more than one faith.
1.4.7.4. Con: It is unclear what the causal link is between restricting religion and pushing out other ideologies or concepts. As a result, this amounts to the [slippery slope fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope).
1.4.8. Pro: In secular countries, governments and politicians should to advocate for their views without relying upon religion.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Many religious rules are personal, and can be self-imposed. There is no need for them to be expressed in a political manner.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Some personal religious rules have come under fire in secular societies. In France, women [cannot wear the Burqa](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/france-burqa-ban-islamic-face-coverings-masks-mandatory/)(The French government confirmed that its years-long ban on wearing burqas, niqabs and other full-face coverings in public will remain in place, even as face masks become mandatory on Monday. While French citizens nationwide will be covering their faces, women who do so with Islamic garb are still subject to punishment.), even if it is their own choice.
1.4.8.1.2. Pro: A person can choose to only eat [Halal](https://www.theweek.co.uk/58447/halal-meat-what-does-it-involve-and-is-it-cruel-to-animals) or [Kosher](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/kosher-food) meat for religious reasons if they choose. There is no need to restrict others from doing otherwise.
1.4.8.2. Pro: In a diverse country like India, the involvement of religion in politics can lead to divisive politics, which promotes hate and communal disharmony.
