Discussion Name: What are the main considerations when voting?

1. What should be the main considerations when voting?
1.1. Which of my biases are influencing my decision \(e.g. confirmation bias. In-group favouritism.\)
1.1.1. Pro: Citizens who base their vote on [intergroup bias](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#OtheReasVote) tend to be irrationally loyal to and forgiving of our/their own group while irrationally hateful of the other group.
1.1.2. Con: It is futile to consider personal biases when their influence on decision-making can never be negated
1.1.2.1. Con: Even if biases cannot be completely removed, they can be effectively mitigated through different strategies.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A study on racial biases found that awareness is sufficient to [neutralize](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/7945/awareness-reduces-racial-bias) their influence on decision-making.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Overconfidence as an example of one of the many cognitive biases or "various flaws that bedevil decision-making... is built so deeply into the structure of the mind that you couldn’t change it without changing many other things”."[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview)
1.2. Whether I understand well enough the different options available to choose from.
1.2.1. Pro: This is important because most people make voting decisions merely based on [family history](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/well/family/what-really-makes-us-vote-it-may-be-our-parents.html).
1.2.1.1. Con: This may not be entirely attributable to family influence, as there appears to be a genetic basis to voting behaviors.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Genes can [predict](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1017/S0022381608080638) whether individuals will [vote](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-genetics-of-politics/).
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Genes influence [whom](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/15/do-our-genes-tell-us-how-to-vote-study-of-twins-says-they-might)(\[T\]he findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe.) we vote for.
1.2.2. Pro: Most people could put enough time and effort into learning and understanding broadly the different options available.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The majority of fuman brains are capable of change and learning- this is known as [brain plasticity \(known also as neuroplasticity\)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)
1.2.2.2. Pro: The majority of people spend [less time working than previous generations](https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours) \(and therefore potentially have more time for leisure and/or education\)
1.2.2.3. Con: People cannot be expected to put in time and effort into learning what they think they already understand well enough. \(See [availability cascade \(cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_cascade)\) and [shared information bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_information_bias)\)
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: If a person has been constantly exposed to information about a single particular political narrative through media \(including when they were young and were less likely to have the tools to analyse or debate the information they're being exposed to\) why would they challenge this view of the world?
1.2.3. Con: Are the options presented showing both pros and cons of suggested changes or actions?
1.2.4. Pro: It is only when we understand the range of choices and what they mean that we can vote meaningfully.
1.3. Whether the candidate's values matches my own
1.3.1. Pro: It would be absurd to vote for a candidate whose values contradict my own.
1.3.1.1. Con: And yet as stated elsewhere in the discussion, few voters are likely to agree with every single value a candidate has. \(And so it's not absurd to vote for a candidate whose few values contradict my own if there are other values the voter shares with the candidate that seem more important.\) See [kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/a-single-issue-or-a-few-that-could-override-all-other-issues-49036.3?path=49036.0~49036.3)
1.3.2. Con: This could prove disastrous if voters hold values that are otherwise immoral or unethical.
1.3.3. Con: It is unlikely that a candidate and a voter will match on every value relevant to voting decision making.
1.3.3.1. Pro: It is more likely that voters will internalize the values endorsed by their [favored candidates](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/30/16943786/trump-changed-public-opinion-russia-immigration-trade)(And yet Trump has nonetheless reshaped American public opinion across a number of topics. Political scientists have known for decades that political elites like presidents help form public opinion, especially among supporters, and evidence has recently begun to accumulate suggesting that people’s opinions follow those of leaders they respect more often than vice versa. That is, it’s likelier for voters to follow elite opinion than for politicians to follow public opinion.).
1.3.4. Con: Candidates may say one thing but do something else. Relying on candidates' expressed values can render one blind to their hypocritical lifestyles.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Republicans consider themselves to be the protector of traditional family values, but [Trump's marital history](https://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/opinion/columnists/nash-column-trump-a-terrible-frontman-for-the-family-values-party/article_626b7e0b-c52f-5d2c-9473-fb20b5803dca.html)(The party of family values elected a man who displays fewer family values and less morality than any other president in recent history.) runs counter to such principles.
1.3.5. Con: One's [vote](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#EpisEthiVoti) impacts not just one's own life but also the lives of others. Therefore, voters should not base their decision simply upon personal values and committments.
1.3.5.1. Con: An [individual vote](http://Her individual bad vote is of no consequence—just as an individual shot is of no consequence) usually has no significant impact on others.
1.3.5.2. Con: Across party lines, values are justified based on their implications for greater good.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: As an example, same-sex marriage supporters may argue that marriage equality would empower the LGBT community, whereas their opponents may fear that such strides would threaten the traditional model of family, which, they claim, is the basic building block of society.
1.3.5.3. Pro: One must vote for parties that empower individual citizens to make their own decisions about their own lives, rather than for parties that make value-driven policies, which limit the options available to the general public.
1.4. The extent to which the political views of each party align with scientific opinion.
1.4.1. Pro: Political "opinions" such as climate change denial could prove disastrous to humanity. Thus, citizens have a duty to not vote for parties espousing such opinions.
1.4.2. Pro: A lack of scientific literacy underlies political views that marginalize people based on their characteristics such as socioeconomic, gender, sexual orientation, and race. Voting for parties with such views contributes to their oppression.
1.4.3. Pro: Disregard for [scientific opinion](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03035-4) amid the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in hundreds of thousands of [avoidable deaths](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/damning-analysis-of-trumps-pandemic-response-suggested-40-of-us-covid-19-deaths-could-have-been-avoided/articleshow/80868530.cms).
1.4.3.1. Pro: President Jacinda Arden who has been lauded for her excellent handling of the outbreak relied on [science](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/10/17/how-science-helped-jacinda-ardern-labor-party-dominate-new-zealand-election-control-covid-19-coronavirus/) and [scientific expertise](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52344299).
1.4.4. Con: Scientific opinion changes across time. Thus, a visionary politician may lose the opportunity to move society forward, simply because their scientific opinion on a given subject is incorrect.
1.4.5. Con: Requiring politics-science alignment could encourage politicians or political parties to fund studies to generate findings that suit their preferred political narrative.
1.5. There is only one rational consideration which should be uppermost in voters' minds: "What's in it for me?"
1.5.1. Con: Considering "What's in it for me?" may lead people to neglect considering the impact on their wider communities.
1.5.2. Pro: Ensuring government benefits citizens on an individual level is likely to lead to a more effective form of government overall.
1.6. A single issue \(or a few\) that could override all other issues.
1.6.1. Con: Voters should refrain from making decisions based on a party's stand on a given issue because the underlying value may run counter to the party's stand on another independent issue.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Republicans are largely anti-abortion because they believe that [life](https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/letter-pro-life-advocates-are-hypocritical-for-being-pro-gun/article_f6770abc-3b6e-588a-af8a-c1e515405469.html) is precious, but they also tend to oppose gun regulations, which could reduce the number of deaths caused by guns substantially.
1.7. What the chance of winning is for the preferred candidate.
1.7.1. Con: Voters often draw conclusions about who is likely to win based on poll results, which are often [wrong](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-polls-were-mostly-wrong/), as was the case with the 2016 presidential elections in the US.
1.7.1.1. Con: The polls were right in that, even though the electoral college votes favored Trump, the [popular vote](https://www.redlands.edu/bulldog-blog/2020/october-2020/are-election-polls-accurate/) was won by Clinton.
1.7.1.2. Pro: The rate of accuracy with which polls predict election outcomes is [60%](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/research/election-polls-are-95-confident-but-only-60-accurate-berkeley-haas-study-finds/)(\[A\]n analysis of 1,400 polls from 11 election cycles found that the outcome lands within the poll’s result just 60% of the time. And that’s for polls just one week before an election—accuracy drops even more further out.)--only a little more than what would be expected by chance \(i.e., a 50-50\).
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Poll accuracy is largely dependent on methodological considerations, such as [sample representativeness](https://www.redlands.edu/bulldog-blog/2020/october-2020/are-election-polls-accurate/), which can be difficult to achieve.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: How the survey questions are [phrased](https://www.redlands.edu/bulldog-blog/2020/october-2020/are-election-polls-accurate/) influence poll outcomes.
1.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Poll questions can sometimes be deliberately [phrased](https://blog.cengage.com/an-exercise-on-question-wording-and-political-polling/)(A DNC Survey from 2020 asks voters to list the aspects of the Trump presidency they found most disturbing. By assuming voters found the presidency disturbing, they make assumptions that don’t exactly follow good polling practice.) to serve as a leading question.
1.7.1.2.1.2. Con: New research findings that enhance our understanding of the methodological factors that adversely affect political accuracy could help surveyors develop [better surveys](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/research/election-polls-are-95-confident-but-only-60-accurate-berkeley-haas-study-finds/) that yield more accurate results.
1.7.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: There is evidence to suggest that asking voters [whom others will vote for](https://theconversation.com/election-polls-are-more-accurate-if-they-ask-participants-how-others-will-vote-150121) yields more reliable poll results than questions that ask them to name whom they intend to vote for.
1.7.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Algorithms developed based on these findings have been found to be [superior](https://theconversation.com/election-polls-are-more-accurate-if-they-ask-participants-how-others-will-vote-150121)(One algorithm, called the “Bayesian Truth Serum,” gives more weight to the answers of participants who say their voting intentions, and those of their social circles, are relatively more prevalent than people in that state think. Another algorithm, called a “full information forecast,” combines participants’ answers across several poll questions to incorporate information from each of them. Both methods largely outperformed the traditional polling question and the predictions from an average of polls.) to traditional polling strategies, when it comes to the accuracy of poll results.
1.7.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Scientific](https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/voter-behavior)(Scientific surveys involve truly random samples of people and that methodology, done with what's called random digit dialing where we generate random numbers to call all possible landlines and cellphones with known probabilities. That method has produced startlingly accurate pre-election predictions for decades. And in fact, that method worked beautifully in 2016. The polls done during the last week before the election, either national polls or state polls, predicted the outcomes for President Trump and for Secretary Clinton with about 1 percentage point of error, just about exactly right.) surveys predict election outcomes more accurately than nonscientific surveys.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Politically motivated polling agencies can distort poll results to influence voter behaviors.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: Poll results influence [voter](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-polls-influence-behavior) decision-making.
1.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: Biased poll results influence voter decisions even when they are informed about the [bias](https://www.le.ac.uk/economics/research/RePEc/lec/leecon/dp19-06.pdf).
1.7.1.3.2. Con: Few voters [change sides](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/italian-political-science-review-rivista-italiana-di-scienza-politica/article/abs/impact-of-exposure-to-preelection-polls-on-voting-behaviour/7A57514ED5427D10C37351D212F0A445) following exposure to poll results that cast their preferred candidate in an unfavorable light.
1.7.1.3.2.1. Con: As the study authors themselves have noted, the percentage of voters might be small but significant enough to sway an election in the opposite direction.
1.7.1.4. Con: Many voters mistrust election poll results. In one study, they considered them to be "[unreliable and useless](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/italian-political-science-review-rivista-italiana-di-scienza-politica/article/abs/impact-of-exposure-to-preelection-polls-on-voting-behaviour/7A57514ED5427D10C37351D212F0A445)."
1.7.2. Con: Because many voters live in partisan information bubbles, they draw [incorrect conclusions](https://news.mit.edu/2019/information-gerrymandering-influences-voters-0904) about the voting behaviors of others.
1.7.2.1. Pro: [Information gerrymandering](https://news.mit.edu/2019/information-gerrymandering-influences-voters-0904) can bias experimental and real-world election outcomes.
1.7.3. Pro: Individual votes are unlikely to make any difference in the outcome of an election.
1.7.3.1. Con: And yet in the event of a tie or an agreed percentage needed to win, one individual vote can make all the difference in the outcome of an election.
1.7.4. Pro: A vote cast for a candidate with low odds of winning is a vote wasted.
1.7.4.1. Con: Even if in the short term the vote might be considered 'wasted', in the long term, if enough people vote for a candidate with low odds of winning, it will increase the chance of more people noticing this candidate as an option and supporting them to win a future election.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Most election campaigns are, in essence, a battle between two parties. Therefore, irrespective of how much one may dislike or disagree with the two parties, one must refrain from voting for a third candidate or choosing a "[None of the above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above)" \(NOTA\) option.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: Voters choose the NOTA option as an expression of [protest](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3280591).
1.7.4.2.2. Con: Including a NOTA option increases [voter participation](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7522/).
1.7.4.2.3. Pro: Where a NOTA option is presented to voters and receives the most votes, the candidate with the [next highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above_\(India\)#:~:text=percent%20NOTA%20voters.-,Responses,the%20highest%20number%20of%20votes.) number of votes will be declared the winner.
1.7.4.2.3.1. Con: This is only part of the rules deciding on what happens what to do faced with NOTA. Alternatives could exist for re-voting, or changing the entire voting system when NOTA has the highest vote.
1.8. Current injustices that would be reinforced or challenged by voting for a certain party.
1.8.1. Pro: Example: \(UK\) It's been suggested that members of the government have given preferential treatment to their own business contacts during the covid pandemic. [Guardian News article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/03/government-secrecy-over-huge-covid-contracts-completely-unnecessary-say-critics) So an argument for a future election could be that if you vote for the government with this seemingly in-group thinking and favoured treatment you are condoning them to continue doing it.
1.8.2. Pro: Should a party/authority with more radical views win, it shifts perceptions of what is acceptable and what is the norm, then allowing more radical ideas and actions to take place. See [overton window](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window)
1.8.3. Pro: Citizens in a [democracy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#MoraObliVote) have a duty to vote to avoid complicity with injustice and therefore are required to vote for those policies that combat injustices.
1.8.3.1. Con: Voting does not necessarily avoid complicity with injustice. In fact, voting may support injustices whereas abstaining from voting may lower the risk of supporting injustices.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: If citizens are unaware of injustices or how their voting reinforces current systems leading to injustice, there is a higher likelihood of them voting in ignorance for options that are complicit with injustice.
1.8.4. Con: "Injustice" is a rather nebulous term, and each party accuses the other of perpetuating injustice.
1.8.4.1. Pro: The issue of abortion is a good example. Specifically, abortion access can be construed as injustice against fetuses, and abortion restrictions can be construed as injustice against women.
1.8.5. Pro: It is immoral to vote for a candidate who is expected to make decisions that would perpetuate or turn a blind eye to injustice.
1.9. The time I have to educate myself on the nuances between the different options/parties.
1.9.1. Pro: Voters have a duty to vote for what they perceive as the best [outcome](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#EpisEthiVoti), and that they make this decision in an informed and rational way.
1.9.2. Con: There are sometimes more options and implications than a voter can be expected to sufficient information about.
1.10. The personal reputation of the candidate.
1.10.1. Pro: The individuals should be 'upstanding' citizens- trustworthy and competent to do what they have agreed to set and do
1.10.2. Con: Reputation isn't as important as a candidate's platform. Some people could have a good reputation but poor quality policies.
1.10.3. Con: Reputation is a subjective perception, not an indication of objective facts. It would be unwise to base voting decisions on a person's reputation.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Politicians can use [reputation management strategies](https://blog.reputationx.com/political-reputation-management) to effectively influence how the public perceives them.
1.11. Whether the candidate is the best for the majority or a minority \(who will be impacted by their policies\).
1.11.1. Con: Perceptions of the impact of a candidate are subjective judgments and expectations, which may prove to be wrong once they are elected.
1.11.2. Pro: [Voters](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#MoraObliVote) should choose based on collective interests of the community rather than personal preferences.
