Discussion Name: Should Labour replace Keir Starmer as leader?

1. Labour should replace Keir Starmer as leader.
1.1. Pro: Keir Starmer is not personally charismatic enough to be a popular leader.
1.1.1. Con: Charismatic leaders can be dangerous for parties in the long term.
1.1.1.1. Pro: A leader's charisma is a poor indicator of his potential success. [Successful business](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-good-leaders-dont-need-charisma/)(The simple answer is no. In a study of 100-year-old European corporations, we found that leaders of the higher-performing companies were often not charismatic — and were, in fact, less likely to be charismatic than the leaders of the lower-performing companies.) people are rarely charismatic.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Business and politics are wildly different areas in that [public support and votes](https://hbr.org/2008/02/becoming-a-charismatic-leader)(Charisma gives the leader the edge he or she needs to give people a reason to believe in their leadership. Charisma itself is the shine on the apple, but not the apple itself. As behavioral scientists have postulated, the shine often comes from what people want to see; it is a reflection of their own selves.) are integral to success of a politician.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Angela Merkel was a [dominant and popular leader](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2013/9/21/redefining-charisma-with-angela-merkel)(\[Merkel\] whom they shower with approval ratings of more than 60 percent.\n\nMerkel has been described in international media as an uninspiring figure – an “unsmiling quantum chemist”, or “unremarkable and dour”. Some Germans agree: Stefan Kornelius, an editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, wondered whether she’s “too boring for Germany”.) without charisma. Efficacy is a better way to gain support and votes.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Germany's cultural and political backdrop is [widely different from that in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/angela-merkel-germany-christian-democrats)(Merkel commands a political system far less hyperactive than the British one. Much of the time German politics is stately; it's a stable political system in which challenges to the powerful are rare.). Their government is significantly more stately.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Leadership [depends on gaining followers](https://worldfinancialreview.com/can-political-leaders-and-corporate-leaders-lead-the-same-way/)(At the heart of leadership are a large amount of followers. Without the support of followers, leaders will fail. The same thing goes with the political candidate that has to win the hearts and minds of the followers to get elected.). Business leaders gain followers by being successful. Political leaders must gain followers by being successful and likeable.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Some of the most successful business people in recent years are famously charismatic.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Steve Jobs, who created Apple, the world’s [most valuable company](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-surpasses-amazon-as-worlds-most-valuable-brand-2021-1?r=US&IR=T)(For the first time in five years, the Apple brand is the most valuable in the world at $263.4 billion, surpassing Amazon and Google, according to a ranking from Brand Finance Global 500.), was so charismatic that his colleagues came up with their [own term](https://jhargrave.medium.com/how-steve-jobs-created-the-reality-distortion-field-and-you-can-too-4ba87781adba)(The reality distortion field was a confounding melange of a charismatic rhetorical style, an indomitable will, and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand. Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely aware of it, although the effects would fade after Steve departed. We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it… but after a while most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of nature.) \("reality distortion field"\) to describe his influence on their work.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Apple did not succeed because Steve Jobs was charismatic. Apple succeeded because they [made great products](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charisma-an-obsolete-leadership-quality/)(Moreover, Jobs and Virgin Group founder Branson weren't successful because they were extroverted, but rather because they're brilliant, talented business leaders. Frankly, I never got the Jobs "reality distortion field" thing. The man was a great marketer and speaker because he was genuine, confident, passionate, and spoke from the heart. Millions buy Apple's products because they're great products. No distortion there.).
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Some charismatic business people have also driven their companies into the ground. Charismatic George Fisher was [unable to reverse Kodak's decline](https://hbr.org/2002/09/the-curse-of-the-superstar-ceo)(Kodak’s new CEO was greeted with much fanfare and high hopes. After all, Fisher was widely credited with Motorola’s strong performance during his tenure. But how much of Motorola’s success can truly be attributed to him? In light of the company’s problems today, it is apparent that much of its earlier success was due to telecommunications deregulation: Increased competition in local cellular markets and lower retail prices led to a more rapid adoption of Motorola’s phones and related technology. And if Motorola’s successes were largely the result of broad trends, so were Kodak’s failings. The analysts and investors counting on Fisher failed to recognize that Kodak’s fundamental problems—most notably, missing the shift from chemical to digital photography—had little to do with the company’s executive leadership. Indeed, in the decade before Fisher was brought in, Kodak had been described as having one of the most effective executive teams in the United States.) in the late 1990s.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: A business leader's success depends much more on the [context they are operating in](https://hbr.org/2002/09/the-curse-of-the-superstar-ceo)(What makes today’s profound faith in the charismatic CEO so troubling is the lack of any conclusive evidence linking leadership to organizational performance. In fact, most academic research that has sought to measure the impact of CEOs confirms Warren Buffett’s observation that when you bring good management into a bad business, it’s the reputation of the business that stays intact. Studies show that various internal and external constraints inhibit an executive’s ability to affect a company’s performance. Most estimates, for example, attribute anywhere from 30% to 45% of performance to industry effects and 10% to 20% to year-to-year economic changes. Thus, the best anyone can say about the effect of a CEO on a company’s performance is that it depends greatly on circumstances.) than on their charisma.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Tony Blair, who was famous for his charisma, is [now deeply unpopular](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36746453)("No British prime minister in modern times has experienced a plunge in fortune like Tony Blair's.\nCheered to the echo as he left the Commons chamber for the last time as prime minister in 2007, after 10 years of largely untroubled dominance, the tragedy of Iraq quickly ensnared him so completely that by this summer he admitted he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. The old Blair magic had turned to sand.").
1.1.1.2.1. Con: People's current negative opinion of Tony Blair is not because he was charismatic. His reputation has suffered for other reasons.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Tony Blair's charismatic demeanor [made him think he could do whatever he wanted](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/132/5/1396/354862)(In 2006 on television, Blair said over Iraq: ‘If you have faith about these things then you realize that judgement is made by other people. If you believe in God, it's made by God as well’. The historian, David Reynolds, brought the issue of hubris to the fore when he wrote about Chamberlain and compared him to Blair: ‘A well intentioned leader convinced of his own rightness, whose confidence in his powers of persuasion bordered on hubris. Who squeezed out critical professional advice controlling policy and information from an inner circle’.), even in the face of [massive public backlash.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2765041.stm)(BBC News, February 16 2003:\n\n'Million' march against Iraq war\nAnti-war protesters at Hyde Park rally\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets of London to voice their opposition to military action against Iraq.\n\nPolice said it was the UK's biggest ever demonstration with at least 750,000 taking part, although organisers put the figure closer to two million.)
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Tony Blair's decision to join the Iraq war [destroyed his reputation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33849764)(It was Mr Blair's foreign policy, though, that was to produce the biggest controversy of his premiership, including protests in London and across the country.\n\nHis support for US President George W Bush in the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 was the most disputed foreign policy decision by a British prime minister since Anthony Eden decided British troops should invade Egypt in 1956.). Not all charismatic leaders would make that decision.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.1.3. Con: Charismatic people get people to vote for them, [especially in difficult times](https://www.cam.ac.uk/charisma)(\[...\] Dr Van der Linden confirms that, given an opportunity for real power, personal magnetism has a flip side. “Charismatic leaders become much more prominent in times of social crisis and social change because they present simple solutions to very complex problems,” he says. “We naturally drift towards resolving a state of anxiety because it is uncomfortable, so heightened receptiveness to a charismatic person is not unusual, and we become open to ideas that we might not otherwise be open to. In addition, being anxious eats up brain space, so we are less likely to think carefully and rationalise arguments.”). Even if a charismatic leader leaves a complicated legacy, the most dangerous thing for Labour would be never to obtain enough votes to form a government.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: The most dangerous thing for Labour would be to damage their reputation [beyond repair](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/key-points-from-review-of-2019-labour-election-defeat)(The authors point to a long-term decline in voter loyalty to Labour, connected to weaker community links, such as through trade unions. It says Labour’s vote share declined between 2001 and 2010, then recovered slightly in 2015 and significantly in 2017 – but the fundamental issues remained.) by once again not delivering on promises made. This can only be done with good leadership.
1.1.2. Con: The Leader of the Opposition should be an alternative to the Prime Minister. Starmer's businesslike and detail-focused approach is a [strong challenge](https://www.politico.eu/article/johnson-vs-starmer-makes-british-parliament-interesting-again-coronavirus/)("It has become a cliché to say that Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, will bring a lawyerly, forensic approach to scrutinizing the government — one that the engaging, charismatic but not always across-the-detail prime minister may be vulnerable to. But if the first PMQs contest between the two men is anything to go by, it’s a cliché well-grounded in truth.") to the charismatic Johnson's vague pronouncements.
1.1.2.1. Con: Starmer has yet to offer strong, non-rhetorical opposition to Johnson.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: [Rhetorical opposition](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/official-opposition)(Opposition MPs participate in debates on bills and amendments, usually speaking against those introduced by the government. The opposition tends to vote against government policy, although this is not always the case. The opposition leader is usually given priority in introducing amendments.) is largely what an opposition MP is supposed to do. Starmer has been vocal against both the [Conservative party](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/15/keir-starmer-accuses-boris-johnson-of-hammering-workers) and the [weaknesses of his own party](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/keir-starmer-premiership-sea-change-anti-semitism-labour-938997)(Keir’s early actions confirmed his resolve. Rebecca Long-Bailey was promptly sacked when she refused to withdraw her support for an article that peddled anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nThe publication of the report into anti-Semitism by the independent equalities watchdog helped to draw a line on the issue. It found that the Labour Party had acted unlawfully on three counts and had discriminated against Jewish members. Keir immediately accepted the report in its entirety and committed to implementing all the recommendations.).
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Starmer has also criticized Johnson for not condemning [offensive behavior](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/england-keir-starmer-prime-minister-boris-johnson-marcus-rashford-b945326.html)(“This is about leadership and I’m afraid the Prime Minister has failed the test of leadership because whatever he says today about racism, he had a simple choice at the beginning of this tournament in relation to the booing of those who were taking the knee.\n\n“The Prime Minister failed to call that out and the actions and inactions of leaders have consequences so I’m afraid the Prime Minister’s words today ring hollow.”) of English football fans sooner.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The opposition should also demonstrate what their administration would be like in practice, primarily through their councillors and mayors. Thus far, Starmer does not seem to be [on the same page as Burnham and Khan](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sadiq-khan-and-andy-burnham-wont-back-starmers-labour-party-rules-lknlw7rft)(The Labour mayors of London and Manchester have declined to back Sir Keir Starmer as he prepares for a serious test of his leadership at a meeting of the party’s executive committee today.\n\nStarmer provoked the anger of leftwingers when he announced his intention to rewrite the voting rules to undo a change that helped Jeremy Corbyn get elected as Labour leader.\n\nYesterday, Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan, both seen as potential rivals of Starmer, refused to endorse his plans, which would give MPs a greater say over who runs the party.), the mayors of Manchester and London, respectively.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Sadiq Khan recently said that Starmer has ["put us back on the right track"](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/sadiq-khan-labour-achievements-london-wales-keir-starmer-1219917)(After two years, the Labour Party conference is back. The last conference we held was only a few months before the devastating general election result in December 2019 – our fourth national defeat in a row. And while rebuilding our party has been an enormous challenge, Keir Starmer has put us back on the right track – and I’m confident that we can win the next general election with a lot of hard work and by putting forward a convincing vision for how we can improve people’s lives and build a better, fairer, greener Britain after the pandemic.).
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Khan's message of support also contained a coded criticism of Starmer. Khan [wrote](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/sadiq-khan-labour-achievements-london-wales-keir-starmer-1219917)(But to have any chance of winning we must first unite as a party, which was one of the key messages in my conference speech. Time and time again, we have seen how the public is turned off by party in-fighting. So rather than focusing our fire on ourselves, we must direct it towards exposing the failures of the Government and providing a sensible alternative.) that "rather than [focusing our fire on ourselves](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-wins-vote-change-rules-hard-left-labour-mps-never-leader-1219537), we must direct it towards exposing the failures of the Government". Khan's link in the article leads to a story about Starmer engaging in a "bruising" battle for election reform within the party.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Khan has [explicitly said](https://www.itv.com/news/2021-09-26/sadiq-khan-tells-labour-to-stick-together-to-defeat-the-tories)(“But if we want to build the fairer, more equal, greener future Britain deserves, we know that winning the next general election is the real prize, and to get there we must unite.\n\n“We must stick together. We must focus all our energy on taking the fight to the Tories and work towards a Labour government – with Keir Starmer in Downing Street.) that Labour should work towards installing Starmer as the next prime minister.
1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Burnham has been [subtly undermining Starmer](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/28/despite-grumblings-the-ubiquitous-andy-burnham-is-a-star-of-conference)(There have been inevitable grumblings about Burnham appearing to be on manoeuvres, and positioning himself as an insurgent heir to Keir Starmer, a “king of the north” who can leverage devolution to help Labour win back the red wall.\n\n\[...\]\n\nAll this is done, Burnham says, in the context of “absolute, unequivocal” support for Starmer, although perhaps tellingly he does refer to him twice as “the current leader”.) behind a facade of support.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Labour MPs have expressed desire for Starmer to establish the [party's direction](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/24/keir-has-no-choice-but-to-go-bold-starmers-conference-high-wire-act)(MPs on all wings of the party expressed a desire for Starmer to set out the party’s specific position on key issues – and frustration at perceived paralysis in the last six months.\n\n“The moment has arrived to stop kicking the can down the road – not just on big issues like social care and tax and the Green New Deal and the energy crisis – but also on other things that matter where it looks like Labour doesn’t even have a clue, such as trans rights and even Jeremy \[Corbyn’s\] suspension” one said.) more clearly.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: In a time of crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of the opposition party is different to normal times.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Data shows that during the early stages of crises, [opposition parties display more positive sentiments towards government actions and policies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2021.1886519)(Our findings are in line with those observed in military crises and possibly also the longer-term dynamics in economic crises. In the short term, one can observe a ‘rally effect’, while in the longer term the negative consequences of the crisis result in more negative opposition party expressed sentiment.). Starmer's Labour is no different.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The Government usage of emergency legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic [restricts parliamentary scrutiny](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5802/ldselect/ldconst/15/15.pdf)(The vast majority of these laws, including the most significant and wide-reaching, have come into effect as secondary legislation and without prior approval from Parliament.) and gives [exceptional powers to the Government](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5802/ldselect/ldconst/15/15.pdf)(It is clear that exceptional measures have been necessary to limit the spread of the virus and keep communities safe.The Government has introduced a large volume of new legislation, much of it transforming everyday life and introducing unprecedented restrictions on ordinary activities.). Therefore it is important that a strong opposition holds the Government in check.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Starmer claimed [opposing COVID measures for the sake of opposition](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58626261)(Becoming leader during the pandemic did not give Sir Keir a huge opportunity to confront the government.\n\nHe supported many of the government decisions on Covid restrictions, saying he did not want to oppose measures for opposition's sake.) alone was a waste of governmental time.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: During times of crisis, societies tend to ['rally around the flag'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17457289.2021.1924742)(When societies are hit by a crisis, people tend to rally around the flag. The rally-around-the-flag effect describes the tendency of public opinion to become more favourable toward political leaders in times of crises.), making public opinion of the [political leader more favourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect)(Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, President George W. Bush received an unprecedented increase in his approval rating. On September 10, Bush had a Gallup Poll rating of 51%. By September 15, his approval rate had increased by 34 percentage points to 85%. Just a week later, Bush was at 90%, the highest presidential approval rating ever. Over a year after the attacks occurred, Bush still received higher approval than he did before 9/11 \(68% in November 2002\).). Therefore it is in the interests of opposition to work with the governing party during these times.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: It is the moral and parliamentary [duty](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/opposition-the/)(The leader of this party takes the title Leader of the Opposition. The role of the Official Opposition is to question and scrutinise the work of the Government.) of the Leader of the Opposition to question and confront the Government. Such a duty is particularly important during times of crisis.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Starmer has been clear from the outset that he wanted to engage in [constructive opposition](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/starmer-dilemma/)(We defined ‘constructive opposition’ as ‘comments and questions that have a useful purpose in getting the government to do its job better’. In other words, an approach that doesn’t criticise for what appears to be political advantage, but rather in furthering the ‘national interest’ and improving outcomes – not far from how Starmer elaborated on the approach himself in his speech upon being elected as Labour’s leader.). Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, [Labour have supported the government](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/keir-starmer-labour-party-tories-b1803620.html)(Only an idiot who cared more about their own political platform would have not supported the government on certain areas like the vaccine rollout in the crisis. Will we ever receive credit for helping stuff pass? No, probably not, but that’s OK.) as it was the right thing to do.
1.1.2.1.3.2.3. Con: Constant criticism of the government seems disingenuous and lowers the impact when there is something serious to criticise.
1.1.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: In a two-party system, due to the lack of viable alternatives, the Leader of the Opposition has a democratic moral duty to confront the Government on behalf not of only his party, but also all who are not represented in Government.
1.1.2.1.3.2.4.1. Con: The Leader of the Opposition refers to the leader of the [official opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Loyal_Opposition_\(United_Kingdom\))(Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition, or the Official Opposition, in the United Kingdom, is the main political opposition to Her Majesty's Government. This is usually the political party with the second-largest number of seats in the House of Commons, as the largest party will usually form the government.), not the [parliamentary opposition](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/official-opposition)(parliamentary opposition: all the political parties in Parliament that are not currently in government.), and therefore they only have a moral duty to their party and shadow government.
1.1.2.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: There are 11 parties currently included in Parliament. Only one of them is in Government. The leader of the largest opposition party bears a moral duty to at least consider their positions and to oppose the government.
1.1.2.1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: The patchwork of parties in parliamentary opposition cover a wide range of political values and cultures ranging from [abstentionist Irish republicans](https://www.e-ir.info/2019/08/19/understanding-sinn-fein-abstention-from-the-uk-parliament/) to [Scottish](https://www.snp.org/) and [Welsh](https://www.partyof.wales/) nationalists. It would be impossible for any one person to represent the wishes of such a group.
1.1.2.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: If the Leader of the Opposition does not provide strong opposition to the Government, then they not only fail their moral obligation to their party members, but also all voters who voted in opposition of the current Government.
1.1.2.1.3.2.5. Pro: The Official Opposition has a [constitutional duty to oppose and criticize the Government](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/official-opposition)(Historically and constitutionally, the opposition is understood to have three main roles: ‘to oppose the government, to criticize it and to seek to replace it’. \[1\]).
1.1.2.2. Con: Labour suffered a crushing defeat to the Tories in the Labour stronghold of Hartlepool in a [by-election](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/07/hartlepool-byelection-result-labour-starmer-conservatives)(The Tories won 15,529 votes, with Labour recording 8,589, according to official results. Jill Mortimer defeated the Labour candidate, Dr Paul Williams, by 6,940 votes. Mortimer won the byelection with more than half of the votes cast \(51.88%\) and a swing from Labour of almost 16%.).
1.1.2.3. Pro: Keir Starmer is [highly educated and passionate about human rights issues](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/who-is-keir-starmer-labour-mp-a4405191.html)("As a lawyer, that's the one thing that defines my career - a passion for fighting injustice."). This counters Johnson's bumbling approach to politics.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Boris Johnson's popularity is increasing [despite recent scandal](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boris-johnson-rise-polls-public-b1839496.html), and it seems his personality actually immunizes him from greater criticism.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Starmer's [passion does not come across](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/year-of-keir-part-1-jittery-mps-politics-and-passion_uk_606654ccc5b6aa24bc60a48d)(“His biggest weakness is he’s not very political and we are living in a very ideologically political age.” One staffer says that the frustration is growing. “By early winter people needed to know more about what the Labour Party stood for under Keir. And what he himself stood for.” Few doubt his competence, but several doubt he has a political killer instinct.) in his public appearances.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Starmer's engagement with constituents [have largely been remote](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/year-of-keir-part-1-jittery-mps-politics-and-passion_uk_606654ccc5b6aa24bc60a48d)(“The public’s only interaction with him has had to be the speeches he’s done in an empty room, behind the despatch box, or through an LBC studio....People say where’s the passion? I’d love anyone to show passion in an empty room.”), limiting the level to which his personality can be shared.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Starmer [does not form connections](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57857017)(Several of the voters hadn't heard of Sir Keir before their encounter, failing the first test for any politician - to be noticed.\n\nOver the hour or so there was no sudden rush of affection for the Labour leader, no one moment where suddenly a connection clicked between him and the audience.) in his interactions with Labour Party members.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Starmer is willing to meet people, [including members of the public](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57857017)(No surprise, then, that the Labour leader was obviously chuffed to bits to be out on the road, taking to the floor \(to chat, rather than cha-cha-cha\) in Blackpool's amazing and recently restored Tower Ballroom.\n\nLining up to speak to him were a dozen independently selected former Labour voters, with Sir Keir promising to take their words "on the chin".\n\nHe was pushed on a huge range of subjects. The sense at the start was not so much anger with Labour, more a quieter, stubborn disappointment.), who disagree with him. Boris Johnson actively avoids these meetings, as seen when [he refused to meet Andrew Neil](https://www.thenational.scot/politics/19382569.dominic-cummings-reveals-boris-johnson-avoided-andrew-neil-election-interview/)(OMINIC Cummings said that Boris Johnson is a “gaffe machine” who is “clueless” when it comes to policy or government.\n\nHitting out at his former boss during a Twitter thread about political commentators, Cummings said that Johnson’s lack of ability was a key factor behind the decision not to do an interview with Andrew Neil ahead of the 2019 General Election.\n\nWhile all other political leaders of major parties did an interview with the former BBC host, Johnson pulled out.\n\nDelivering a monologue which has now been viewed almost eight million times and made the front page of some UK newspapers, Neil slammed the Prime Minister for avoiding scrutiny.).
1.1.2.3.2.3. Con: Starmer's [interview with Piers Morgan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57321990)(3\) How he met his wife\n\nSir Keir has been married to his wife, Victoria, since 2007, and she sat in the audience to watch the interview take place.\n\nBut when Morgan asked him how the pair had met, it was not the most romantic tale.\n\n"I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate," said Sir Keir.\n\n"I \[asked the team\] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said let's get her on the line."\n\nWhen he spoke to her from her office as a ward sister in the NHS, he grilled her on the documents, and before he hung up he heard one comment from her.\n\n"She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me," Sir Keir said. "And quite right too.") showed a more relatable side than the professional image he usually projects.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Starmer has shown great passion for reinventing the UK education system to [ensure all children have choice](https://feweek.co.uk/i-have-no-time-for-snobbery-in-education-keir-starmer/)(In a section lamenting differences in attainment and opportunities for people from independent school backgrounds and state school backgrounds, Starmer takes aim at the academic and vocational education divide saying: “I have no time for those who say that when it comes to poorer children, we should stick to the hard, vocational skills.\n\n“No well-off family would ever consider denying their own children these experiences – so why should we not demand the same for the 90 per cent of British children who do not attend independent school?”) in their educational futures and are not limited by their socioeconomic background.
1.1.2.3.4. Pro: Starmer's legal background means [he is a capable adversary to Johnson,](https://www.politico.eu/article/johnson-vs-starmer-makes-british-parliament-interesting-again-coronavirus/)(Starmer took a different tack: Instead of Corbyn’s righteous fury, he slowly and deliberately constructed a case. And while he will want to be seen to be speaking for the people, he did not deploy Corbyn’s tactic.\n\nThe most obvious courtroom technique deployed by Starmer at Wednesday’s session was the flourishing of the government’s own paperwork to counter a point made by Johnson.\n\nWhen the prime minister spoke about the inappropriateness of international death comparisons, Starmer held up one of the government’s own press conference slides on … international death comparisons. It was an effective wheeze to undermine the viewer’s trust in Johnson as witness.\n\nAs one worried Tory MP told POLITICO: “Starmer is a prosecuting lawyer, and it is going to be the case for the prosecution every week, with Boris as the accused.”) whom he can undermine while remaining deliberate and focused on his policy.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Starmer and Johnson [are equal in polls](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/johnson-and-starmer-neck-and-neck-who-would-make-most-capable-prime-minister-doubts-about-labour)(When asked who would make the most capable Prime Minister, 38% say Boris Johnson and 38% say Keir Starmer. Johnson’s numbers have fallen 9 points from 47% in March 2021, whilst Starmer’s have remained largely unchanged \(up one point\)) about who would be the most capable Prime Minister.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: The same polls reflect a [7-point increase in individuals](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/johnson-and-starmer-neck-and-neck-who-would-make-most-capable-prime-minister-doubts-about-labour)(The narrowing of the gap is largely due to the increase in respondents saying ‘neither’ \(up 7 points to 13%\). 1% say someone else \(unchanged\) and 9% say they don’t know \(down a point\).) claiming neither politician would make a capable Prime Minister.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Starmer has [outperformed Johnson in all domains](https://news.sky.com/story/starmer-outperforms-johnson-in-first-in-person-conference-speech-as-labour-leader-according-to-sky-news-poll-12421477)(The poll by Opinium, conducted after the speech, found 63% of respondents agreed with what Sir Keir had to say, 57% said he came across as strong, 62% say it showed him as competent and 68% said it shows he cares about ordinary people.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe numbers outperform Mr Johnson's first conference speech in 2019.\n\nAfter being shown extracts of that speech, 51% agreed with what he had to say, 52% said it showed he was strong, 46% said competent and 37% said it showed him as caring about ordinary people.) in his first party conference speech, most notably with 68% of individuals saying it was clear he cares about ordinary people, relative to a low 37% for Johnson.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: The Conservative party voters [may not value](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/does-the-conservative-party-care-about-ordinary-people) 'caring about the ordinary people' as much as Labour voters do, making this comparison inaccurate.
1.1.2.6. Con: Labour still trails the Conservative party [in polls](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/).
1.1.3. Pro: In comparison to the charisma of his counterpart, Boris Johnson, and the strong personality of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer appears boring and unrelatable.
1.1.3.1. Con: In an age of political upheaval, seeking leadership that combats the caricaturisation of politics is wise. Both [Corbyn](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-018-3838-x)(The newspapers also made much of how ‘ordinary’ Corbyn’s habits and behaviours were in contrast to the ambitious and elitist Westminster political stereotype. He was described as “opting for a bicycle instead of a car” \(Sun, 16/08/15\) and “taking the night bus home from a rally, no chauffeur-driven car” \(Guardian, 11/09/15\).) and [Johnson](https://www.irishnews.com/opinion/letterstotheeditor/2021/08/31/news/boris-johnson-is-the-court-jester-with-nothing-of-significance-to-bring-to-the-table-2431959/)(There is also a deep ambiguity and nihilism to his subversive clown persona which borders on the malignant. Indeed, sometimes, very disconcertingly, it resembles the Joker – the flamboyant super villain of the Batman movies. Like the Joker, the Bo-Jo clown is mercurial and ephemeral with no long-term strategic goal other than to take control at any cost.) have become memetic representations of their parties.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Keir Starmer's [lack of charisma](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2021/03/why-being-boring-might-be-advantage-keir-starmer)(No passionate young people chant his name, no one clamours for his after-dinner speeches, no op-eds are written delving into the mystery of his charm and how he gets away with it all. Yet Starmer’s brand of boring – a refusal to engage with the culture war of the moment, no overriding passion for any particular set of policies to the exclusion of pragmatism, a measured approach to the failings of his opponents \(his response last month to news that the Department of Health had acted unlawfully by failing to publish PPE contracts within the required period was to say the public didn’t want Matt Hancock to resign\) – actually looks like a fairly appealing set of qualities for a future prime minister.) is representative of a return to politics about discourse and social issues, instead of one orientated towards amusing characters.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Criticism of Keir Starmer's social class is in fact a gateway to his most relatable factor - [he grew up similarly to many Britons](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/who-is-keir-starmer-labour-mp-a4405191.html)("So, actually, my background isn't what people think it is. I know what it's like. I actually never had been in any workplace other than a factory until I left home for university. I'd never been in an office.\n\n"So the idea that somehow I personally don't know what it's like for people across the country in all sorts of different circumstances is just not borne out.).
1.1.3.1.3. Con: The [use of memes and caricaturisation](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/corbyn-memes-wot-won-it-some-of-the-best)(While the Conservatives posted relentless YouTube attack videos and bought up Snapchat advertising slots, some mostly young Labour supporters were spreading the love for Corbyn using the argot and themes relevant to them. Milifandom had nothing on Corbyn’s online appeal. Here are a few examples of Corbyn memes that flew in the election campaign. Could they have swept people all the way to the polls?) in politics has lead to large [increases in youth voters](https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/11/the-memes-that-decided-the-outcome-of-the-general-election-6701277/)(For young voters the reach of organically shared memes dwarfed anything promoted by traditional forms of communication.\n\nWith an estimated 72% of young voters turning up on the day to cast their vote the memes clearly had an impact.).
1.1.3.1.4. Con: Starmer is by no means immune to personality politics. In fact, his attempt to [appeal to voters with his personal history](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/piers-morgan-keir-starmer-life-stories-b1857693.html)(To be noticed by the public, he will have to carry on doing the personal stuff over and over again. His reticence has allowed his critics to portray him as boring, buttoned-up and uninspiring. For Tory-supporting newspapers, it chimed neatly with the message from last month’s elections: voters do not know what Labour or its leader stands for.) show that he too plays at personal politics.
1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Starmer's approach to the personal component of politics [differs from his opponents and predecessor](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/piers-morgan-keir-starmer-life-stories-b1857693.html)(In fact, Starmer is a more difficult target for the Tories and their cheerleaders than Jeremy Corbyn, who lived up to the left-wing, unpatriotic labels they pinned on him. Starmer’s interview shows that the less damaging “boring” charge can be answered convincingly, and that he will fight hard to challenge the misleading caricature painted by his opponents.) as it is tactical, endearing and makes him more robust as a candidate.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Relatable politicians, such as [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://culturess.com/2018/11/16/5-reasons-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-relatable-politician-right-now/)(Through her posts, she’s shared what orientation is like for her and fellow “freshman” to giving viewers a tour of the Capitol building. Also, in a highly relatable moment, she posted about how hard it is to find time to do her laundry.\n\nBy being so open about this process, Ocasio-Cortez is shedding light on how Congress works and making politics seem more reliable and accessible, and we applaud her for that.), engage more voters as poeple feel connected to their representatives.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Sharing parts of her daily life, such as [playing Among Us](https://bhsowl.org/4491/opinion/should-politicians-be-more-relatable/)(As a young liberal woman of color, she strays from the norm in our government of older white men, but more than that, she is accessible. She is someone who uses the same social media platforms and plays the same video games as the regular public. \n\nAOC is also relatable because she joined the political system from the outside. When she first started running for office she was a bartender, though she had to quit when her campaign became a full-time job. Because of her relatability, young people are able to see her as a person they could imagine hanging out with rather than a disembodied political figure.) to pass time over lockdown, AOC has become one of the most popular figures [amongst young voters](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/2020-election/aoc-what-makes-her-so-popular-younger-voters-171097)(“Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s social media savviness has definitely helped her reach a national audience and especially young voters,” Kira Sanbonmatsu, professor of political science at Rutgers University and senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics, said. “It reflects a shared, generational experience with social media.”) in modern politics.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: AOC may be widely idolised as a political icon, but her [support levels are low](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/28/18285533/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-poll-favorables-media), reflecting that perhaps relatability and political efficacy are unrelated.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: The non-partisan Center for Effective Lawmaking judged AOC to be in the [bottom ten](https://thelawmakers.org/find-representatives)(Ocasio-Cortez, Alexandria\nD, NY-14\nOverall: 0.209\nBenchmark: 0.997\nRank: 230/240) US Representatives in [terms of effectiveness](https://nypost.com/2021/04/03/aoc-was-one-of-least-effective-members-of-congress-study/)(AOC introduced a total of 21 bills which the center defined as “substantive” — but that is where the story ends. Her legislation received no action in committees, no floor votes, and none ever became law, according to the center, which takes its data from Congress.gov.\n\n“She introduced a lot of bills, but she was not successful at having them receive any sort of action in committee or beyond committee and if they can’t get through committee they cannot pass the House,” Alan Wiseman, a Vanderbilt political scientist and co-director of the center, told The Post.). Popularity does not mean that someone is a good lawmaker.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Labour should have a leader who could be [a viable Prime Minister](https://thehaveringdaily.co.uk/2020/05/04/sir-keir-starmer-whats-missing-for-labour-by-tony-klinger/)(You might hate and loathe the Prime Minister but the reason he has continued to win elections and votes is because a huge swathe of our people instinctively like him and think he’s one of them), a role which requires charisma.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Ultimately, the Prime Minister acts as a global representative of a nation. People [want someone charismatic](https://thehaveringdaily.co.uk/2020/05/04/sir-keir-starmer-whats-missing-for-labour-by-tony-klinger/)(They enjoy his jokes, his banter, his bluster and occasional falls from grace. He’s very human, accessible, and in some sense just like one of the lads. Sir Keir Starmer seems wooden, a stuffed shirt, and robotic in comparison. Winning elections isn’t about just having the most compelling argument it is about who we trust and like best.) and likeable to represent them.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: Labour is not currently a party that could handle the strains of being in government as they are too divided. Starmer is the right person to reunite the party.
1.1.4. Pro: Powerful British tabloid newspapers have [criticised Starmer's lack of charisma](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14903658/sir-keir-starmer-charisma-total-idiot/)("THE SUN SAYS Sir Keir Starmer may have all the charisma of a cardboard traffic warden but he is not a total idiot").
1.1.4.1. Con: Starmer has been [unfairly treated](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/keir-starmer-labour-party-tories-b1803620.html)(It is much easier to say how someone should be leading than to actually do it, especially in a time of almost no political intrigue and a country desperate for literally anyone to get anything even partially right for more than a month at a time. I keep seeing the criticism, both anonymous and otherwise, that the Labour Party is failing to oppose the government because it supports some of what the government is doing. This is merely a lazy analysis, but I guess it is an understandable hangover from the last decade of politics that told us there is only a binary, on or off; people are either heroes or they belong in the bin. It is very tedious.) in the press.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Starmer has been criticized for not conforming to the [reactionary responses](https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2021/04/23/week-in-review-starmers-critics-are-losing-all-contact-with-reality/)(While he was out campaigning in Bath this week, the Labour leader was accosted by a raging anti-lockdown type. He listened to him respectfully, explained why he disagreed, and then went into his pub, where the man flew into a rage. Starmer’s minder held him back while the Labour leader walked off.\n\nThe response was predictable and quite revealing. A barrage of mockery at what had been a fairly standard bit of meet-the-public peril, and which Starmer handled pretty well.) we have come to expect from our political leaders.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Many of the criticisms made of Starmer are [fair and mirrored by supporters](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/12/keir-starmer-labour-leader-crucial-byelection)(A lack of killer instinct to get the Tories – which Tony Blair and his spinner Alastair Campbell had in the 1990s – haunts the party. “We’re too committed to being supportive of the government,” as one shadow minister puts it. “It leaves people thinking: ‘if you’ve not got anything to say, why should we listen to you?” Shadow ministers complain almost everyone except Rachel Reeves is kept off the airwaves, including deputy leader Angela Rayner, who they say is shut out of leadership decisions by Starmer’s aides.) of his own party.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Left-wing media sites have [turned against Starmer](https://theconversation.com/how-left-wing-media-sites-have-changed-their-coverage-of-the-labour-party-under-keir-starmer-142686)(Left-wing alternative media sites such as The Canary, The Skwawkbox, and Novara Media have spent several years providing intense support for the Labour leadership under Jeremy Corbyn. But our analysis shows how they starkly changed their position now that Keir Starmer has taken over as leader of the party.\n\nBack in January Rebecca Long-Bailey was seen as the Corbynite candidate for the leadership. As the Labour leadership election got underway, left-wing alternative media sites positioned themselves in opposition to Starmer and in support of Long-Bailey.) even though Corbyn repeatedly failed to win elections.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Many criticisms of Starmer do not relate to election results and are instead aimed at his values and conduct. These publications had positive views of the values and conduct of Corbyn.
1.1.4.2. Con: Tabloid newspapers are often sensationalist and untrustworthy.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Scandals, such as the [News of the World phone hacking controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal)(Employees of the newspaper were accused of engaging in phone hacking, police bribery, and exercising improper influence in the pursuit of stories. Whilst investigations conducted from 2005 to 2007 appeared to show that the paper's phone hacking activities were limited to celebrities, politicians, and members of the British royal family, in July 2011 it was revealed that the phones of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, relatives of deceased British soldiers, and victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings had also been hacked.), have called into question the journalistic integrity of tabloid newspapers.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Wikipedia recommends that tabloid newspapers be treated with caution when considered for the [purposes of citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Potentially_unreliable_sources)(The more extreme tabloids such as the National Enquirer should never be used, as most stories in them are intentional hoaxes.\nIn general, tabloid newspapers, such as The Sun, Daily Mirror, the Daily Mail \(see also the February 2017 RFC discussing its validity\), equivalent television shows, should be used with caution, especially if they are making sensational claims. The Daily Express and Sunday Express should be treated with even greater caution.).
1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Although Wikipedia is regarded to be unreliable by some, it has a strong level of [community administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editorial_oversight_and_control#Tagging_of_information)(The editorial role in Wikipedia is not to produce original research so much as to collate and source existing reputable knowledge in an encyclopedic form, under strict policies of neutrality of viewpoint and verifiability of information thus added.) backed by open discussion and [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editorial_oversight_and_control#Tagging_of_information)(The community has a very strong buy-in to consensus decision-making, underscored by guidelines such as Wikipedia:Consensus, and Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion. Consensus is not the same as majority, it signifies that the concerns and views of minorities should be taken into account in the attempt to gain a decision which reflects community values and which most can live by to some extent or other. Most policies and procedures also develop and become refined in this same manner.), particularly on popular pages.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: Regardless of their trustworthiness, people read them. The Daily Mail & the Mail on Sunday have a combined circulation of [over 1.7 million](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/most-popular-newspapers-uk-abc-monthly-circulation-figures/)(ABC average circulation for Aug 2021 \nDaily Mail - 925,545 \nMail on Sunday - 809,728).
1.1.4.3. Pro: The extent of tabloid newspapers' political power in the digital era is uncertain, but they can [undoubtedly still influence voters](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/the-man-who-could-stop-brexit/564689/)(This is a strange time in the United Kingdom, as Brexit hurtles closer without anyone yet knowing what leaving the European Union will mean. It’s also a curious time for the press, as circulation plummets, those frail pages leafed by increasingly frail and few hands. Yet one print publication, the Daily Mail, still commands vast power, its thunderous front-page headlines all but causing the paintings to tremble at 10 Downing Street. And this is where Greig comes in, for he is about to take control at the inky institution, perhaps editing this country’s political chaos in the process.), [including through their websites](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/30/mail-online-advertising-revenue-growth-daily-mail-general-trust)(The share price of the company that owns the Daily Mail has risen more than 9% after a strong performance from Mail Online more than offset a decline in newspaper advertising revenues.).
1.1.5. Con: Starmer is a [decent and principled man](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/keir-starmer-boris-johnson-labour-leadership-election-results-lgbt-a9384361.html)(In the 90s, being out in the legal profession was likely to marginalise you at best. The UK then was a hostile place to be gay. If we’d come out at university, most gay and lesbian people leapt back in the closet when they became lawyers. If we didn’t, plenty of us would be gently teased because of our sexuality. Others might not mock but would still focus obsessively on our sexuality. Others found it easiest to ignore us.\n\nI met Keir Starmer in 1992. I was a pupil barrister and he was a junior tenant in the same chambers. Pupillage is demanding; Keir looked out for all of us. I was the first openly gay person in chambers, and Keir made sure my boyfriend was as included as everyone else’s partner. It seems so obvious now, but back then, people didn’t think about LGBT inclusion – Keir did. Interestingly, it was around the same time, I met Boris Johnson, who, as I have written about before in this paper, made my sexuality very relevant, and left me feeling flushed and foolish.) who has worked on many [worthwhile causes](https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/keir-starmer-mum-health-battles-have-inspired-3488566)(As a barrister, Sir Keir has reached the apogee of his profession. He served as director of public prosecutions \(DPP\) for England and Wales between 2008 and 2013, before being knighted a year later for services to law, notably in recognition of his work to abolish the death penalty in several Caribbean countries.\n\n\[...\]\n\n“I wanted to be a human rights lawyer to change things for individuals who most needed my legal help and assistance,” he said.\n\n“I became DPP because I wanted to change and improve the way we prosecuted cases. It’s always been a purpose-led route through my career. Doing things because there’s a job to be done.) in Britain.
1.1.5.1. Con: It is [on record](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/boris-johnson-minister-of-chaos/619010/)(By now, every British subject is an expert on the matter of Boris Johnson. We know that he has an extraordinary gift for extramarital affairs, that he has \(at least\) six children by three women, and that his personal finances are a regular subject of press gossip. We know that he has been fired twice for lying \(once as a journalist, once as a politician\); that he was the Conservative mayor of Britain’s left-wing capital city; that he helped engineer the defenestration of two prime ministers from his own party; and that he very nearly died during the pandemic.) that Johnson had multiple extra-marital affairs before becoming prime minister, that he had been fired twice for lying to his employers, and that he betrayed both David Cameron and Theresa May to give himself a chance at the top job. He still became prime minister.
1.1.5.2. Pro: People who know him [like him](https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/who-is-keir-starmer)(Friends describe Starmer as gregarious and fun-loving; he is an Arsenal season ticket holder \(upper tier, West Stand\) whose love of five-a-side football is well known. \(Starmer reputedly organises his London team’s games, collecting subs and sending out the texts.\) Famously, Starmer has been mooted as the inspiration for the character of dashing human rights lawyer Mark Darcy in Helen Fielding’s Bridget Jones novels, although Starmer himself has repeatedly squashed the rumours.).
1.2. Con: Keir Starmer's policies and beliefs make him the ideal catch-all candidate.
1.2.1. Pro: Keir Starmer is not too left wing to alienate moderate voters.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Labour needs to reclaim the voters it lost during the 2019 General Election. Starmer's more middle class appearance may aid in attracting ['soft Tory' voters](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/18/starmer-win-soft-tory-conservative-voters-labour-election-success)(Two in five voters who did not vote Labour at the last election are currently open to doing so in the future. Of those, 27% voted Conservative, 17% voted Lib Dem, 3% voted Green and 5% voted for other parties. \(The rest did not vote.\) However, when analysts took into account the likelihood of people to vote and where the votes were actually needed to win seats, the importance of Tory voters increased hugely.).
1.2.1.2. Pro: Keir Starmer has expressed his [opposition to the tactics used by Extinction Rebellion](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/extinction-rebellion-cenotaph-starmer-labour_uk_5fabe603c5b68707d1faf51d), which is in line with most voters as only [19%](https://twitter.com/yougov/status/1433823282621521927) support Extinction Rebellion.
1.2.1.3. Con: The political characteristics of a 'moderate' voter are changing since new generations are the [most left-wing in decades](https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/03/how-keir-starmer-alienated-generation-left). Appealing to 'moderate' voters will increasingly mean appealing to the political left.
1.2.2. Pro: Keir Starmer calls on all factions within Labour to put aside their differences and [unite to defeat the Tories](https://www.mailplus.co.uk/edition/news/politics/108227/sir-keir-starmer-lays-out-centrist-vision-for-labour-in-12000-word-essay). This type of pragmatism is likely something that many can get behind.
1.2.2.1. Pro: As of June 2022, just [33%](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/) of the electorate support the Conservatives, so strong anti-Tory branding could be appealing.
1.2.3. Con: Keir Starmer's policies and beliefs are unpopular.
1.2.3.1. Con: Extreme left parties [are unsuccessful in Britain](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/corbyn-s-leadership-has-been-a-success-and-a-failure-for-labour) and lead to high levels of polarisation. Starmer's move towards a [more center left approach](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/08/14/left-wing-vs-right-wing-its-complicated)(British politics is more fractured than ever before, with party loyalties in flux and the fault lines of left and right no longer holding sway \(if they ever did\). Any politician who still looks at the electorate in terms of left and right is not only missing opportunities to appeal to voters who support other parties, but is also potentially unaware of how up for grabs their own voters are.) is more pleasing to the many despite some alienation from far-left factions in the party.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: If Starmer's Labour party continue to take moderate views it could lead to a [loss of voting support](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/englands-left-must-rebuild-outside-labour-party/)(It would be a historic error to hunker down in Labour at the expense of this urgent work. Vitality is to be found in building a movement of resistance to the Tories outside Labour. This is not to say there is no difference between a Starmer led government and a Johnson one – the terrain for left advance is more fertile under the former. It is not even an argument to leave the Labour Party. But it is about being clear sighted about where openings to rebuild the left exist. In any event hundreds of thousands of activists who became active around Corbyn over the years will find no enthusiasm for Starmer – or increasingly Labour as a whole.) from left leaning party members.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Left-wing policies poll well in British politics.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the [Overton Window](https://medium.com/policy-postings/how-coronavirus-smashed-the-overton-window-af1eaae682a) in the UK has shifted to the left.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: Starmer's extremely heavy-handed approach to suppressing the left within Labour has led to high levels of polarisation within the party itself, with the neoliberal wing locked in a bitter struggle against the left. This is more of a threat to Labour's success than any polarisation on the national level.
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: A political party is only as effective as its ability to win elections; if far-left factions of Labour are alienated, that's a cost worth paying.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Starmer is reforming the Labour Party to be [more similar to Tony Blair's party](https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/voices/keir-starmer-labour-speech-blair-b1929292.html)(On the eve of his big speech, Keir Starmer showed his frustration at being constantly compared with two of his predecessors – Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair – and declined to say to which of them he was closer. “My job is not to replicate what some past leader has done, my job is to take our Labour Party and change it,” he said.\n\nYet his 90-minute address to the Labour conference made clear he has chosen the Blair path. He has concluded he cannot both deliver the unity he promised when he ran for the leadership – in other words, keep the Corbyn left happy – and win power. As he told delegates, to “remake this nation” requires Labour to win – for him, “the object of the exercise”.) in the 90s. Foreign Policy once described Tony Blair as ["The Most Hated Man in Britain"](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/11/the-most-hated-man-in-britain-thinks-he-can-save-the-country-tony-blair-brexit-labour/)(The Most Hated Man in Britain Thinks He Can Save the Country\n\nThe best thing Tony Blair can do for Brexit and the Labour Party is to stay as far away as possible.).
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Tony Blair enjoyed [10 years of success](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36746453)(Cheered to the echo as he left the Commons chamber for the last time as prime minister in 2007, after 10 years of largely untroubled dominance, the tragedy of Iraq quickly ensnared him so completely that by this summer he admitted he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. The old Blair magic had turned to sand.) until his decisions in Iraq lead to a drop in his approval ratings. Starmer's choice to model his Labour Party off Blair's could return the party to its former success under Blair.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Starmer's failed proposals to reform the [voting laws for the Labour Party leadership](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58689884)(Sir Keir Starmer has been forced to drop changes to the way Labour elects its leaders after they were rejected by the party's left wing.\n\nHe had wanted to scrap one-member-one vote - but opponents said that would give Labour MPs too much say over who gets the top job.\n\nSir Keir is now hoping to get members to back a watered-down package of reforms in a conference vote on Sunday.) were elitist and divisive.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: The system Starmer wanted to replace guaranteed one vote for every Labour Party member. Starmer's new proposals would have meant that members' votes [would only have counted for a third of the total](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58689884)(He had wanted to replace the current one-member-one-vote system with an "electoral college" system - abolished by predecessor Ed Miliband - under which Labour members would only account for a third of the votes in a future leadership contest.\n\nMPs and unions would also each have made up a third of the votes.\n\nBut Sir Keir had to drop his proposals after he failed to persuade the big Labour-backing unions to support them.\n\nActivist group Momentum called the proposed rule change "an MP veto by the backdoor", adding: "Handing this much power to a Westminster elite is the opposite of democracy."), putting more power into the hands of Labour MPs.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Even though Starmer began his term [stressing party unity](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/22/keir-starmer-warns-labour-to-unite)(Labour will lock itself out of power for an entire generation if it fails to end years of internal warring and instead target “dangerous” Tory prime minister Boris Johnson, Keir Starmer warned the party today.\n\nWith voting about to begin in the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, Starmer said the party would experience its longest period out of power since the second world war should it continue to focus on “internal disagreements” rather than confronting the prime minister.), he insisted on pushing this divisive issue, resulting in an [embarrassing climbdown](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/labour-conference-rayner-starmer-leader-b1926889.html)(Such changes, if approved by the Brighton conference, would strengthen the influence of MPs and make it less likely the party elected a leader like Corbyn with only minority support in the Parliamentary Labour Party \(PLP\). Starmer allies are putting a brave face on it, saying the “significant” changes will ensure the party is never again hijacked by the hard left as it was in 2015. They say his plan was never set in stone. One told me: “Two steps forward, one step back. It doesn’t stop him advancing again.”\n\nBut to voters, headlines about a climbdown risk making the Labour leader look weak. The only consolation is that he avoided a humiliating defeat on the conference floor; that would have been noticed by more people than the tactical retreat that became inevitable.).
1.2.3.3.3. Con: Starmer's proposed changes to the voting laws were necessary to [stop entryists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-contest-can-jeremy-corbyn-win-without-his-legion-ps3-supporters-a7134371.html)(In the wake of Labour’s defeat under Ed Miliband at the 2015 general election, Mr Corbyn won a landslide 59.5 per cent of the vote to become the party’s new leader.\n\n\[...\]\n\nBut controversy surrounded Labour’s voting system, which was being used for the first time, with reports of “entryism” from the far-left and even Conservatives who relished the chance of a Corbyn-led opposition skewing the vote in his favour.\n\nPreviously, MPs, union members and party members had a third of the vote each in leadership contests.\n\nBut the rules introduced by Mr Miliband introduced a “one member, one vote” system and allowed registered supporters of the party to sign up and vote for £3.) \(people who join the party at short notice to boost a candidate's support\) from hijacking the Labour Party leadership elections as they may have in 2015.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: This disincentivises leadership candidates to recruit new members of the Party to the cause, and will ensure that the Labour party never recieves another surge in new members like that of [2015-2016, fuelled by Corbyn's appeal](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/explaining-the-pro-corbyn-surge-in-labours-membership/)(In the course of a year and a half, Labour Party membership has increased massively. The number of full members has moved from 190,000 in May 2015 to 515,000 in July 2016 – an influx of 325,000 new members. Monica Poletti, Tim Bale and Paul Webb explore how we can explain the pro-Corbyn surge in this growth.).
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: This will stabilise the Labour party in the long-term, preventing the possibility of radical candidates gaining power through rallying support outside of the Party.
1.2.3.3.4. Con: Starmer's proposals would have ensured that MPs had more power over nominating the party's leader. This is appropriate as MPs are, after all, elected to represent their constituents.
1.2.3.4. Con: Starmer has only been leader of the Labour party for just over a year. [He needs to be given more time](https://washingtonspectator.org/labour-party-murray/)(Starmer may no longer have the austerity target to aim at, but the government’s shortcomings over the pandemic—lack of preparation, a delayed lockdown following a misguided flirtation with “herd immunity,” a chronic shortage of protective equipment for health service personnel, and a huge lag in testing capacity—could be promising substitutes. With another election not likely for four years, he has time to build. An initial aim might be to reach polling numbers as good as Corbyn’s in 2017.) to see if his approach will work.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Starmer's [tactics are different](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/year-of-keir-starmer-labour-leadership-anniversary)(Starmer's allies say he is playing a long game and are still confident that it'll come off.\n\n“The British people voted out Churchill in 1945," said one. "You have leadership for war and leadership for rebuilding the country – and Johnson is not the leader for rebuilding”.) to those of his predecessors and his opposition and as such may take longer to reveal themselves.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: With pressing issues facing the UK such as Brexit, [fuel shortages](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-58709456)(The Petrol Retailers Association \(PRA\) - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - has said there are "early signs" the pressure is starting to ease at the pumps.\n\nIt says that 37% of the forecourts owned by its members were out of petrol on Tuesday, compared with two-thirds on Sunday.) and the COVID-19 pandemic, Starmer may not have the luxury of time.
1.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: It is precisely these issues that represent Starmer's suitability as Labour leader. When Johnson's government fail to course correct and deal with these problems, and others, adequately, [support for Starmer will increase.](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boris-johnson-keir-starmer-opinion-polls-b1902630.html)(Opinion seemed to turn against Johnson when he tried to get out of isolating after Sajid Javid, the health secretary, tested positive for the virus. The prime minister’s U-turn did not save him from the “one rule for them” charge, which keeps cutting through to the public – first with Dominic Cummings’s day trip to Barnard Castle, then with Matt Hancock’s social un-distancing.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThere may be several more ups and downs of this seesaw before the next election, but for the moment, I think the balance of power is tilting against Johnson and in Starmer’s favour.)
1.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: At the Labour Party conference, [Starmer released a roadmap for Labour's plans to rebuild the country](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58720108)("I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win," Sir Keir said.\n\n"So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election."\n\nSir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised.). His 'principles' clarify his intention is to [repair the damage done](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-sets-out-10-point-vision-for-labours-contribution-society-in-12000-word-essay-3392882)(“Labour will build a society that prizes the contributions people make, providing security and opportunity across Britain.”) under Johnson's government.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Starmer's leadership has taken place in impossible circumstances which [delayed the proper functioning](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/uk-parliament-coronavirus)(But the nature of the current pandemic means that meeting and working in person carries health risks. This is different to other historic challenges that the UK parliament has faced. For example, although the Commons experienced bomb damage during WWII, this necessitated changes to the venue of its meetings, rather than making the actual nature of its meetings risky. Multiple MPs – including the prime minister – have either been diagnosed with the coronavirus, or had to self-isolate, over the past eight months, highlighting the need for parliament to adapt its usual ways of working.) of government.
1.2.3.4.3. Con: Regardless of reasons, Starmer has [failed to show the electorate](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/starmer-dilemma/)(For Starmer, the results are at best mixed. The largest group of people \(35%\) believe that he has done either a fairly or very bad job at ‘constructive opposition’; 29% think that he is doing neither a good nor bad job; while 27% think that he is doing either a fairly good or very good job.) meaningful results. It is in his best interest to appear proactive while pursuing his '[long game](https://washingtonspectator.org/labour-party-murray/)'.
1.2.4. Con: Starmer has [alienated supporters of Corbyn](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/29/labour-suspends-jeremy-corbyn-over-ehrc-report-comments), and the [more left-wing members of Labour](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/keir-starmer-expels-far-left-jeremy-corbyn-supporters-from-labour_uk_60f6ffbfe4b0158a5eda82d7)("Hundreds of far Left supporters of Jeremy Corbyn will be expelled from Labour within days after its ruling body agreed to ban four groups accused of promoting a “toxic culture” within the party.").
1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.4.2. Con: Starmer, speaking about the Labour Party, acknowledged that ["Our trade unionist, reformist social democrats and radical socialist traditions are still at the heart of our movement."](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-contest-socialist-tradition-a9352271.html)(Our trade unionist, reformist social democrats and radical socialist traditions are still at the heart of our movement.)
1.2.4.3. Pro: Starmer's 10 key principles, outlined in his [pre-party conference essay](https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Road-Ahead-FINAL_WEB-fri-1.pdf), omitted many of the [left-wing pledges](https://todayuknews.com/politics/keir-starmers-10-principles-for-power-leave-out-left-wing-campaign-pledges/)(Promises to pursue “economic justice”, “common ownership”, “equality” and to “defend migrants’ rights” are not mentioned in a 14,000-word essay released ahead of a make-or-break party conference.) that were made during his leadership bid.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: In his pre-party conference essay, Starmer spoke about economic, educational, and social [inequality of opportunity](https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Road-Ahead-FINAL_WEB-fri-1.pdf)(There are two fundamental\nthings we need to fix in this country:\ninsecurity and inequality of opportunity.), all of which common under "economic justice" and "equality" even if not explicitly stated so.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Starmer has been accused of [leading a witch-hunt](https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2021/08/16/news/ken-loach-accuses-labour-party-of-witch-hunt-following-expulsion-2418607/)(VETERAN left-wing film-maker Ken Loach has said he has been thrown out of the Labour Party.\n\nLoach, whose acclaimed films include The Wind That Shakes The Barley and I, Daniel Blake, claimed he was expelled for refusing to "disown those already expelled”.\n\nHe has accused Labour of a “witch-hunt”.) against left-wing members and groupings within Labour.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: In July 2021 the Labour National Executive [banned membership of four political groupings](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58591455)(In July, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive - declared that membership of four groupings would be incompatible with party membership.\n\nIn other words, these groups were banned, or, in the jargon, proscribed.), all of which were left-wing.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: [This was condemned by the largest left-wing group within Labour](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57909481)(Momentum - the biggest left wing Labour group - said it was a "cynical and desperate" attempt to "smash the left".\n\nLabour's biggest financial backer Unite also condemned the move.), Momentum, as a "cynical and desperate" action, intended to "smash the left".
1.2.4.4.1.2. Con: Some of the groups were [ran by people expelled from the party or had opposed the push to tackle anti-Semitism](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57909481)(Labour said some of the groups were run by people expelled from the party, while others had opposed Labour's push to tackle anti-Semitism.).
1.2.4.5. Pro: Starmer has faced accusations that he has [weaponised antisemitism](https://jwa.org/blog/weaponization-antisemitism-naomi-wimborne-idrissis-suspension-uk-labour-party)(Under the guise of taking a stand against antisemitic sentiment within the Labour Party, accusations of antisemitism are increasingly instrumentalized by politicians and the mainstream media in the UK when it is politically convenient for them to do so.) for political means.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: Starmer has conflated support for Palestine - a value often considered left wing - with antisemitism, and has [taken disciplinary action against those who criticize the state of Israel, including Jewish people themselves](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2021/09/30/667546/Labour-conference-)(As UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer declares victory over alleged anti-Semitism in the party, left-wing Jewish members are complaining of a new wave of purges taking place to remove Jews from the party who defend Palestine and stand with exiled former leader Jeremy Corbyn.).
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: Jewish Voice for Labour has issued a guide for canvassers stating:["If you are dealing with people who try to use antisemitism to bury Labour and Corbyn give them no quarter. Go on the offensive"](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/go-on-offensive-to-defend-corbyn-from-antisemitism-claims-says-jewish-voice-for-labour-c3hkl2t5h).
1.2.4.5.3. Con: Many Jewish groups have [praised Starme](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52201614)(Sir Keir Starmer has “achieved more in four days” than Jeremy Corbyn did “in four years” on tackling anti-Semitism, Jewish community leaders have said.)r for his actions in tackling antisemitism within the party.
1.2.4.5.4. Pro: The co-founder of the pro-Corbyn group, Jewish voice for Labour, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi, [was suspended from the party after criticizing the "unjust" suspensions of many left-wing members](https://jwa.org/blog/weaponization-antisemitism-naomi-wimborne-idrissis-suspension-uk-labour-party)(The latest development was the December 4 suspension of Jewish socialist Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi from the party, for her conduct at an online constituency meeting. During the local party meeting, the Jewish Voice for Labour co-founder criticized the “unjust” suspension of other left-wing party members over accusations of antisemitism by the new party leadership, including her ally Corbyn.) of the party for antisemitism.
1.2.5. Con: Keir Starmer's attempts to be a 'catch-all' candidate can be seen to be weak and ineffective. As the saying goes; "those who stand for nothing fall for anything".
1.2.5.1. Pro: By positioning himself to win back 'soft Tory' voters, whilst also trying not to alienate the left wing of the party, Starmer has left himself and the party appear weak and ineffective.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Starmer has undermined his pledges and the alternatives that they offer. He has stated that the [most important pledge that he made was to turn Labour into a party capable of winning a general election](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-conference-pledges-b1928605.html)(“I stand by the principles and the values behind the pledges I made to our members, but the most important pledge I made was that I would turn it into a party that would be fit for government, capable of winning a general election, I’m not going to be deflected from that.”), casting doubt on his commitment to his other pledges.
1.3. Con: The issues that have plagued Keir Starmer's leadership are not specific to him, and would be a problem for any Labour leader.
1.3.1. Con: It is not the issues themselves which are problematic, but how Starmer has interacted with them.
1.3.1.1. Con: Starmer has decisively and effectively handled the issue of antisemitism within the party, taking [strict disciplinary measures](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/keir-starmer-premiership-sea-change-anti-semitism-labour-938997)(Crucially he took firm disciplinary action against anyone who challenged the report’s findings or continued to play down the scale of anti-Semitism within the party.) in order to counteract the issue.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The Equality and Human Rights Commission found that Labour had [committed unlawful acts](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party)(Our investigation found that the Labour Party has committed unlawful acts.) in regards to its handling of complaints of antisemitism. This delivered an legal responsibility for Starmer to [develop and follow an action plan aimed at tackling these failings](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party)(The Labour Party is now legally obliged to draft an action plan to tackle the unlawful act findings we made. This should be based on our recommendations.).
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Labour Party during the time of the allegations, [rejected the findings of the EHRC report](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/29/jeremy-corbyn-rejects-findings-of-report-on-antisemitism-in-labour)(Jeremy Corbyn has rejected the overall conclusions of a report on antisemitism in Labour, saying the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media...) and claimed that they were overstated for political means.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Antisemitism is often erroneously linked with anti-Zionism and [criticism of the state of Israel](https://theconversation.com/criticizing-israel-is-not-antisemitic-its-academic-freedom-148864)(This summer controversy arose around the hiring of Valentina Azarova as the director of the University of Toronto faculty of law’s international human rights program.\n\nSome faculty accused the dean of rescinding a job offer because public figures were uncomfortable with her scholarly criticism of Israel’s human rights record.\n\nThis incident is particularly concerning to scholars who conduct research on Palestine and Israel. Many see it as part of a growing trend to equate criticism of Israeli state policies with antisemitism.).
1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: It is logical that the man accused of [allowing antisemitism into the party](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45030552)(Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015.) would attempt to minimise the findings of a report against him.
1.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Starmer has used allegations of antisemitism to engage in factionalism by disciplining a number of high-profile Corbyn supporters such as [Rebecca Long-Bailey](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45030552)(Sir Keir sacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.) and [Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45030552)(In a statement, the party said: "In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation.") himself.
1.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Proportional disciplining of party members for offensive acts cannot be considered as factionalism.
1.3.1.1.2.4. Con: Whether the allegations were overstated or not, the controversy and the minimisation of the allegations threatened the [reputation of the entire Labour party](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/politics/article/labour-ehrc-anti-semitism)(Labour’s antisemitism shame is just part of a wider malaise\nThe EHRC report on Labour's antisemitism exposes delusions about the culture and morality of large sections of the party and the long-term damage done to its reputation). Starmer took appropriate and decisive action to combat this.
1.3.1.2. Pro: During a time of national crisis, empty shelves in supermarkets and panic buying at petrol stations, [Starmer prioritised playing party politics at the Labour conference in Brighton](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/angela-rayner-tories-scum-labour-party-needs-keir-starmer-1219813)(But he messed up pretty much every aspect of the plan. Under no possible assessment of our current circumstances could Labour leadership election rules be considered the most important issue facing Starmer today. We are on the brink of a national crisis, with panic buying at petrol stations, empty supermarket shelves, soaring gas prices, inflation, tax rises and benefit cuts.\n\n...\n\nPursuing internal rule changes in this context looked myopic, solipsistic and out of touch. It sent the message that Labour was more interested in exploring its own belly button than the chronic issues facing the country. Worst of all, Starmer couldn’t even win the fight. The unions stood up to him and now he’s had to make do with a watered down version of his original proposals.).
1.3.1.2.1. Con: In order to effectively tackle broader issues, Starmer must stabilise and consolidate his power within Labour.
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.3.2. Pro: The Labour Party left by Jeremy Corbyn faced significant [allegations of antisemitism](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party) and [political division](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/11/09/almost-six-ten-think-labour-party-divided). Any leadership candidate would face challenges in resolving these issues.
1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Many Labour members claim that the public aren't aware of the [depth of the issues within the party](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/year-of-keir-starmer-labour-leadership-anniversary)(Starmer's allies say it would be foolish to read too much into the results given the state of the party when he inherited it a year ago. "You don’t rebuild trust after 12 months and the idea that you can after such a whopping defeat isn’t borne out by anything," said one senior figure.) that Starmer inherited.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Brexit [split the Labour party](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/labours-dilemna.aspx)(Then came Brexit, splitting the Labour vote and the loyalties of its leaders. The Party split between Leave and Remain, north and south, old and young leaving the leadership with a Solomon-esque dilemma, and which \(along with his own weaknesses\) fuelled press antagonism to Corbyn.) and led to a loss of faith in leadership.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Labour popularity had [decreased significantly](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2021/03/29/keir-starmer-one-year-on-a-communication-gap/)(In 2019 Labour recorded its worst share of seats \(202\) and votes \(32.1%\) since 1935. Labour dropped nearly 8 points in the popular vote, after its surprisingly strong showing in 2017. It lost seats sometimes for the first time ever in the famous Red Wall band of Brexit-supporting constituencies across the Midlands, Yorkshire and North East. Its muddled Brexit stance also cost Remain-supporting voters.) under Corbyn.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: If Labour are attempting to rebuild trust with their members they should [endeavor to be more transparent](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-management/columns/restoring-trust-with-transparency)(Building a team where open and honest communications is the norm and not just complying with the rules requires a constant focus on transparency. As a leader you need to ensure that the same message is being delivered to your team, customers and suppliers. This will lead to a genuine trust and that will lead to results.) with them about the realities of the party.
1.3.2.3. Con: In 2018, Labour members themselves said [divisions within the party were being exaggerated](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-poll-says-antisemitism-row-is-exaggerated-8tdj7wffh)(Nearly eight out of ten Labour members believe that accusations of antisemitism are being exaggerated to damage Jeremy Corbyn and stifle legitimate criticism of Israel, according to a YouGov poll for The Times.\n\nThe leader was still overwhelmingly backed by members, with 80 per cent saying that he was doing a good job and 61 per cent saying he was handling the antisemitism crisis well. Some 69 per cent supported his response to the Salisbury poisoning, after he seemed reluctant to blame the Kremlin.) to damage Corbyn. The party Starmer took over was therefore not as divided as people thought.
1.3.3. Con: Many of the issues surrounding Starmer's leadership, such as his lack of charisma and his lack of policy clarity, are directly linked to his personality and political tactics. Such issues would not be a problem for all potential Labour leaders.
1.3.3.1. Pro: For Starmer to be successful and compensate for his lack of charisma, he needs to show efficacy as a leader, something he has yet to do.
1.3.4. Pro: Boris Johnson is a formidable political opponent. Any opposition leader would struggle to hold him to account.
1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Johnson seems impervious to criticism.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Dominic Cummings, who used to be Johnson's closest advisor, publicly described him as ["unfit for the job"](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/dominic-cummings-covid-chaos-no-10-like-out-of-control-movie-boris-johnson)(Dominic Cummings has laid bare the “surreal” chaos in Downing Street in March last year as the government grappled with the Covid pandemic, portraying the prime minister as obsessed with the media and making constant U-turns, “like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the aisle to the other”.\n\nDuring an extraordinary evidence session to MPs at Westminster on Wednesday, Boris Johnson’s former chief aide targeted the prime minister for personal criticism, accusing him of being “unfit for the job”.) of Prime Minister. Johnson's popularity began to slide immediately afterwards - it is now at its [lowest level](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/07/boris-johnson-approval-rating-slips-to-lowest-level-since-he-became-prime-minister)(Boris Johnson’s personal approval rating has slipped to its lowest level since he became prime minister, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.\n\nHis overall approval rating has fallen to -16, down from the -13 he recorded two weeks ago and -8 a fortnight before that. It is even lower than the -15 he recorded back in January, when Britain was in the grip of a Covid peak, lockdown measures were in place and the NHS was under severe pressure.\n\nThe latest poll shows that 34% of voters now approve of the job he is doing as prime minister, while 49% disapprove – up two points on the previous poll.

Con: Johnson's approval rating tanked at key moments, such as when [Matt Hancock resigned](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/matt-hancock-boris-johnson-poll-b1878917.html)(Voters believe that Matt Hancock’s resignation as health secretary made Boris Johnson look weak and the government sleazy, according to the findings of a new poll.\n\nThe results of the Savanta ComRes survey for The Independent suggest that voters were not convinced by the prime minister’s attempt to imply that he had forced Hancock out after he was caught on camera breaking social distancing rules in a passionate clinch with a married aide.\n\nSome 50 per cent said the affair made the PM look “weak”, against just 32 per cent who said he looked “strong”, in a clear indication that voters think Mr Johnson was forced to bend to pressure for Mr Hancock’s removal, rather than being in control of events.\n\nAnd 48 per cent said that Hancock’s affair with Gina Coladangelo and his subsequent resignation made them more likely to regard the government as sleazy, against just 9 per cent who said they made it less likely.) and when the [winter lockdown was announced shortly before the holidays](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/poll-reveals-anger-over-boris-23196545)(Public fury over Boris Johnson's handling of Covid Christmas rules has been laid bare by a snap poll.\n\nA new YouGov poll, conducted after the Tier 4 rule changes yesterday, found 61% think the government handled the coronavirus rules over the festive season badly.\n\nSome 38% said it had been handled "very badly".\n\nAlmost half of those polled said they "strongly support" the introduction of Tier 4- which see non-essential retail and travel banned for around a third of the population of England from today.\n\nAnd in total some 74% felt supportive of Tier 4 - with just 17% opposed.). A competent opposition could have capitalised on this public backlash.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Johnson's [egocentric style of politics](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boris-johnson-brexit-no-deal-leadership-charisma-ego-a9090086.html)(That is a red flag for decisions simply driven by ego. Now, a healthy ego is no bad thing to have for a leader, but it becomes problematic when ego takes over and is put in the mix with power, arrogance, cockiness and the notion of being “seen to be right”. This can trigger blind spots in how we perceive the world around us.\n\nMany people perceive that Johnson displays these flaws, and if he and his advisers really are stuck in this ego-driven “master of the universe” delusion, then we could be in trouble.) gives the British public a single person to look up to, making him an ideal leader for times of national crisis.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Johnson's eccentricities have also lead to him [comparing Muslim women to letter boxes](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45083275)("I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."),[referring to gay men as "'tank-topped bumboys' and calling black people 'piccaninnies' with 'watermelon smiles'](https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6?r=US&IR=T)
1.3.4.4. Con: Johnson is [divisive within the Conservative Party](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/12/boris-johnson-rebelliousness-tory-party-deep-divisions)(Faced with a run of relatively poor recent opinion polls, many in the parliamentary party have little stomach for an ambitious climate agenda. \n\n\[...\]\n\nThrow into the mix the reality that climate scepticism remains only a dormant part of some Conservatives’ political DNA, particularly on the libertarian right. Add the fact that Nigel Farage, whose influence still obsesses a section of the Tory party, now accuses the UN of alarmism and warns of waves of eco-refugees. In this volatile atmosphere, there is deep Tory unease about the financial costs of net zero, the reliability of the technological alternatives and the political price of any grand strategic approach. As a result there is real potential for an alarmed Tory horse to throw its overconfident rider out of the saddle.). A good opposition leader would be able to capitalise on those divisions.
1.4. Pro: Keir Starmer has proved completely ineffective as a leader of the opposition.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.
1.4.2. Pro: Labour's electoral performance since Starmer became leader has been [poor](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57033273)(The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland.\n\nThe party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14.\n\nThis follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election.).
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.4.2.2. Con: Labour successfully defended its seat in Batley and Spen in a [recent by-election](https://theconversation.com/batley-and-spen-what-bitter-uk-by-election-won-by-sister-of-murdered-mp-tells-us-about-state-of-british-politics-163839)(At 5:25am it was declared. Kim Leadbeater was the new Labour MP for Batley and Spen, beating her nearest rival, the Conservative candidate Ryan Stephenson, by 323 votes. It was close but a clear victory for Labour.).
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Simply defending existing seats is not enough for Labour to gain popularity and power again.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Starmer's election performance has not been poor as growing the party has not been his aim. Starmer ran on a platform of [reunifying and stabilising](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56461645)(Following his convincing victory, Sir Keir initially appeared to be serious about unifying the party.\n\nFor example, he appointed Morgan McSweeney - who ran Liz Kendall's ill-fated leadership bid in 2015 - to LOTO, the Leader of the Opposition's Office, but he also found a role for Simon Fletcher - a key figure in Jeremy Corbyn's successful leadership bid.) the party, therefore he should not be judged on the growth of the party under his early leadership.
1.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: In order to return to government, Labour must retain their current support, including far left voters, win back the votes they lost to the Tories in 2019 and engage newly registered voters in order [to reach the 124 seat majority](https://willsadler.medium.com/to-have-a-chance-of-forming-a-government-in-2024-labour-must-firstly-face-the-maths-d56a6c52afba)(Labour’s pressing responsibility is not only to lead our country’s progressive majority. The party must also fight to unite it. This is the only way that a Labour-led government appears on the not-too-distant horizon, which by then will be needed more urgently than ever before.).
1.4.2.2.2. Con: Labour success in [Batley and Spen was marginal](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57691543)(Mr Galloway, standing for the Workers Party of Britain party, had targeted Labour voters with the aim of toppling Sir Keir as Labour leader.\n\nHis campaign sought to win support from voters unhappy at the party's stance on issues including the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and the disputed territory of Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan.\n\nAn ethnically diverse seat, about 20% of the population is from an Asian background, with just under 19% being Muslim.) due to the growing influence of the Workers party which reflects the work Labour must do to retain their voters.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: Despite growing discontent with Labour in the North of England, they held on to their seat in [Batley and Spen by 323](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57691543) votes.
1.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: Batley and Spen is an [opportunity for Labour to learn](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57692953)(I am not saying Jeremy Corbyn was an angel but his whole life it was clear what he stands for, his whole moral current.\n\n"Our perception of Keir Starmer is he has no policies, no drive. He sits on the fence."\n\nHe added: "We need to send a message to the Labour leadership, and other parties that Muslim votes matter.") how to improve their performance running local candidates, focusing on local issues as well as national ones and establishing Starmer's position more clearly.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.4.
1.4.4. Pro: Keir Starmer has repeatedly failed to hold the government to account for its failings.
1.4.4.1. Con: Starmer has opposed the government on a number of grounds, such as [the social care plan](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/08/keir-starmer-orders-mps-to-vote-against-governments-social-care-plan), the [ending of the universal credit uplift](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/15/keir-starmer-accuses-boris-johnson-of-hammering-workers) and the [handling of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2021/sep/06/keir-starmer-johnson-was-incapable-of-international-leadership-over-afghanistan-video).
1.4.4.2. Con: Starmer has provided pragmatic and responsible opposition, shying away from "[opposition for opposition's sake](https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/sir-keir-starmer-full-statement-new-labour-leader-engage-constructively-government-coronavirus-415523)".
1.4.4.3. Pro: Keir Starmer [failed to capitalise](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/10/johnson-tax-workers-labour-starmer-tories)(The national insurance hike to fund social care should have been a major political victory for Labour, personally gift wrapped by Boris Johnson. The policy amounts to a raid on the living standards of workers, whose wages have already been squeezed, to ensure “the children of Surrey homeowners can receive bigger inheritances”, as an unnamed cabinet minister eloquently put it. \n\n\[...\]\n\nAnd yet Tory MPs are roaring with jubilation. It’s easy to see why. Labour failed to offer a coherent alternative and allowed Boris Johnson to evade scrutiny by highlighting this absence. Keir Starmer correctly pointed out the Tories were violating an election pledge not to hike NI contributions, but let’s be real here: if Johnson’s supporters cared about his dishonesty, they would have stopped voting for him long ago. Yet Labour seems to think the prime minister’s lack of integrity means he is only ever one scandal away from political ruin.) on Boris Johnson's healthcare policies breaking one of the Conservative Party's manifesto pledges.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Labour's failure to offer a [legitimate policy alternative](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/08/keir-starmer-tories-tax-hike-labour-austerity-low-taxes)(Although Labour has criticised the new levy, the party has no concrete ideas of its own about how the extra spending would be funded. If the party thinks a wealth tax or higher national insurance contributions for the better off could be the solution to the Tories’ new levy, both of which would raise serious amounts of money, it has not said so.) to Johnson's proposed tax hike cost them a political advantage.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: Starmer's has spoken out against Johnson's proposed tax hike claiming that Johnson's approach amounts to ["hammering working people"](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/15/keir-starmer-accuses-boris-johnson-of-hammering-workers)(Boris Johnson has been accused of “hammering” workers with a “broken tax system” as the end of the universal credit uplift and the hike to national insurance loom.\n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused the prime minister of “making a bad situation worse” by in effect cutting the pay of those including supermarket workers and teaching assistants by more than £1,000 a year.).
1.4.4.4. Pro: Keir Starmer has displayed [his ability](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58626261)(And while his forensic, solicitor-like approach at the dispatch box won him plaudits when he did challenge the government - such as calling for lockdown sooner during the second wave - some in the party questioned whether he had been too soft early on.) to stand up to the government, as such his lack of action represents an unwillingness to oppose the government.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: In his Labour conference speech, [Starmer established his plan](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/29/keir-starmer-promises-serious-plan-for-government-in-labour-conference-speech)(“We have a fuel crisis, a pay crisis, a goods crisis and a cost of living crisis – all at the same time,” Starmer said, urging the prime minister to “either get a grip or get out of the way and let us clear up this mess”.) for opposing the government.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Starmer is playing his politics safe, and is [relying on a mistake from Johnson](https://labourlist.org/2021/05/keir-starmers-biggest-mistake-was-to-underestimate-boris-johnson/)(A core plank of Labour’s strategy has been to point to, as they see it, Johnson’s obvious incompetence. Yet the public, it seems, disagree. \n\n\[....\]\n\nBecause it is a self-evident truth to most in the Labour Party that Johnson is wholly unsuited to the office of Prime Minister, the assumption is that Starmer automatically appears a more credible alternative to voters by default. This partly explains his passive strategy prior to the local elections – wait long enough and voters will eventually see through the Prime Minister, so the thinking goes.) to seal his future.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Starmer failed to oppose the government on the introduction of the Spy Cops Bill, [which allows undercover police to break the law.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/14/spycops-bill-undermines-rule-of-law-green-light-serious-crimes-undercover-officers)
1.4.4.5.1. Con: Starmer defended support of the Spy Cops Bill as undercover [agents are still bound by the Human Rights Act](https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2020/10/23/starmer-defends-labour-position-on-spy-cops-bill/)(The Labour leader said “there is no bigger advocate for human rights” than him, and told Mr Grant that any powers authorised for use by undercover agents would have to comply with the Human Rights Act.\n\nHe said: “On the face of this Bill, there is a clear requirement that says nothing can be authorised if it conflicts with or breaches the Human Rights Act.\n\n“If you can’t authorise something that would breach the Human Rights Act, how on earth can you make the argument that you can break human rights under this Bill?\n\n“You’re not allowed to sign an authorisation if what you’re authorising will break the Human Rights Act.).
1.4.4.5.2. Con: Starmer argued that the Spy Cops Bill would [encourage transparency about the powers of the state](https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2020/10/23/starmer-defends-labour-position-on-spy-cops-bill/)(He claimed the Bill would increase the transparency of powers already available to undercover agents.\n\nHe said: “I’m a strong believer that if the state has powers – undercover agents, police officers, I don’t really mind – they should be on the face of legislation, not hidden in the shadows.\n\n“Opposing this Bill means, do you get rid of these powers? No, they just get hidden in the shadows with no tribunal you can go to and no commission.\n\n“All my life I’ve believed that if the state is going to have power it should be on the face of legislation so everybody can see what it is and what the issues are.”) and as such increase accountability.
1.4.4.5.3. Pro: Corbyn, and many other party members, [defied Starmer's move to abstain](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/reminder-of-the-34-labour-mps-who-defied-keir-starmer-to-vote-against-the-spycops-bill-257499/)(Reminders of the 34 Labour MPs who defied Sir Keir Starmer to vote against the SpyCops Bill have been making the rounds on social media today ahead of a crucial vote on a policing bill that will make its way to the House of Commons next week.\n\nJeremy Corbyn and Richard Burgon are among the MPs who have committed to voting against the bill which will cover a wide range of areas, from sentencing to digital information, but has a specific section on the policing of protests.) and chose to vote against the Spy Cops Bill.
1.4.4.5.4. Pro: Starmer moved to [abstain from voting](https://labourlist.org/2020/10/exclusive-starmer-says-labour-should-not-vote-down-spycops-bill-even-if-unamended/) on the Spy Cops Bill, which would allow the bill to pass.
1.4.4.6. Con: Starmer has put in several [good performances](https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/voices/keir-starmer-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-russia-report-a9631961.html)(A\n\ns the weeks go on, Sir Keir Starmer is morphing from a lawyer to a streetfighter. He needs to. Because the dangerous glint in Boris Johnson’s eye at the start of Prime Minister’s Questions carried the unspoken message: “Watch me take this guy out.”\n\nThis was the first clash since the Dominic Cummings scandal - a Downing Street breach of its own rules so outrageous and embarrassing that some MPs expected the PM to arrive in the House wearing a hair shirt and a tight-fitting celice. Penance, however, is not a Johnsonian habit.) during Prime Minister's Questions.
1.4.4.6.1. Con: Behaviour in Prime Minister's Questions is purely performative if not backed with concrete policy solutions.
1.4.4.6.1.1. Con: The performative nature of Prime Minister's Questions \(PMQs\) is a problem with the format of PMQs, not the leader of the opposition per se.
1.4.4.6.1.2. Con: The purpose of Prime Minister's Questions is to hold the Prime Minister to account for their policy solutions, not for the opposition to put forward their own.
1.4.4.6.2. Pro: Starmer's background of working as a barrister has likely benefited him in rhetorically confronting Boris Johnson.
1.5. Con: There are no viable alternatives to Keir Starmer.
1.5.1. Pro: The most likely alternative, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner, would be a worse leader than Starmer.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Rayner is relatively unpopular. According to [YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/politics/popularity/labour-politicians/all)(The Most Popular Labour Politicians \(Q2 2021\)\n\nPopularity is the % of people who have a positive opinion of a Labour politician.) \(a prominent British polling organisation\), she is only the 31st most popular Labour politician - behind Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Polls are often [wrong](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/latest-polls-labour-conservative-brexit-wrong-average-348081)(Even if the polls start to agree, it doesn’t mean they’re figured out the right way to do it. In fact, this is often a problem in itself, what’s known as ‘herding.’ Polls end up converging to a similar point, as pollsters attempt to make their models as accurate as possible. This doesn’t mean they’re lying, but it’s important to look out for outliers – polls which radically differ from the mean. If there aren’t any at all, it’s possible the polls are all adjusting in the wrong way.\n\nPolls are the best way we have of looking into what the state of the race is, but it’s also important not to overvalue them. Single polls, generally, aren’t a good indicator, but watching for trends, especially across multiple pollsters, might be a good way to get a sense of how the race is going. But there’s always going to be a lot to fight for, as things change fast.).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Rayner was [on Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37588143) from 2016-2020, including the shadow cabinet that saw [the worst Labour result since 1935](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50799792)(Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935 on Thursday and saw its vote share fall by eight points.).
1.5.1.2. Pro: Rayner has courted controversy - most notably when she was accused of [calling a Conservative MP "scum"](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/21/angela-rayner-accused-of-calling-tory-mp-scum-in-commons)(The Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has apologised for calling a Tory MP “scum” in the House of Commons after he criticised her party’s opposition to the government’s handling of the pandemic.) during a debate. She is therefore unlikely to appeal across parties.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: By displaying such a vocal opposition to the Conservative Party, Rayner displayed the very strength that Starmer [appears to lack](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/is-keir-starmer-strong-or-weak) according to polls.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Rayner recently referred to the entire Conservative party as "[a bunch of scum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/26/angela-rayner-stands-by-remarks-calling-tories-scum)(Angela Rayner has stood by her description of the Conservatives as “homophobic, racist, misogynistic … scum” after the Labour leader distanced himself from her words.\n\nOn Sunday, amid tensions with Starmer over the party’s proposed rule changes, the deputy Labour leader declined to apologise for her remarks, which were made at a Labour conference reception the day before.\n\n“We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile … banana republic, vile, nasty, Etonian … piece of scum,” she said at the event, before adding that she had “held back a little”.)" despite [apologising](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54638267)(Labour's deputy leader has apologised for using the word "scum" during a debate over coronavirus restrictions.\n\nAngela Rayner made the comment in the Commons on Wednesday during a speech by Tory MP Chris Clarkson.\n\nThe MP questioned her remark, while the deputy speaker reprimanded her for her language.\n\nMs Rayner has now issued a statement, saying: "I apologise for the language that I used in a heated debate in Parliament earlier.") for previously calling a single Tory MP "scum" in the House of Commons. This makes her a hypocrite.
1.5.1.3. Con: Rayner emphasises her [working class background](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/10/labour-has-talked-down-to-voters-for-too-long-says-angela-rayner)(Rayner said she owed everything to the Labour movement, a veiled comparison with other figures. “It’s only because of the Labour party and our trade union movement that I’ve gone from no GCSEs and a minimum wage job to where I am today,” she said.) and relates more to Labour's core voters than Starmer, who [seems more middle class](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/keir-starmer-looks-and-sounds-middle-class-precisely-because-he-s-working-class)(He is a Northerner only in London terms, and as former Director of Public Prosecutions, doesn't sound like he's come from a tough background. He has spent the past few days trying to overcome this great disadvantage as much as he has tried to articulate what he would actually stand for as Labour leader, telling the Today programme that 'my background isn't what they think it is'. \n\[...\]\nBut Starmer is right to defend his background as it isn't what people say it is. His father worked in a factory as a toolmaker and his mother was a nurse. She was in and out of hospital with a rare illness which eventually forced her to stop working. Starmer was the first in his family to go to university. He is from a humble background.).
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Keir Starmer's [middle class](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/keir-starmer-looks-and-sounds-middle-class-precisely-because-he-s-working-class)(What makes him seem as though he has had the same comfortable upbringing as the stereotypical politician is that he has learned to look the part. This isn't something that occurs to those who aren't worried about their social status because they are already from the sort of backgrounds that regularly send people into professions and even Parliament.) appearance could be used to his advantage with more conservative voters, though it [disadvantages him with Labour](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/keir-starmer-looks-and-sounds-middle-class-precisely-because-he-s-working-class)(But once you've got through all the hurdles which require you to look the part, you suddenly discover that it is far more beneficial, particularly in the Labour Party, to sound and talk as though you really are one of the Four Yorkshiremen).
1.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: Voters respond to [candidates that resemble them](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/october22/morph-102208.html) - Keir Starmer presents himself in a middle class manner, and therefore may appeal to [moderate Conservative](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/october22/morph-102208.html)("When you look at who's really swapping their votes, it's the independent voters and weak party affiliates," Bailenson said. "It's the moderate people. If your heart and mind are set on voting for George Bush, this is not going to change your mind.") voters.
1.5.1.3.1.2.

1.5.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.3.3. Con: Keir Starmer is from a [working class background](https://www.tatler.com/article/sir-keir-starmer-posh-facade)(Starmer is right to defend his background. His father worked in a factory as a toolmaker and his mother was a nurse. Keir, himself, was named after the first Labour MP, Keir Hardie. His mother was in and out of hospital with a rare illness which eventually forced her to stop working. Starmer was the first in his family to go to university. Point proven: he has risen from a humble background.).
1.5.1.3.4. Pro: British working class voters have [largely defected to more conservative parties or have stopped voting](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/the-re-shaping-of-class-voting-in-the-2019-election-by-geoffrey-evans-and-jonathan-mellon/)(In this blog we show how this realignment of the traditional axis of class voting happened over a relatively short period between 2015 and 2019, though the seeds of this realignment were sown some decades ago when ‘New Labour’ was re-positioned as a catch-all party minimizing its ties with trade unions and the working class. Since then, working class voters have increasingly chosen not to vote at all, or have defected to the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and, eventually, UKIP. As we showed in a previous BES blog, by 2015 UKIP was the most working class party in Britain.). Labour need to recapture their votes.
1.5.1.4. Con: [Someone other than Rayner](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1434646/labour-leader-replace-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-andy-burnham-evg)(While it seems currently unlikely that Sir Keir will ditch his tenure after only a year in office, two key names have cropped up already as the next potential leaders of the party.\n\nAngela Rayner\nDeputy leader Angela Rayner was sacked by her boss as party chair following the disastrous results last week, leading to speculation she could be the next to run a leadership bid.\n\[...\]\n\nAndy Burnham\nThe so-called ‘King in the North’ Andy Burnham has also been tipped for the top job following his landslide win in Manchester’s mayoral race.) could be elected Leader of the Labour Party.
1.5.2. Pro: Despite the [enduring presence of Corbyn loyalists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-starmer-corbyn-conor-mcginn-wes-streeting-b1927228.html) in the Labour party, there is currently no realistic option of [his return to Labour leadership](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/08/jeremy-corbyn-could-be-reinstated-as-labour-mp-under-leftwing-challenge-to-starmer).

1.5.2.2.1. Con: Corbyn was criticized previously for [issuing a 'non-apology'](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18877971.corbyn-accused-non-apology-explanation-anti-semitism-report-comments/) in regards to his comments on the EHCR report. It is unlikely that he will obey Starmer, [a man he has heavily criticized](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-jeremy-corbyn-b1926914.html)(Jeremy Corbyn has accused Sir Keir Starmer of giving the Conservative government a “free pass time and again”, as he also criticised the leadership for “turning its back” on “hope for the future”.\n\nThe remarks from the former Labour leader come amid a dramatic fallout between Sir Keir and the left over controversial changes to the party’s rule book that were branded “undemocratic” and risked “civil war” in the party.), and issue an apology that pleases him.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Jeremy Corbyn does not represent [the leadership that Labour](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/i-was-heart-corbynism-heres-why-we-lost/)(Only around 20 Labour MPs had genuinely backed Corbyn. The politically balanced shadow cabinet and the retention of the previous chief whip was both a genuine attempt at pluralism and an anticipatory suing for peace.\n\nThe first year of Corbynism established only that Labour was dysfunctional. Despite the popularity of his policy-heavy leadership bid, none of it had been articulated from office, because it couldn’t get it through the shadow cabinet.) needs at the moment.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Corbyn [inspired new membership](https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2017/06/why-jeremy-corbyn-new-leader-new-times)(Corbyn not only gave the lie to this but also demonstrated that he, far more than any of the other party leaders, was in tune with the times, the candidate of modernity.\n\nCrises, great turning points, new conjunctures, new forms of consciousness are by definition incubators of the new. That is one of the great sources of their fascination. We can now see the line of linkage between the thousands of young people who gave Corbyn his overwhelming victory in the leadership election in 2015 and the millions of young people who were enthused by his general election campaign in 2017. It is no accident that it was the young rather than the middle-aged or the seniors who were in the vanguard: the young are the bearers and products of the new, they are the lightning conductors of change.) by challenging existing Labour leader trends and being in touch with the times.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Starmer won a decisive victory in his leadership pledge by promising to [move Labour away from Corbyn's leadership style and its consequences](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56461645)("There are three focal points of power in the party - the leader's office, the general secretary and the national executive," he says.\n\n"If you control all three of these, you can usually steer the party in the direction you want to go in."\n\nAnd Mr Akehurst says the nature of the party has changed markedly from Mr Corbyn to Sir Keir.\n\n"Membership is down on its absolute peak but in historic terms 512,000 is a huge membership.\n\n"And it is being kind of reshaped in Starmer's image," he says.).
1.5.2.4. Pro: Corbyn himself had [very low approval ratings](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/01/30/brexit-indecisiveness-seriously-damaging-corbyn)(In our most recent survey the Labour leader’s favourability fell to 22%, around three times smaller than the group of 67% who had an unfavourable opinion. This gives him a new all-time low net score of -45.) by the time that he stepped down from leadership.
1.5.3. Con: Andy Burnham, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, is exceptionally popular and has successfully challenged Boris Johnson [on a number of issues.](https://www.ft.com/content/e724ec26-fdd7-4d40-8aa4-da3690f4cc6d)(Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has won a new convert. Gemma Fish, 38, who runs a charity in Salford, has never voted before but in elections on Thursday she expects to change the habit of a lifetime. “He stood up for Manchester,” she said.\n\nBurnham last October memorably resisted Boris Johnson’s plan to lock down the city without what he regarded as adequate financial help. “It’s brutal to be honest, isn’t it?” Burnham said in an emotional press conference outside the city’s Bridgewater Hall.\n\nThe mayor was dubbed the “king of the north” — exactly the kind of local champion envisaged when George Osborne, former Conservative chancellor, created a new breed of metro mayors first elected in 2017.)
1.5.3.1. Pro: Burnham expressed [his willingness](https://news.sky.com/story/election-results-party-should-get-in-touch-if-they-need-me-labours-andy-burnham-does-not-dismiss-future-leadership-bid-12300272) to go for leadership should the party wish it.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Burnham has [expressed his support for Starmer](https://news.sky.com/story/labour-keir-starmers-leadership-in-turmoil-as-poll-finds-69-of-members-would-prefer-andy-burnham-in-charge-12345377)(I’m supporting Keir - I want him to win the next general election, and I will do whatever I can to help him achieve that”, he told the magazine.) and said he would only take leadership in the future.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Burnham has been widely praised as an effective leader.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Starmer himself drew attention to the [efficacy of Burnham's leadership](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/andy-burnham-is-what-labour-20495970)(“What Andy Burnham has done is show very clearly what a difference it makes when Labour is in power,” he said.\n\n“And I think if you asked anybody across Greater Manchester who stood up for their communities in the pandemic everybody - but everybody - would say Andy Burnham did.") in the Greater Manchester Area.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: 70% of Labour members say [Burnham would be a better leader](https://news.sky.com/story/labour-keir-starmers-leadership-in-turmoil-as-poll-finds-69-of-members-would-prefer-andy-burnham-in-charge-12345377) than Starmer.
1.5.3.2.3. Con: Burnham has [never held a role](https://members.parliament.uk/member/1427/career) with demands equivalent to those involved in leading the [current Labour party](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/the-structural-challenges-facing-starmer-and-labour/)(Imagine Starmer and the Labour Party are currently in a ship in the middle of the pandemic storm. The proverb ‘sit tight in the fishing boat despite the rising wind and waves’ comes to mind. Labour needs to first survive the storm before it can assess where to go next.).
1.5.3.3. Con: Burnham [is not an MP](https://news.sky.com/story/labour-keir-starmers-leadership-in-turmoil-as-poll-finds-69-of-members-would-prefer-andy-burnham-in-charge-12345377)(However there is a clear preference for Mr Burnham - who could not stand immediately since he is not an MP - over Sir Keir) so could not feasibly replace Starmer.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: It is easy for Burnham to challenge the Prime Minister when he does not face parliamentary challenges nor shoulder the responsibilities of an MP.
1.5.3.3.2. Con: Burnham [resigned from the parliament and the role in the shadow cabinet](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14769614.labours-andy-burnham-quits-shadow-cabinet-focus-manchester-mayoral-bid/)(He said: "This is my 10th conference speaking to you as a cabinet or shadow cabinet minister. And it will be my last.\n\n"It is time for me to turn my full focus to Greater Manchester. That's why I can tell you all first today that I have asked Jeremy to plan a new shadow cabinet without me, although I will of course stay until it is in place.) in order to [become Mayor of Greater Manchester](https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/the-mayor/)(Andy Burnham was elected Mayor of Greater Manchester in May 2017, and was re-elected for a second term in May 2021. \n\nPrior to being Mayor, Andy was MP for Leigh from 2001. In Government, Andy has held Ministerial positions at the Home Office, Department of Health and the Treasury. In 2008 he became Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, before returning to Health as Secretary of State in 2009.\n\nIn opposition, Andy has served as Shadow Education Secretary, Shadow Health Secretary and Shadow Home Secretary.). Therefore it is a very real possibility that he could retake his seat should the conditions arise for him to replace Starmer.
1.6. Pro: Keir Starmer has unclear policies.
1.6.1. Con: Starmer released a [12,000 word essay](https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Road-Ahead-FINAL_WEB-fri-1.pdf) on what the Labour Party stands for in September 2021.
1.6.1.1. Con: Starmer [mentioned Scotland only three times](https://www.thenational.scot/news/19599668.keir-starmer-essay-labour-leader-mentions-scotland-three-times-12-000-word-effort/)(LABOUR leader Sir Keir Starmer’s 12,000 word essay on his plans for Labour was finally unveiled last night – and it mentioned Scotland just three times.) in the entire document. The policy of the Labour Party towards all Scottish issues is still unclear.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Labour only hold [two constituencies in the SNP dominated Scotland](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-57028315). It may be a wise tactical decision to focus on taking seats from the Conservative Party than expanding into Scotland.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is more beneficial for Labour to focus on taking seats from the Conservatives as it not only increases Labour representation but also reduces that of the Conservative Party.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Coverage of this essay suggests that the British media now know [more clearly what Starmer stands for](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58654046)(Sir Keir Starmer has published an 11,500 word essay on what he stands for and how he wants to change the UK, ahead of his party's conference.\n\nThe Labour leader says the country is at a crossroads after the pandemic and is "crying out for change".\n\nIf elected prime minister, he says he would create "a society built on everyone's contribution".\n\nSir Keir has faced criticism from some in Labour that he lacks vision and voters don't know what his values are.\n\nHe is due to deliver his first in-person conference speech to party members since becoming leader last year, in Brighton next week.\n\nIn his essay The Road Ahead, published by the Fabian Society think tank, he sketches out many of the themes that are likely to feature in his speech, saying he wants Labour to be "Britain's bricks and mortar".).
1.6.1.2.1. Con: If the media are required to read a 12,000 word essay in order to understand Starmer and his policies, then Starmer has a severe communication issue.
1.6.1.3. Con: Almost [nobody will read a 12,000 word essay](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmers-14000-word-essay-on-labours-future-wont-be-read-in-the-miners-welfare-club-yorkshire-mp-jon-trickett-warns-3380719)(Keir Starmer's 14,000-word essay on Labour's future 'won't be read in the miners' welfare club', Yorkshire MP Jon Trickett warns\n\nYorkshire MP Jon Trickett has hit out at Keir Starmer's plan to release a 14,000 word essay setting out his vision for the Labour party - questioning whether target voters will actually read it.). What Labour need are catchy policy slogans like "levelling up", not self-indulgent novellas.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: The essay was [meant to provide the intellectual underpinnings of Starmer's conference speech](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/22/keir-starmer-essay-sets-labour-on-course-for-centre-ground)(During his first 18 months, the Labour leader has been beset with consistent complaints from within his own party that he has failed to make clear to the public what he stands for – a charge his team reject, pointing to the difficulty of gaining a hearing during a public health emergency.\n\nIn the essay, set to provide the backbone for his first party conference speech in front of a live audience, Starmer says a Labour government would hand back powers from Whitehall to local communities, tackle inequality, and ensure effort is rewarded with better jobs and opportunities.) in 2021. It was not meant to be read by everyone, and most people will get the gist of its message from the coverage of his speech.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: The [length and nature of this essay](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmers-14000-word-essay-on-labours-future-wont-be-read-in-the-miners-welfare-club-yorkshire-mp-jon-trickett-warns-3380719)(The left-wing MP, who represents Hemsworth, told the Daily Telegraph: "I don't think the ex-miners at the miners' welfare club in my area are going to be reading 14,000 words and I don't think many people in the country are to be honest.\n\n“The former Labour voters who went to the Tories or to Brexit won’t be studying a 14,000-word article. They are looking for concrete, punchy opposition to the Government, and they’re looking for a clear policy.”) suggest that Starmer is not focussing on courting working-class voters.
1.6.1.4. Con: [Multiple publications](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/labour-keir-starmer-essay-voters-b1919338.html)(The answer, on both counts, appears to be “no”. Because the 14,000 words, in their grandiose, verbose, sickening entirety will be published, in full, before the Labour Party conference in two weeks time.\n\nThese 14,000 words are not expected to contain a single policy announcement, but rather become the intellectual foundation for who Starmer is, and what he wants to do with the Labour Party \(we must hope the phrase ‘win an election’ creeps in there somewhere.\)) consider the essay to contain ["few concrete policies"](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/22/keir-starmer-essay-sets-labour-on-course-for-centre-ground)(The pamphlet includes few concrete policies, but is peppered with hints of the party’s direction.\n\nStarmer describes it as a “disgrace,” that class sizes have been allowed to reach their highest level in 20 years, for example. Tony Blair’s pledge card for the 1997 general election included a promise to cap class sizes at 30.).
1.6.2. Pro: Starmer has [publicly failed to clarify](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/what-does-starmer-actually-stand-for-)(By contrast, after Labour’s electoral pasting in early May, Starmer did a now-notorious TV clip in which he promised Labour would listen and change. Yet when pressed to give a single specific example of something he would prioritise, he couldn’t do so. Not one thing.) what alternative Labour offer to the Conservatives.
1.6.2.1. Con: [Starmer's 10 pledges](https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/) are a clear declaration of the differing views and alternative options offered by the Labour Party.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Starmer's policies adequately communicate he and Labour's values, which is a [powerful form of political messaging](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/05/15/political-messages-values-matter-policy/)(“We find that the values a candidate used to advocate for their policies were more influential on the popular support they received than the policies themselves,” said Willer, a professor of sociology in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences. “We may underestimate just how much framing matters, often more than the objective features of the thing being framed,” he said.).
1.6.2.2. Con: The incident referred to above was an [on-the-spot question asked on television](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/what-does-starmer-actually-stand-for-)(Starmer did a now-notorious TV clip in which he promised Labour would listen and change. Yet when pressed to give a single specific example of something he would prioritise, he couldn’t do so. Not one thing.) and not a reflection of the reality of Starmer's propositions.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Successful politicians such as Theresa May are famous for [not answering questions](https://theconversation.com/theresa-may-has-a-very-special-technique-for-avoiding-questions-67424)(May’s responses are polite and relevant to the substance of the question, but do not provide the requested information. She doesn’t say whether the UK should have access to the single European market, nor whether she would prevent a second independence referendum in Scotland. Notably, across the two interviews, a mean 88% of her non-replies include this strategy of giving a non-specific response to a specific question.). It is unreasonable to criticise Starmer for standard political behaviour.
1.6.2.2.2. Con: Politicians get asked on-the-spot questions all the time. If Starmer can't clarify his party's position when asked directly, Labour should choose somebody who can.
1.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: The reaction to [Ed Balls struggling to answer a maths question](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3027693/What-s-six-times-seven-Ed-Balls-left-stumped-basic-maths-question-eventually-coming-answer.html)(What's six times seven? Ed Balls left stumped by basic maths question before eventually coming up with the answer\n\n- Labour’s shadow chancellor got the right answer after a ten second pause\n- He said it was 'always dangerous to answer those sorts of questions'\n- Comes after he revealed he did not want to answer maths questions on TV\n- Told Susanna Reid that the maths brain in his family was his mother in law) showed that wrong or embarrassing answers to simple questions gives ammunition to Labour's enemies.
1.6.2.2.2.2. Con: Measured responses to complicated questions are better than kneejerk reactions. Starmer should take time to answer questions correctly rather than blurt out whatever comes into his mind.
1.6.2.3. Pro: One member of Starmer's [shadow cabinet claimed that](https://www.ft.com/content/a1ee756c-3068-4b02-8778-f293a19dda27)(His first task, then — and one he hopes to begin at his party conference and in a new pamphlet — is to build a critique of Britain under Boris Johnson which resonates with the voters and goes beyond being merely a voice of the disadvantaged. This will also help define him. For all the calls for more policies, what voters really want is to understand a leader’s core values and sense that he is on their side. This has been missing. One shadow cabinet member sighs that “apart from criminal justice policy it’s not clear where Keir’s north star is”.) "apart from criminal justice policy it's not clear where Keir's north star is".
1.6.2.3.1. Con: This anonymous politician may be criticising Starmer for their own political benefit or to undermine Starmer's leadership.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: Even if this politician is criticising Starmer for their own benefit, this willingness to publicly criticise him is still evidence of unhappiness within the party at Starmer's leadership.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Several other shadow cabinet members [have also criticised Starmer](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/starmer-shadow-cabinet-cowards_uk_6075c547e4b01e3042372820)(Unnamed shadow ministers have in recent weeks criticised Starmer’s aides, including his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, policy chief Claire Ainsley and political director Jenny Chapman, blaming them for Labour’s caution or its reliance on focus groups of former “Red Wall” voters.) and his staff anonymously, suggesting that other senior Labour MPs share this attitude.
1.6.3. Con: Having unclear policies makes it less likely that Keir Starmer [will turn off voters](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2021/04/year-his-labour-leadership-how-keir-starmer-performing)(One of the unintentional \(or perhaps intentional\) advantages of not making much of an impact as party leader is that you’re less likely to turn off voters. According to the Britain Elects poll tracker, Starmer has earned the ire or praise of 70 per cent of voters: seven in ten Brits, one year in, have an opinion of him. This compares to the 83.6 per cent and 84.1 per of Britons who had a positive or negative opinion of Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn, respectively, when they were one year into their own terms as party leader.).
1.6.3.1. Con: The same logic dictates that having unclear policies will make it less likely that Keir Starmer will win voters to his side. Considering the fact that [Labour are trailing the Conservatives in polls](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/), Starmer should be aiming to grow party support.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.
1.6.3.2. Con: The Conservative party clear policies and policy goals, such as [delivering Brexit, reforming immigration laws and increasing public spending in key areas](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/conservative-manifesto-the-key-points-policies-boris-johnson). In contrast to this, Starmer's unclear policies are [unappealing](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/).
1.6.3.3. Pro: It is [unclear what Boris Johnson stands for](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/what-does-boris-johnson-s-tory-party-stand-for-)(The main thing to say about Boris Johnson’s speech at this year’s online Tory conference is that it captures the present mood of the Conservative party almost perfectly. The problem with that is, that mood is one of confusion and soul searching about what the Conservative party actually exists to do.), yet the Conservative Party won a clear majority in the 2019 general election. This suggests clear policies are not needed for political success.
1.6.4. Con: Starmer has a clear list of [10 core pledges](https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/)(My promise to you is that I will maintain our radical values and work tirelessly to get Labour in to power – so that we can advance the interests of the people our party was created to serve.\n\nBased on the moral case for socialism, here is where I stand.\n\n1. Economic justice\nIncrease income tax for the top 5% of earners, reverse the Tories’ cuts in corporation tax and clamp down on tax avoidance, particularly of large corporations. No stepping back from our core principles.).
1.6.4.1. Con: Starmer and his shadow cabinet have [compromised on many of these pledges](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/10-broken-pledges). This has made them unclear, and caused some Labour members to [doubt his commitment](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/13/keir-starmer-jeremy-corbyn-suspension)(...he has signalled that he may ditch the 10 radical policy pledges he made to Labour and trade union members, on which he was elected to his job. If he is not careful, he risks becoming fixed in the public’s mind as someone who can’t be trusted.) to them.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: [Starmer abandoned his pledge to "support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water"](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/starmer-introduces-rule-changes-to-sideline-left-wing-of-labour-party-1.4684294)(Starmer won the leadership on a promise to unite the party around 10 pledges, one of which was to “support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water”. He abandoned that pledge on Sunday, saying he would not nationalise the energy companies at the centre of the current storm.) at the 2021 Brighton conference.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Labour members are correct to doubt his commitment to his pledges. [Starmer has stated that he is willing to break pledges in order to make Labour more electable](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-conference-pledges-b1928605.html)(“I stand by the principles and the values behind the pledges I made to our members, but the most important pledge I made was that I would turn it into a party that would be fit for government, capable of winning a general election, I’m not going to be deflected from that.”).
1.6.4.1.3. Con: It is politicially wise for Starmer to prioritise opinions of [the people he represents](https://dpsa.dk/papers/Politicians%20as%20party%20hacks.pdf)(Observational and experimental \ndata from three countries demonstrate that citizens generally perceive politicians as conducting partisan representation, but they prefer that the politicians follow their own conscience \(trustee representation\) and their constituency \(delegate representation\) over party policy.) and not Labour member interests.
1.6.4.1.4. Con: Starmer's pledges were overly idealistic and would not have seen measurable change. As such, his [choice to revise them](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-conference-pledges-b1928605.html)(The central thing is that those commitments I made, those pledges are made of values that I hold dear.\n\n“The world has changed since they were made. But now the question is, how do we apply them in the reflective circumstance we might go into election.”) is politically wise.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Starmer's pledges won him the [support of Labour members](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-keir-starmer-wins-labour-21812142) in order to win the leadership contest.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Chief among Starmer's pledges was a [promise to make Labour electable](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1498591/keir-starmer-labour-party-conference-boris-johnson-10-pledges-jeremy-corbyn-spt)(“I stand by the principles and the values behind the pledges I made to our members, but the most important pledge I made was that I would turn it into a party that would be fit for government, capable of winning a General Election, I’m not going to be deflected from that.”), many of the others will follow once Labour are in government.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: In prioritising electability, Starmer has weakened the strength of his other pledges as [he has indicated that he can and will compromise on them](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-conference-pledges-b1928605.html)(Keir Starmer has said he is willing to tear up the promises he made during the Labour leadership election if it is needed to make the party electable.).
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: Appearing inflexible on core pledges can have a negative impact on electability. Ed Miliband literally carving his policies in stone before the 2015 election was [widely mocked](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/dec/22/the-ed-stone-ed-milibands-monumental-folly-labour-election-limestone)(“They’re carved in stone because they won’t be abandoned after the general election,” said Miliband, standing in front of the stone in a car park in Hastings. “I want the British people to remember these pledges, to remind us of these pledges, to insist on these pledges.”\n\nThe ridicule was instantaneous.\n\nMichael Dugher, the then shadow transport minister, called the stone – which cost a reported £30,000 to produce – a “balls-up ... a 12ft, granite, marble, cock-up”. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said it was “some weird commie slab”, and Lucy Powell, then the vice-chair of Labour’s campaign, added to the party’s woes when she told 5 Live: “I don’t think anyone is suggesting that the fact that he’s carved them in stone means he’s absolutely not going to break them or anything like that.”).
1.6.4.4. Con: Starmer's pledges are not clear. While they state wishful outcomes, they propose no policy nor method by which this will be achieved.
1.6.5. Pro: Starmer's key policy is that [he is not Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/labour-leader-keir-starmer-needs-be-more-not-jeremy-corbyn-ayesha-hazarika-3124690)(Labour needs to raise its game, and that includes the Shadow Cabinet. Starmer got off to a good start by defining himself against Jeremy Corbyn. But that can’t be it. He now needs to show the country who he really is and what he stands for.). That is not enough to get people to vote for him.
1.6.5.1. Con: [Starmer received over half of the votes in the Labour leadership contest](https://labour.org.uk/people/leadership-elections-hub-2020/leadership-elections-2020-results/)(Keir Starmer has received more than 50 per cent of valid votes cast and is therefore elected.). If his only key policy was not being Jeremy Corbyn, then that was enough to get over half of his party to vote for him.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Being popular within the Labour Party does not equate to being popular with the public. Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership contest with [a higher vote share than Starmer](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election)(Jeremy Corbyn has been elected leader of the British Labour party, in a stunning first-round victory that dwarfed even the mandate for Tony Blair in 1994.\n\nHe won with nearly 59.5% of first-preference votes, beating rivals Andy Burnham, who trailed on 19%, and Yvette Cooper who received 17%. The “Blairite” candidate Liz Kendall came last on 4.5%.) and still oversaw Labour's [worst general election result in almost a century](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/12/13/21004755/uk-election-2019-jeremy-corbyn-labour-defeat)(The British electorate voted Thursday in one of the most important elections in the country’s modern history. And the results show that they voted overwhelmingly for Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson and for Brexit: a 78-seat parliamentary majority for Johnson and the worst showing for the opposition, the left-wing Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn, in nearly 100 years.).
1.6.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
