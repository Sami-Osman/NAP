1.2.1. Pro: [Smaller countries have better control and accountability](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/be.2012.7)(The great powers are not the only models, however. Much can be learned from small countries which are often free to experiment with new institutions and new policies. This paper describes lessons that can be learned from such countries though no one size fits all.) than their larger peers. An independent Quebec would be able to have tighter control and greater accountability.
1.2.2. Con: Smaller countries have less buying power and economic and [military clout](https://voxeu.org/article/why-military-purchasing-power-parity-matters), resulting in less influence internationally.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The United States already uses [its economic size against Canada in international negotiations](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/02/5-things-to-know-about-usmca-the-new-nafta/)(The fact that both Mexico \(on autos\) and Canada \(on dairy\) took some small steps to appease Trump’s demands should not be surprising—the U.S. is more important to their economies than vice versa.), and it would do so doubly for Quebec.
1.2.2.2. Con: Some small countries such as [Switzerland retain a high buying power and economic influence](https://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/Switzerland-2019-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf). \(p.3\)

1.3.3.1.1. Con: Or they may regroup in order to better stand their ground.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Quebec owns [St-Lawerence River](https://www.glc.org/lakes/st-lawrence), which is an access to the Atlantic Ocean.

1.3.4.4. Con: Quebec has a slightly higher [fertility rate](http://worldpopulationreview.com/canadian-provinces/quebec-population/) than the rest of Canada.
1.4. Pro: Separating from Canada would ensure the preservation of the Quebec language and culture.
1.4.1. Con: There is no evidence that the French language and culture is under threat in Quebec.
1.4.1.1. Pro: There would be only a very limited addition to the powers Quebec currently have to ensure the preservation of the French language and culture.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Quebec has already [direct control over immigration](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/politique-du-quebec-immigration).
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There are [open borders between Canadian provinces](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/provinces) so Quebec does not have control over who enters or leaves the province.

1.5. Con: Separating from Canada would cripple Quebec's economy.
1.5.1. Con: Quebec ranked [21st in GDP per capita](http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/salle-presse/communique/communique-presse-2014/mai/mai1422_an.html) in 2020.

1.5.2.2. Pro: Quebec has the biggest [lithium reserve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420721003809) in the world which is not currently being exploited efficiently.

1.5.3. Pro: Many federal government offices are on the Quebec side of the [National Capital Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Region_\(Canada\))(The National Capital Region \(French: Région de la capitale nationale\), also referred to as Canada's Capital Region and Ottawa–Gatineau \(formerly Ottawa–Hull\), is an official federal designation for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, the neighbouring city of Gatineau, Quebec, and surrounding urban and rural communities.). These would have to be moved and people crossing the Ottawa River would need passports.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The same would apply to [residents of the Magdalen Islands who take the ferry to PEI](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/health-and-wellness/magdalen-islands-entry-and-departure-through-pei).
1.5.4. Con: Separating from Canada would reduce the taxes Quebecers are forced to pay to the federal government.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Quebec is an expensive province with some of the [highest tax rates in North America](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/quebec-tax-brackets#quebec_tax_brackets).

1.5.5. Con: Additional trade deals with the U.S or the EU would potentially limit any damage to the economy.

1.5.7. Pro: It will be [costly for Quebec](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/the-staggering-price-of-quebec-independence/article17529502/) to separate from Canada.
1.5.7.1. Pro: In 2014, The Fraser Institute estimated that Quebec received [$5.7 billion](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/quebec-subsidized-rest-canada) from the Canadian government every year. This subsidy will be lost.

1.6. Con: Quebec's territorial integrity would not be guaranteed.
1.6.1. Con: "Territorial integrity" should not be viewed as something inherently positive, the way that a person's "bodily integrity" would be – the contours of jurisdictional boundaries are accidents of history, and maintaining them in their current forms is arbitrary and does not necessarily result in more positive outcomes.
1.6.2. Pro: Quebec does not have [sufficient military defense](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-caf-military-report-1.5586408) to protect themselves in the event of an international conflict.
1.6.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that Quebec on its own will have to deal with military threats since it sits in a peaceful region and has oceans between itself and more conflict-ridden areas of the globe.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: This does not necessarily indicate the likelihood of conflict in the future.
1.6.2.2. Con: [Quebec have a strong participation in the Canadian Armed Forces.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-001-x/2008107/article/10657-eng.htm) These would be redirected to an armed forces of an independent Quebec.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: CAF personnel would remain under the employment of Canadian Forces. Quebec would have to [create it's own QAF](https://www.csmonitor.com/1990/0621/z1quebec.html) and a bridging program to offer "similar type of employment" to eligible personnel, and try to assemble a coherent force.
1.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: Every piece of equipment will remain the property of CAF. The same goes for the military bases until a mutually agreed upon purchase is completed.
1.6.3. Pro: Regions where a strong majority of the population would prefer to stay in Canada could launch initiatives to be annexed to adjacent provinces.
1.6.4. Pro: [Territories governed by First Nations](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/white-house-documents-reveal-how-us-would-react-if-quebec-had-separated/article17499442/) may not want to recognize the referendum results if there is nothing in it for them.
1.7. Con: If a separation did occur Quebec's political influence would be limited internationally.
1.7.1. Con: Separating from Canada may increase ties with European nations such as France.
1.7.2. Con: Quebec's political influence is already limited by it being a part of Canada since it does not have an independent foreign policy.
1.7.3. Pro: A tiny, new nation is unlikely to yield much power of influence in global terms.
1.7.3.1. Con: The rest of [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) has only about 38 million inhabitants.
1.7.3.2. Con: Quebec could be positioned close to the [100th most populous country](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?t=100) , so it wouldn't be tiny.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) is a country on its own and has a similar population as Quebec. \([8.2M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec)\)
1.7.4. Con: An independent Quebec could have seat at the UN and other international organisations.
