Discussion Name: Should the BAR exam be eliminated as a requirement to practice law?

1. The BAR exam should be eliminated as a requirement to practice law.
1.1. Con: If the BAR exam is eliminated it would encourage unlawful practices that could currently get you dis-BARed like perjury for example.
1.2. Con: The BAR exam preserves the competency of attorneys.
1.2.1. Con: A number of very famous and successful attorneys initially failed their bar exams, which suggests that the bar does not accurately test attorneys' competency.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and former Dean of Stanford Law School Kathleen Sullivan [all failed the bar exam](https://abaforlawstudents.com/2017/06/20/success-after-failing-the-bar-exam/) on their first try.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: If the bar was meant to track competency and the likelihood of success as a lawyer, the fact that so many talented legal minds failed it initially raises questions about the efficiency of the exam.
1.2.1.2. Con: They did go on to pass the bar exams before becoming successful attorneys. It is likely they became more competent over time.
1.2.2. Pro: The bar exam provides an objective standard through which candidates can be assessed. In this way, it also [facilitates equality of opportunity.](https://www.asiaone.com/asia/bar-exam-fades-history-korea)
1.2.2.1. Pro: The BAR exam allows students to be evaluated equally. This is not guaranteed to happen in a university class, where there may be a [proximity bias](https://www.quimbee.com/resources/what-is-the-bar-exam-an-ultimate-guide) with the professor.
1.2.3. Con: If universities were [more selective](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/dealbook/bar-exam-the-standard-to-become-a-lawyer-comes-under-fire.html) about their students, there would be no need for the Bar to screen attorneys for competency.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Due to [declining law school enrolments](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/the-bar-exam-mend-it-dont-end-it/?rf=1) in recent years, schools are admitting students with lower LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Only [110,183](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/law-school-enrollment-is-up-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-a-decade/) J.D. students enrolled for law school in 2017, which is the lowest number in over 40 years.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: This is likely due to the [increased transparency](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/09/24/is-the-bar-too-low-to-get-into-law-school/incoming-law-students-have-weaker-exam-credentials) about employment outcomes in law, which have caused many prospective law students to reassess whether they wanted to invest the time and money in a legal education.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Ever since the 2008 recession, law practice has become [more competitive](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/09/24/is-the-bar-too-low-to-get-into-law-school/law-schools-need-to-better-prepare-their-students), with firms hiring fewer entry-level lawyers.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Since 2008, roughly [15,000 attorney and legal-staff](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/business/09law.html?searchResultPosition=32) jobs at large firms have vanished.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: More entry-level legal work is now [outsourced](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/business/09law.html?searchResultPosition=32) to contract temporary employees, both in the United States and in countries like India.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: There has been a [recent rise](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/more-people-applying-to-law-school-but-its-not-like-last-years-trump-bump) in students applying for law school, due to what has been called the 'Trump bump'.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The ['Trump bump'](http://nationaljurist.com/prelaw/trump-bump-continues) is a theory that explains the sudden increase in applicants on the current political climate due the Trump administration, as more people see law as a way to advocate for political and public policy issues that they care about.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: This dramatic drop-off in law school enrolments is costing campuses a cumulative [$1.5 billion](https://www.law.com/2018/10/04/study-finds-law-schools-are-losing-1-5-billion-annually-in-tuition/?slreturn=20200025210504) in lost tuition each year
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: With lower grades, these students are unlikely to ever pass the bar exam.
1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: In 2013, the median LSAT score of students that were admitted into Florida Coastal School of Law was in the [bottom quarter](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/opinion/sunday/the-law-school-debt-crisis.html?searchResultPosition=29) of all test-takers nationwide.
1.2.3.2. Pro: In 2014, roughly a third of the 204 accredited law schools had entering classes where [at least 25%](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/business/dealbook/study-cites-lower-standards-in-law-school-admissions.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) of the class consisted of ''at risk'' students.
1.2.3.3. Con: Being more selective does not amount to the same result as the BAR exam. Being selective asserts for the standard knowledge/capability needed to enrol in law school while the BAR exam asserts for the standard knowledge/capability needed to practice law. Both criteria are needed at different points in the process.
1.2.4. Pro: Society has a compelling interest in ensuring lawyer competency. The BAR exam serves this purpose.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Society has a duty to protect citizens and their rights by ensuring that every lawyer is qualified and appropriately educated in the fundamentals of the law.
1.2.4.2. Con: It is unclear if general society benefits from lawyers that have excelled at an exam that is [largely based](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/dealbook/bar-exam-the-standard-to-become-a-lawyer-comes-under-fire.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below) on rote memorisation.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Lawyers studying civil procedures for their bar have to memorise [hundreds of legal rules](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/09/24/is-the-bar-too-low-to-get-into-law-school/the-american-bar-association-should-create-a-more-meaningful-bar-exam) for it, even though they would be allowed to consult cases and statues as practising lawyers.
1.2.4.3. Con: The BAR Exam creates an unhealthy level of pressure on law students to perform during a single occasion, even if their competence has been proven over a longer course of time.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Some people struggle with dealing with stress and nerves both before and during exams. These people aren't necessarily any less competent than those who can cope with the stress yet are more likely to fail due to the pressure getting to them.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: For many, whether they pass the BAR exam or not is going to determine their entire future. That is an extreme amount of pressure to put on a person.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Con: Those who are not able to think clearly and quickly when stressed or under immense pressure are unlikely to succeed as competent lawyers in court environments.
1.2.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Competency as a lawyer doesn't necessitate being good in court; there is a great deal of non-litigation work performed by attorneys.
1.2.4.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: There are many, many different [branches](https://www.thelawyerportal.com/free-guides/areas-legal-practice/) of law. Many of these do not operate in a court of law, and thus do not necessarily require the skillset associated with functioning well under pressure.
1.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: BAR exam anxiety [manifests](https://www.forbes.com/2007/07/25/law-bar-exam-lead-careers-cx_tw_0725barexam.html#622e355ccddb) in several harmful ways, such as nocturnal anxiety attacks, memory loss, and even post-exam stress disorder.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The BAR exam does not test students on realistic standards, as a closed book two-day MCQ test [does not reflect](https://excessofdemocracy.com/blog/2017/5/does-the-bar-exam-adequately-test-prospective-lawyers-minimum-competence) how a practicing lawyer would handle a case.
1.2.4.4. Pro: The bar exam tests a number of important skills that every competent attorney must have.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: The bar often tests knowledge of [thousands of arcane](https://reason.com/2019/07/09/how-to-make-bar-exams-great-again/) legal rules that only a small minority of practising lawyers ever use.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: The bar tests all lawyer on [essential areas of law](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/dos/taking-the-bar-exam/) - including civil, contracts, torts, constitutional, and criminal law.
1.2.4.4.3. Pro: The bar also assesses students on [important legal skills](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/dos/taking-the-bar-exam/), such as problem solving, legal analysis and reasoning, and ethical dilemmas.
1.2.4.5. Pro: Only a prepared lawyer can prepare a good defense.
1.2.4.6. Pro: [Suzanne Darrow-Kleinhaus](https://www.tourolaw.edu/AboutTouroLaw/Bio/8) argues that the bar exam [adequately assesses](https://web.archive.org/web/20101203122548/http://www.ncbex.org/uploads/user_docrepos/740205_darrowkleinhaus.pdf) competency in the basic analytical skills required for the practice of law. \(p. 36\)
1.2.4.7. Pro: Seeing as some law schools engage in [grade inflation](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/kill-the-bar-exam/) and do not adequately assess their law students, it's important that there is a standardised test for all lawyers to properly screen lawyers before they can practice.
1.2.5. Pro: The BAR exam serves a worthwhile purpose to deter unwanted potential attorneys.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Because the bar is so [notoriously difficult](https://magoosh.com/bar-exam/bar-exam-hard/), students that are not truly committed to practising law are likely to give up.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Given that the bar exam has a high first-time fail rate, it successfully filters out those who do not have the tenacity and determination required to retry after failing.
1.2.5.2. Pro: A number of students apply to go study law and sit the bar simply because they [don't know](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/us/applications-to-law-schools-are-declining.html?searchResultPosition=33) what else to do.
1.2.6. Pro: The BAR exam and its existence fosters trust in legal professionals among the general public.
1.2.7. Con: Seeing as the bar [only tests the ability to take tests](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/kill-the-bar-exam/), and not the ability to practice law, it fails to adequately assess the competency of attorneys.
1.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.1.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Bar exams screen out potential lawyers who are [bad at memorisation](https://reason.com/2019/07/09/how-to-make-bar-exams-great-again/) or don't have the time and money to take a bar prep course.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: The [best way](https://www.newsweek.com/bar-exam-unfair-and-undemocratic-322606) to learn about the legal profession is through tried experience and practical training, which is delayed for years by the bar exam.
1.2.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.
1.3. Pro: The BAR exam significantly harms the market for lawyers.
1.3.1. Pro: The BAR Exam creates substantial barriers to otherwise viable candidates.
1.3.1.1. Con: Substantial barriers are necessary to ensure that only the very highest level of academic attainment has been reached, as they are dealing with the justice system and will have substantial responsibilities as a result.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The competency cannot be based by numbers only. And some percentage is weak in emotional aspects. They fold due to the pressure of passing the Exam. In which may lose some potential talents
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.
1.3.2. Con: The market for lawyers is [oversaturated](https://www.thecareercookbook.com/too-many-lawyers/). The BAR exam can help this oversaturation by acting as a filter of lesser able lawyers.
1.3.3. Pro: The BAR exam is injurious to the supply-side of the legal market.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Because fewer lawyers are passing the bar exam, there are fewer lawyers available to help those in need of legal assistance.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In many cases, public defence lawyers are so overworked that they [can not provide](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/opinion/sunday/the-law-school-debt-crisis.html?searchResultPosition=29) constitutionally adequate representation for criminal defendants.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: The lack of lawyers has resulted in civil legal services that help people with housing, immigration, and workplace issues, being [even more scarce](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/opinion/sunday/the-law-school-debt-crisis.html?searchResultPosition=29).
1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: In 2017, a study revealed that [86%](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/insight-turns-out-we-actually-need-more-lawyers-sorta) of the civil legal problems reported by low-income Americans in the previous year received inadequate or no legal help.
1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: This was particularly acute for family law, landlord-tenant, and bankruptcy matters, where at least one party was required to represent themselves in roughly [70-90% of cases](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/insight-turns-out-we-actually-need-more-lawyers-sorta).
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: There are a number of states where there are nowhere near enough lawyers for the general population.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: In Nebraska alone, there are [11 counties](https://www.npr.org/2016/12/26/506971630/nebraska-and-other-states-combat-rural-lawyer-shortage) without a lawyer - leaving many in need of legal help stranded.
1.3.3.1.3.2. Pro: [21%](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/facing-a-shortage-of-lawyers-in-some-areas-this-state-considers-licensing-legal-technicians) of New Mexico's counties have 5 or fewer lawyers, and 2 counties have no attorneys at all.
1.3.3.1.3.3. Pro: Whilst roughly 20% of the US population lives in rural areas, [only 2%](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/06/26/wanted-lawyers-for-rural-america) of small law practices are located in small towns and rural areas.
1.3.3.1.3.4. Pro: In North Dakota's [53 counties](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/06/26/wanted-lawyers-for-rural-america), seven has just 2 lawyers, six have 1 lawyer, and three have no lawyers at all.
1.3.3.2. Con: It is better to have fewer lawyers who are sufficiently competent, than more who are not. Eliminating the bar exam would lower standards.
1.3.3.3. Pro: In the United States, a [growing number](https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2016/10/01/growing-number-law-school-grads-unable-pass-bar-exam/91271810/) of law-school graduates have been unable to pass the BAR exam.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: In 2016, only [58% of students](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/kill-the-bar-exam/) that sat the bar exams in the US passed.
1.3.3.4. Con: It is not the BAR exam that is causing lawyers to decrease, but rather, the [decreasing number](https://www.thoughtco.com/are-there-too-many-lawyers-4026025) of law-school applicants over the years contributes to that.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.3.
1.3.3.5. Pro: A [high percentage](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/04/archives/a-high-percentage-of-minority-law-students-are-failing-bar-exams.html) of minority law students have failed the BAR exam.
1.3.3.5.1. Pro: Black law graduates are [statistically more likely](https://aaattorneynetwork.com/factors-affecting-bar-passage-among-law-students-the-real-connection-between-race-and-bar-passage/) to struggle with the bar exam than their white counterparts.
1.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: Nearly [40% of black students](https://aaattorneynetwork.com/factors-affecting-bar-passage-among-law-students-the-real-connection-between-race-and-bar-passage/) fail the bar exam on their first try, compared to 8% of white students.
1.3.3.5.1.2. Pro: This is often because black law students face [severe financial pressures](https://aaattorneynetwork.com/factors-affecting-bar-passage-among-law-students-the-real-connection-between-race-and-bar-passage/) that make them far more likely to work during law school than other students.
1.3.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: For this reason, black law students often [skip bar review courses](https://aaattorneynetwork.com/factors-affecting-bar-passage-among-law-students-the-real-connection-between-race-and-bar-passage/) in favour of working.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Since few lawyers pass the BAR exam, those who do charge [extremely high fees](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeleef/2015/04/22/true-or-false-we-need-the-bar-exam-to-ensure-lawyer-competence/#6825b2c0631f), which makes it such that very few people can afford legal assistance.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: 80% of state criminal defendants in Georgia, USA [cannot afford](https://theconversation.com/every-year-millions-try-to-navigate-us-courts-without-a-lawyer-84159) to pay for a lawyer.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: Hiring lawyers for simple car crashes can cost a minimum of $17,000, whereas [around 40%](https://lawsoup.org/2019/04/09/most-americans-cant-afford-a-lawyer-heres-how-you-can-get-help/) of Americans state that they will not be able to produce even $400 for an unexpected expense.
1.4. Pro: Better alternatives exist to accomplish the intended purpose of the BAR Exam.
1.4.1. Pro: The Iowa State Bar Association [proposed](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/dealbook/bar-exam-the-standard-to-become-a-lawyer-comes-under-fire.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below) an in-state 'diploma privilege' that would allow graduates of local law schools to skip the bar exam and begin practising immediately.
1.4.1.1. Pro: This is a far better alternative for training attorneys than the Bar, which [does not test](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/dealbook/bar-exam-the-standard-to-become-a-lawyer-comes-under-fire.html) Iowa specific law.
1.4.2. Pro: The [Daniel Webster Scholar](https://law.unh.edu/academics/experiential-education/daniel-webster-scholar-program) \(DWS\) programme is considered a better alternative than the BAR exam.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The Daniel Webster Scholar Honors Program offers students the [opportunity to create portfolios](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/dealbook/bar-exam-the-standard-to-become-a-lawyer-comes-under-fire.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below) of their written work and record their oral performances, which are then reviewed by state bar examiners after each semester. Those who pass the review can skip the bar exam and go directly into practice.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: During the last two years of law school, they take courses that have been [designed](https://www.nhpr.org/post/study-lauds-unh-law-program-allows-students-bypass-traditional-bar-exam) for the mission of making law students 'client-ready'.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Students take courses that are [specifically created](https://www.nhpr.org/post/study-lauds-unh-law-program-allows-students-bypass-traditional-bar-exam) with a lot of experiential education and work in clinics.
1.4.2.2. Con: The Daniel Webster Scholar programme [only allows lawyers to work](https://www.nhpr.org/post/study-lauds-unh-law-program-allows-students-bypass-traditional-bar-exam) in New Hampshire. If they want to move they would not only have to take that state's bar but they would be unprepared for that form of exam.
1.4.2.3. Con: Despite the successes of the programme, it is unclear how far it is exportable as a method for successfully teaching law and producing high quality lawyers throughout the United States.
1.4.2.4. Pro: [A study](https://www.nhpr.org/post/study-lauds-unh-law-program-allows-students-bypass-traditional-bar-exam#stream/0) in 2015 found that the programme's students outperformed colleagues in the field who were licensed to perform in the previous two years.
1.4.3. Con: Due to its existence and long-standing tradition of use, the BAR exam is more standardized and universally accepted than other tests.
1.4.3.1. Con: [Many](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/dealbook/bar-exam-the-standard-to-become-a-lawyer-comes-under-fire.html) academic institutions and professionals are questioning whether the BAR exam is an effective standard by which to measure competency to practise.
1.4.4. Pro: A study by the NCBE’s Testing Task Force to ascertain whether the exam continues to ['keep pace with a changing legal profession'](https://twitter.com/NCBETaskForce) is currently underway. The need for this study in the first place suggests the BAR exam is losing relevance.
1.5. Pro: The BAR exam infringes on individual freedom by restricting upward socio-economic movement.
1.5.1. Pro: Students have to pay for this in addition to the [considerable expense](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/2014/01/26/Bar-exam-falling-out-of-favor/stories/201401260118) of law school, which can become too great a financial burden for a significant amount of lower/middle income students out of the profession.
1.5.1.1. Pro: This considerable expense, on top of the [30-40% likelihood](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/09/24/is-the-bar-too-low-to-get-into-law-school/the-american-bar-association-should-create-a-more-meaningful-bar-exam) of bar failure, makes the cost of taking the bar exam too much for many otherwise talented students.
1.5.2. Pro: The BAR examination, and training, are expensive; those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may not have the funds to manage it.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Preparatory tuition, essential materials to prepare for the exam, the exam fees themselves and filing fees vary from state to state, but are all significant; these make taking the BAR exam a large and often unviable [financial commitment](https://www.ais-cpa.com/bar-exam-costs-and-fees/).
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Many students will end up spending a [few thousand dollars](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/2014/01/26/Bar-exam-falling-out-of-favor/stories/201401260118) on an all-consuming preparatory course in order to pass the exam.
1.5.2.2. Con: [Bar exam loans](https://www.finder.com/bar-exam-loans) are now widely available and provide a way for such groups to afford to take the exam.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: There are many [financial disadvantages](https://www.jdadvising.com/bar-exam-loans-general-overview/) to a BAR exam loan which arguably make this a bigger financial burden than if a person were to pay the BAR exam costs upfront.
1.5.2.3. Con: Some law firms, particularly [larger](https://www.jdadvising.com/do-big-law-firms-pay-for-bar-prep/) ones, will pay partially or completely for their employee's BAR exam costs.
1.5.3. Con: Using this logic we can argue that qualifications should not be a professional requirement because it would restrict social mobility and individual freedom. In such a society, anyone could get a job as a doctor, politician or lawyer.
1.5.4. Con: There are a number of [scholarships and wavers](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/dos/taking-the-bar-exam/) that individuals can access to reduce the cost of taking the Bar.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Some bar courses allow students who will be working at a law firm to ['sponsor' other students](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/dos/taking-the-bar-exam/) for the full cost of their course tuition.
1.5.4.2. Pro: There are [specific scholarships](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/dos/taking-the-bar-exam/) for lawyers that intend to work outside of the private sector with lower pay.
1.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.
1.6. Con: Passing the BAR exam is a stalwart tradition, a rite of passage that should be upheld.
1.6.1. Con: All other aspects of the legal system have [had to adapt](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/09/24/is-the-bar-too-low-to-get-into-law-school/the-bar-exam-is-not-the-best-test-of-a-good-lawyer) in response to a changing world, the Bar should be no exception to this.
1.6.2. Con: Upholding an archaic and outdated tradition just because it is tradition is not always a logical or moral act, as it does not take into account changing socio-economic or political progression.
1.6.3. Pro: Upholding traditions fosters [faith and trust](https://www.thecultureconcept.com/traditions-respecting-evaluating-transforming-society) in the systems that they exist in.
