Discussion Name: Should Mexico legalize drugs?

1. Mexico should legalize drugs.
1.1. Con: There is a reason why drugs are banned in the first place; it is because they are harmful. Hence legalising the use of drugs is not the solution.
1.1.1. Con: When drugs are legalized, there is more ability for the consumption of them to be regulated and limited. This makes it safer than a black market where there are no such limits and regulations.
1.1.1.1. Con: Regulation has not worked in the past.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Fentanyl, a legal synthetic opioid, has been [overprescribed](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/6/17649036/fda-fentanyl-opioid-epidemic-drug-legalization) as a result of aggressive lobbying in the interest of profit mongering.
1.1.1.2. Con: Legalization does not lead to the eradication of the black market for drugs.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Despite the legalization of marijuana, the illegal market for it [remains robust](https://www.sanpatrignano.com/what-we-do/sanpa-international/marijuana-legalization-has-led-more-use-and-addiction-while-illegal-market-continues-thrive/).
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In Los Angeles, unlicensed marijuana businesses [greatly outnumber](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/21/legal-marijuana-black-market-227414) legal ones.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Despite legalization, the [overwhelming majority](https://qz.com/1605614/canadas-black-market-for-weed-is-thriving-even-after-legalization/) of cannabis sales across Canada during the fourth quarter of last year were done on the black market.
1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: If first world nations have failed to successfully legalize drugs, Mexico is unlikely to be able to do so.
1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Mexico does not have resources to match those of first world nations, and the government is [wreaked](https://theconversation.com/mexicos-corruption-problems-are-still-among-the-worlds-deepest-76627) with corruption.
1.1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The cartels are [far too powerful](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/06/22/legalizing-drugs-wont-stop-mexicos-brutal-cartels/) to be challenged and have a vested interest in drugs remaining illegal.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Obtaining drugs within a legal system will still be difficult due to regulations \(such as prescriptions, permitted potency, ease of access\). Individuals wishing to circumvent these will continue to turn to the black market.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Legislation could help restrict and regulate drug use through mandating policies such as a legal age to purchase and maximum quantities allowed for personal use.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Legal drugs could be regulated through quality control measures such as clear labeling of strength of batches and ensuring purity of the drugs for sale.
1.1.1.5. Pro: There is no incentive for quality control in the [black market](https://theweek.com/articles/445005/why-all-drugs-should-legal-yes-even-heroin). In a legalised and regulated system, quality control would make consumption far safer.
1.1.1.6. Con: The ability to access drugs will massively increase. Many people who would be too afraid to approach drugs sold on a black market could end up getting hooked on drugs when they're legal.
1.1.2. Pro: For many people, abiding by the law is necessary, whether due to the nature of their employment, or their belief systems \(religious, ethical, personality\). Legalization of drugs makes it possible for them to consume drugs, and therefore increases the likelihood of addiction among this group.
1.1.3. Con: When drugs are legalized, the conversation and information about them stops being a taboo and becomes a health topic, thus people naturally get better informed. Information allows the freedom to do and sustain decisions.
1.1.3.1. Pro: This can further facilitate access to marijuana for individuals who need it for medical reasons.
1.1.4. Pro: The damages drugs can cause to recreational users include [addiction](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/commonly-abused-drugs-charts), [mental health issues](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/preface), and [physical health problems](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine).
1.1.4.1. Pro: Cannabis consumption has been [linked](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/schizophrenia/cannabis-psychosis-link) to psychosis.
1.1.5. Con: The risk of self-harm is not a valid reason to ban anything. For instance cigarettes and alcohol are legal and are much worse for their users than some of the drugs, both also having an impact on those nearby. Skateboarding, skiing, scuba diving and many other activities are also dangerous to your health but they're not illegal.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Being reckless in any regard isn't a trait that's good for us, and if we coddle these people we prevent evolution from reducing our overall recklessness.
1.2. Pro: The government could tax the legalised drugs and \(monetarily\) benefit from their popularity.
1.2.1. Pro: Drug legalization could generate up to [$106.7 billion](https://www.cato.org/publications/tax-budget-bulletin/budgetary-effects-ending-drug-prohibition) in annual budgetary gains for federal, state, and local governments.
1.2.1.1. Pro: In fact, according to a [study](https://www.cato.org/publications/tax-budget-bulletin/budgetary-effects-ending-drug-prohibition), legalization has so far generated more tax revenue than previously forecast but generated essentially no reductions in criminal justice expenditure
1.2.2. Pro: Legalizing drugs could help to secure the investment portfolios of investors across the country and further afield as well.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Currently](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp), many of the most successful businesses in the early legal cannabis space have been based in Canada or other countries.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Legalizing would allow drug companies to list their stocks on all U.S. exchanges, thereby enhancing liquidity and opening up access to many more investors.
1.2.3. Pro: The money being deployed on tackling the drug problem would also be saved. It could be invested in other, more pressing departments.
1.2.3.1. Pro: In 2013, the cost of fighting the powerful drug cartels rose to almost [$172.7 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2014/06/19/mexicos-astonishing-spending-on-fighting-drug-cartels-has-not-reduced-violence/#59e5d04b54ac).
1.2.3.2. Pro: Mexico has a foreign debt of [$73.5 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2014/06/19/mexicos-astonishing-spending-on-fighting-drug-cartels-has-not-reduced-violence/#59e5d04b54ac), which could instead be repaid.
1.2.4. Pro: States in the USA where marijuana has been legalised have reported [millions of dollars generated](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp) through taxation on drug sales since they legalised, and began selling and taxing, marijuana products.
1.2.5. Con: This could send a message that the government supports the use of drugs among their citizens, if they are willing to provide drugs for sale and benefit from the consumption of these substances.
1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Consumption of drugs could get out of hand and harm people even more.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: In a free society, adults should be permitted to do whatever they please as long as they understand the consequences of their own choices and that they cause no direct harm to others. Drug use is one such activity.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The families and employers of drug users are affected by their drug use.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.2.5.2.5. Pro: More people would become addicted.
1.2.5.2.5.1. Pro: The use of marijuana has nearly [doubled](https://www.sanpatrignano.com/what-we-do/sanpa-international/marijuana-legalization-has-led-more-use-and-addiction-while-illegal-market-continues-thrive/) since its legalization in the US. With it, the number of Americans with marijuana use disorder has also increased.
1.2.5.2.5.2. Con: [Evidence from Portugal](https://newint.org/features/2012/09/01/drugs-legalization), where all drugs were decriminalized over 10 years ago, suggests safer behaviour \(fewer fatal overdoses and cases of HIV\), when drugs are legalized.
1.2.5.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.2.5.3. Con: Most governments regulate tobacco but it is very clear that this is not because they think cigarettes are good for citizens' health. The government could make it clear that they believe legalised and regulated drugs are safer than illegal drugs, without saying drugs are good.
1.2.6. Pro: Illegal products cost more, therefore legalization would decrease the price.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The prices can also not be regulated in any way, so when illegal, different distributors are free to price their products as they wish.
1.2.6.2. Pro: An illegal product can have [increased costs](http://www.samefacts.com/2012/12/drug-policy/why-illegality-makes-drugs-expensive-than-taxes-ever-could/) due to the need for secrecy that arises from the drug being illegal, e.g. materials or products must be smuggled, rather than openly transported, across borders.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.4. Pro: If drugs are legalized, more job opportunities would be created.
1.4.1. Con: Legalization would only cause mafias to look towards employment in [other illicit activities](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/05/30/should-latin-america-end-the-war-on-drugs/drug-legalization-could-create-more-crime), as they will not have the required skills to easily find another job.
1.4.2. Pro: According to Forbes, the marijuana industry in the US may produce [upwards of 250,000](https://www.hotelcaliforniabythesea.com/legalization-marijuana-affect-substance-abuse/) jobs by the year 2020, due to its legalization.
1.4.3. Pro: The regulation, distribution, retail etc. of the legalized drugs would all be areas of industry that would require workers, increasing available employment.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In Colorado, USA, the legalization of marijuana is [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/27/the-marijuana-industry-created-over-18000-new-jobs-in-colorado-last-year/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.31ee66ffa13b) to have created more than 18,000 new jobs.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: A study estimates at least [81,000](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp) additional direct, indirect and induced jobs in California will be created as a result of legalized marijuana sales.
1.4.3.2. Pro: 'The legal drug industry' is [estimated](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp) to create several distinct types of jobs, from healthcare jobs in the form of nurses and other trained staff to work in dispensaries, agricultural jobs to allow domestic growing of plants used in drug manufacture, to marketing and IT jobs relating to the distribution end of the industry.
1.4.4. Con: Many jobs would be lost given the amount of energy, resources and manpower currently focused on the '[war on drugs](https://theweek.com/articles/445005/why-all-drugs-should-legal-yes-even-heroin)'.
1.4.4.1. Con: Many of these jobs, e.g. military, would not be lost but rather re-directed towards other duties.
1.4.4.2. Con: The amount of resources saved would easily cover any loss incurred through people made unemployed. Such people could be compensated or employed in jobs created by the legalisation.
1.4.4.3. Pro: It is estimated the the American government has spent [over a trillion dollars](https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/world/15-utterly-shocking-facts-about-the-war-on-drugs/2/?v=6&n=f) on their 'War on Drugs'.
1.5. Con: Legalisation of drugs in Mexico would worsen relations with the United States unless the latter followed suit.
1.5.1. Pro: A legal market for drugs that are illegal in the United States would, in effect, promote smuggling of those drugs into the US, which they would not approve of.
1.6. Pro: Illegal products create organized crime, legalization would therefore eliminate mafias.
1.6.1. Pro: If mafias were eliminated, then the important institutions of law enforcement would be more effective and less corrupted.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In order to protect their business, many drug gangs will [enlist](https://mic.com/articles/27281/gun-control-debate-gang-violence-accounts-for-half-of-violent-crime-in-america#.yJSxyxFa3) members of military and law enforcement offering bribes in exchange for information/ silence/ misdirection.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Corruption within the law enforcement and military is hugely damaging because of the ways in which it allows [gang violence to thrive](https://mic.com/articles/27281/gun-control-debate-gang-violence-accounts-for-half-of-violent-crime-in-america#.yJSxyxFa3).
1.6.2. Con: Legalization of drugs would just cement the hold of the cartels on the regions that the police/military haven't been able to pacify/control.
1.6.2.1. Pro: As they already have the infrastructure in place, they would be able to turn into a legal business and start to provide support that the government was unable to do minus the turf wars/police raids.
1.6.2.2. Con: Legalising drugs would allow law enforcement to focus their efforts on preventing/ punishing illegal activity carried out by gangs/ cartels, e.g. violence, human trafficking.
1.6.3. Pro: The legalization of drugs will [allow local farmers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/legal-marijuana-medical-use-crime-rate-plummets-us-study) and sellers to compete with mafias and cartels, hence cutting down on their profits and putting them out of business.
1.6.4. Pro: [Research has](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jawikshlkd9cia/GKZ_MML_Press.pdf?dl=0) shown that the legalization of marijuana has led to the reduction in activity by Mexican drug trafficking organizations and their affiliated gangs. \(p. 1\)
1.6.5. Pro: Large drug organizations can't rely on the state to protect them and their merchandise as what they're doing is illegal, meaning that they can't complain to the state if someone robs them. This means that they need weapons in order to protect their business from competitors.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.
