Discussion Name: Should school be mandatory until 12th grade?

1. School should be mandatory until 12th grade.
1.1. Pro: If education is widely available, people are better suited to manage and run an information economy.
1.1.1. Pro: The amount of [technical innovation from a highly educated population has helped reduce/eliminate most environmental ills](https://www.allerin.com/blog/3-ways-technologies-are-helping-us-save-the-environment) that plagued humanity for the last part of a millennium.
1.1.2. Con: School does not need to be mandatory in order to be widely available.
1.1.3. Con: The fact that education should be widely available has been already established but the duration of education has not.
1.2. Pro: There should be a mandatory expectation of any adult that they will have been educated to at least a specific level - matriculation it used to be called. In practice, most students can learn the needs to at least cope in adult life can by the year of 16th. birthday. \(12th. grade?\) [Ref: Functional Skills UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/functional-skills-subject-content-mathematics)
1.2.1. Pro: The system could go further to motivate reluctant learners . If the final test of 'sufficient' education to become an adult citizen can be met by an individual by their 15th. year then that learner could leave then, effectively one year early, if they wish.
1.3. Pro: Some form of educational pursuit should be encouraged until the child reaches the age of 18. But requiring them to complete formal schooling in the public school system may not be the best. Instead, we should consider options for trade, technical, or vocational schooling and training for those students who would prefer to follow those routes, instead of pursuing a college track. Both are equally valid options.
1.3.1. Pro: In England you must be in education, training or volunteering until[the age of 18](https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school).
1.4. Pro: Education must be considered a [right](https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/education-right-not-privilege) for every member of society.
1.4.1. Pro: Funding for education, of some form, typically for the 17 years between 4 and 21, is good for many. Those who drop out after 16 may return, or go into trade \(work skills\) schools, apprenticeships, whatever. In principle the 17 years worth of funding should be available to be used at anytime between say 4 and 54. In the UK it is called ['Lifelong learning'](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/727776/Foresight-future-of-skills-lifelong-learning_V8.pdf) But it is not yet implemented.
1.4.2. Pro: Countries with better [education in the past](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) are more likely to be democracies today.
1.4.3. Pro: Education is key for success, so everyone should at least graduate from high school.
1.4.3.1. Con: In today's information age, education can be supplied in many other ways.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The current information age can allow the education of individuals to be personalised to suit their needs and future plans.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Yes we should all have a personalised plan and be ['in education' for life](https://www.kialo.com/funding-for-education-of-some-form-typically-for-the-17-years-between-4-and-21-is-good-for-many-those-who-drop-out-after-23318.162?path=23318.0~23318.1_23318.17_23318.162&active=_23318.162&action=comments).
1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Information is not education.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: There should be a common standard to achieve before the personalised plan. This is necessary to wisely use the benefits of the online age.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: There should be a standard to achieve before you leave education to work full time.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Just because there is a lot of information on the internet doesn't mean that it's information of high quality.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: The internet very often provides [misinformation and false facts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/technology/twitter-fake-news-research.html) that would not positively contribute to these children's education.
1.4.3.1.3.2. Con: Correct usage of the internet provides a faster and more reliable way to learn.
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: There are many non-formal ways that can help shape your future and your education. For example voluntary work.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Education provides children with the basic necessities to become independent, functional adults.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Usually education provided by schools is insufficient and contains outdated information and outdated way of thinking.
1.4.3.3. Pro: It has been [recorded](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/students-should-be-required-to-stay-in-school-until-age-18-researchers-say-188241691.html) that staying in school for longer improves the life outcomes of students who otherwise would have become dropouts.
1.4.3.4. Pro: High-school dropouts [fare much worse](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/students-should-be-required-to-stay-in-school-until-age-18-researchers-say-188241691.html) than their peers on a wide variety of long-term outcomes.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: On average, a [dropout](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/students-should-be-required-to-stay-in-school-until-age-18-researchers-say-188241691.html) earns less money, is more likely to be in jail, is less healthy, is less likely to be married, and is unhappier than a high-school graduate.
1.4.4. Con: A right, but not a compulsion.
1.4.4.1. Pro: If the same ideas about compulsory education were applied to voting, we would have a great deal of terrible elections. Instead, we should allow individuals to self select the level of education they wish to pursue, while creating opportunities for those that opted out previously to return and finish when they feel it expedient to do so.
1.5. Con: School should not be mandatory. Education should. We continue to learn throughout life. There should be no age limit for gaining a qualification. Nor should qualifications be mandatory.
1.6. Pro: Accessing education until 12th grade allows children and young people to develop their ability to think about the world around them, creating more prepared citizens \(with vocational and intelectual tools\), which is the aim of the educational system. Children who abandon the school too early are unlikely have access to higher level learning \(I am not referring to higher education, but more complex intelectual tools to analyse the world\).
1.7. Con: Parents should make this decision, not the government.
1.7.1. Con: With the decision being left to parents, the child's opinions are not likely to be expressed.
1.7.1.1. Con: Same argument is for the government involvement. Having a law that forces people to do something is not the same as having an option.
1.7.2. Pro: Schools can infringe on the parents' rights to make decisions about the social and religious upbringing of their children.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Public School curriculums can very often include topics and themes that parents do not wish to expose their children to.
1.7.2.2. Con: Parents should not have the absolute freedom to determine the social and religious upbringing of their children. All children should be offered a variety of different perspectives so that they may have some ability to make an informed choice for themselves.
1.7.2.3. Con: School curriculums are designed by people who are trained to educate while parents do it out of their personal beliefs.
1.7.3. Con: Parents are sometimes poor decision makers and neglect to prepare children for adulthood. Making school mandatory is a way to make sure that children get a decent standard of education which prepares them for adult life.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Even if the state is unable to provide a great education for all children, they would at least be providing a minimum standard of education for all children which is better than having many children get no education at all.
1.7.3.2. Con: We have poor decisions made because of the absence of proper education. Having more time spent in school does not equal to having a proper education.
1.7.4. Con: This decision will influence the future of the all country, so parents should not get to decide.
1.7.4.1. Pro: [Educated people](https://www.howtolearn.com/2013/03/importance-of-education-in-a-countrys-progress/) are more aware of the socio-economic scenario of their country and can help in the progress of the country.
1.7.4.2. Pro: [Education](https://www.howtolearn.com/2013/03/importance-of-education-in-a-countrys-progress/) helps to decide whom to vote for in order to positively impact the economy of a country. Being educated helps in deciding why to vote for a particular party over the other.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: Teachers are not impartial to the political system. That way children could be indoctrinated by them to think a certain way and that may not have a positive outcome for them.
1.7.4.3. Con: The ones who should make the decision - the children themselves - have a limited capacity to understand.
1.8. Con: School may not be the best option for some children.
1.8.1. Pro: Some children are simply incapable of/unwilling to adapt to the academic environment. Violent children and those who treat it like social hour detract from the educational potential of others.
1.8.2. Pro: There are children who would be more helpful working and gaining money.
1.8.2.1. Pro: If a person with learning difficulties is forced to go to school, he/she is likely to cause general disruption preventing others from learning. Despite this, they can still be capable workers.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: Governments should strive to build education systems that are inclusive enough to cater to all students. Facing a learning difficulty should not result in a person being deprived of education completely.
1.8.2.2. Con: Teens would be able to work but they wouldn't be able to produce meaningful work if they don't have an education.
1.8.2.3. Con: Children are generally not allowed to be [employed](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/sep/18/child-work-legal-restrictions).
1.9. Con: Only students, for whom it makes sense to eventually go to college, should be forced to graduate.
1.9.1. Con: If kids make the decision to not graduate then it is not an informed decision. They are too young to understand the long-term impacts of not attaining education and hence the government should be allowed to intervene in their choices.
1.9.1.1. Con: Freedom is a basic right that should apply to all. Making your choice even if it's a bad one is a must. They must learn that every decision has a consequence.
1.9.1.2. Con: Education can come in a variety of ways.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Homeschooling is a basic way to give kids relevant information for them.
1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Voluntary work is a great way to learn and develop critical skills needed in society.
1.9.2. Con: Kids who don't want to go to college also need this graduation. Without education, they have a poor understanding of the world around them.
1.9.2.1. Con: Most schools don't offer practical services to help the kids. Like how to get even a job or counseling on what to do next.
1.9.2.2. Con: Because of the existence of bad teachers, a lot of kids are wasting their time in school.
1.9.3. Pro: Schools cant cater the different needs of all their students.
1.10. Con: If this were to be true, the people without qualifications would have a much harder time finding any job.
1.11. Pro: If school isn’t mandatory, parents may force their kids to give up to go work.
1.11.1. Pro: Parents, facing dire economic needs, very often force their [children to work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3533357/).
1.11.1.1. Pro: Children being forced to work violates their [right to a full filling childhood](https://www.tdh.ch/en/right-to-a-childhood).
1.11.1.2. Pro: Parents forcing children to work adds to the globally prevalent problem of [child labor](https://watermark.silverchair.com/gpl031.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAmwwggJoBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJZMIICVQIBADCCAk4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMtSvQrBCxjhyOSGEqAgEQgIICH4tYhbDLqjCcu7EQvLR2Mqxd-CpL7azDTO04kv1dkrsruHikNaBUdLIMGdbGhrmRtFPYh5J1KD-DjvWRpNSww7neNowk_ZbwjYQlGNMPxGDlSOBCy88Mo8VTFK63bND9oQ2MY7rQk5lmDoUcpRm6FxgYTe_fnwhesHlRO_HydAUUjR17G8Slzv9aOOvlT8deGcFYH_96dhECuI42Cf-WFGYs5v4T6brS_dC_sa2Wjy5opGTMPI95nxG5yICIuZ5R__LJ0w4TpmeEObHGpk2YdHDEB_v_wsznGYxQ8oW_8q_xATBcxrJV3QIlR5UG-xS2S6fmUpFZb7_axfV5rvAwtJ0fwQ-EVxdQIADBW0xjPqsJuIkRGnz1Qc5jB9CmVRrtqcza8tUQitQB7ffqW4W7-1Zf700WTNzALJB-Oh8uMREPMk1esJ84K8EpwJ829pWkQ-I9iw4qrlgikDzDxAPQni7zdcyONyAZKIz9O1YyjIa1wJnGiRlwCh-KfgvNJ6UBjZFCBZVx-2515QbYi84M-8HX4qgjDqmvAlAxvxUJEdL76brF08VEkL1Rup_73WZwDVzUgBunU9WJLFhXvXXXnxd2nAj1YdNSvW6Fm24_gdAGVpBKZGhOluG9VGzvir8tBhGCryf-TgsmBSaIoIkpvI01kPo0HBlgeHuk00Dc3Q2OJ7eu8eqFFFEiNbt-dhPeMixP9clRxeWt_l_o97aYZA).
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.8.2.3.
1.12. Pro: Mandatory school could improve the literacy of the people.
1.12.1. Con: More time studying do not always equal improved literacy.
1.13. Pro: It could help the economy by creating more people with higher qualifications for jobs.
1.13.1. Pro: [Piketty](https://hkspolicycast.org/piketty-explains-why-capitals-analysis-of-wealth-inequality-is-far-from-apocalyptic-eeaec28ac40f) argues that the mitigation to Wealth Inequality is to invest in people. He points to Europe as having a lesser problem with WI than USA because of more universal benefits such as good quality education.
1.13.2. Con: Creating a people standard higher than the current one could damage the economy. Imagine having 12 grades just to sweep the floors. It makes the immigrant force less likely to have a actual legal job.
1.14. Con: Since school is not free, it should not be compulsory.
1.14.1. Pro: In South Korea, every school is free for every student except private school. So it is mandatory that Korean students must graduate middle school. But high school isn't free for students so we can suspend going school from high school.
1.14.2. Pro: If not made free, education can end up being a [massive financial burden](https://www.englishforums.com/English/ChildrenEducationExpensiveCountries-GovernmentsPartlyEducati/blnkwx/post.htm) for most parents.
1.14.3. Pro: If education is compulsory and not free then there can be a huge [discrepancy](https://nextbillion.net/public-vs-private-education-in-developing-countries-a-matter-of/) between the quality of education people from different financial backgrounds will receive.
1.14.4. Con: Not everything that's free should be forced on us.
