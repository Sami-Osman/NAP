Discussion Name: Should There be a Universal Basic Income (UBI)?

1. Wealthy countries should provide citizens with a universal basic income \(UBI\).
1.1. Pro: A UBI would reduce crime.
1.1.1. Con: A UBI attracts more illegal immigration.
1.1.1.1. Con: Only citizens would receive a UBI, so illegal immigrants do not have an additional incentive to immigrate.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: UBI incentivizes immigrants to become documented.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Even if UBI payments are only available to citizens, this still provides an increased incentive to immigrate to countries with a UBI and in doing so start the pathway towards citizenship.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This would be a bizarrely long gamble in most countries, where receiving citizenship post-illegal-immigration is exceptionally difficult and requires a substantial period of residence in the country if it is possible at all.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Immigrants may feel they're able to pay back for their immigration through a UBI, enabling them to work harder and be on the right track \(like getting good skills\) towards being a good citizen for when they get to that crossroads.
1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Illegal immigrants may have children who would qualify for and dilute the available UBI resources.
1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Non-citizen children would not qualify.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Even if a UBI is only available to citizens, potential immigrants might have family members who are citizens and who could use their UBI payments to support them.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Given most illegal immigration is from poorer to richer countries, it usually makes more sense for relatives to instead support their family by way of remittances to a poor country where their money has much higher purchasing power.
1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Since a UBI would only be sufficient to meet basic needs, it is unlikely to be able to support additional people.
1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: It is unclear why anyone would view this as any different from other discretionary spending that people may put their UBI payments towards. These family members would be collecting no more UBI payments than anyone else.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: With a UBI, low-wage jobs will become less attractive to most citizens, attracting unprotected [immigrants](http://inequality.org/argument-universal-basic-income/) to do the hard labor, as in [Dubai](http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/middle-east/dubai-migrant-workers-the-hidden-slaves-behind-glamour-city/news-story/b3997ed5b013870424e84d78a561946c).
1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Dubai is not a liberal [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Dubai) nor does it have high levels of workers' [protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Dubai#Foreign_workers_and_labour_rights). The fact that there is an increase in working immigrants does not necessarily mean they have to be unprotected or exploited.
1.1.1.2. Pro: In many countries, being born in that country grants the child automatic citizenship. If that child then receives the UBI, it provides an incentive to immigrate illegally.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: UBI payments for children are typically set at approximately half of that of an adult. Even if a child receives a UBI payment, that is unlikely to be enough money to support the parents.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Historically, Europe has granted [citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) by right of blood \(i.e. inherited by parents\) and America by birth, thus this is only applicable to North and South American countries as most countries allow citizenship by birth with restrictions, and several have increasingly changed policies due to immigration.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: This seems to be more an issue with how citizenship works.
1.1.1.3. Con: Eventually, UBI may be in place in every country, so there would not be such movement across borders due to economic migration.
1.1.2. Con: Studies suggest that implementing a UBI would have [little impact](https://iseralaska.org/2019/02/pfd-study-shows-little-impact-on-crime-providing-important-research-on-universal-income/) on crime.
1.1.3. Pro: If a UBI replaced benefits that have restrictive limiting criteria, then it would reduce crime caused by benefit fraud as you would not need to notify changes of circumstances as extensively.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Some people found guilty of committing benefit fraud have done so [unknowingly](https://www.dpp-law.com/guilty-of-benefit-fraud/), by not realising that the state holds inaccurate information about them or that they need to amend the details of their circumstances.
1.1.4. Pro: Statistical studies of UBIs and similar systems suggest that a UBI might reduce crime.
1.1.4.1. Pro: For the years of [2008-2012](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137) the US Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that persons in poor households at or below the Federal Poverty Level had more than double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: This shows a correlation, but not necessarily a causative link. It is also possible that more violent people are less likely to succeed in a civilized society, or potentially that less educated people – who would as such be less successful as well – might be more violent.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Stress makes it harder for one to control their emotions, and one more liable to feel desperate and lash out. It seems likely that this is causatively related to violence, and that reducing stress via providing a UBI to fund basic necessities would thus reduce violence.
1.1.4.2. Pro: A study by [Akee et. al \(2010\)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.1.86) shows that a government cash transfer might significantly increase education for children coming from poor backgrounds, thereby decreasing the probability of minor criminal offences.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: A cash transfer reducing future criminal offenses is unrelated to UBI. If a complex welfare system different from UBI injected more money into poor background children education than UBI, this argument would be against UBI.
1.1.4.3. Pro: In Namibia, there was about a [40% drop](https://www.theincomer.com/2018/02/28/basic-income-crime-rate-drop-by-40-lower-inequality-even-stronger-workforce/) in crime in areas where a UBI was introduced.
1.1.5. Pro: A UBI addresses the economic causes of crime.
1.1.5.1. Con: Most major economic crimes are motivated by a greed for acquiring wealth above a subsistence level. A UBI is unlikely to decrease this drive.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Four of the five most committed crimes in the US are [property crimes](http://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/what-are-the-most-common-crimes-in-the-united-states/), despite the existence of existing social safety nets.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: This could equally be evidence that existing social safety nets are significantly insufficient.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: The US social safety net is [one of the lowest in the world](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SAFETYNETSANDTRANSFERS/Resources/281945-1124119303499/SSNPrimerNote25.pdf).
1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: The type of crime committed in the US has no bearing on this discussion unless you can provide a link between that type of crime and receipt of benefits
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Organised crime groups attempt to get rich from crime; not merely subsist. Internationally their acts [are worth $870 billion USD a year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/16/organised-crime-worth-560bn).
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Low-level gang members [don't make a lot of money](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/24/opinion/oe-dubner24). They only pursue the *chance* to make it big, which is enough of an incentive that they don't flip burgers instead, but not necessarily enough of an incentive to keep them all on when their new best alternative is "get UBI and sit on your ass playing videogames".
1.1.5.1.3. Con: Even if true, a lack of reduction in economic crime does not mean the UBI is not effective in reducing other types of crime, namely the ones committed to acquire basic sustenance.
1.1.5.1.4. Pro: [White-collar crime](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/white-collar-crime.asp) is an example of crime motivated by greed rather than need.
1.1.5.2. Con: While UBI can address economic problems, many crimes do not occur due to these issue . For instance many crimes stem from issues with [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-related_crime), [mental illness](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807312851), [relationships](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1177/Family-Relationships-Crime-General-socialization-crime.html) or social status.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: There is a [positive relationship](https://borgenproject.org/addiction-poverty-connected/) between poverty and substance abuse.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Poverty incentivizes the sale of drugs because it represents a high-risk/high-reward opportunity for people in [low-income environments](https://www.monarchshores.com/food-for-thought/drug-addiction-and-poverty).
1.1.5.2.1.2. Con: Positive relationship aka correlation doesn't imply causation. The second sentence in the linked above article states: " The direction of causation is unclear". The strongest claim that article makes is that poverty cause drug abuse is: "...and perhaps even some causal effect." Also it completely ignores that the can be no casual effect in any directions i.e. that there is other hidden factor\(s\) that has casual relation to both poverty and drug abuse.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: This does not deny that a UBI would reduce the total rate of crimes.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: UBI is most beneficial to individuals below the poverty line. Some of these individuals are below the poverty line because of addictions. The UBI would enable addictive behavior.
1.1.5.2.3.1. Con: This suggests that not giving them this benefit would stop them from being addicted. There is no reason to believe this.
1.1.5.2.3.2. Con: Staying off of addictive substances is a real struggle, and one needs the means to be able to do it.
1.1.5.2.3.3. Con: Some people in poverty may have addictions, but not all. There are many other causes of, and contributors to, poverty.
1.1.5.2.3.4. Con: It may be worth inadvertently enabling some addictive behaviour in order to deliver the other benefits of the UBI, such as assisting those in poverty for other reasons.
1.1.5.2.3.5. Pro: UBI would provide addictive, impulsive personalities with an endless source of income - enslaving them to impulsivity and rendering change impossible for many.
1.1.5.2.3.5.1. Con: If someone could not change with the advantages offered by a UBI, it's unlikely they would change while suffering the disadvantages of living in poverty.
1.1.5.2.4. Con: A UBI could also give people with drug addictions or mental illness the ability to pay for assistance.
1.1.5.2.4.1. Con: UBI could also give people with drug addictions the means to purchase more drugs.
1.1.5.2.5. Pro: Crime, drugs, broken families and other socially destructive outcomes are more likely in places with high unemployment \([1](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/11/13/na111417-crime-and-youth-unemployment-in-the-caribbean)\), due to the leaving a social support network that work provides.
1.1.5.2.5.1. Con: UBI would give more spare time to citizens to organize in social clubs and create social networks outside a traditional professional or labor settings.
1.1.5.3. Pro: A UBI can reduce the economic stresses that contribute to crime.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Crime stems from a lack of economic opportunities. A UBI provides a means to ameliorate this by enabling people to pursue an education or start a business; or at least live on a stable income.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: With their basic needs covered by a UBI, many people will be able to afford to continue with their higher education.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: After the [Iranian government introduced a UBI](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income), they identified that the lessened working hours of young adults in the program would likely lead them to enroll at schools and universities to focus on their education.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: [The study](http://erf.org.eg/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1090.pdf) does not appear to conclude that the UBI increased education rates; at best, it speculates \(which anyone can do, including outside of a study\). In fact, in the conclusion, the authors write that "youth... can stay in school longer, or enjoy more leisure, though we do know which of these options they choose." \(p. 13\). Thus, we cannot use the study to conclude that the UBI improved educational enrollment, let alone by a significant amount.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Even if this were an accurate characterization of the study, this may not be unique to a UBI; it is wholly plausible that if Iran was already under-providing welfare, introducing a targeted/conditional welfare program would have been more effective at increasing enrollment rates. In other words, the benefits may not have been unique to a UBI program specifically; traditional welfare might have been better for the situation.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2. Con: If higher education provides value to society, there are ample market incentives to furthering education. If, however, if this higher education is simply the self-indulgent study of topics without value to society, then it is not the role of the state to subsidize such unproductive activities.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Education is nearly always of indirect if not direct benefit, as more knowledgeable people can provide or apply their knowledge in any situation where it becomes relevant \(consider someone with medical training acting as a first responder in a medical crisis despite not currently being "on-duty", or someone with specialist training pointing out a hazard which is not immediately apparent\).
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Education provides self-improvement and personal growth benefits from the outlay of effort and self-discipline and dedication, as well as the new information acquired allowing people to change or add to their worldview.
1.1.5.3.1.1.3. Con: With a UBI, there are fewer incentives to get a higher education because you'll make money no matter what.
1.1.5.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Incentives don't disappear because you have the money necessary to take care of your basic needs.
1.1.5.3.1.1.3.2. Con: Human beings are naturally curious; that is what led us to the point we are now. Having basics needs met won't change that — it is more like the opposite we will have more time to make questions.
1.1.5.3.1.1.4. Pro: Early [YC UBI study participants](https://www.thebillfold.com/2017/09/y-combinator-is-expanding-its-basic-income-project/) are pursuing innovative projects, enrolling in career expanding education and proving the concept can work for a wider audience.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5. Con: Governments can directly and specifically support art without having to introduce a UBI.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: Governments can choose to support art which is deemed particularly valuable by society, such as aiding in the upkeep of museums and landmarks, and making art more accessible to its citizens.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Governments can provide funding for schools to take trips to art museums.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Governments can create art programs and provide opportunities for those who want to create art. This is a more effective way of encouraging art and artists.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3. Con: A government - which is definitely not a neutral actor - with the capacity to decide which art is valuable and therefore worth supporting, can have negative political and social consequences. A UBI does not suffer from this.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Government-critical art may not receive support.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3.2. Pro: Governments would have tremendous influence on a society's art and culture scene by picking artists.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3.3. Con: Governments supporting art are unlikely to be directly involved in the sponsoring of art, and are more likely to establish institutions which act independently of the government. Generally, the government is primarily responsible for setting the budgets their respective institutions have to work with.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3.3.1. Con: [Culture minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_minister) is a cabinet position in some governments.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3.3.2. Pro: Governments [cultural policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_policy) generally do not directly target specific types of artists, but rather indirectly targets art by funding museums, accessibility, regulation, and protection of national heritage.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.1.3.4. Pro: Politicians have a system-inherent motivation to appeal to their \(voter\)[base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_\(politics\)) in order to get reelected.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.2. Con: When only lower socioeconomic groups receive a benefit it is often framed as a handout and only designed to tide people over while they go back to traditional employment.
1.1.5.3.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The government is likely to primarily sponsor those who are in need of money in order to perform art and sustain projects. Since an artist within the lower economic class is less likely to be able to afford it, they are more likely to be targeted by government art grants and sponsorship.
1.1.5.3.1.1.6. Pro: At the lowest end of the job market, workers often have to put in so many hours that they have little time for anything else, especially self improvement. Self improvement can only come from being able to study and or experience a greater variety of things which means either increased free time or jobs that are particularly well rounded.
1.1.5.3.1.1.6.1. Pro: This is especially true in places where the cost of living is particularly high, pushing many workers to take on extra hours or additional jobs, which further reduces their access to leisure time away from work.
1.1.5.3.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: This is can be found in the Hawaiian culture through the notion of "[living aloha](https://www.cbrigham.com/living-aloha-and-pono/)," which advocates building up the local community in order to maximize time spent with family in order to combat the negative effects of the lack of leisure time.
1.1.5.3.1.1.6.2. Pro: People will be able to do longer studies, or retake studies at some point in their life, knowing they will have the resources to live during that time. The possibility of taking studies anytime can encourage some to acquire skills in fields with huge demand.
1.1.5.3.1.1.6.3. Pro: A UBI frees individuals to train and learn at any time in their life without fear of not being able to sustain themselves. People will no longer be locked into careers they found out too late that they do not like due to the inability to attain the high level of learning required to do something else
1.1.5.3.1.1.7. Pro: When citizens can better afford to spend time studying, [overall levels of education grow](http://pas.sagepub.com/content/32/1/7.short) and the workforce becomes more skilled.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1. Con: A UBI could also lead to decreasing levels of education, as universal financial security would lessen incentives for citizens to pursue higher education.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: The prospect of securing a higher-paying job \(an incentive undermined by a UBI\) is an important factor for many people when considering [higher education](http://study.com/articles/Why_Should_I_Seek_a_Higher_Education.html).
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.2. Con: Many people study motivated by higher ideals or out of curiosity.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3. Con: A UBI only covers basic needs. If an individual wants to achieve a high-paying job, higher education is normally required.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1. Pro: Even if people merely end up changing jobs, that requires a degree of flexibility, a higher education and continuous training. A guaranteed income makes people more confident embracing these changes in the job market.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: People aren't able to magically change their skill set overnight, even if one job was made available before the old job was gone, that's useless to someone who can't yet fill the new role.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1.2. Con: Companies are less likely to offer re-training programs when they think that workers can subsist on the UBI. Workers would have to actively seek re-training, which is a significantly higher barrier to entry to maintain a position in the workforce. In this sense, people would be more likely to exit the job force, resulting in decreased innovation as a society.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Workers should actively be putting in effort anyway, both to improve their current standing within their jobs and to keep whatever industry they're in moving forward.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1.2.2. Con: In the status quo, without a UBI, employers don't offer re-training to employees out of a sense of charity; they do so because it allows them to continue to retain a valued asset. The introduction of a UBI doesn't change this calculus, it only makes the worker better of when this training isn't on offer.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1.3. Con: Even if retraining were desirable, a direct solution to this problem would be to introduce a welfare benefit tied conditionally to taking up skills retraining courses. This would avoid the possibility of workers leaving the workforce altogether because welfare looks too comfortably attractive.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Introducing such conditions would only force people to register for training that they had no interest in. There are already many such programs that tie in conditions to receiving welfare, and all they do is create an incredibly burdensome bureaucracy.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.1.4. Pro: A UBI would disqualify most people from Student Aid Finance, Grants, and scholarships presently based on low income level. Many would no longer feel obliged to educate themselves minimally to qualify for jobs that they don't want to do anyway and those desiring higher education would no longer qualify for government aid to do so. Feed a nominal UBI amount into your FAFSA and watch the bottom line Expected Family Contribution figure go up!
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.2. Con: If an entire population is highly educated then it is no longer a defining feature for any individual worker. As a result it would only increase the baseline level of skills required for all jobs; leading to people doing the same work for the same money regardless of the fact that they have pursued higher education.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.2.1. Con: Even if everybody has access to higher education, different capabilities and interests will still result in workers with different skills.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: In Scotland, where higher education is entirely [subsidised](https://beta.gov.scot/news/higher-education-student-support-for-scotland-2015-16/) by the government, and therefore everybody has access to it, not all [students](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2003/03/16786/20354) decide to pursue a university degree.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.2.2. Pro: [Credentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credentialism_and_educational_inflation) and degree creep have been identified as problems in a number of professions.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.2.3. Con: Degree creep is already caused by requirements and [regulations](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/11/stop-degree-creep-health-care.html) \(e.g. asking nurses or other health professionals to have extra degrees to exercise their professions\). The additional capacity to access education would not increase degree creep significantly.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.2.4. Con: If a population in general has a higher level of education, there is greater opportunity for the diversification of interests alongside intellectual exchanges between citizens. This encourages  theoretical advancements and the creation of new jobs at levels of experience not yet achieved.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.3. Pro: Increased levels of education are good for the economy, as educated workers are more likely to innovate.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.3.1. Con: A UBI would take away the drive to innovate.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.3.1.1. Con: A UBI would provide the freedom to innovate for those who already have the drive to do so.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.3.1.2. Con: Some people have a genuine drive to improve things for society, which provides a drive to innovate irrespective of financial incentives.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.4. Con: Growing education levels do not necessarily increase social mobility, especially for people belonging to traditionally [oppressed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/free-university-tuition-in-scotland-has-not-benefited-the-poor-say-academics-a6757546.html) groups. For example, many university graduates with bachelor degrees are unable to find work in their field, and [end up stuck in minimum-wage or part time jobs](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-06/college-grads-taking-low-wage-jobs-displace-less-educated).
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.4.1. Con: This is more of a problem with the economy as a whole. It is still definitely [true](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2017/01/23/dispelling-the-myth-of-underemployed-college-graduates/#43527cfb502c) that people with college degrees have an easier time finding high-paying jobs than those without.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.4.2. Pro: This is especially pernicious given the amount of debt many students accumulate when undertaking higher education.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.4.2.1. Pro: 68% of graduates from public and nonprofit colleges in the United States had an average student loan debt of [$30,100](http://ticas.org/posd/map-state-data) per borrower. This is difficult to pay back on a [minimum-wage](http://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-workers-poverty-anymore-raising/) salary.
1.1.5.3.1.1.7.4.2.1.1. Con: [College graduates' average income](http://time.com/money/collection-post/3829776/heres-what-the-average-grad-makes-right-out-of-college/) is higher than the minimum-wage salary.
1.1.5.3.1.2. Pro: There is a higher correlation between unemployment and crime than between income level and crime. If the economic impoverishment thesis for crime holds, unemployed people receiving the UBI would still be equally likely to commit crime. \([Hooge et al, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262933140_Unemployment_Inequality_Poverty_and_Crime_Spatial_Distribution_Patterns_of_Criminal_Acts_in_Belgium_2001-06)\)
1.1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: This effect is likely to be because it is quite difficult to both obtain and stay on welfare. Thus the unemployed are likely to turn to crime out of economic desperation; a factor that would not occur given a UBI.
1.1.5.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The study in question focuses on Belgium, one of the few countries that offers [unlimited](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/2015/unemployment_benefits_20151126.pdf) unemployment benefits. There is little difficulty staying on welfare there.
1.1.5.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: According to [the European Commission the payment of benefits in Belgium](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1102&intPageId=4425&langId=en\)) is limited to three years. No unemployment insurance scheme exists for self-employed persons, with the exception of a bankruptcy allowance which is not paid by unemployment insurance. The claim that it is 'unlimited' does not seem to hold.
1.1.5.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: In many countries, the benefits system was [designed to be punitive and onerous in order to deter people from claiming without real need](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/working-papers/do-punitive-approaches-to-unemployment-benefit-recipients-increase-welfare-exit-and-employment-a-cross-area-analysis-of-uk-sanctioning-reforms.html). This model is outdated and does not reflect the goals of an enlightened society.
1.1.5.3.1.2.2. Con: While there was a small rise in unemployment under a UBI in [Manitoba, Canada,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome) during the 1970s, it was uniquely limited to teenagers and new mothers. Both of these were for assumed reasons other than laziness- teenagers were focusing on school, and new mothers were able to provide for their newborns more effectively. Other demographics did not see a major change in employment rates.
1.1.5.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Existing studies on UBI \(in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada for example: [www.cbc.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/basic-income-cheques-going-to-400-households-as-project-gets-off-to-slow-start-1.4329212\))\) did not compare giving cash to receiving other government benefits of equal value. They gave a test group additional cash without taking away existing benefits. These studies don't address the UBI proposed here where the cash benefits are instead of, not in addition to, existing government benefits.
1.1.5.3.1.2.3. Con: Unemployment leads to crime due to economic desperation and alienation. A wealthy unemployed person is not likely to commit crimes.
1.1.5.3.1.2.3.1. Con: A wealthy person is more likely to commit white collar crimes. Less likely to be prosecuted, and more likely to be able to afford a competent defense. They have more to loose, much more leverage, and their criminality is more impactful.
1.1.5.3.1.2.4. Pro: Those who are unemployed have more opportunity in the form of free time for committing certain types of crime. The old adage comes to mind; idle hands are the devil's playground.
1.1.5.3.1.3. Pro: A UBI makes it more likely that people will attempt to start their own companies, or become self-employed.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: [61%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/15832/majority-americans-want-start-own-business.aspx) of employed Americans want to start their own business, preferring to work for themselves than for someone else. This becomes possible with a UBI.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Start-up failure rate in the US after 4 years is between 42% and 63%. This shows that this is not a long-term sustainable pathway for most people. \([StatisticBrain](http://www.statisticbrain.com/startup-failure-by-industry/)\)
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: [29%](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-reports/The-20-Reasons-Startups-Fail.pdf) of start-ups fail because they run out of funding. A UBI can offer additional capital to help businesses succeed.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Start-ups that fail for lack of funding usually need more than the small influx of cash that one individual's UBI payment would generate.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If a UBI can provide all citizens with a trickle of disposable income then it provides an environment that is suitable for crowdfunding like Kickstarter or micropayment subscription services.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: If we focus on sustainability instead of profitability, then the UBI could itself start and sustain a small business.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: We can help more people with a profitable and growing business than with a tax that has to pass through a bureaucracy to get to the people who need it.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.3. Con: UBI is designed for welfare, not venture funding. Those who start a business are involved in serving the public which is a large responsibility. Those that businesses that do not serve the public must be allowed to fail quickly.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Businesses that do not serve the public effectively will still fail or perform poorly in the presence of a UBI, as their more effective competitors will outperform them and substandard products and services will be recognized and rejected by consumers.
1.1.5.3.1.3.2. Con: A UBI may provide an income that is barely above the poverty line; as such it would be barely enough to live on let alone provide resources enough to start a business with.
1.1.5.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Removing the risk of abject poverty as a result of failure could very well be a motivating factor for quite a few lower-income people deciding whether or not to risk entrepreneurship.
1.1.5.3.1.3.2.2. Con: The largest barrier to starting a business is time. Most people cannot quit their job for long enough to get a business up and running, or the consequence of failure is to lose everything. You still require food, housing and transportation while starting a business. A UBI would allow most people to survive while also focusing on starting a business.
1.1.5.3.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Some potential entrepreneurs cannot afford to leave their current employment to work on projects they hope will pan out to successful businesses.  A UBI would allow such entrepreneurs to take extended time off of paid to work to invest in their startup.
1.1.5.3.1.3.2.2.2. Con: Anyone whose bills still exceed the amount they get from the UBI \(which would especially be the case for single-breadwinner family households\) would not be able to start a business because of this. At best, it is helpful for a tiny slice of people at the margins.
1.1.5.3.1.3.3. Pro: A UBI would enhance entrepreneurship, sustaining people while they develop projects that may take time to generate profits.
1.1.5.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: UBI pilot studies in Zambia and Mexico showed increased entrepreneurial activity. [oecd.org](http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC/POVNET\(2008\)8&docLanguage=En) \(pg. 10 of the attached policy guidance note\).
1.1.5.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: UBI means that those looking to start new businesses or become self-employed can do so without the risk of losing the ability to pay for living costs. New business owners need not fear that if their business or project fails that they will be left without money to pay for rent or food, they will be protected with a UBI. This allows for trial and error with relative safety for budding entrepreneurs.
1.1.5.3.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: This allows business owners to bolster their profitability by not drawing a wage for themselves during the initial set up years when capital expenditure is high.
1.1.5.3.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: A UBI would encourage more entrepreneurial activity in non-welfare states since individuals won't lose their healthcare if they quit they job \(they can pay for insurance with their UBI\).
1.1.5.3.1.3.4. Pro: A UBI would enable a lot of people to do what they really like, instead of what they currently do for a stable income. Doing what you really like for a few years helps you master some skills which, together with great quality coming from your enthusiasm around that "hobby", might result in an increase of small businesses.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: Enjoying or finding passion in one's work increases motivation and hence, willingness to put time and effort in and effectiveness.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.2. Pro: There is also no guarantee that "what one really likes" is unproductive, and indeed it is hard to find jobs \(or other activities!\) which are completely unproductive.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Even someone who does not produce goods which are directly valued in monetary terms or \(deliberately\) participate in intellectual or artistic endeavours still contributes to society if they interact with other people - they can provide knowledge and information, opinions and perspectives, friendship, listening and support, participation in shared/group activities \(which tend to improve with more participants and/or require a minimum/specific number of participants in most cases\).
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.3. Con: A UBI would mean people are less likely to pursue profitable business ventures in favor of ones that they personally enjoy, which leads to less of society's needs \(e.g. plumbing, massage therapy, elderly care\) being met in favour of more people pursuing unsustainable businesses like party planning, book writing, etc.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.3.1. Con: But if the number of people pursuing business ventures goes up and the profitable ventures are still available, there will be more people motivated to start a business who also personally enjoy making money. Supply and demand will also only make these ventures more profitable if their demand is left unmet over time.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.3.2. Con: The fact that people are not forced to do unwelcome and poorly-paid jobs in order to survive does not mean that people will not do those jobs if there is a comensurate reward. If society has need of goods or services that are underprovided those goods or services would become more valuable and so able to demand a greater reward, providing a greater incentive for people to provide them. Inequality is driven by people being forced to accept unfair deals rather than be destitute in a buyers market.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.3.2.1. Con: Although higher wages would still be incentive, people would still have the ability to fall back on the UBI if they run into financial trouble, which would decentives people from choosing safe jobs. This could lead to both a lot of high risk reward jobs such as philanthropy and low paying but entertaining jobs such as in the art field.
1.1.5.3.1.3.4.4. Pro: A UBI would allow people to do their hobbies and travel, discover the world and not do undesired jobs just to make for living. And if a person would like to get more money, they can find work they like.
1.1.5.3.1.3.5. Pro: A UBI provides an instant safety net and thus reduces the need for overly-expensive, or exploitative credit.
1.1.5.3.1.3.5.1. Pro: Banks are more likely to grant lines of credit, as applicants have a UBI to fall back on as loan security.
1.1.5.3.1.3.5.1.1. Con: Banks want a good asset-to-debt ratio when assessing loans, and will likely calculate UBI payments as a negative factor in the same way they already count Social Security Income \(in the US\) as a negative.
1.1.5.3.1.3.5.2. Con: If the UBI is utilized to generate a line of credit then it is not being used to cover essentials such as food, clothing, and shelter.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6. Con: Starting a business is a risky financial proposition; something that a UBI shouldn't be encouraging for people who are on low incomes.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.1. Con: UBI does not encourage low income individuals to start businesses directly. It simply provides more start-up capital to those who may already want to but do not have enough funds.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.1.1. Con: A UBI might have laws that prevent it from being able used as such, thus it might not provide any start-up capital at all.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: A UBI is specifically designed \(and named\) to be an income that is both universal and unconditional. Any conditions on how it's spent would make it conditional, and thus also not a normal income either.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.2. Con: A universal basic income is given to everyone, across the spectrum of earned income. Therefore, middle class people can also use their UBI to start a business.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.3. Pro: More capital means more \(and greater\) acceptable risks can be taken by a new business owner. More risks being taken will eventually lead to more businesses entering the marketplace. This might not be a net benefit for UBI pensioners, but for the marketplace it absolutely would be.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4. Con: A UBI actually enables and encourages these values by providing a stable safety net that could prevent people from failing. People then would have a greater capacity to develop these values instead of diverting their focus to mere survival \(i.e. no more [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp)\).
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.1. Pro: People who do not work out of financial fear are [more productive](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/what-if-everybody-didnt-have-to-work-to-get-paid/393428/).
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: [One reason](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/12/opinions/schulte-leisure-productivity/) for low productivity is that people are unable to enjoy the benefits of the money they earn through their labor, since they have no time. A system that allows people to actually enjoy their life means that they are more productive at work, since they are more relaxed.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: This argument is [empirically supported](http://www.forbes.com/sites/elenabajic/2015/08/25/take-a-vacation-to-boost-your-productivity-at-work/#3a27c02c6955) by statistics in countries with more days for vacation.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that this is a causal relation as opposed to a simple correlation. It is possible that countries with the highest productivity can afford the most days for vacation.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2. Pro: A basic income would provide a person with multiple chances to become financially literate. Currently, without affluent parents or any other sturdy safety net, one or two bad decisions or unlucky outcomes can be a slippery slope into debt and/or poverty.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.1. Con: UBI is unnecessary when it comes to teaching someone personal financial responsibility. Any interaction with money is a learning opportunity, especially when the person has earned it.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.1.1. Con: People should not be penalized, or worse, suffer, for the rest of their lives over mistakes made early - which is possible without a sufficient safety net like a UBI or sufficient welfare.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.2. Con: UBI doesn't prevent a person from spending beyond their means or accruing debts they are unable to pay.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.2.1. Con: It does, however, provide a safety net for gradually recovering from the results of doing so, and provides a second chance once the lesson is learned - which is what the original claim is arguing.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.2.2. Con: Unless you restrict what people are allowed to spend their money on, this applies equally to any other income, from employment or otherwise.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.3. Pro: With the basic needs of the people covered by UBI, they can focus more time on experimentation and gathering experience.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.4. Pro: UBI provides people with economic security which allows them to invest more.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.4.1. Pro: A UBI assists small businesses by allowing genuinely interested parties to devote more of their time, effort, and attention to the business rather than having to worry about their own employment and financial security.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.5. Con: Good decision makers should not be forced to provide financial support to poor decision makers.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.5.1. Con: Humans should not be damned to suffering and hardship for single mistakes, or even a series of mistakes. "Rescue" and education efforts should always be made.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.3. Pro: Similar to how giving children pocket money develops their understanding of and responsibility with money, the UBI stipend could help people develop better financial responsibility.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.4. Pro: The difference between a UBI and a minimum salary has to be regularized, in order to avoid mechanisms where not working is more remunerative than doing so.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.4.1. Con: This will lead to a general decrease in job positions, as with the same money an entrepreneur will be able to hire fewer people.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.4.2. Pro: This could force large company enterpreneurs to invest more of their capitals in working force.
1.1.5.3.1.3.6.5. Con: There is many low risk, low capital business options that can raise someone out of poverty that could be explored with a UBI in place. For example, if someone wants to become a gardener, cleaner, software developer, translator. There is a development period where the small business is only looking for customers but has no money in place. UBI would bridge that gap where as many now don't earn enough to save enough or borrow enough to bridge the 6 to 12 months to build a client list and earn more
1.1.5.3.1.3.7. Con: Implementing a UBI could require increasing income or business taxes that make it harder to start businesses or maintain employees.
1.1.5.3.1.3.7.1. Pro: Increased taxation can lead to people being unwilling to open up businesses.
1.1.5.3.1.3.7.2. Con: A UBI is agnostic to how it is funded. Increasing taxes on businesses is a choice separate from UBI.
1.1.5.3.1.3.8. Con: Extending government grants and support schemes would better support new businesses and cost less.
1.1.5.3.1.3.8.1. Pro: For the same cost of a UBI, much more support to new businesses could be provided through targeted government grants and loans. The money saved from not paying 'wasted' UBI to the wealthy could go into initial grants for new small businesses, to get them off the ground.
1.1.5.3.1.3.8.2. Pro: Government support would be time-bounded, which would give the necessary drive for businesses to work hard or fail. A UBI could indefinitely prop up businesses which may have no productive future.
1.1.5.3.1.3.8.3. Pro: Support could be conditional on a good business plan. This helps make sure that people are working on a business with actual potential, which would reduce stress and the [high chance of failure](https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail).
1.1.5.3.1.4. Con: Crime is always a personal decision. Blaming lack of economic opportunity disposes with personal responsibility for one's own actions.
1.1.5.3.1.4.1. Pro: Drug addicts would need [more money](https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/mother-of-two-steals-food-after-spending-centrelin/3657814/) than a UBI provides, thus would still have to steal or beg.
1.1.5.3.1.5. Con: In wealthy countries, like the U.S., there are always economic opportunities. They may be hard to take advantage of, but not impossible. See any rags to riches success story for anecdotal evidence. Which is sufficient for this point, if it's possible, even for one person to actually accomplish, then it's possible for others to follow in their footsteps and duplicate their results.
1.1.5.3.1.6. Con: A UBI by definition is enough to cover the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year. Therefore, UBI could not allow for a person to pursue an education or start a business. If it did, it would be providing more than the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1. Con: Under a UBI existential stress is lowered and free time is increased, giving the person time to complete their studies using free resources such as the library and the internet.
1.1.5.3.1.6.2. Con: Under current welfare programs, it is not possible to accumulate any extra wealth as any and all liquid wealth is seen as a signal the claimant does not need assistance and thus benefits are reduced. Under a UBI if you are smart about your finances, you can accumulate money as there is no means testing which means there is no cap on how much you can accumulate. If you can live frugally, you could accumulate a large amount of money and thus start a business.
1.1.5.3.1.6.2.1. Pro: This is really an important point. There are other claims that state people would work less \(less incentive\) with a UBI in place, but really, with other welfare programs that are gone if you work and earn something additionally, those are more discouraging people to work.
1.1.5.3.1.6.2.2. Con: As the parent claim states, "By definition a UBI is enough to cover the total cost of all essential resources". If there was anything left over to save, then you're being paid more than the total cost of all essential resources. If you're capable of accumulating anything the UBI is too much.
1.1.5.3.1.6.3. Con: Starting a business would still require savings for the initial investment. The UBI would just be a safety net, and cover personal expenses while the business is not yet making money.
1.1.5.3.1.6.3.1. Con: In order to get those initial savings, a person would have to be above the UBI level. Therefore, that person is then taking a risk by starting a business, if the risk pays off that person could become very wealthy, if it doesn't they may end up with nothing. Society shouldn't be responsible for funding people's risk taking behavior, even moreso if they don't get to share in the rewards. If they want to take a risk, they should take the responsibility too.
1.1.5.3.1.6.4. Con: Per the topic background, a UBI "is presumed to at least meet the poverty line or whatever indicator best represents the amount needed to live a modest life". This is not so restrictive as to only cover the cost of all essential resources for one adult, and is a minimum not a maximum, so a UBI could allow a person to accumulate wealth and do those things, if they were more frugal than others.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: [Financial stress](http://www.acseduonline.com/blog-stress-causes-crime-95.aspx) can cause crime when there is a lack of qualifications and social support for at-risk individuals. A UBI provides extra financial support to lower crime, by fostering stability and security towards a decent life instead of through crime.
1.1.5.3.3. Con: Implementing a UBI would require massive increases in taxation on the middle class, resulting in greater stress for a large swath of the population.
1.1.5.3.3.1. Con: There are alternative sources of financing, such as public dividends, that may be used to sustain UBI without creating extra pressure on the layperson's economics.
1.1.5.3.3.2. Con: The tax effects on people who are already well-off and stable would not be as significant as the benefits to people whose quality of life and/or prospects would be significantly improved by a UBI.
1.1.5.3.4. Pro: A UBI provides people with financial safety, reducing the stress associated with economic and social decisions. That means less stress cycling through from [person to person](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shrink/201209/is-stress-contagious) during [interactions](https://www.psychologies.co.uk/why-stress-so-infectious), which also improves social behavior as there will be fewer stressed people to interact with.
1.1.5.4. Pro: A UBI reduces financial inequality by lifting the incomes of those at the bottom \(of income\) up by a higher % than for the wealthy. As [crime is connected to financial inequality](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf), the UBIs capability to reduce financial inequality will lead to lower crime levels.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: [Crime exists at all strata of income.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/pyschology-white-collar-criminal/503408/)
1.1.5.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.
1.2. Con: UBIs would have negative effects on national economies.
1.2.1. Pro: A UBI would lead to greater inflation.
1.2.1.1. Pro: If the production of services and goods come to an halt, the available resources will become scarce, since nothing is being produced. Therefore it will probably lead to more inflation when more money is printed, causing a downward spiral of the economy.
1.2.1.2. Con: A UBI would require an unrealistically high level of inflation to occur for the benefits of a universal basic income to be strongly mitigated.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The amount of inflation that UBI causes may not be much because it's aimed at [getting people out of the poverty line](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15364546/universal-basic-income-review-stern-murray-automation). Net recipients of UBI transfers are going to be spending mostly on basic needs and thus have minimal effect on the money supply.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Not all goods are meat and potatoes. There are goods the poorest don't utilize which have constrained or sluggish changes in supply, such as housing.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This would only add to the monetary stress for those items, not divert money from them to goods that would grow the economy.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Assuming what UBI transfers will be spent on is hearsay - one doesn't know and can't decide for others what that money will be spent on and it's just as plausible that the money could be mis-spent, requiring yet another safety net for those who waste their UBI.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Giving even more money to people who will misspend it is redundant, as that money will also be misspent. Education is what is needed in those cases.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Even if the level of inflation under a UBI was moderate, it might still be high enough to render the implementation of a UBI less efficient to a family than other models of welfare.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: UBI payments can be indexed to inflation.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: A UBI will only have an effect on inflation if it is set so high that demand outstrips the ability of the labor market and natural resources to meet that demand. It will likely have only a modest effect on inflation.
1.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: In most cases, supply can rise to meet increasing demand, undercutting any inflationary pressure. The obvious exception is real estate, but a UBI will allow more people to migrate away from concentrated population centers because they are no longer dependent on the jobs there. This will effectively reduce demand for real estate, countering any inflationary pressure. Renewable energy will counter the inflation of fuel prices.
1.2.1.3. Pro: A UBI will raise the general demand in a national economy as citizens would have more available income that can be used [for consumption and investment \(saving\)](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~webfac/wood/e100b_f08/consumption.pdf). This process will lead to a higher price level and [thus inflation](http://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2002/october/inflation-factors-rise/).
1.2.1.3.1. Con: There only is a [very limited positive correlation](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/05/20/higher-incomes-loosely-linked-to-more-spending-according-to-jpmorgan-chase-study) between changes in income and changes in consumption.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The researchers here are careful that the study would not infer macroeconomic trends \(inflation being a macroeconomic trend\). Those who already have a JPMorgan Chase account would not be those who go from being homeless to affording a mobile home, for example.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Assuming the vast majority of citizens will not stop working, the UBI is an addition on top of their incomes. This leads to an increase in the amount of money in the national economy.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: In addition to that, a UBI also boosts the spending power of the lower class, which intensifies the mentioned effect.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: A UBI would not create money from nothing, but rather reallocate who has it to spend.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: A [UBI](http://morganfoundation.org.nz/why-the-guardian-is-wrong-on-ubi/) is a redistributive transfer; it is not a new cost the government must meet. Rather it is a cost to some and a windfall to others - the net cost is zero.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: It might not be a cost to the government, but it is an immense cost to taxpayers. Many people will have to pay a far higher tax-rate to pay for the large scope of the program.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: UBIs impose this cost on people who have worked to earn their money.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con: That is true of all existing tax systems and of all existing welfare systems.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.2. Con: The work one does today couldn't be done without previous generations' work, since fire handling to the first wheel, from writing to printing press, the transistor, internet, etc. UBI then, is paid thanks to all wealth created in history as a dividend. It's an effective way to make everybody access this heritage as a right.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.3. Con: A UBI imposes this cost on those who have won the lottery of birth. The difference between an executive and an apple-picker is more likely due to systemic factors than a result of either person's choices.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Of the 29 richest people in the US, [most were not born rich](http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-people-in-the-us-2016-1/#19-sheldon-adelson-11).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.4. Con: This assumes people are getting money based on the actual value they're adding to the system. The redistribution would make up for some of the difference generated when someone gains capital without adding enough value back into the system.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.5. Con: Many wealthy people have far more money than can ever have been earned through products of labor. Let's assume that someone is doing a job with such intense labor that they earn $6000 an hour. If this person worked 60 hours a week, every single week, for 50 years, and didn't spend a penny of their income on food, housing, taxes, or anything else, they still would not be a billionaire. Anyone with that much money has been exploiting those under them and their money should be redistributed.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.5.1. Con: There are more sources of income than production and exploitation. Investing in somebody else their business is not exploitation and one of the more common ways of earning enough to become a billionaire. Running a successful business yourself is another way.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.2.6. Con: This argument assumes that all income comes from human activity. With the introduction and proliferation of automation and AI, more and more of the income will be due to activities performed by non-human actors, effectively making an UBI a redistribution from non-human to human actors.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: Most of those receiving a UBI also pay, on net, positive amounts of tax. Therefore, when calculating the cost of a UBI, it doesn't make sense to to calculate their UBI as a cost when it can easily be offset by a small tax increase.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.3.1. Con: This would, in effect, invalidate the whole definition of "universal" basic income—this proposal essentially just says "we make it universal, but the rich don't get any benefits in the end." In other words, it would make more sense to only pay the poor, rather than also paying the rich.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.3.2. Con: As per basic accounting, all the flows of money \(costs and revenue\) should be accounted for, or else people will be more liable to make accounting/policy errors. Thus, it may be true that these costs might be offset by "a small tax increase," but we still have to account for the total expenditures. Otherwise \(for example\), people might forget that taxes must be raised in order to offset the UBI for rich people.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: It is particularly important to account for the payments to rich people because these payments previously were not being made \(e.g. under targeted welfare systems\).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4. Con: Redistribution reduces production by decreasing the incentive to work. Hence redistribution creates a net loss to society, not zero as claimed.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1. Con: [The multiplier effect](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Managing_the_economy/The_multiplier_effect.html) shows that the accumulation of capital harms the national economy. By redirecting money pooling at the top through a [continual redistribution](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/why-should-we-support-the_b_7630162.html) from the top-middle down to the bottom-middle of the income spectrum, the entire economy would actually expand.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Once people can easily afford basic goods like food, water or shelter, or health, this would release public money from health-related spending like disease prevention and boost the income of private companies with millions of new consumers. The company's new income would boost tax revenue and help compensate the initial investment in the UBI.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Increased spending on consumption has negative externalities.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Increased spending on consumption is bad for the environment.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Green products, which have a more [positive impact](http://www.ripublication.com/gjmbs_spl/gjmbsv3n6_09.pdf) on mankind and the environment, cost on average [50% more](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/7785705/Green-goods-cost-nearly-50-more.html) than non-green products. With a UBI, more individuals will have more funds to purchase green products, resulting in a less harmful impact on the environment.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if a UBI results in people having more money, that doesn't imply people would choose to spend the extra money on more environmentally friendly products.  For example, if a person is too poor to afford a car, they take the bus to work.  But once they have enough money they buy a car, which hurts the environment rather than helps.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: With added income, more people will have the ability to pay for college, which will enrich the scientific labor force attempting to study and combat climate change.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.3. Con: A UBI tied to a value based on the total sustainable natural services, including renewably-sourced human and animal products, of each region. This would solve both intranational ecological exploitation and international inequities due to colonialism/neoliberalism/etc. while providing a natural, measurable de-externalization of capitalist production costs.[Environmentally Sustainable National Income - A new alternative marcoindicator](http://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38828016.pdf)
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Global economic enfranchisement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tralfamadoran777) accomplishes this by paying an equal share of the interest paid in money creation to each, a functional tax on all money, which is "a value based on the total sustainable..." and will also fill the data gaps referenced in the link, by providing data from each.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.4. Con: Many people work jobs they know to be environmentally damaging in order to earn enough for a decent life. A UBI would allow them to stop.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Instead of giving people UBI "for free" let's hire them to clean our environment.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.5. Con: Having a higher base income allows people to more easily [make capital investments in green technologies](http://basicincome.org/news/2016/08/green-technology-another-reason-need-basic-income/) \(e.g. solar panels\) that would previously have been unaffordable.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.6. Con: UBI helps address climate change by reducing commuting time, office space, and consumerism. It allows people to engage in enriching low-carbon activities such as small-scale farming, art, and study.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: If a UBI's implementation means [a shorter working week](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/basic-income-short-working-week-green-institute-report), this would also reduce commutes, reducing emissions and benefitting the environment.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: Fewer working hours mean more recreational hours, and recreation has a higher environmental impact than working. For example, recreation in the UK already accounts for [20% of CO2 emissions](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/your-carbon-footprint-revealed-climate-change-report-finds-we-each-produce-11-tons-of-carbon-a-year-427664.html).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.6.1.2. Con: A shorter work week leads to more commuting, as more people need to do the same work \(assuming the same work needs to be done\).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.7. Con: A UBI makes it possible to effectively fight climate change and environmental damage by loosening relationship between welfare and GDP growth. Societies will no longer have to rely on infinite, exponential economic growth and creating useless jobs that create no social value in order to ensure basic survival of individuals.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.8. Con: Not all consumption is bad for the environment. As we move further into the digital age, more and more of what people spend their money on is not physical.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.9. Pro: [Families and homes with similar incomes tend to own similar homes and objects](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/matrix). A low universal basic income give a lot of people and families a very similar low income which will lead to a strong increase of similar cheap products which can lead to [environmental complications](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150928153039.htm) and can have a [negative impact on climate change](https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Meat-the-Biggest-Threat-and-Opportunity-to-Climate-Change-FINAL.pdf).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2.1.10. Con: Whether there will or won't be an increase in consumption is difficult to know and extending that conjecture to a subsequent further impact on the environment is even less knowable. Hence 'moot' - unknowable and thereby not relevant. Just such a long way from UBI to consumption to climate change.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.2. Con: A person needs a certain amount of income in order to be capable of productive work. Issues associated with poverty prevent people from entering the labour force.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: Poverty is stressful, as is starting a new job. If someone cannot handle that stress, they can easily become trapped in poverty, unable to successfully commence employment.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: Health issues can prevent one from being able to work, but may require costly surgery, medicine, or other treatment to successfully treat.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Targeted welfare may be more effective at improving such situations, providing the needed medicine or treatment free or at a discounted cost.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Targeted welfare requires identification of the cases where it is needed - creating "gaps" in the "net" which cases may "slip through", as well as requiring bureaucracy and administration and investigation/inquisition to find and confirm the cases that would require it. A UBI would avoid these issues by being unconditionally available to everyone.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: If a targeted welfare program requires would-be beneficiaries to come forward to it, this creates several issues - would-be beneficiaries may not know about it, may not have the time or ability to do what is required of them to access it, or may feel that it is stigmatized or prefer to "deal with their own problems themselves". A UBI would avoid these issues also by being unconditionally available to everyone.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: UBI reduces incentives for creating new products and advancing our civilization. Many good inventions and products were driven by the desire to become wealthy, if much of that wealth was taken away and redistributed to people not working, many would not try as hard to make more money.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.3.1. Con: Wealth will still be possible to accrue \(and thus still a motivation\), as income beyond your UBI can still be attained through work or the sale of goods, ideas, and services.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.4. Con: Most people will still want to work at least part time to supplement their UBI, provided working conditions are safe and reasonable.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.5. Con: There are plenty of non-financial incentives to work, which may in fact increase the incentive to work when one is not being forced by financial pressures into working a job they would prefer not to.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.6. Con: A UBI will redistribute wealth and thereby give more opportunities to the poor, enabling the overwhelming majority of the population to be more productive.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.7. Con: If the UBI is financed by a tax on the top 1% then for 99% the incentive to work will remain the same.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.5. Con: Redistribution means disruption and causes changes in the marketplace. If it were a worldwide system, it would at least eliminate the flight of businesses to other countries, but issues would still remain.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.6. Con: It’s inefficient to take money from wealthy or middle class citizens only to give it back to them. It makes more sense to just let them keep it in the first place.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.6.1. Con: This does nothing to prevent poverty or poverty-related suffering and deaths.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.6.1.1. Con: Neither does giving money to rich people, which is what the UBI does.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.6.1.1.1. Con: People who are wealthy today may not necessarily be wealthy tomorrow. In different stages of someone's life, they may do high-powered work, invest in businesses or enterprise, and/or subsist on UBI respectively. It is good for everyone to have the option available to them.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.6.1.1.2. Con: The U in UBI is the reason for this. It's universal, which means that all people will receive it. This is mitigated with higher taxes on higher wealth individuals.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.6.2. Con: It can be done in an extremely simple one line addition to the tax form.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.7. Con: It is unjust for the government to take a meaningful sum from a class of people who disagree with how it would be used.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.7.1. Con: Quite a few people object to either welfare programs, or military spending, but both of them are still very high, and at least to some degree, necessary.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.7.2. Con: That class of people would not have been able to earn and/or inherit the money in the first place if it wasn't for the society that the government is tasked with protecting and developing. If UBI sufficiently enhances society then the government has the right to charge the people that benefit \(financially\) from the society the most for its continued upkeep and enhancement.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.7.3. Con: This is logically flawed. In a democratic system, the government must fulfil the wishes of the voting majority. It is meaningless to refuse to pay tax because you, personally, did not vote for it. The policy is a national policy, voted by the country.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.8. Pro: Implementing a UBI would allow governments to reduce spending in other areas; thus reducing its cost.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.8.1. Pro: A UBI would also allow the government to consolidate or eliminate negative income tax payments, such as the earned income tax credit in the US, [which currently costs between $60 and $90 billion](https://www.cato.org/publications/tax-budget-bulletin/earned-income-tax-credit-small-benefits-large-costs).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.8.1.1. Con: $60-90 billion is a mere fraction of what a reasonable UBI would cost.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.8.2. Pro: A UBI would alleviate the need for many of the things governments currently spend money on like Unemployment Benefits \(for example the [German "ALG II"](https://con.arbeitsagentur.de/prod/apok/ct/dam/download/documents/SGB2-Merkblatt-en_ba013347.pdf) \)
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.9. Con: The net cost would not be zero as there would be cost associated with managing the system.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.9.1. Con: The cost associated with managing a UBI is \(almost by definition\) far less than the current cost of a selective welfare system, thus creating a net saving \(reduction in current costs\).
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.10. Con: UBI is made of two parts: 1\) collect money, and 2\) redistribute it. The first part is not redistributive by itself and has limits, you cannot confiscate with taxes more money than what it exist in the economy.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.11. Pro: Many economists have suggested revenue neutral workable UBI plans that are affordable. For example, the [FairTax version of UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax) has been studied by economists at the beacon hill institute and in-house economists with various government institutions and concluded that it would be able to cover 30% of the needs at the poverty level with no change to existing welfare programs. If we further assume that some portion of existing welfare programs would be reallocated, that percentage increases.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.12. Pro: For instance, a 26.51% tax levied flat across all income levels in the US and distributed to all working age adults \(206,585,933 people\) would result in a $25,003 UBI for everyone after taxes \(based on a GDP of $19.484 trillion\). Those who earn little or nothing, such as college students, would make $25k. Someone who is currently at the poverty line \($19k\) would be topped up to almost $39k. Someone earning $58k would be topped up to more then $67k. 0% tax impact would be at $94k per worker.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.12.1. Pro: Couple this with abolishing minimum wage requirements and US labor could become more profitable for businesses.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.12.1.1. Con: Cheap labor being subsidized by a UBI could discourage companies from innovating more efficient ways of doing things, slowing growth.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1.13. Pro: Governments could increase taxes on the rich to afford implementing a UBI.
1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: The price of a resource is set partly by consumers' ability and willingness to pay \(and partly by scarcity\). If you gave everyone on earth $1 trillion each tomorrow, the price of a loaf bread would rise to $millions, neutralising the effect. In states that offer unconditional housing benefit, landlords are able to demand at least the state benefit rate, causing average rent to climb. The net effect is a transfer of wealth from the state to landlords.
1.2.1.3.2.3.1. Con: That would only be the case if every economic actor in this scenario started out with the same resources, so they would not be effectively richer. Now, when some have billions to begin with, and many have nothing \(or even less than nothing, debt\), it would bring new economic actors into play.
1.2.1.3.2.4. Con: That is not a great assumption. There will be people who earn a small amount at something they strongly enjoy but have a side job to make ends meet. There will be mothers who would take time off they would not have taken to have children.
1.2.1.3.2.4.1. Con: No reason is given why the majority of people would leave.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: UBI payments enable many more citizens to acquire real estate, as they have a higher income and easier access to credit. This process leads naturally to increasing prices for property, until the new standard price is reached and the purchasing power of their UBI payments are nullified.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: The combination of purchasing power and freedom from work would enable people to live where they want, not where they must, normalizing the topography of house prices over land area.
1.2.1.3.3.2. Con: Any time wages rise, there is inflation, but it is less than the increase in wages, giving a net positive gain. A UBI works like an increased wage in the economy, even if it is unearned.
1.2.1.3.3.2.1. Con: The introduction of a UBI is of different quality than a mere increase of wages: A UBI affects the whole population \(citizens and/or residents\); A UBI provides a significantly higher amount of money compared to an average increase of wages; A UBI is permanent and therefore allows future planning irrespective of the labour market's situation.
1.2.1.3.3.3. Con: That argument presupposes that offer would be inelastic, but it would actually respond to the increase in market demand, and production would be more substantial, for more people would be economic actors and able to buy, therefore offsetting inflation.
1.2.1.3.3.4. Con: This wouldn't increase inflation, It would just increase house prices - and only in areas where supply is not meeting demand \(eg major western cities, the UK etc\)
1.2.1.3.4. Pro: A UBI will increase income, which in turn increases demand \(for better housing, better products, better foods, etc.\) which in turn leads to higher prices. Thus, the benefits of a UBI will normalize out within a few years — back to where we started, where a segment of the population falls at the bottom of the affordability scale.
1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: There is, by now, considerable evidence that consumption appears to respond to anticipated income increases \([Jappelli, Pistaferri, p.502](http://web.stanford.edu/~pista/ann_rev.pdf)\).
1.2.1.3.4.1.1. Con: To say people would consume more based on their income is, beyond plain obvious, not the same as saying such an event would cause inflation.
1.2.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: [Increased spending results in inflation.​](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/inflation/causes-inflation/)
1.2.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not a universal law, it is only the case in scenarios when the offer is bounded and inelastic; either because it is impractical to produce a good or because it is already being produced at maximum capacity where because  every land and resource is being directed at more important productions the opportunity cost would be too high. This is certainly not the case with a UBI because the offer could respond to the increase in the consumer market with new economic actors.
1.2.1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In the short term supply is inelastic. It takes time for the market to react, and the market reacts primarily due to the greater incentives provided by increased prices.
1.2.1.3.4.1.2. Con: This point is only valid in that the transition to UBI could be inflationary. It does not speak to long term inflationary trends once it is implemented.
1.2.1.3.4.2. Pro: To give people a minimum amount of money without taxing others would inflate the money supply, and with such inflation comes increased prices, as more dollars chase the same number of goods and services in a society. And with increased prices, an increased minimum will be required to compensate.
1.2.1.3.4.2.1. Con: A UBI would be paid for through taxes. The money supply would only inflate if the UBI were paid for through printing money, which is not core to UBI policy.
1.2.1.3.4.2.2. Con: But in fact others should be taxed, especially those activities putting pressure on the system that make it harder and harder for people to find jobs \(e.g.  automation and AI-related activities\).
1.2.1.3.4.3. Con: The UBI rate can grow in response to changes in the cost of living. [These problems have been faced, and dealt with with other welfare programs.](https://www.ssa.gov/news/cola/)
1.2.1.3.4.3.1. Con: The impact of UBI will be much larger than existing welfare programs. So the cost of living adjustment will need to be quite large. That will add to the inherent infinite growth tendency of the market system: a UBI increases cost of living which increases in turn the UBI.
1.2.1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: This may indeed be a factor, but these same forces have the possibility of waging wages at a similar rate, while this, all together may well create an environment where saving is less favorable, which is different, it's hard to say it will damage the economy, or people's lives all that much. Lacking more data, it's hard to say for certain which of these two theories is more right.
1.2.1.3.4.4. Con: This argument seems to suggest that we should neither increase income, nor demand for better housing/foods/products, as increasing this demand would result in normalization and pricing out. Aside from pinning UBI to inflation as a remedy, \(and the [work demonstrating](https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7) that this does not occur, as both Alaska and Kuwait experienced decreases in inflation after UBI implementation\), the premise that increasing both income and demand for better housing/foods is a bad idea, seems quite misguided.
1.2.1.3.4.5. Con: While increased income may increase spending and increase inflation, it does not have to, per se. If supply rises equally as a result of higher demand, the price of a product 'should' not rise, thus no inflation.
1.2.1.3.4.6. Pro: UBI will not only create more inflation, but it will create a positive feedback loop. UBI will cause inflation, which will raise the cost of goods and services, which will lead to raising the UBI. Rinse. Repeat.
1.2.1.3.4.7. Con: UBI will trigger an increase in purchases which in effect could make products more expensive. However in the long term the increase in purchases in a given product would also increase competition and raise feasibility to iterate and improve the product, lowering the price of the previous model or product substitutes. Overall the same social wealth tiers will exist, however everyone will have access to better, more technologically advanced products, services, medicines at more affordable prices.
1.2.1.3.5. Pro: It does appear that UBI would increase aggregate demand, then indirectly increase inflation as per [demand-pull inflation](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/012005.asp).
1.2.1.3.5.1. Con: This would only be the case in a scenario where offer was inelastic \(either because goods are too expensive to produce, thus unenforceable, or already at peak production, because all the land and resources are already destined to other more important products, making opportunity cost too high\), otherwise it would respond to the expansion in the consumer market by producing more, effectively offsetting inflation
1.2.1.3.6. Con: This would only be the case in a scenario where supply was inelastic \(either because goods are too expensive to produce, or already at peak production, because all the land and resources are already used for other more important products, making opportunity cost too high\), otherwise producers would respond to the expansion in the consumer market by producing more, effectively offsetting inflation
1.2.1.3.6.1. Con: Not all goods are elastic, e.g. land. Therefore, the inflation would only be offset in some sectors of the economy and not others.
1.2.1.3.7. Pro: Segmented inflation realistically might occur since more people will be buying low-income goods/services that previously could not be afforded by so many people, such as basic foodstuffs, low-cost housing, cheap cars, etc.
1.2.1.3.8. Con: The hand that provides the resources for UBI will be the same hand that taxes the economy to generate the revenue. UBI is redistributive in its principle, so what purchasing power you take from one you given to another. Ignoring the intricacies of exactly how consumer goods markets will adjust, the net impact on inflation is likely to be neutral. Furthermore, successful implementation of UBI will require coordination between fiscal and monetary policy authorities.
1.2.1.4. Con: Luxuries may be marginally priced out, but necessities wouldn't be, as UBI is additive, not redistributive.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Wealthier people save more as a percentage of total assets. Any change to that would increase the total cash in economy and therefore inflationary pressures.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: Since a UBI must be funded by increased taxation, it is effectively redistributive.
1.2.1.5. Con: The current economic challenges are [too little inflation, not too much](http://www.investopedia.com/news/us-inflation-hits-fouryear-high/?ad=dirN&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&qsrc=0&o=40186).
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Inflation can be countered through monetary policy. Interest rates are currently too low, as is inflation. Generating inflation would be good for the country, and interest rates could be raised to counter any risk of hyperinflation.
1.2.1.6. Con: Inflation would only occur if the money supply was increased to pay for a UBI.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: Because a UBI is a redistribution plan, the amount of money in existence will, in aggregate, be the same. Therefore, consumption will not increase.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Con: [Redistributing money](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/better-economic-growth-when-wealth-distributed-to-poor-instead-of-rich) to the poor will likely increase goods sales as the poor spend proportionately more of their income on consumables than on savings.
1.2.1.6.1.1.1. Con: This is not because poor people consume more, but because they earn less. If they would earn more, it is likely that they would save more of their income as well.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: The [Quantity Theory of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) states that inflation will only happen if money supply increases. With UBI, aggregate money supply in the economy does not increase, it just redistributes money from one part of the economy \(the rich, specific industries, specific economic activities, etc., depending on how the UBI was funded\) to the public.
1.2.1.6.3. Con: In an era of accelerating technology, we should see negative pressure on inflation, meaning UBI could be funded by central banks printing money, a kind of QE for UBI.
1.2.1.6.4. Con: Besides the quantity of money \(which affects general inflation\) the relocation of money creates localised inflation too.
1.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: In the USA, as more money was made available for university costs \(loans, etc.\) the costs then soared far beyond that of general inflation. A UBI would create localised inflation rendering the income payments useless.
1.2.1.6.4.2. Pro: An equal influx of money to all the population would create severe localised infaltion in consumer goods such as food, transport, housing, etc. as the purchasing power of everyone is shifted upwards.
1.2.1.6.4.3. Con: An UBI would indeed cause some localised inflation, but it's impossible to make sweeping statements on whether they would offset the costs.
1.2.1.6.4.4. Con: There's a critical difference between a UBI and the money made available for higher education: the latter is specifically purposed \(which logically increases the risk of inflation\) and the former is not. It allows people to spend the money on a large variety of things, greatly lowering the risk/amount of inflation.
1.2.1.6.5. Con: Inflation for individual products will increase faster for products generally bought by UBI recipients. Overall across all products inflation may remain the same.
1.2.1.7. Con: Real cases suggest that a UBI would not lead to greater inflation.
1.2.1.7.1. Pro: In [a study in Mexico giving out cash actually had a lesser effect on the market than giving out necessary goods](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/20/16256240/mexico-cash-transfer-inflation-basic-income) - in this case, food.
1.2.1.7.2. Pro: Both [Alaska and Kuwait](https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7) experienced decreases in inflation after versions of UBI were implemented.
1.2.1.8. Con: Inflation is not inherently harmful as long as real wages and purchasing power remain constant.
1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.3.
1.2.3. Con: UBIs would increase the productivity of individuals.
1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.1.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Many people work jobs they are not great at because they need those jobs to get through the month. At the same time, many willing and productive people are sitting at home, searching for a job. If UBI were implemented, the first type of person could leave a job they are not happy with knowing they will be financially secure, while the latter type of person could take their post. This would boost productivity.
1.2.3.3. Con: UBIs tend to incentivize more value-driven activities \(like sports or the arts\), creating inefficiencies in how people spend their time and money.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: We have the ability to do controlled experiments of both size and scale to see how a UBI would affect different communities.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: [Finland](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/finland-universal-basic-income-experiment-lesson-tips-ubi-poverty-unemployment-a7871441.html), among other countries, is experimenting with a UBI under controlled conditions to rigorously determine its effects.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: There is more to life than "productivity" and "value". If there is no time to use and enjoy the utility we create, it is valueless.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Factors other than mere productivity and GDP including [well-being](https://www.activesustainability.com/sustainable-development/alternatives-to-gdp-for-measuring-well-being/) are considerations, in particular in the western world.
1.2.3.4. Pro: [Evidence](http://behavioralscientist.org/wisdom-universal-basic-income/) suggests that a UBI would be beneficial from a psychological well-being and productivity perspective.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Current welfare systems induce a psychology of fear of ['earning too much'](http://reason.com/reasontv/2016/03/03/the-human-cost-of-welfare-how-the-system), which can hinder the potential for self-reliance and economic growth. A UBI would remove this fear, as it is not dependent on one's earnings.
1.2.4. Con: Poverty is very [expensive](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21663262-why-low-income-americans-often-have-pay-more-its-expensive-be-poor) for a country. Therefore, not having a UBI is more expensive than a UBI.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The increase in economic contribution from those lifted out of poverty by UBI could be greater in many cases than the cost of providing those individuals a UBI.
1.2.5. Pro: The financial burden that countries would have to bear in order to implement a UBI that guaranteed that people at least reach the poverty line would have serious economic consequences.
1.2.5.1. Con: If a country's economy can create millionaires and even billionaires, it can afford to give everybody [enough to eat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/07/the-world-produces-enough-food-to-feed-everyone-so-why-do-people-go-hungry). A society should be organized so that everyone's basic needs are fulfilled before allowing excessive wealth for a few people.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Ensuring the life and health of our fellow man is one of our first moral obligations as humans.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: The moral obligations of humans are not the moral obligations of governments.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Democratic governments are not only responsible for the people under their care, but also ideologically should be representative of them. Therefore, they should attempt to carry out their collective moral obligations, without descending into tyranny.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Governments are made up of humans. Those men who are part of governments choose what rights should be defended by the law, so governments have many more moral obligations than normal citizens.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: We are morally obligated to ensure *opportunity,* not outcome—especially if people simply choose not to work. Traditional welfare can target those who are temporarily unfortunate \(e.g. family breadwinner dies\) or long-term disadvantaged \(e.g. disabled\), but a UBI provides a basic income to all people, regardless of their actual need.
1.2.5.1.1.3. Con: Although we are morally obligated to help others, this does not mean we should be legally compelled to do so, especially considering \(for example\) that what the government considers "need" and what is actually "need" may be 2 different things. Similarly, if the government already taxes its citizens without fixing the problems, it should be hesitant for blaming/shaming the rich for not providing even more.
Ultimately, the parent is missing a crucial link between moral principle and legal policy.
1.2.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Many people do not carry out moral obligations they do not immediately see/feel or are not aware of; legal mechanisms ensure moral obligations are fulfilled.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: An economy can have the potential to create a large amount of wealth, but still be unable to fairly allocate/distribute or produce enough of a certain resource, such as food.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Many of the countries in question produce enough food to comfortably feed more there population without any type of intervention.
1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: Whilst this is theoretically possible, the issue with millionaires in an economy where people are starving is that they represent a concentration of clout at the expense of others. When one person has a greater income in a day than another does in a year, it is not that the first is working harder: it is that they are profiting from the others work at their expense.
1.2.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: Investing does not directly produce any labour or products.
1.2.5.1.2.2.2. Con: Remuneration can be for work but for the most part in modern societies with free markets people are remunerated for their contribution to society. Those with the greatest contributions tend to be those who have produced innovation or improved efficiency. Thus much wealth transfer is a result of society "voting" for the contributions they value most by purchasing them in markets.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: Governments are capable of providing welfare, but the costs of providing "universal" basic income at a level which "meets the poverty line" are \(likely\) far greater than traditional, basic welfare for the needy.
1.2.5.1.4. Pro: In wealthier countries, very few people actually face even temporary starvation in any given year.
1.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: In the U.S., for example,[less than 1% of the population](https://mises.org/library/america-struggling-hunger) faces hunger in a given year and [less than 4,000 people](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/malnutrition/by-country/) die from starvation or malnutrition. Estimates of how much a UBI would cost [vary](http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/much-ubi-cost/) from 595 billion to over 4 trillion. Giving 1% of the population $150 a month for food to cover both starvation and food insecurity would only cost $5.9 billion.
1.2.5.1.4.1.1. Con: The costs to maintain people above the poverty line are far more than just "providing enough money to prevent starvation", as most industrialized countries are already monetarily capable of doing that.
1.2.5.1.4.1.2. Con: If only 1% of the population receives the money, then it is no longer a "Universal" Basic Income. Therefore, such a proposal cannot be used as an example cost for UBI.
1.2.5.2. Con: A UBI would enable other forms of revenue collection that could help offset its cost. Hence, it would be partially self-funded, so it can be affordable.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: A UBI offsets its cost by creating wealth and increasing the amount of economic activity that states can tax.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The degree to which it might "create wealth" to offset its costs is likely to be low. Overall, this does not suggest that UBIs would actually be affordable.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: The size of an economy is determined by two main factors: first, the total amount of money available. But, more importantly: the speed of monetary circulation between actors \(a factor which is commonly overlooked\). Again in a very simplified model, everyone can get rich on just $1 along as it is transferred very rapidly in exchange for goods. In fact, just handing money to people to buy things may be the best stimulus for the economy imaginable \(but cause inflation, over stimulus\).
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.2.1.11.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Since this would have to be funded by taxes, as more recipients began to rely on it as a source of income there would be increasingly less funds to pay for it setting up an inevitable unfunded deficit.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Experiments and proto trials suggest that governments could afford to implement a UBI.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: Alaska has had a UBI-type programme [for many years](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/alaska-model-citizens-income-in-practice/), and yet can still afford it and [grow its GDP](https://www.bea.gov/news/2018/gross-domestic-product-state-2nd-quarter-2018).
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Most countries are already in debt; a situation that the additional spending required for a UBI will only worsen.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: According to International Monetary Fund data released in 2017, the general level of government debt globally is projected to fall, on average, in the years up to 2022. [\(Source: IMF projections\)](http://bit.ly/2hMuYLM)
1.2.5.3.2.2. Con: A straight UBI cuts the costs associated with running a complicated welfare system, allowing more budget allocation to go directly to the people receiving welfare instead of it being sunk into administration.
1.2.5.3.2.2.1. Con: It is unrealistic to suggest that a decrease in administration cost for welfare systems will make a substantial impact on the total cost of the system.
1.2.5.3.2.3. Con: 1. Government debt itself is not inherently bad assuming that the debt is issued in currency it controls and that the increased money supply does not create excessive inflation. 2. Debt may, in fact, have a multiplier effect on the economy by creating a chain reaction of economic activity. In general, when money supply increases at the bottom or through direct spending \(like infrastructure\) the multiplier is greater because the money is spent faster than by tax cuts to the top.
1.2.5.3.3. Pro: A UBI could not be successfully funded as employed taxpayers make up the base, therefore publicly funded programs will become ripe for private take over.
1.2.5.3.4. Con: This is not the case if the increasing gains from automation were also taxed.
1.2.5.3.4.1. Con: Taxing automation would discourage automation, which UBI fundamentally relies on.
1.2.5.3.4.1.1. Con: UBI is in no way built on or relying on automation. It was proposed way before industrialization even: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income#History)
1.2.5.3.5. Pro: If everyone got a paycheck whether they worked or not, there would be little incentive to pay the taxes required to disburse a UBI.
1.2.5.3.6. Pro: UBI requires funds to enact, and those funds must be generated before they're dispersed. If everyone is on a UBI, then no one is required to generate those funds, and it becomes a 'chicken or the egg' paradox. If only some are on a UBI, then non-UBI people will be forced to hand over a chunk of their generated income to fund UBI. There is no free meal ticket.
1.2.5.4. Con: A UBI need not be set at the poverty line to be an improvement over the status quo.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: Even if the UBI did not meet the poverty line—such as if it only met half of the poverty line—it would likely still be extraordinarily expensive while not even solving the issues at hand.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Con: Many countries are currently paying welfare to the unemployed and poor. In a first step, a UBI can be designed to cost the same amount of money as the existing social system. Wealthier people pay a share equivalent to their UBI \(=\> no change in total\), and unemployed people get as much welfare as before. This would bring many of the advantages of UBI \(psychology, less bureaucracy, only motivated people in retraining courses instead of forced attendance\) at no cost.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: Many Americans work two or three jobs. Simply being able to quit one of these jobs would mean the world to millions of single working parents across this country.
1.2.5.4.2.1. Pro: Approximately [13 million](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/06/about-thirteen-million-united-states-workers-have-more-than-one-job.html) Americans work more than one job, with a small percentage working two or more.
1.2.5.4.3. Pro: Even though an affordable UBI may not be sufficient to prevent poverty by Western standards, it should still provide enough to avoid extreme stress and inequality. With additional income or provision possible under a UBI low-paid employment will become both feasible and attractive as a form of self-provision.
1.2.5.5. Con: While there may not be any country that can afford a UBI today, it does not mean a particularly wealthy country could never afford one in future.
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Increasing reliance on automation and artificial intelligence will provide levels of surplus that make a UBI more readily affordable.
1.2.5.5.1.1. Pro: Increases in technology will eventually result in an excess of productivity. Government issued UBI is necessary to distribute the returns on this productivity equitably.
1.2.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: When [productivity reaches incredibly high rates](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/519016/stop-saying-robots-are-destroying-jobs-they-arent/), there will be no need to have as many people working. Instead, we could afford to distribute a UBI to the increasingly large number of people who would no longer work.
1.2.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The excess productivity could be incentive to layoff the amount of workers it would displace and maintain all other operations as normal. This would create even more profit for corporations due to no longer needing to pay wages and supplemental benefits.
1.2.5.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Corporations look after themselves before their employees. If it is beneficial to them to be rid of employees, there will definitely be cuts.
1.2.5.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Those profits would be taxed at a high rate and distributed as UBI. By distributing buying power to laid-off workers, UBI allows the capitalist market system to survive under conditions where many people are not working most of the time.
1.2.5.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Productivity growth[has been stagnant or in decline](https://www.oecd.org/std/productivity-stats/) in most OECD nations. The [data shows no relationship between productivity growth and net unemployment](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/519016/stop-saying-robots-are-destroying-jobs-they-arent/).
1.2.5.5.1.1.2. Con: The returns on this productivity could equally be distributed by lowering tax rates for low/middle income earners or increasing public funding for existing welfare, education, or healthcare systems.
1.2.5.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The chain of command of a public administration has fixed costs, plus the variable one related to corruption. The use of unneeded intermediaries decreases efficiency and raises costs.
1.2.5.5.1.1.3. Pro: A UBI is necessary and plausible if AI is to take a majority of jobs on the market. It is necessary as a majority of people who do work now will no longer be able to find jobs. It is plausible as AI will reduce the cost of many products and services available to us, thus we will be able to enjoy more with less, in which case the total living cost will be reduced, thus the amount of UBI necessary will be reduced \(discounting inflation etc\).
1.2.5.5.1.1.4. Pro: UBI allows us to continue with technological advances without the worry of losing jobs. In fact, because of technology and the ability it has to reduce the work needed by humans, UBI is necessary. Imagine a farmer in the 19th century and the amount of work needed to sustain a farm compared to today. The same amount of time, effort, and work could now feed hundreds if not thousands and all families should reap the rewards of this advancement!
1.2.5.5.1.1.5. Pro: UBI is a necessity for the economy in the future. Due to increases in automation, there will be a shortage of suppy for the workforce. In contrast to this, the people at the top of the business will earn huge amounts of money; creating an income gap like we’ve never seen before. It might not be time for UBI right now, but it’s definitely a solution to future problems.
1.2.5.5.1.1.6. Pro: Global wealth is not a fixed quantity: as technology improves, the world economy sees an aggregate benefit without requiring anyone else's wealth to decrease commensurately. UBI is an appropriate response to the aggregate increase of global wealth because of technology.
1.2.5.5.1.2. Pro: A society in a position to implement a UBI presupposes automation and AI. With mechanized efficiency and without the cost of human labor it is necessary to reevaluate the costs of living in a post-scarcity society when determining the economic viability of a UBI.
1.2.5.5.1.3. Con: This is just another way to describe heavier taxation of industry, which eventually damages an economy's competitiveness and tax revenues.
1.2.5.5.2. Pro: The affordability problem can be avoided by implementing a UBI only when an economy is mature enough that it is beneficial. A society requiring only ~70% of its citizens to contribute to the labor force is by definition producing enough excess that it can fund some minimal standard of living for the remaining 30%. Finding the relevant line is important, but this is a problem regarding execution, not the concept itself.
1.2.5.5.2.1. Con: This argument begs the question \(or is tautological\), at least as written; it is basically saying "UBIs could be beneficial when/where the implementation would be beneficial." It does not support the claim that any \(realistic\) economy will benefit from a UBI \(as opposed to other, means-tested welfare\).
1.2.5.5.2.2. Con: If the debate is made just about the ideal concept and ignores flawed execution, this makes [many "poor execution" arguments](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1387&context=public_law_and_legal_theory) against means-tested welfare irrelevant. In other words, you can't just compare the ideal UBI to a realistic \(imperfect\) means-tested welfare system; you have to compare ideal to ideal or realistic to realistic.
1.2.5.5.3. Con: The question seems to imply whether a UBI should be implemented today as part of the discussion around how to socially adjust to AI. To say 'we are not there yet' still argues that this shouldn't be allowed as we are incapable of implementing the idea. If it is impossible to implement, then we shouldn't consider it.
1.2.5.5.4. Con: UBI depends on an unsustainable level of global market wealth. If every economy achieved the kind of market success - that would be required to pay its citizens a UBI - we would need far more global growth. The Limits to Growth analysis \(see - [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/U7Z6h-U4CmI)\) clearly tells us this would require several more planets.
1.2.5.5.5. Con: It is also possible that if/when governments can eventually afford UBIs they will also have better or more means-tested welfare, making UBIs still inferior. In other words, in the future it might be better to just stick with means-tested welfare which has been increased/improved.
1.2.5.5.6. Con: Such a hypothetical future where the economy has massive surplus potentially may not even be struggling with extreme poverty. Unless the claim/we identify what this hypothetical/theoretical future society looks like, it is difficult to evaluate how practical/beneficial a UBI would be in the society.
1.2.5.6. Con: A UBI prevents a major rise in poverty in times of financial crisis, so the government can save money to where a UBI is affordable.
1.2.5.6.1. Pro: Universal income will protect people from the next inevitable banking crash, so governments do not spend money they cannot afford to help citizens out financially.
1.2.5.7. Con: Government legislative actions can restrict markets that impact the cost of living to keep prices regulated, which would decrease the amount of UBI needed to curb poverty.
1.2.5.8. Pro: A state that is losing its financial leeway cannot effectively pursue economic policies.
1.2.5.8.1. Pro: Providing citizens with a UBI may result in losing [20-30% of a nation's GDP](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/06/universal-basic-income-public-realm-poverty-inequality).
1.2.5.8.2. Pro: Without sufficient funds, governments cannot help the economy in times of economic recession by launching stimulus plans.
1.2.5.8.3. Pro: Major investments in education or infrastructure can no longer be sustainably financed.
1.2.5.9. Pro: If government spending is significantly higher than revenue, the bonds issued by these governments may be downgraded by [rating agencies](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/business/global/16rating.html), making it harder and more expensive for them to raise funds on the capital markets.
1.2.5.9.1. Pro: [Higher interest rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/business/global/16rating.html) on debt add to the country’s overall debt burden and can force the government to reduce spending, increase taxes or both.
1.2.5.10. Con: Simulations and statistical analysis show that many governments could actually afford to fully implement a UBI.
1.2.5.10.1. Pro: Microsimulation from Barcelona University study shows that [only 3.4% of Spanish GDP](http://www.redrentabasica.org/rb/la-renta-basica-incondicional-y-como-se-puede-financiar-comentarios-a-los-amigos-y-enemigos-de-la-propuesta/) is needed to finance a sufficient UBI. This is without removing any funding for the army, health or education.
1.2.5.10.1.1. Con: Microsimulations cannot credibly simulate the effects of a nationwide UBI. Criticisms of UBI tend to center around its macroeconomic effects, which microsimulations do not address.
1.2.5.10.1.1.1. Con: Macroeconomic study shows that UBI would grow the economy. [rooseveltinstitute.org](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/)
1.2.5.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The study assumes that inflation will not significantly be affected by this change in the economy, even though it just seems that more people are spending, rather than the money being used more efficiently.
1.2.5.10.1.1.1.2. Con: The study does not seem to account for decreased-incentive effects. That is to say, the study proposes a policy of higher taxes on the rich, but does not account for whether this might discourage the rich from working as much, offering as many investments/loans, and/or expanding their business.
1.2.5.10.1.1.1.3. Con: The study seems to improperly estimate investment and loan effects. That is to say: the study claims overall economic activity would increase because the proposal would be funded largely by taxes on the higher-income population, which the study states tend to save a higher proportion of their money. However, a decrease in savings decreases the ability to invest/acquire loans \(contrary to its assumption that "Generally, investment is determined by the level of economic activity"\).
1.2.5.10.1.2. Con: Given Spain's GDP of [$1.2 Trillion \(USD\)](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/gdp) and a population of 46.4 million, 3.4% of GDP equates to a UBI of only $879 per person.
1.2.5.10.1.2.1. Pro: Even assuming that $879/year in Spain equates to roughly $1160/year in the USA—since the cost of living in Spain is roughly 32% lower \(as suggested by [this site](http://www.mylifeelsewhere.com/cost-of-living/united-states/spain)\)—this is clearly an insufficient sum for a UBI.
1.2.5.10.1.2.2. Con: Not every single person in Spain would receive a UBI; such as non-citizens or children.
1.2.5.10.1.3. Con: Expressing costs in terms of GDP is misleading, because GDP generally does not link well with government taxation/spending. For example, in the US, federal and total government revenue in 2016 [was estimated to be $3.27 and $6.13 trillion](https://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/federal_revenue) \(respectively\). US GDP in 2016, on the other hand, was multiple times that: [nearly $18.6 trillion](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2017/pdf/gdp4q16_adv.pdf). Ultimately, many government programs can be made to look small when expressed in percentages of GDP, but that is misleading when talking about government spending.
1.2.5.10.1.4. Con: This 3.4% will have to be ploughed out of some other thing it has been already allocated for, and possibly allocated year on year. That departments and services that would be would suffer as a result.
1.2.5.10.1.4.1. Con: Most UBI implementations will make other benefits obsoleete. Like unemployment benefits, or multiple child monetary support.
1.2.5.10.2. Con: In the U.S. providing a UBI of $10,000 \(just below the poverty level\) to 300 million Americans would cost over $3 trillion dollars, easily [eclipsing current levels of tax revenue](http://www.cbpp.org/poverty-and-opportunity/commentary-universal-basic-income-may-sound-attractive-but-if-it-occurred).
1.2.5.10.2.1. Con: The average personal income tax rate in the USA is [above 35%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/personal-income-tax-rate); assumed the UBI will be added to the taxable amount, a significant part would come back in taxes.
1.2.5.10.2.2. Con: This would also contain nearly all the welfare hand-outs so that some is not all new cost.
1.2.5.10.2.3. Con: This [ignores the fact](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-we-should-all-have-a-basic-income/) that a UBI would also be implemented as a net transfer system: "In the same way it does not cost $20 to give someone $20 in exchange for $10, it does not cost $3 trillion to give every adult citizen $12,000 and every child $4,000, when every household will be paying varying amounts of taxes in exchange for their UBI. Instead it will cost around 30% of that, or about $900 billion."
1.2.5.10.2.3.1. Pro: $900 billion would be relatively easily accommodated through tiny tax rates increases \(5% for an extra $300b\) while also eliminating 25% of defence spending \($215b\), wage subsidies \($72b\), the home mortgage interest deduction \($70b\), and social security \($220b\).
1.2.5.10.2.3.1.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that there would be a 25% cut to military spending anytime soon.
1.2.5.10.2.3.1.1.1. Con: There are already people who are significantly dissatisfied with the amount of military spending, and advocate for a reduction in it.
1.2.5.10.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It does not matter what a few people think; people have always wanted to cut the military spending. In the end, a 25% reduction seems highly unrealistic.
1.2.5.10.2.3.1.2. Con: 2017 tax revenues are $3.3 trillion, $300 billion is 9% of that, tax rate would have to be increased by 9%, which is nearly double the "tiny" 5% suggested, the math is off. Also, I'm not sure where these numbers came from defense spending is $590B, and Social Security is $939B, 25% of each is $148B and $235B respectively, $383B total, compared to the $435B for those two that's specified, this is off by more than $50B!

1.2.5.10.2.3.2. Con: "Net transfer" systems lose efficiency when the people who create value \(and subsequently earn money\) are taxed to cover for those who do not or cannot. Otherwise, deep/extreme socialism could solve all of our inequity and inefficiency problems. Traditional, means-tested welfare systems, while imperfect, can strike the proper balance of redistribution.
1.2.5.10.2.3.3. Con: This ignores the fact that taxes would still have to be raised \(or other programs cut\) in order to afford this program. Many people might end up getting more money than they have to pay in new taxes, but overall taxation would have to increase by at least however much money is provided through the UBI.
1.2.5.10.2.3.3.1. Con: It doesn't matter if the taxes are higher, when you are given the money to pay those higher taxes up-front.
1.2.5.10.2.3.4. Con: The US population is estimated at 252 million adults, and 74 million persons under age 18. At the levels you suggest that would require tax revenues of $3.3 trillion, even if you then redistribute that. Current US revenues are about $3.3 trillion, so you're talking about doubling the current US tax rates.[Federal Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/media/File:CBO_Infographic_2017.png) [Population Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217)
1.2.5.10.2.3.5. Con: While it doesn't cost $20 to give someone $20 in exchange for $10, you still have to have the $20 to start with. You'd still have to collect the full $3.3 trillion. If you're arguing for negative income tax, I suggest you tack on to one of the already existing claims for that.
1.2.5.10.2.3.6. Pro: If we assume UBI level is $12000, and it's a negative income tax, and if you make more than $12000, you get nothing. Then the whole program would require extra revenues in the US of about $600B. [Income Data](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/pinc-01/2018/pinc01_1_1_1.xls)
1.2.5.10.2.3.6.1. Con: $12000, is well below the US poverty line of $22500. At that level it would cost $1.6 trillion, and this argument is under the claim, "UBI's that meet the proverty line are too expensive for governments to afford". At some point, yes you can lower the number enough that some\(not all\) people won't argue with you about the funding anymore, at that point would you even be making things enough better to worry about providing the benefit.
1.2.5.10.2.4. Con: Many UBI programs do not pay out to children. There are only about 250 million adults in the USA. Some programs only pay out to adults over 21 years of age, thereby reducing the number of benefactors to 230 million.
1.2.5.10.2.4.1. Con: In the end, this is only a small difference from the grandparent. If the UBI were $10,000 annually and there were roughly 200 million benefactors, expenses would be roughly $2 trillion—half of [current federal spending overall.](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-spending-3305763)
1.2.5.10.2.5. Con: [Here is an example](https://works.bepress.com/widerquist/75/) where it would cost $539 billion. It was made by a leading figure of the Basic Income Earth Network, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
1.2.5.10.2.5.1. Con: The cited [source](http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/much-ubi-cost/) is unreliable—even dubious.
1.2.5.10.2.5.1.1. Pro: The source makes an extremely dubious/misleading comparison between UBI and current entitlement spending. Specifically, the source says that the gross cost of a UBI program is "often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful," but in the very next part of the sentence, it compares the *net cost* of a UBI to the *gross cost* of current entitlement programs. If the source says that gross costs of a UBI aren't important, it shouldn't compare UBI's net costs to gross costs of entitlement programs.
1.2.5.10.2.5.1.2. Pro: The source itself describes its estimates as "back-of-the-envelope calculations," rather than even halfway rigorous economic models.
1.2.5.10.2.6. Con: This implies that the current taxation structure is the ideal structure. UBI allows the tax free threshold to be lowered, increasing revenue from the bottom, and a change to the tax structure for the top end of town more in line with the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) could very well allow it to be sustainable.
1.2.5.10.2.6.1. Con: If the tax free threshold is lowered \(i.e. if poorer people could be taxed\) this would undermine the value of the UBI.
1.2.5.10.2.6.2. Con: If the tax free threshold were lowered, this might discourage poorer people from increasing their income \(e.g. by working\) in the same way that traditional welfare does \(to an extent\).
1.2.5.10.2.6.3. Con: This merely assumes that increasing taxes on a poorer segment of society will noticeably offset the spending increases. On the contrary, it seems unlikely that this will have significant positive effects on revenue.
1.2.5.10.2.7. Con: With a UBI, the pressure on other social welfare programs is drastically decreased. In the US, the costs of social security, unemployment benefits, medicare and health rebates, and food entitlements [are approximately $2.2 trillion dollars](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/). Cutting these programs would become feasible under a UBI, where it would replace most entitlement systems.
1.2.5.10.2.7.1. Pro: Even moderate reductions would provide feasibly close to one trillion dollars of freed government revenue.
1.2.5.10.2.7.1.1. Con: This would not be "new" government revenue; the "reductions" in traditional welfare program would be eclipsed by increases in spending on UBI.
1.2.5.10.2.7.2. Con: Without medicare, many low-income families would burn through their UBI very quickly, unless there's a medical system such as Canada has in place.
1.2.5.10.2.7.3. Con: If a $10,000/year UBI were enacted in the US, the total costs would be roughly around $2.5-3.5 trillion dollars \(depending on who receives benefits\). Thus, even if the traditional welfare programs were somehow fully cut, this would still represent an increase in overall spending by hundreds of billions of dollars.
1.2.5.10.2.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.10.2.3.
1.2.5.10.2.7.4. Pro: In fact one of the very goals of a UBI is to obviate the need for any other social welfare programs. The saving it hopes to exploit is not just the money given to the needy in such a program but the entire overhead of delivering them \(including staff, real estate, and infrastructure\). All these savings go toward making a livable UBI feasible and attractive as an alternative to not addition to all other existing welfare programs. [Guaranteed Income as a Replacement for the Welfare State](http://www.fljs.org/files/publications/Murray.pdf)
1.2.5.10.2.8. Con: Providing a UBI, particularly when targeted at the consumer sector of the economy \(which traditionally has a very high multiplier effect on fiscal injections\) can also drastically improve economic performance to pay for increases in government spending.
1.2.5.10.2.8.1. Con: A UBI is not targeted toward the consumer sector of the economy; it is given to everyone equally.
1.2.5.10.2.8.1.1. Con: The vast majority of citizens are from the "consumer sector," so the program still has the highest impact on this sector.
1.2.5.10.2.8.2. Pro: Households in the US have very low rates of savings, and thus very high rates of spending. Even assuming a moderately high propensity to save, of 0.25 \(25% of every dollar of income saved\), the multiplier effect of additional money to households would sit around 3-4. The US currently collects around one quarter of GDP in the form of tax revenue, meaning that the UBI would come close to paying for itself in the form of tax revenue increases.
1.2.5.10.2.8.2.1. Con: Treating the UBI as a stimulus assumes that the poor are not already spending at similar rates through the status quo means-tested system, and any gains in pretax income given to the status quo middle class must surely be offset by any increases in the marginal tax rate that would result in this.
1.2.5.10.2.8.2.2. Con: Any discussion of consumption multipliers must factor for how savings are [multiplied](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multipliereffect.asp) by the fractional reserve system of banking. Decreasing savings to increase consumption very reasonably may have no net-multiplier effect \(possibly even a negative multiplier effect\), and/or also may reasonably decrease the efficiency of combined consumption + investment.
1.2.5.10.2.8.3. Pro: Even when not directly claimed by tax revenue, increases to national wealth that come from increased economic activity justify economic policies to increase government wealth, such as international borrowing or printing new money. When these policies are implemented as the result of increased economic performance, negative side effects such as inflationary pressures and loss of credit worthiness can be avoided.
1.2.5.10.2.8.3.1. Con: This assumes that a UBI increases spending among low socio-economic status people over the current means-tested welfare system, which already provides substantial capital to this group to spend on necessities like food and shelter.
1.2.5.10.2.9. Con: The United States has already gone through many years of tax reductions, as well as reductions in government spending. Congruently with this the income disparity has skyrocketed, and many already live below the poverty line. Therefore the United States may be a bad example to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a UBI.
1.2.5.10.3. Con: In Sweden \(one of the largest welfare states\) if each citizen were given a basic liveable income of 12,000€/year, the annual cost of this policy alone would be as much as the [government spends in total](http://www.government.se/articles/2016/09/the-2017-budget-in-five-minutes/). This seems unaffordable.
1.2.5.10.3.1. Con: The government could just come up with a different tax structure.
1.2.5.10.3.1.1. Con: Tax cannot be higher than GDP \(that would mean 100% tax\). Taxation in many develop countries is close to \(or even above\) 50% of GDP. So taxes could never be more than doubled. [List of tax revenue to GDP ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_to_GDP_ratio).
1.2.5.10.3.1.2. Pro: UBI doesn't have to be a new institution. It can be built into tax graduation or a "negative tax" for those who make less then UBI.
1.2.5.10.3.2. Con: It is in the largest welfare states that a UBI would be the most affordable because it would replace the already-expensive set of social services.
1.2.5.10.3.3. Pro: In Stockholm that income doesn't even cover the cost of a one bed flat. A typical small radhaus \(terrace\) costs over 20,000 euros a year in rent.
1.2.5.10.3.3.1. Con: While Stockholm is the most expensive place to live in Sweden, someone living on welfare in the existing system \(income ~€12000\) can't affort that anyway, so the point is moot.
1.2.5.10.3.4. Pro: In the best case scenario, the government would have to scrap many major welfare schemes in order to afford the cost of a UBI.
1.2.5.10.3.4.1. Con: That's the point. The idea is to replace means-tested benefits with a universal income that a person can always rely on having.
1.2.5.10.3.5. Con: The total cost of UBI is not equal to the amount of money paid to individuals - rather, it is the differential increase or decrease in the wealth of the nation: [scottsantens.com](http://www.scottsantens.com/the-cost-of-universal-basic-income-is-the-net-transfer-amount-not-the-gross-price-tag).
1.2.5.10.3.5.1. Con: Regardless of how you account for the overall net cost, it is valid to point out that multi-trillion dollar government program would require the government to spend that many trillions of dollars. Therefore, the money has to come from somewhere, and not only is it necessary to account for the costs, this demand for money can cause problems such as if the government has to raise taxes or change tax structures in order to pay for it.
1.2.5.10.3.6. Con: It could be set as a percentage of GDP and that people could choose if they want UBI, or not \(for the sake of others\). For instance - people with high income from their work could reject their UBI for government budget, charity, or someone else, or to make UBI higher \(could be done only once per year to lower costs of administration\). This could teach people solidarity.
1.2.5.10.3.6.1. Con: This would be a very ineffective at reducing costs, because of course most people would still opt in \(given that it is basically a free $10,000 payment\).
1.2.6. Con: A UBI would allow governments to foster liberal economic policies without throwing people into economic and social insecurity.
1.2.6.1. Pro: If high enough, a UBI could allow the removal of the minimum wage since it provides sufficient bargaining power to prevent exploitation.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Removing the minimum wage would allow companies to hire lower-skilled, less experienced, or less productive workers at appropriate rates.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: This could bring down the wages of skilled workers as well.
1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Con: With the UBI, skilled workers might still end up making about as much as they were before.
1.2.6.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Companies would still have to give decent wages as an incentive for skilled workers. People may be less willing to work if they're already provided for, they'd work to receive extra comfort such as being able to afford their own home or hobbies.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: Without a minimum wage, companies [should be able to](https://www.ecnmy.org/learn/your-government/regulations/are-minimum-wages-good/) hire more people.
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: Without a minimum wage, prices would generally go down on products made in that country, which could help the economy.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Liberal economic policies are worth pursuing.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: By virtue of increasing economic liberalization across the world, liberal economic policies are useful for countries to develop ties with other countries.
1.2.6.3. Pro: This is of primary importance in the age of AI and robotics.
1.2.7. Pro: A UBI might require higher taxes, which would hurt the economy.
1.2.7.1. Con: Technological advances in wealthy countries have created a [surplus of wealth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) that can be shared directly as income to citizens rather than indirectly through tax spending.
1.2.7.2. Pro: In the short run, tax increases have a [negative impact on demand](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/145810/economics/the-impact-of-taxation/). As households and companies have less available income and capital due to higher taxes, they will spend and invest less.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: Higher taxes will mean many have less disposable income, which means they will spend less in the economy, decreasing aggregate demand.
1.2.7.2.2. Con: A UBI as additional form of income mitigates this negative effect, especially for those with lower incomes.
1.2.7.2.3. Con: However they will have paid a fair tax rate that benefits all citizens. Instead of low taxes lining the pockets of investors and private companies delivering the universal services a government should provide its people.
1.2.7.3. Pro: In the long run [high marginal tax rates](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-economy-long-run) have a negative impact on the supply by discouraging work, saving, investment, and innovation.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: The IMF released a report claiming that higher taxes would [not negatively affect growth](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/imf-higher-taxes-rich-inequality-jeremy-corbyn-labour-donald-trump).
1.2.7.3.1.1. Con: Higher taxes, particularly among the rich, would likely lead to an increase in tax evasion, thereby decreasing the total amount of money the government receives.
1.2.7.3.1.2. Pro: The bulk of tax increases could be levied upon the super-wealthy. In the US in particular this would only marginally shift that top tax rate [back to its historic norm of 50%+](http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf) which did not seem to overly constrain growth between 1917 and 1987.
1.2.7.3.1.2.1. Pro: There already are initiatives founded by [millionaires](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/40-millionaires-ask-new-york-raise-taxes-wealthy-1-percent-plan-fairness) to raise the tax for the rich. This shows their willingness to contribute more to society.
1.2.7.3.1.2.1.1. Con: There several offshore tax schemes - such as those discovered by the [Panama Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers) - that prove wealthy individuals are willing to try to hide their assets to contribute less.
1.2.7.3.1.2.2. Con: As the very richest are able to [shape tax policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/business/economy/for-the-wealthiest-private-tax-system-saves-them-billions.html?_r=0), it is unlikely they would accept extensive tax increases.
1.2.7.3.1.2.2.1. Con: That doesn't mean that it can't happen in a democracy.
1.2.7.3.1.2.3. Pro: A UBI would have a much greater positive impact on the economy that tax cuts, as giving $1 to those with lower incomes has three times the growth effects on GDP as compared to giving the same $1 to high income individuals, due to the economic multiplier effect. [huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/the-economist-just-came-o_b_7447312.html)
1.2.7.3.1.2.4. Pro: There would be enough wealth if it were to be distributed down from [billionaires](http://time.com/money/5112462/billionaires-made-so-much-money-last-year-they-could-end-extreme-poverty-seven-times/). No one needs that much money \([apparently](https://qz.com/1211957/how-much-money-do-people-need-to-be-happy/) money doesnt increase happiness after $105,000 per year\). \(There should be a cut off point; if you make more than 500,000 a year \(and slowly decrease it to 105,000 to reduce shock\), you only keep 200,000, the rest goes to the government, who can make much better use of it.\)
1.2.7.3.1.2.4.1. Con: There would be difficulties implementing this, as many wealthy people would feel robbed of the fruits of "their" hard work, ignoring or overlooking the advantages of their privilege.
1.2.7.3.1.3. Pro: Misinformation by government that lower taxes are beneficial to society and the citizenry is a fallacy perpetrated to ensure votes at the ballot box.
1.2.7.4. Con: A UBI would not have to be paid for by taxes. As with other forms of government spending, a UBI could be paid for by fiat spending \(i.e. 'printing money'\).
1.2.7.4.1. Con: Issuing enough fiat currency to fund a UBI must be balanced against the compounding [effect](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/634/economics/the-problem-with-printing-money/) this would have on the economy and inflation since there is little point in providing a universal income if, as result, goods are priced above the budget it would allow.
1.2.7.4.1.1. Con: The inflationary constraint upon fiat currency is not some arbitrary number, but instead the real productive capacity of the economy in question. Given the profound levels of current waste and untapped potential, we are nowhere close to maxing out our real productive capacity. The best way to avoid critical inflation from fiat spending is thus to spend it on supporting real productive capacity, rather than upon speculation or rent-seeking \(title-income, interest, etc.\).
1.2.7.4.2. Pro: The US dollar is a sovereign fiat currency. Congress creates it by decree with spending and can afford anything for sale in dollars with no structural revenue constraints or the threat of involuntary default on any obligation denominated in dollars. The only constraint on a fiat currency is inflation, not the ability to "fund" anything with taxation. Taxes are not "revenue" for fiat system, as the issuer of currency has no need to "get" currency to spend. Affordability is not on the table.
1.2.7.4.3. Pro: An economy using a fiat currency is not revenue constrained. The issuer of the currency doesn't need to "get" currency from anyone to spend. Taxes only serve to drive a currency's demand and to draw down currency to prevent inflation. Only currencies pinned to a commodity \(gold\) or fixed exchange rate are dependent upon revenue.
1.2.7.4.4. Pro: The US dollar is a sovereign fiat currency that we can never run out of and we can never involuntarily fail to pay any obligation denominated in it. This takes "affordability" off the table.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i35uBVeNp6c&t=169s) [neweconomicperspectives.org](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/03/where-did-the-federal-reserve-get-all-that-money.html)
1.2.7.4.5. Pro: In the future, countries will afford the UBI, as part of a [macro economic process](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/) when unemployment becomes too high and the economy is near collapse and/or major deflation. Modern monetary theory itself can prove this affordability, especially when a country has sovereignty over its' own currency. Please don't forget new currencies and international influence in regards to the UBI that will help other countries afford this, if the need arises. [rooseveltinstitute.org](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/)
1.2.7.5. Pro: A UBI would take money away from the rich, which would greatly decrease job creation and economic growth.
1.2.7.5.1. Con: Rich entrepeneurs may prefer investing in automated process to save on labor costs. This would mean that employment may not necessarily increase if entrepeneurs are given greater freedom.
1.2.7.5.1.1. Pro: [Automation](http://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/12/17/automation-has-created-more-jobs-in-the-past-but-will-it-now/#55efab0627fd) will not create new jobs like other technologies did.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: The loss of jobs due to automation will dramatically reduce social mobility as most individuals' skills will be rendered obsolete — particularly those who perform menial work.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Automation](http://www.businessinsider.de/stephen-hawking-ai-automation-middle-class-jobs-most-dangerous-moment-humanity-2016-12?r=UK&IR=T) will accelerate the already widening economic inequality around the world as very small groups of individuals can make enormous profits while employing very few people.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Blaming technological change for inequality absolves the elites of their responsibility. Technology transforms production, but [power and politics determine](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/universal-basic-income-equality-tech-silicon-valley) how the dividends are distributed.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: A storybook "[rags-to-riches](http://www.businessinsider.com/rags-to-riches-stories-2011-11)" career will become next to impossible to achieve.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: As automation replaces human workers, it's likely something like this will be used to create a new serf class, and a new land owner nobility, essentially repeating the middle ages. In other words, as more people are unemployed, the government will use UBI to prevent uprising and civil unrest against the economic elite. This is very likely, but it is not at all a good thing.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: The exponentially accelerating progress in robotics and AI will inevitably result \(as we're starting to see already\) in the elimination of essentially all jobs and corporate shareholders reaping all the benefits. There are only two possible outcomes:  either we tax the corporate profits resulting from automation to provide a UBI, or there will be blood in the streets.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: An UBI can unleash the creative forces once the need for basic survival imperatives and creature comforts are removed. An infrastructure must be created to capitalize and support on creative, innovative surge in new paradigms. Industrial monopolies would represent a danger to this system.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Having a universal basic income will help give those whose skills are rendered obsolete through automation the time, energy, and financial support to learn new skills or retire.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: This is due to the production of digital technologies that [eliminate the need](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531726/technology-and-inequality/) for many middle-class jobs.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2. Pro: Experts predict a "[jobless future](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety)" as most jobs can be broken down into a series of routine tasks, more and more of which can be done by machines.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: According to [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540), full artificial intelligence could supplant the human race.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2.2. Con: The fact that a computer can do something better than a human being doesn’t mean that the computer will replace the human being. The market will determine whether it is economical to do so, given the costs and perceived benefits.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2.3. Con: When machines replace one kind of human capability,[new human experiences and capabilities emerge.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/06/04/the-robots-are-not-coming/#574dc6131913) These might be mostly higher value and offer more interesting work than the experiences and capabilities that have been replaced by machines.
1.2.7.5.1.1.3. Pro: The idea of automation and [artificial intelligence](http://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/12/17/automation-has-created-more-jobs-in-the-past-but-will-it-now/2/#33a8b61b23ae) is different than other technological inventions before as it merges the existing ideas of machinery, electricity and computing to something entirely new.
1.2.7.5.1.1.4. Pro: General artificial intelligence will be able to learn at a faster rate than humans.
1.2.7.5.1.1.5. Con: Experts suggest that automation and AI will create more jobs than it will replace. [www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/ai-robots-jobs-alphabet-eric-schmidt.html)
1.2.7.5.1.2. Pro: In the current age of information technology, a very small amount of people can gather a huge amount of money without any need to significantly increase the employee base of a company. Any major website company is a perfect example of that.
1.2.7.5.2. Con: The rich can only benefit from a wealthier middle and working class. With more money being spent businesses will have higher profits, in turn giving the rich more money.
1.2.7.5.3. Con: It is estimated that having a UBI for 8 years will grow the USA's GDP by [2.5 trillion dollars.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/1000-per-month-cash-handout-would-grow-the-economy-by-2-point-5-trillion.html)
1.2.7.5.3.1. Con: An increase in the GDP is not in itself a good thing, especially when it just seems to be "more money is spent" \(as the study seems to suggest\); one must link to how quality of life is affected by a change in the economy.
1.2.7.5.3.2. Con: The linked study makes multiple questionable/disputed assumptions.
1.2.7.5.4. Pro: The rich are the biggest [job creators](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2013/12/11/sorry-henry-blodget-but-the-rich-do-create-nearly-every-job/) in the economy.
1.2.7.5.5. Pro: The rich are disproportionately likely to [invest their wealth](https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/economic-effects-ultra-rich-wealth-tax) compared to other classes.
1.2.7.5.6. Con: The rich are not needed to create jobs.
1.2.7.5.6.1. Pro: Job creation is driven by demand of goods and services, not the amount of wealth the rich have. UBI would increase such demand, thereby creating jobs.
1.2.7.5.6.1.1. Con: Only the "rich" have the capital to start such enterprises as to produce these new products and services you are suggesting. Starting business isn't a cheap thing, you need tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars of liquid capital for a bank to even consider giving you a loan to help you get started.
1.2.7.6. Pro: The reduced incentive to work for those who are guaranteed an income will reduce government tax revenue.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: Income taxation is not the only source of government revenue. Money is also made from exports, property taxes, the sale of bonds, and government investments.
1.2.7.6.2. Con: Simultaneously, the revenue from sales taxes is likely to increase as a UBI provides a secure source of income for citizens that can be used to consume goods and services.
1.2.7.6.3. Pro: A UBI would enable people to work less or even leave the workforce permanently.
1.2.7.6.3.1. Pro: It is in the best interest of society to heavily incentivize all people to participate in the workforce.
1.2.7.6.3.1.1. Pro: Increased labor participation is [important for economic development.](http://www.worldwatch.org/increase-labor-force-can-be-engine-development-0)
1.2.7.6.3.1.1.1. Con: In times of increasing automation, 3D printing, and intelligent software; labor participation has become less important.
1.2.7.6.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: As our society becomes more and more automated and a society that will function with less human workers becomes possible, it may be time to reexamine our assumptions about what actually makes a society "wealthy".
1.2.7.6.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If people are too busy earning money to enjoy the benefits of it, there is no point to their actions.
1.2.7.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, depending on what form this capital takes and what actions are taken to increase it, their actions may in fact be actively harmful and destructive, either to other humans or to animals, land, and the environment.
1.2.7.6.3.1.1.1.2. Con: We are [very far from a world without need for human labor](http://secondmachineage.com/). There are many problems that can only be addressed by humans in healthcare, childcare, eldercare, cleaning the environment, etc.
1.2.7.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: If our productivity levels stay the same, then the fewer people work, the smaller general welfare will grow.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2. Con: Societal wealth is a matter of total working hour productivity. More working-hours means more produced, and more material wealth. It is a function of society to decide how much work \(and thus wealth\) for which it is worth sacrificing free time for.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1. Con: Social wealth is not a matter of total working hours as claimed. Labour productivity depends much more on the amount of capital present in a country than on total working hours, as shown by the difference in productivity between the US and a country like India. If a UBI removes the incentive to build capital or to maintain existing capital, it will decrease social wealth, regardless of total hours worked.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Given an amount of "capital"—or, more correctly, a given level of technical progress—the amount of labor exercised correlates linearly to the wealth produced until the limits of technology to scale are reached. New technology raises the carry capacity by allowing further scaling, and reduces the invested labor per unit of productive output.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1.2. Con: "Capital" is just an abstraction of labor—labor is invested to produce and maintain capital—and generally describes technology, either knowledge of processes \("human capital"\) or tools \(e.g. machines\). It is more-correct to say productivity is determined by technical progress.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Humans economize: they will expend the minimum means to produce the maximum ends. If a UBI were to reduce the total labor, labor would be organized to maximize productivity—to maintain the highest level of technical progress so as to maximize the unit production per labor hour.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The fact that society would economize is irrelevant because it does not imply society would be better off. If half of your wealth is destroyed, you economize, exactly because you are worse off than before. But the fact that you economize does not mean it is a good idea to destroy wealth. If UBI removes incentive to build capital or maintain existing capital, you surely economize but you are also worse off.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The capital you would lose in this scenario would be a waste. Building a factory which cannot be staffed is a use of labor which could otherwise produce actual things and thus wealth; building said factory would be a destruction of wealth. Building or maintaining the capital you claim would go unbuilt or unmaintained would decrease wealth.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.1.4. Con: This is internally-inconsistent, as it implies that the amount of capital required is fixed and does not grow or shrink with the amount of use to which that capital is put. The is implied by reasoning that an economy cannot scale down to any significant degree, in turn implied by reasoning that less labor means the capital used by that labor goes neglected and decays—rather than that some of the capital becomes excess as production scales down.
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.2. Con: The sentiment is true, but working more \(over employment\) has been known to cause economic crashes. Certain levels of 'productivity' just aren't sustainable due to phenomena [such as the business cycle \(see chapters 9-12\)](http://www.academia.edu/24045849/Macroeconomics_Third_Edition_by_Charles_I._Jones_W.W._Norton_2014).
1.2.7.6.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Overwork also has health implications, which increases healthcare costs as well as decreasing productivity.
1.2.7.6.3.1.3. Con: A society exists for far greater purposes than providing meaningless work for factory fodder. People who are free from mindless tasks \(that machines can do\) are free to pursue more creative and fulfilling tasks.
1.2.7.6.3.1.3.1. Pro: If someone can get by on UBI while they chase their dreams, great things can happen. History is littered with geniuses in their fields who have died young/been forced to abandon their work through poverty.
1.2.7.6.3.1.3.2. Pro: It is in the best interest of society to have a happy and healthy workforce. It is detrimental to society and individuals to have participation in the workforce so heavily incentivized that it leads to mental and physical illness.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4. Con: As automation and machines eventually displace more and more humans from the workforce, having people work less may actually have a positive effect.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1. Pro: Systematic unemployment due to lack of available jobs is a future threat to human welfare even in the current economy, and that threat is [likely to increase in the future](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-is-the-future-of-work/).
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1. Con: We should be trying to [create more jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n6ivGgb9RY) and not finding ways to get people out of the workforce.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Job creation increases economic well-being.  Like it did in the [Reagan era](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2014/09/11/sorry-obama-fans-reagan-did-better-on-jobs-and-growth/#549b9fab55e1)!
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: It is doubtful that all relevant factors are the same as they were in the Reagan era.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: More jobs means a better economy because more jobs means more people with money.  More people with money means more people buying things which means more profits for companies which means even more jobs!
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Given [that over the last few decades real wages have barely budged](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/), this calculus clearly no longer holds. Any growth in jobs and the economy has not lead to increases in consumer spending power; because costs are instead rising in terms of basic expenses such as food and healthcare.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Creating jobs is nice and even if we 'should' try, it is likely that will be [impossible in the future](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-is-the-future-of-work/), at least that 100% employment is impossible.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.4. Con: This implies \(or avoids saying\) we should avoid UBI in order to drive job creation. Individuals benefit from UBI and corporations create jobs. Supporting individuals when corporations fail to create jobs makes sense. Whether or not corporations should or shouldn't create jobs is irrelevant.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.1.5. Con: UBI is not a way of getting people out of the workforce; it is a better way of supporting those who are between jobs, those who are working in jobs that don't suit them, and those who can't find a job they are able to do. UBI could allow them the opportunity to find a better fit for their talents and abilities, or allow them the freedom to learn more in order to do so.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: The argument strengthens if humanity rejects its current apocalyptic drive for consumption. To the extent unemployment is unavoidable and not a result of personal inadequacy or market down-cycles, then UBI because a necessary protection insurance against the societal costs of widespread crime and poverty.
1.2.7.6.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: When employment is working at a task better done my machines and only preserved as human labor for the sake of creating jobs, 100% unemployment should be a goal not something to fear.
1.2.7.6.3.1.5. Con: Participation in the work force has external costs.
1.2.7.6.3.1.6. Pro: The government's priority should always be to encourage employment instead of giving people the hope that they can subsist on subsidies, or innovation and production will stagnate.
1.2.7.6.3.1.7. Con: Currently, people work out of social and economical obligation. A UBI diminishes this obligation, enhancing people's sense of freedom and agency.
1.2.7.6.3.1.7.1. Con: People are free to choose not to work in capitalist systems. The fact that there are consequences to that choice doesn't make it economic coercion.
1.2.7.6.3.1.7.1.1. Con: By logical extension: when pointing a gun to an individual's head and asking them to do something, said individual is free not to do said thing. The fact that there are likely going to be consequences to that choice is exactly what makes it coercive.
1.2.7.6.3.1.7.2. Con: It is not the job of government to unconditionally support individual's 'freedom' if they are not willing to engage in the economic exchange of labor.
1.2.7.6.3.1.7.3. Pro: For some people, who are genuinely not fit for the workforce, this is a good thing. These people can now live much more enjoyable lives.
1.2.7.6.3.2. Con: People working less actually increases employment as, assuming demand remains constant, other workers will be brought in to make up for it. Lower average hours worked with sustained demand will lead to higher employment rate until employment reaches a maximum.
1.2.7.6.3.3. Pro: Increases in population combine with increases in productivity to ensure that there will always be less work needed.
1.2.7.6.3.4. Con: Existing welfare schemes reduce people's incentive to work because earning more money reduces the number of benefits they accrue. A UBI fixes this and actually provides [a higher marginal return to earning an income](https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/06/13/universal-bassic-income-and-marginal-rates/).
1.2.7.6.3.4.1. Pro: In the US, the effective marginal tax rates on the poor [are often as high as 109% of their income](https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/06/13/universal-bassic-income-and-marginal-rates/) because of the corresponding reduction in welfare benefits as they earn more.
1.2.7.6.3.4.2. Pro: UBI does not punish those of lower classes who begin to earn more money, but instead keeps the incentive to move up in income to the point where UBI is no longer necessary for the individual. Therefore this saves the government more money over time in welfare spending.
1.2.7.6.3.4.3. Con: Even if the existing welfare schemes are \(supposedly\) worse than UBIs, welfare schemes could be improved so that the disincentive to increase income is not as steep as the [\(1999\) source](https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/shaviro_02-1999.pdf) of the [parent's source](https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/06/13/universal-bassic-income-and-marginal-rates/) illustrates. In other words, traditional welfare programs could be fixed rather than eliminated and replaced with UBI.
1.2.7.6.3.4.3.1. Con: This argument is a status quo bias. It adresses only one of the current wellfare system's shortcomings but maintains that it should be preserved to avert change.
1.2.7.6.3.4.3.2. Pro: If the main problem with current welfare is the disincentive to work, a reworked version of [workfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workfare) can solve that problem without the need for the high cost of a UBI. Requiring some level of employment before social benefits supplement that income \(for those physically and mentally able\) incentivizes employment and reduces overall welfare costs because the government is only supplementing, not providing the income.
1.2.7.6.3.4.3.2.1. Con: Invisible disabilities, or those who have difficulty proving their disability \(or do not have full information about the availability of schemes\), could easily slip through the cracks. A UBI allows no cracks by including every individual.
1.2.7.6.3.4.4. Pro: A UBI is a fairer alternative to most welfare programs because everyone gets it — not just the people who need it the most which could be interpreted as rewarding incompetence/laziness.
1.2.7.6.3.4.4.1. Con: It really makes no difference to the rich though. It only helps those who aren't being taxed already, since those with enough tax to outweigh the UBI will not really get any benefit. If anything, a UBI, if it is more desirable to live off of than a taxable income, may cause some of the rich to stop working.
1.2.7.6.3.4.4.1.1. Con: Much of the money 'earned' by the wealthy is earned through investment, not work, which is still taxable income. Also, as the wealthy tend to make significantly more than would be provided via UBI, the idea that they would 'stop working' to get that free money instead is fairly unlikely.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5. Pro: UBI would correct the unintended consequence of broken families and encourage marriage and stable family structure. Current welfare discourages marriage as evidenced by the rise in single mother households whereas UBI would not penalize a single mother for the added income of a spouse but instead encourage the combining of incomes through marriage.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.1. Con: Providing for the people through government is destructive of families, as it directly competes with or purports to replace [the responsibility](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19) of [fathers to provide](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&old=true) for their families.
There is [no more economical way](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aparnamathur/2015/10/30/the-family-foundations-of-economic-growth/#3a60007a2a9b) to live than in intact families as the fundamental provident unit of society.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.2. Con: Traditional welfare systems can exist which are neutral or even incentivize marriage.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.2.1. Pro: In the UK it was historically very beneficial to be married, although it is now rather neutral, [due to](https://www.money.co.uk/guides/how-will-getting-married-affect-your-finances.htm) married couples/marriage allowance, tax bracket sharing, and tax free gifts.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.2.2. Pro: Many countries, [like Germany](https://www.expattax.de/marriage-tax-classes-germany/), have joint taxation. This benefits married couples who can choose to submit taxes together, meaning they can often share unused tax credits.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.2.3. Pro: Proposed changes to the Swiss marriage tax model make getting married [more financially beneficial](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/switzerland-abolition-of-marriage-tax-penalty-proposed/) than being an unmarried couple.  It also adds financial incentive for couples with children to get married.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.3. Con: Much of any marriage penalty comes from tax changes, rather than welfare, because most couples are not on welfare. 

UBI would not affect the taxation system, and therefore would not have as much of an impact on marriage incentives as a tax reform world.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.4. Con: Increasing numbers of single mother households just suggests that relationships are not lasting as long.

If a correlation was to be drawn between current welfare systems and lack of marriage, we should look at numbers of unmarried couples, not single mothers.
1.2.7.6.3.4.5.5. Con: A UBI would not encourage combining of incomes through marriage, as any family would get the same benefits even if they stayed as an unmarried couple.
1.2.7.6.3.4.6. Pro: In the current system, if one gets a job, they get reduced benefits, resulting in less stability and netting less capital for subsistence. With UBI of 1k a month, working merely increases the capital for subsistence and [promotes working](http://fortune.com/2017/09/03/universal-basic-income-economy-study/), even with a minimum wage job, to thrust an impoverished household into the lower middle class.
1.2.7.6.3.4.6.1. Pro: The small increase in income from getting a minimum wage job, at the cost of hours of free time, often does not motivate unemployed people to find one. A UBI, retained when entering the workforce, provides better incentive.
1.2.7.6.3.5. Con: A UBI will enable unhappy workers who detract from work productivity to leave their jobs, so happy and productive workers can take their place.
1.2.7.6.3.5.1. Con: Those who detract from productivity will automatically be replaced through market forces.
1.2.7.6.3.5.1.1. Pro: Employees who fail to be productive will be let go and replaced by new employees who can do a better job.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2. Pro: Most people go to work today merely because they will not be able to feed themselves or their family otherwise. A UBI will remove that obligation.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1. Con: [Choice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201404/why-having-the-choice-do-nothing-is-so-important) has been found to be a powerful motivator, as a positive relationship has been found between one's ability to choose not to work and one's commitment to work.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.1. Con: The illusion of choice can also be harmful when it comes to reinforcing harmful social norms. For example, women may be more likely to 'choose' not to work under a UBI, but this choice may be heavily influenced by social messaging and gender norms.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Approximately [40%](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/business/economy/women-as-family-breadwinner-on-the-rise-study-says.html) of American mothers are the breadwinners in their household. This number increases when non-married couples are taken in consideration. Therefore, it is probable that even with a UBI, the representation of women in the workforce will continue to grow.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.1.2. Con: With a UBI, women currently dependent on their partner's salary will now have their own money.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.2. Con: This commitment needs to be evaluated relative to the net loss of workers who choose to opt out. Though the quality of workers may marginally increase, the quantity decreases to a more significant and harmful extent.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.2.1. Con: [An experiment](https://public.econ.duke.edu/~erw/197/forget-cea%20\(2\).pdf) with a UBI in Canada resulted in households reducing their workloads by about [13%](https://qz.com/765902/ubi-wouldnt-mean-everyone-quits-working/).
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The main reason fewer hours were worked was that male students stayed in school longer – they no longer had to help support their family – and mothers stayed at home longer with newborns. These were both responses that benefit society overall.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The experiment in question only ran for four years, and was known by participants to have a fixed term. The need for future employment is likely a major skewing factor compared to a permanent UBI program.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.2.1.3. Con: The experiment ran short term, which could have skewed the results: the rise in unemployment may have been temporary. Learning different skill sets, switching careers, starting a business, or even de-stressing \(so they can pursue a career without mental or physical health problems\) takes time. It's possible that a portion of the 13% did just that.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.2. Con: Existing welfare systems in some countries already allow people to not work while still managing to feed their families \(at least as much as a UBI would\).
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: The German "[Hartz IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartz_concept#Hartz_IV)" offers recipients, usually long-term unemployed, social benefits and a monthly payment for them and their families to maintain a basic standard of living.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3. Con: People work for reasons other than income.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1. Pro: Labor is often very meaningful to a lot of people, since it provides some sense of dignity.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.1. Con: There are other ways people experience dignity. Being respected and acknowledged for social, familial, and political contributions also provides dignity and meaning to a person's life.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Contributions in the form of personal development and financially aiding the family are among the greatest of these ways.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: Solely living on the UBI could make people feel useless.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Nothing is stopping people who want to work from working.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Or it could give them the freedom to do things they actually want to do, that would feel meaningful to them.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.3. Con: Current societal and cultural shaming for "not contributing" \(despite there being no universally recognized higher cause to which someone should be contributing\) is what is depriving people of dignity in the first place, which they then attempt to regain by working.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.4. Con: This does not represent everybody and is not an excuse to force labour onto those who would rather not engage in it, unless there is a genuine need for that labour.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.2. Con: A UBI allows people to work for these reasons unrelated to income at more genuine and efficient levels by reducing financial stress and coercive incentives.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.3. Con: Then their work could become an activity they choose to engage in, and UBI provides more choices and freedom of choice overall - including that one.
1.2.7.6.3.5.2.4. Pro: In wealthy countries people who work only for survival would be able to stop working.
1.2.7.6.3.5.3. Con: This assumes there are a surplus of happy workers to take necessary jobs.
1.2.7.6.3.5.3.1. Con: There is an excess of all workers at the moment, and while it is possible none of them will be more agreeable with the working conditions, it is probable a good number will be.
1.2.7.6.3.5.3.1.1. Con: There is only an excess of available workers because of the requirement for every human being to work. UBI eliminates that imperative.
1.2.7.6.3.5.4. Con: This assumes happy workers are more productive, which is [false](http://www.hiringsmart.com/articles/608/Happy_Employees_are_not_Necessarily_Productive_Employees/).
1.2.7.6.3.5.4.1. Con: The linked article states that disengaged workers are not productive - so enabling disengaged workers to leave a job they are not engaged with and find a job or other activities which are more engaging and satisfying to them would produce a similar benefit.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5. Pro: Happy workers are [more productive](http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/happy-productivity-work/).
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1. Con: Workers are not 'happy' if their work is not significantly higher valued than "non-work" in terms of spending capacity and available income; the UBI devalues the perception of basic work.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1. Pro: Prior to a UBI, a worker had a certain available income, and a non-worker had no income. Post UBI implementation a non-worker would have available income. Individuals earning more than [50.000 USD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZH_i4nqHE1OKmapiHqusnXF8LpXJfGZgU0nNIcKN13Y/edit?usp=sharing) would have to pay more into the UBI tax than they get back in UBI payments; they can afford less than what they had before. The worker's comparative marginal gains over a non-worker pre vs. post UBI would show their work is less valuable.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1.1. Con: The amount someone makes does [not reflect the value of their labor](https://theweek.com/articles/451285/1-percent-dont-work-harder-money--work-less), earnings from capital gains and inheritance are not made from hard work.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: In the case of inheritance, it doesn't reflect the work of the person receiving the inheritance, but it reflects the work of the person providing the inheritance. That money has to come from somewhere.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1.1.2. Con: In the case of capital gains, these are produced by the investment of already existing capital. The previously existing capital that is needed to invest is the result of work. Then researching and choosing an investment, and taking the risk associated is the work that goes into the investment itself.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1.2. Con: Of note, the 50,000 mark is only accurate under certain taxation/payment schemes. There is, inevitably, a point at which someone must be paying in more than they are giving out, but exactly where that point is, depends on the particular UBI plan enacted.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1.3. Con: Not all income is work related. Some is investment related. And the higher up the income ladder you go, the larger the percentage of income 'earned' is actually based on investments, thus, while it may 'reduce the value' of some people's work, it does so at a lower and lower rate, at the higher points of the economy.
1.2.7.6.3.5.5.1.1.4. Con: Reduction of the value of work at higher levels in order to maintain a minimum basic living standard across the board is a reasonable cost.
1.2.7.6.3.6. Con: This makes an assumption that UBI will be set at an enormously high level - a level that would certainly not be practical or feasible given the economic realities and the budgets of state and federal governments.
1.2.7.6.3.6.1. Pro: UBI will most likely be set at levels that allow for the assurance of fresh food, water, electricity, and housing. Done right, UBI can be set at levels low enough.
1.2.7.6.3.7. Pro: UBI will increase depression and suicide rates as people lose purpose derived from work.
1.2.7.6.3.7.1. Con: Many suicides are correlated with [poverty](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797\(16\)30461-5/fulltext), harsh living circumstances, work stress, and hatred of one's job.
1.2.7.6.3.7.1.1. Con: There can be different reasons for suicide - this does not invalidate the fact that many people derive purpose and order from their work.
1.2.7.6.3.8. Pro: A fundamental economic principle is to add value through work. When income is given for free without work this does not add value to the economy.
1.2.7.6.3.8.1. Con: There are no things like "fundamental economic principles", they are observations that have been valid in the past. They are traditions in the sense that they have been repeated so often people take them for laws. E.g. there could be so many opportunity costs that are avoided that the net turnover will be positive \(think of health, less pollution, etc.\)
1.2.7.6.3.9. Pro: The UBI may result in fewer citizens being forced to provide for an increasing number of unproductive individuals in society.
1.2.7.6.3.10. Pro: A UBI, by eliminating the need to work, would strongly decrease the incentives that promote innovation.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1. Pro: UBI will negatively impact incentives for technological and economic progress. Be it fame, fortune, or philanthropy, we have all the great things in our life readily available because the brains behind them had something motivating them.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.1. Con: Innovation requires the ability to pursue avenues that might include risk. With no reasonable safety net, these risks may be avoided instead of pursued.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.2. Con: Motivations can be more than money. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people in the world, and still working at an age many people have retired.[g.co](https://g.co/kgs/Cwy8m9)
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.3. Con: Money is not the motivator behind innovation. The great innovators in history were all driven by a will to help people, or by their own passion for their subject.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.3.1. Con: The belief that all innovators in history were not driven by money may be hard to back up. If someone asked people like Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Henry Ford or the Wright Brothers about their drive to go from a neat idea to a scale that could benefit society, money would likely be a leading factor. Useful innovation needs scale and scale requires a lot of work and money. Payoff must be greater than cost for innovation. Here is a good article about driving innovation [sciencedirect.com](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873331730104X)
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.3.1.1. Con: Thomas Edison claimed credit \(and eventually copyright\) out of greed for work that Nikola Tesla did in order to benefit humanity.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Nicola Tesla did work for the good of mankind, as can be seen in his plans for [universal energy](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science1), something that would be almost impossible to commercialize.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.6.3.10.1.3.1.1.1.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.4. Con: Much of the greatest technological innovation has been made possible through general research - research that was subsidized through public funds with no direct expectation of profit. The motivator here is not something that a UBI would destroy: human curiosity and the possibility of changing the world.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.4.1. Pro: Those motivations don't magically disappear because we get a little bit of money.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.4.1.1. Pro: Very few people who achieve fame and fortune cease pursuing those goals once they achieve a moderate amount of wealth. This shows that, to an extent at least, incentives to achieve those forms of success go above and beyond just getting rich.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.3.1.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.4.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.6. Con: Many mathematicians and scientists of the past were born into wealthy and affluent positions affording them the freedom to peruse their true interests benefiting society and not what keeps bread on their table.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.3.
1.2.7.6.3.10.1.8. Con: [The idea that money is a motivator is untrue,](https://youtu.be/dgKKPQiRRag) and studies have proven that money only motivates up until a living wage, after which competence is a greater motivator.
1.2.7.6.3.10.2. Con: A UBI would help inventors \(who tend to be terrible at making money\) continue to invent. Thus incentivising some of the greatest minds in society to use their mind instead of work to survive.
1.2.7.6.3.11. Con: This would be highly beneficial for those with moderately severe chronic illness or disability or those who otherwise cannot qualify for disability assistance programs.
1.2.7.6.3.12. Con: Evidence suggests that social security systems like UBI do not lead people to stop working.
1.2.7.6.3.12.1. Pro: Germany has a very sophisticated [social state](https://www.internations.org/germany-expats/guide/15984-social-security-taxation/social-security-in-germany-15970), with a variety of public payments and benefits that enable citizens to live at least a humble life without work. Nevertheless, the [unemployment rate](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/unemployment-rate) is very low.
1.2.7.6.3.12.2. Pro: The average amount given for social security in the US is [not enough](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/why-its-hard-to-for-retirees-to-get-by-on-social-security-benefits.html) for many to live on without other streams of income.
1.2.7.6.3.12.3. Pro: Brazil has a program called "Bolsa Família" \(Family Allowance\), which is basically UBI but only for poor people. Although it is not exactly UBI, there were enough [studies](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ecos/v19n3/08.pdf) in Brazil to prove that the described social program did not make, with some exceptions, people lazy. In a lot of cases, the exact opposite was observed: people worked harder to pursue their dreams.
1.2.7.6.3.12.4. Con: A negative income tax \(a variant of UBI\) [was already tried](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/commentary/universal-basic-income-has-been-tried-it-didnt-work) in six U.S. states between 1968 and 1980. It reduced people desire to work and lead to them having longer lengths of unemployment.
1.2.7.6.3.12.4.1. Con: The cited article is a questionable interpretation of the broad range of data collected in several interesting experiments. The author of the article focuses solely on the reduced productivity of those involved, and even that is examined only in a decrease in hours of work. No consideration is made to how much they started at, their quality of life, or long term investments/improvements.
1.2.7.6.3.12.4.2. Con: The article explicitly says that the programs analyzed were negative income taxes, which are not universal basic income \(since negative income taxes decrease pay out as one makes more money\).
1.2.7.6.3.12.4.3. Con: These programs took place while traditional welfare was still in place, weakening the study's applicability for a UBI which replaces traditional welfare.
1.2.7.6.3.12.4.4. Con: It is not clear what the recipients did with their extra time; some of them may have chosen to do productive/positive activities that just aren't technically "work," such as pursuing education, taking care of sick family members, volunteering, that just aren't "work." Without knowing these details, we cannot reliably determine the extent/harm of this effect.
1.2.7.6.3.12.4.5. Con: Negative tax structure and UBI are not even remotely comparable: NTS decreases the more you earn so essentially working to maintain the same quality of life. This is incentive not to work. Not comparable to UBI which is no strings attached and the more you work, the more quality of life improves.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5. Pro: UBI experiments and trials show that people do not tend to work less when given an unconditional income.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.6.3.5.2.1.2.1.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.2. Pro: In 2011 Iran established a [program](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) that guaranteed citizens cash payments of equivalent to third of the nation's median income. A report found no evidence for the hypothesis this unconditional income reduced the willingness to work.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.2.1. Pro: People engaged in the Iranian [service industry](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) worked more than before the implementation of the payment program.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.2.2. Pro: Iranian business people started to expand their [businesses](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income).
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.2.3. Pro: There is [evidence](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) that citizens started to pursue more satisfying kind of work instead of leaving the labor market for good.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.3. Pro: A UBI does not undermine the incentive to work, as evidenced by this [London-based study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIL_Y9g7Tg0).
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4. Pro: [A UBI experiment](http://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/resources/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Indias-Basic-Income-Experiment-PP21.pdf) in India showed that overall employment increased with the implementation of a UBI and there was a sharp increase in more independent labor.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4.1. Con: The experiment did not actually test a UBI, because benefits were temporary, which significantly alters the incentive of beneficiaries towards making something lasting out of it. If they thought this income would become the norm instead of being a financial windfall, they would not be as motivated to reduce debt, for example.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4.2. Con: The experiment did not actually test a UBI, because the benefits were not paid from taxes collected in the villages, but injected from outside. Instead of UBI, which is a zero-sum game within the economic zone in which it is implemented, they brought in purchasing power from outside the "UBI" zone, which of course makes the villages better off.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4.2.1. Con: While this experiment may not be an accurate representation of the macroeconomic consequences, it still shows the effects of a UBI on individual behavior: increased school attendance, reduced debts, and a shift in occupations from wage laborer to farmer.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4.2.2. Con: Even if purchasing power is redistributed rather than raised \(on net\) a zero-sum change can still improve net welfare as the benefit of the marginal dollar to the poor is much higher than the to rich.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: Also in any small scale view, this is not a sum zero game. A poor area \(such as this village\) will net benefit, and a rich area \(which could have been a wealthy town nearby\) will net loose.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.4.3. Con: The experiment did not actually test a UBI as it is usually proposed, because the benefits were designed to be just enough to make a difference, but not enough to live off. It was a supplemental income that still required the villagers to work for their livelihood, as opposed to an income that can buy at least food, clothing and shelter.
1.2.7.6.3.12.5.5. Pro: A UBI experiment in Finland showed that those who received UBI [did not work less](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2193136-universal-income-study-finds-money-for-nothing-wont-make-us-work-less/) than a control group of those who received traditional benefits.
1.2.7.6.3.13. Con: People will not drop out of work due to cultural reasons.
1.2.7.6.3.13.1. Pro: The [Protestant work ethic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1501011/) is a strong element of many western societies that causes moral pressure to work and is still a dominant spirit of the modern era. \([Castells, Himanen, p. 19](https://archive.org/details/TheHackerEthicAndTheSpiritOfTheInformationAge)\).
1.2.7.6.3.13.1.1. Pro: For Protestants, the ['psychic harm'](https://hbr.org/daily-stat/2013/08/there-really-is-such-a-thing-a.html) from unemployment is 40% more than for other social groups, due to hard work being viewed as a 'calling' rather than a job.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2. Con: Societies and its values are subjects of constant change and progress. Triggered by the UBI, working less or even not working at all could become the social norm and the source for individuals' identity and self-esteem becomes a different one.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.1. Con: Just as societal change can alter the working habits toward working less, they can also form around working more efficiently or productively.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.1.1. Pro: [Financial stress](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/employees-financial-issues-affect-their-job-performance.aspx) can affect health to the point of decreasing productivity. A UBI can alleviate this stress, thus indirectly increasing productivity.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.1.1.1. Pro: Increasing amounts of physical illnesses are being found to be stress-related, as stress weakens the immune system and negatively affects the physical body in other ways.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.1.1.2. Pro: UBI reduces levels of stress and anxiety that result from an insecurity in wages and allows a person to build psychological resources that enhance possibility for upward mobility.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.1.1.3. Pro: Focus and attention are limited resources; when you have more mental space because some of the stress to take care of the basic needs is relieved, it allows you the ability to explore more options in life. In this regard, money \(UBI\) is a non-linear in its effects, once people get over the inertia of the first $500-1000 per month it expands their possibilities, which means a nation could operate at a higher level of productivity.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.1.
1.2.7.6.3.13.2.2. Con: Whilst being productive is important, a move away from financial status as the primary source of one's pride should actually be a favourable development for societies.
1.2.7.6.3.13.3. Pro: In many cultures, especially in East Asia \(e.g. [South Korea](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/23/asia/south-korea-work-culture/)\), there is huge societal pressure to work.
1.2.7.6.3.13.3.1. Pro: The societal pressure to work in South Korea is deeply rooted, as it begins in the [classroom](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/15/393939759/the-all-work-no-play-culture-of-south-korean-education).
1.2.7.6.3.14. Con: People will not drop out of work due to personal values.
1.2.7.6.3.14.1. Pro: Even if provided with a UBI, people would continue to work in order to ensure better education and resources for their children.
1.2.7.6.3.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.6.3.5.2.3.1.
1.2.7.6.3.14.3. Pro: People want to improve their social status.
1.2.7.6.3.14.3.1. Con: There are other ways to improve social status, such as through [education](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/social-mobility-and-education), [marriage](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol26/8/26-8.pdf) or friendship.
1.2.7.6.3.14.3.2. Pro: Improving social status will allow people to enjoy the kind of lifestyle they envision for themselves, thus, improving their happiness.
1.2.7.6.3.14.4. Pro: For many people work is an important source of [personal identity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1501011/) and self-esteem.
1.2.7.6.3.14.4.1. Pro: [55%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/175400/workers-sense-identity-job.aspx) of US workers report getting their sense of identity from their job.
1.2.7.6.3.14.4.2. Con: [Work](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-robinson/self-identity_b_1128731.html) as a major source of personal identity can be detrimental to a person's sense of self-worth, as it is tied to a dynamic external construct and daily performance instead of internal values and attributes. Even if people leave the workforce, it will - under this premise - lead to a more positive and sustainable sense of self-identity.
1.2.7.6.3.14.5. Pro: Some people work because they are driven by a personal mission.
1.2.7.6.3.14.5.1. Pro: A UBI could restore pride in kinds of work that are culturally significant, but otherwise are not usually fiscally responsible undertakings.
1.2.7.6.3.14.5.2. Pro: Some famous and successful [CEOs](https://www.fastcompany.com/3026791/dialed/personal-mission-statements-of-5-famous-ceos-and-why-you-should-write-one-too) have a clear personal mission.
1.2.7.6.3.14.6. Con: Parents may struggle to find a healthy work-home balance. These individuals may believe it makes more sense to leave the workplace in order to focus on their childrens' welfare or care.
1.2.7.7. Con: Taxes other than income taxes could be raised in order to lessen the economic impact on individuals.
1.2.7.7.1. Pro: UBI through a tax on [energy resources](https://www.canadadrives.ca/blog/news/carbon-taxes-and-carbon-tax-rebates-in-canada-explained)(Canada’s carbon tax has two parts: a carbon levy on fuel purchases and a big emitters program for industrial facilities. To explain how the carbon levy affects the average Canadian, this article will focus more on the carbon levy and less on the big industrial emitters.\n...\nFor the provincial governments that refused to adopt the carbon tax, Trudeau wasn’t about to reward them with billions in new tax revenue. That’s why the feds created the Climate Action Incentive \(CAI\) – to make sure taxpayers are on the receiving end of the carbon tax revenue – not uncooperative premiers. It also softens the blow for those cringing at increased power bills and pump prices.) and financial transactions \(such as those in [Canada and Switzerland](https://en.unesco.org/inclusivepolicylab/analytics/greening-basic-income)(Carbon price-and-dividend schemes are in place in Canada and Switzerland, with dozens of other jurisdictions implementing forms of carbon pricing.)\) makes an increase on the income tax unnecessary, while making society more equal.
1.2.7.7.1.1. Con: Canada claimed that [80%](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-trudeaus-2022-climate-plan-more-carbon-taxes)(While Ottawa has claimed 80% of households in these provinces end up better off financially because of the rebates) of families would be financially better off. In 2021, Parliamentary budget officer reports that though most households are financially better off it is [60%](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-trudeaus-2022-climate-plan-more-carbon-taxes)(...while most households... end up better off financially because of rebates, 40% of Ontario households, not 20%, are now paying more in carbon taxes than they receive in rebates.) of families.
1.2.7.7.2. Con: The costs of those forms of taxes are all ultimately met by Citizens; even if indirectly.
1.2.7.7.3. Pro: If higher tax revenue is required, a [Land Value Tax](https://www.kialo.com/should-a-land-value-tax-be-introduced-to-replace-other-taxes-8742) could be used. Such a tax does not harm the economy and has other localized benefits beyond simply raising revenue.
1.2.7.8. Con: A UBI would improve peoples heath, thus creating major savings in the healthcare sector, which is publicly funded in many developed countries.
1.2.7.8.1. Pro: Basic income has been shown to have a [positive affect](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313385410_Reducing_health_inequities_Is_universal_basic_income_the_way_forward) on birth outcomes in Alaska.
1.2.7.8.2. Pro: Income transfers are some of the most effective means of [improving health outcomes](https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/alphaweb.site-ym.com/resource/collection/86D31666-E7EA-42F1-BDA1-A03ECA0B4E3D/OnPhysicians_Letter_BIG_170815.pdf) and being healthy is a fundamental precursor to almost all other rights and freedoms.
1.2.7.8.2.1. Con: Government regulates levels of societal freedom more than health. Take two individuals, one very healthy and one with a terminal disease; both can live in the same totalitarian society a with equally little freedoms.
1.2.7.8.2.1.1. Con: The person with the poorer health will still have fewer freedoms. \(E.g. limited access to public services, time consuming treatments, ...\)
1.2.7.8.2.1.2. Con: There will always be some limitations for what you can do, the freedom given by UBI is that people get power \(monetary power\) and can choose what to do with it — without the threat and fear of not being able to survive.
1.2.7.8.3. Pro: A UBI reduces mental health complications \([p. 4](https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article-pdf/40/1/3/24372631/fdx006.pdf)(In an unconditional cash transfer experiment in Malawi, schoolgirls\nwere ~38% less likely to suffer psychological distress than the\ncontrol group. A 1996 longitudinal study conducted on a tribal reservation in the USA examined the psychiatric outcomes following the opening of a casino, which lead to a rise of income in the reservation. The study results showed that drug dealing in adolescents declined, high school graduation rates increased and the youngest of the family were less likely to experience any psychiatric disorder. Research studies in Kenya present a multitude of mental health benefits from income supplements: youth experienced 24% less depressive\nsymptoms, psychological well-being increased and the benefits played a buffering effect for the mental health of orphaned children. Young men reported feeling healthier and being more hopeful. In short, income security appears to be a key factor in protecting mental health.)\).
1.2.7.8.3.1. Pro: Unresolved, compounded [stress](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/stress/index.shtml) can lead to mental disorders like depression and anxiety. With money being a [major stressor](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/02/money-stress.aspx) of 64% of Americans-particularly in the lower income bracket-a UBI can decrease this stress by increasing the amount of money contributed to a household.
1.2.7.8.3.2. Pro: Stress has been affecting the lives of those living in the cities [so much](https://www.stress.org/daily-life/), mainly work, money and the future, that it is literally [changing the pathways in our brains](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10190) and there is [data proof](http://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf) that living in the cities or urban areas in general has a direct impact on our mental health and how prone we are to disorders, in developed countries.
1.2.7.8.3.2.1. Pro: That is [debilitating to society](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2004-15935-004) as a whole, no matter who you are as [stress is infectious in and of itself](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/stress-cues-from-others#2) AND can make you more [susceptible to other diseases](https://www.clinicaleducation.org/resources/reviews/chronic-stress-increases-infection-susceptibility/).
1.2.7.8.4. Pro: India trialed a [UBI in 2010](https://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/universal-basic-income-5-experiments-from-around-the-world-1): The trial resulted in a sharp increase in food sufficiency and a drop in illness in villages that received the funds compared to those that did not."
1.2.7.8.5. Pro: Minorities and the poor have real problems that endanger their health and sometimes their lives, like living in very poor conditions, being malnourished, not having access to health care and education, etc. A UBI can afford them better health, education, and housing.
1.2.7.8.5.1. Con: There are [government public assistance programs](https://www.usa.gov/benefits) available that already provide benefits to improving health care access, education, proper nutrition, and housing.
1.2.7.8.5.2. Con: UBI is another wealth re-distribution scheme that ultimately reduces the choices of consumers, the quality of goods & services.  [Problems with UBI Schemes](https://mises.org/blog/dangers-universal-basic-income)
1.2.7.8.5.3. Pro: A UBI will reduce unclaimed medical costs caused by malnurishment, dehydration and various homeless injuries. In turn, this will cause an overall increase in national health.
1.2.7.8.5.4. Pro: Eliminating these problems should be the absolute priority, even if this does not also solve discrimination and inequality.
1.2.7.8.5.5. Con: A UBI is unlikely to provide people with enough income to significantly expand their freedom of choice. People who are poor will still be significantly less well off than the rich.
1.2.7.8.5.5.1. Con: People who currently must take a job or starve will have the freedom to keep looking for something better. People are less likely to feel trapped under a UBI.
1.2.7.8.5.5.2. Con: Low-income people often feel trapped by the location of the social programs they currently receive. With a UBI that people can take with them when they migrate within a country, people will have better opportunities to relocate.
1.2.7.8.5.5.3. Con: The greatest marginal value of UBI funds would be to the least mobile and skilled in society. The assurance of a consistent revenue stream, regardless of where a person lives, opens up myriad possible life changes which would simply be inaccessible for someone caught in the crushing wheel of poverty. UBI increases personal freedom and mobility.
1.2.7.8.5.5.4. Con: There will always be someone who is relatively better off. However, financial security does allow more room for freedom of choice.
1.2.7.8.5.5.4.1. Pro: The point of a UBI is to help give everybody the same set of starting conditions. After that, meritocracy can play out fairly.
1.2.7.8.6. Pro: A UBI would help decrease hospitalisation rates.
1.2.7.8.6.1. Pro: A UBI can provide the additional funds needed to purchase healthier foods, which can result in better overall health.
1.2.7.8.6.1.1. Pro: [Chronic diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/) such as diabetes and heart disease often result in multiple hospitalizations. These conditions can be helped and prevented through [proper nutrition](https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/trs916/summary/en/); a resource UBI can help provide.
1.2.7.8.6.2. Pro: There was an 8.5% reduction in hospitalization observed in the Dauphin, [Manitoba experiment](http://Embrace future branch https://www.kialo.com/ubi-creates-well-defined-groups-of-recipients-and-donors-according-to-net-incomeoutcome-its-easier-to-be-a-recipient-so-1634.8910?path=1634.0~1634.1_1634.8912-1634.8910&active=-1634.8910&action=comments crime branch https://www.kialo.com/one-of-the-us-constitutions-preambles-intent-is-to-provide-for-the-general-welfare-and-article-181-says-congress-1634.8723?path=1634.0~1634.1_1634.1131_1634.8723).
1.2.7.8.6.2.1. Con: Better health while in poverty will mean more women in poverty will choose to have children out of wedlock, thus increasing the population of government dependants and the social problems associated with single parent families.
1.2.7.8.6.2.1.1. Con: Better health while in poverty doesn't imply more children out of wedlock. For better health to exist there has to be reproductive health services which will in turn address this issue. This correlation does not seem to happen.
1.2.7.8.6.2.1.2. Con: Reduction of poverty means that women - in or out of wedlock - are better able to access things such as contraception, and thus better able to avoid unwanted children. This is likely to balance any increase in the number of those who choose to have children that they may not want to have if poorer - but may still have anyway.
1.2.7.8.6.2.1.3. Con: The same logic could be used to attack any initiative that would increase the health of people in poverty. This is not sufficient reason to avoid improving the health and living conditions of those living in poverty.
1.2.7.8.6.2.2. Pro: In medicine poverty is considered a Risk Factor for a lot of diseases. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_poverty)
1.2.7.8.7. Pro: A UBI helps disabled people.
1.2.7.8.7.1. Pro: A UBI would allow for disability to be dealt with in a non-exploitative or demeaning way.
1.2.7.8.7.2. Pro: Disabled people's medical bills would be unlikely to pile up and force them to change their lifestyles if they had a UBI.
1.2.8. Pro: A UBI could decrease the incentive for workers to take jobs that are unappealing and/or uncomfortable, even where those jobs are vital to society and the economy.
1.2.8.1. Pro: If incentives for workers in menial jobs are not adjusted via supply and demand the government will have to intervene with incentives which will counteract the benefits of UBI via larger taxes and hidden costs.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: One possible solution to making these jobs more attractive are tax incentives that result in lower public revenues.
1.2.8.2. Con: If those low-skill jobs are fundamental, but increasingly attract fewer workers, the jobs will then require higher wages until their attractiveness reaches an equilibrium.
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: A UBI will decrease the supply of low-skilled workers. This dynamic will be counteracted by rising wages \(in low-skilled jobs\) and a surge in Automation \(to replace lost workforce\). A UBI therefore acts almost like a pigouvian tax on low-skilled work \(similar to a minimum-wage\).
1.2.8.2.2. Pro: Many factories and warehouses pay double federal minimum wage for entry level. It isn't about the pay, it's about the culture of people not willing to work with their hands and get them dirty. It's about the culture that only office work is good work, and that actual labor is beneath the common man.
1.2.8.2.3. Con: The equilibrium you talk about is bankruptcy for many small businesses that can no longer afford a waiter, a cleaner, or a dishwasher. This simply plays into the hand of well established businesses and makes the barrier to entry much higher for anyone looking to start something new.
1.2.8.3. Con: Many of these jobs no longer require labour as they have become automated.
1.2.8.3.1. Con: Some jobs are not currently possible to automate. Others are not economically feasible to.
1.2.8.4. Pro: If there are any menial jobs that cannot be automated, it will be difficult to arrange to have them done. Menial labor, if not motivated by necessity or by the hope for better opportunities, doesn't have what little appeal it had in the first place.
1.2.8.4.1. Con: There are many perverse factors and market failures that currently prevent the free market from working effectively as it should.
1.2.8.5. Con: A UBI does not need to be set so high that everyone is satisfied, only enough that their needs are met at a minimal reasonable level.  Anything beyond that would still require a job.
1.2.9. Con: A UBI gives everyone money to spend on goods and services, therefore increasing aggregate demand and output.
1.2.9.1. Con: Redistribution is zero-sum: everything given to unproductive people has to be taken from productive people, either directly through taxes, or indirectly through borrowing or inflation.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Even if the transferred money drives up sales for productive people \(who offer goods or services\), because the money used to purchase the goods and services had been first taken from them, they essentially had to provide them for free.
1.2.9.2. Pro: A UBI offers the same benefits as raising the minimum wage, but without increasing the cost of labor. This keeps prices down as incomes go up, resulting in better purchasing power.
1.2.9.2.1. Con: The government may increase taxes over products and services, which in turn inflates the cost of goods and reduces the purchasing power.
1.2.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.
1.2.9.4. Pro: A UBI would likely have a growth effect on the market by putting money in the hands of the impoverished, who studies have proven spend a [greater percentage](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-should-we-support-the_b_7630162)("All those dollars low-wage workers spend create an economic ripple effect. Every extra dollar going into the pockets of low-wage workers, standard economic multiplier models tell us, adds about $1.21 to the national economy. Every extra dollar going into the pockets of a high-income American, by contrast, only adds about 39 cents to the GDP.") of their income than wealthier individuals.
1.2.9.4.1. Pro: As some companies cannot afford to pay high salaries, a UBI works as a subsidy. It helps the affected companies, e.g. start-ups, to develop and expand.
1.2.9.4.1.1. Con: On the other hand, a UBI can be misused by employers as an excuse for low salaries.
1.2.9.4.2. Pro: Black Americans have low [saving rates](http://thepowerisnow.com/savings-rate-of-african-americans/). Thus, money received would be channeled into the economy directly.
1.2.9.4.2.1. Con: As the [source](http://thepowerisnow.com/savings-rate-of-african-americans/) states, the most likely reason is that Black Americans do not earn enough to save. The money paid out to them might give them a chance to save.
1.2.9.4.2.1.1. Con: Much of the money received may have to go to [debt settlement and other expenses](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/debt-black-families/409756/), with very little going into savings.
1.2.9.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Even just clearing existing debts is a starting point for savings - when income is no longer eaten up by interest fees on debt, individuals can begin to save.
1.2.9.4.3. Con: Increased spending means decreased saving, and therefore less capital construction. This makes society less wealthy in the long run.
1.2.9.4.3.1. Con: More capital is constructed rather by re-investing than by keeping saved money-based capital. Saved capital is out of the market for all the time it stays saved.
1.2.9.4.3.1.1. Con: Money that is saved in a bank or other financial institution is not out of the market, but instead is now accessible to most anyone who wants to borrow. Money saved "under the mattress" does not contribute to economic growth, but is a negligible portion of all savings. It also plays an important role in the security of low income households \(which are most likely to practice it\).
1.2.9.4.4. Con: It doesn't help the economy to reward low-paid jobs, but [higher paid jobs](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/17/opinion/the-reagan-boom-greatest-ever.html). Higher paid jobs require ambition, motivation, and hard work. It's only worth it if there are incentives to do it.
1.2.9.4.4.1. Con: People would still receive an incentive by the extra income generated from their job.
1.2.9.4.4.1.1. Pro: A UBI is unlikely to inhibit someone like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates from their passions. If there are creative people out there, a UBI would give them time to work on what is important to them so they are free to be more creative, instead of working an unrewarding job.
1.2.9.4.4.2. Con: Higher paying jobs still reward people more then lower paying ones.
1.2.9.4.4.3. Con: Motivations are worthless if you don't have the ability to act on them. You can't start a business without an office you can't afford; you can't work hours of manual labor if you are starving; you can't get a job as a teacher if you can't afford to learn the knowledge you wish to impart.
1.2.9.4.4.3.1. Con: Although opportunity is not perfectly equal, a degree of equality is offered through the [ability to receive investment/loans](https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/07/how-to-finance-your-business.html). Even if someone is very poor, if they have a very good business idea, they will likely be able to receive some startup money.
1.2.9.4.4.3.1.1. Con: It seems like every head of a successful business has a story about how they were poor, and destitute, and someone gave them a shot. But these businesses are far from the total of the story as most people, even with great ideas, don't get those loans and their stories are buried by survival bias.
1.2.9.4.4.4. Con: This argument mirrors almost perfectly the [gospel of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology), [which tells people with cancer should seek treatment by giving money to a rich person who merely talks about how rich he is, instead of seeking the medical attention they need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg). Both put people with wealth on a pedestal, and lie to the poor and desperate that if they just give to these 'purer' people \(in this case, by working for them\) they can be better and more successful people.
1.2.9.4.4.4.1. Con: This misses the point of the grandparent, which partially emphasizes that higher-paying jobs tend to be more valuable to + lacked by society, since the price signals of the market \(as established in economics 101\) indicate what society wants more or less of.
1.2.9.4.4.5. Con: Money does not measure the worth of a person, their contribution to the society does. An individual's monetary worth measures only their talent in amassing a resource and is a solitary act benefiting only one individual. An act that in turn deprives others of access to that  resource and impedes contribution by the many to society. If money is the only measure of personal worth, then one's life is a meaningless pursuit of coin and paper that ceases to have value upon one's death.
1.2.9.4.5. Pro: A fairer distribution of wealth has been shown to boost [economic growth](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/better-economic-growth-when-wealth-distributed-to-poor-instead-of-rich) by increasing domestic spending.
1.2.9.5. Pro: A UBI will stimulate the economy, as wealth scarcity reduces cash flow. A UBI will improve cash flow and thus encourage people to spend more freely, especially those who work and educate for extra wealth privileges.
1.2.9.6. Pro: People tend to [spend less and save more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift) when there is no security net. The economy would be better off having people circulating their money around to a greater extent.
1.2.9.7. Con: Generating income from paid work also drives demand by increasing supply, thereby balancing demand.
1.2.9.7.1. Con: There might not be enough work to sustain a basic standard of living for most people when automation and the use of AI ramp up.
1.2.9.8. Con: Taking money from net producers, through tax, and giving it to net consumers is a drain on the net producers, thereby reducing the amount of production that can be invested in economic growth.
1.2.10. Pro: Those who have [multiple citizenship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_citizenship), could receive a UBI in a wealthy nation, then spend it in a poor country with a low cost of life. That would be a leak of capital and labour from the rich country to the poor one.
1.2.10.1. Con: In order to receive a UBI, it may be required to live in the country where it is offered and to have a permanent residence for 6-8 months.
1.2.10.2. Con: While this is a slight economic bad from the rich country's perspective, this seems net-good from an overall-happiness perspective. That money is likely to go further in improving quality-of-life and provisioning for the citizen in the poorer country, and may also meaningfully boost quality of life for the people who sold him things.
1.2.10.2.1. Con: If too many people move from affluent countries to developing countries, it could increase the overall cost of living and is therefore negative for the local populations.
1.2.10.3. Con: This case \(and the related case of "double-citizenship double-UBI income"\) can likely be handled via government agreements about what benefits and taxes apply to multiple-citizenship persons, and what multiple-citizenships are permitted.
1.2.10.4. Pro: Many people do something similar when they retire abroad. They chose to go to live in countries with a cheap cost of living and there they can have luxury with their pension which would be small compared to the cost of living in their home country.
1.2.10.5. Con: It is unlikely that those that can afford to travel internationally would receive a significant portion of their income as UBI.
1.2.10.5.1. Pro: [In 2017, the average US outbound traveler](https://travel.trade.gov/outreachpages/download_data_table/2017%20Profile%20of%20US%20Residents%20Visiting%20Overseas.xlsx) spent $1,476 outside of the US as part of a trip for business or pleasure \(cell C402\). The average length of stay abroad was over 16 days \(cell C206\). The average household income of international travelers was $127k \(cell C477\).
1.2.11. Con: A UBI allows labour to be more effectively allocated across entire economies.
1.2.11.1. Pro: A UBI will allow for a freer form of working where people can take jobs and pursue projects more directly related to their skills, while maintaining a stable standard of living while they wait on the fruit of their collective labors.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: A lack of need may inhibit innovation by diminishing people's motivation to create new things.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Con: Inventors tend to come from [rich families](https://qz.com/1167332/data-shows-us-inventors-arent-just-good-at-science-they-come-from-rich-families/)(If you want to be an American inventor, you’ll need two things: to excel at math and science, and to have a rich family.\n\nFive economists tracked over 1 million inventors from birth, and discovered several startling things. Children of parents from the top 1% of income are 10 times more likely to file a patent than the bottom 50%. White children, across all family incomes, are three times more likely to invent than black children. Only 18% of all the inventors are women.) and privleged backgrounds, not poor ones.
1.2.11.1.1.2. Con: The necessity there referenced is a task that is undoable, or needs to be done better, not a lack of means in general. For example, projecting ones voice thousands of miles almost instantaneously was impossible before the invention of the telephone, and being able to eat won't make working in the dark easier, but a light-bulb will.
1.2.11.1.1.3. Con: Or it may create the free time for a motivation or inspiration which would otherwise be repressed and ignored until it fades \(due to higher - or higher-seeming - priorities\) to instead be pursued.
1.2.11.1.1.4. Con: The need for food and shelter is only one need that might spur innovation. Other needs will arise when this most basic need is removed and hence encourage further innovation.
1.2.11.1.1.4.1. Pro: Climate change is an existential problem. The necessity to solve this problem may spur innovation regardless of the economic conditions of those who try to innovate.
1.2.11.1.1.5. Con: Innovation is not necessarily an inherent good.
1.2.11.1.2. Con: This outcome can be achieved with a more traditional unemployment insurance scheme.
1.2.11.1.2.1. Con: Not all types of work are covered by these schemes. Non-traditional pursuits in music, writing and art do not have a quantifiable average income which can be addressed.
1.2.11.1.2.2. Con: Traditional unemployment insurance schemes lose many people through the cracks and are easily exploitable.
1.2.11.1.2.2.1. Pro: It only saves people from the stress of poverty after poverty is already present. Economic stress produces compiled anxiety in a household due to education costs and requirement for more loans and credit.
1.2.11.1.3. Pro: A UBI affords people the time and financial freedom to diversify their skill sets.
1.2.11.1.3.1. Pro: UBI allows young incoming workers to the economy the time and money to first figure out what they truly love to do and are gifted at so, when they do enter the workforce, they are happier and much more productive over their 40-plus years of employment.
1.2.11.1.3.2. Con: Some people will not use this time to diversify their skill set.
1.2.11.1.3.2.1. Con: It is up to each individual to choose, whether or not they want to work more, educate themselves or to do other things. It is the same today: some people work, some study, and \(like it or not\) some stay home on a welfare program.
1.2.11.1.3.2.2. Con: Some people may not use this time to diversify their skill-set, however, it is unclear whether it will be a significant percentage, enough to negate the benefits of those who would.
1.2.11.1.3.3. Con: Such extra skills will be worthless if people do not apply them, for example, on a job.
1.2.11.1.3.3.1. Con: This assumes that the only things that add worth to society are jobs. Volunteers in many fields seem to disprove this.
1.2.11.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Volunteers may do a lot of good, but jobs do the most for economic growth.
1.2.11.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Our economy is driven by people working: people can't afford not too. Thus while jobs are the engine of the current economy, that doesn't speak to the possibility of an alternate economic system in which volunteer work forms the basis of work.
1.2.11.1.3.3.2. Con: A "skill" that provides recreation has the benefit of increasing morale regardless of whether it provides an economic benefit or not.
1.2.11.1.3.3.3. Con: In a time of exponential technology growth, it is unpredictable what jobs will exist in the future.  As people explore their previously-untapped skills \(such as creativity\), they could very well invent a job that's needed, rather than waiting for a government or corporation to discover that need.
1.2.11.1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.7.
1.2.11.1.4. Pro: Without the burden of basic material survival, individuals have more time and energy to consider the wider issues relating to their jobs. This tends to lead to innovation, as well new possibilities. Freedom from material want allows space for perspectives to change in such a way that benefits society as a whole.
1.2.11.1.4.1. Pro: UBI would foster innovation by freeing people from toiling to meet basic needs.
1.2.11.1.4.2. Pro: One of the first thing large companies do for desirable employees is take money off the table by providing them with an income that allows them to be free from worry in order to pursue the objectives of their jobs. By expanding this to the general public, and taking away the worry of basic housing and nutrition, it allows for creativity and realization of potential. Most people will get bored of sitting around and doing nothing.
1.2.11.1.4.2.1. Pro: Universal Basic Income merely is Capitalism that doesn't start at zero dollars. It starts with food, shelter, and health.
1.2.11.1.5. Pro: Put another way it's [Seneca's barbell](https://plasubtil.wordpress.com/2014/07/23/antifragile-chapter-ten-seneca/) strategy. UBI's the cost of an option that protects from the downside of extreme harm \(the absorbing barrier of destitution\) and so affords the freedom \(survival and time\) to engage in activities that may bring upside to do more than merely survive. Conceived this way, you set a level that allows not only for the basics of healthcare, shelter, and food; but is additionally structured for the skills acquisition that upside depends on. Redundancy? Absolutely.
1.2.11.1.6. Pro: A UBI would promote a more motivated, productive workforce in employees free to choose work according to their talents, interest, or prospective benefits rather than taking something just to survive.
1.2.11.2. Con: The UBI would decrease the incentive to stay on top of changing market conditions and develop the skills and personal savings needed to stay productive and self-sufficient because the guaranteed income provides a fallback option in the event that one becomes unemployed and financially depleted.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: This is false for individuals who are intrinsically motivated to work in a sector, which the economy values above UBI.
1.2.11.2.2. Con: This claim is only true if people are happy to take a hit in their standards of living due to not earning additional money.
1.2.12. Con: Many top economists support introducing a UBI.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Widely respected economists, such as free market capitalist [Milton Friedman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM&t=50s), were in favor of a basic income guarantee in the form of a [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman#Social_security.2C_welfare_programs.2C_and_negative_income_tax) and saw it as having positive effects on the national economy.
1.2.12.2. Pro: Winners of the economics Nobel Prize have [endorsed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2017/08/31/top-economists-endorse-universal-basic-income/#5647098715ae) the implementation of a UBI.
1.3. Pro: A UBI is the most effective and efficient wealth redistribution system.
1.3.1. Con: Current welfare systems are already highly efficient.
1.3.1.1. Pro: [Compared to current welfare systems](https://thespinoff.co.nz/featured/31-03-2016/i-love-the-idea-of-a-universal-basic-income-but-heres-the-problem/), introducing a UBI either means cutting the benefits of current recipients by more than the amount of the UBI, or adding the UBI payment to non-recipients to the total cost.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: For the UBI to not leave the most needy welfare recipients worse-off it would need to cover the costs of overlapping entitlements, which would cost far above the poverty line — [up to $22,000 in the case of New Zealand](https://thespinoff.co.nz/featured/31-03-2016/i-love-the-idea-of-a-universal-basic-income-but-heres-the-problem/).
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: An 'affordable' UBI that does not fully replace the existing targeted means of welfare distribution \(i.e. one that is supplemented by other targeted schemes\) retains many of the existing issues with poverty traps, inefficient distribution and high costs.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Empirical evidence shows that at [least 90%, if not 99%, of the capital used](http://www.cbpp.org/research/romneys-charge-that-most-federal-low-income-spending-goes-for-overhead-and-bureaucrats-is?fa=view&id=3655) for American welfare systems goes towards the beneficiaries.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: In 2015 13.5% of the U.S. population lived in poverty \([U.S. Census](http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/p60/256/pov_table3.xls)\). This shows that currently existing welfare programs, while efficient, are not doing enough.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Welfare programs are not intended to provide more than basic needs.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: The fact that current welfare programs are \(supposedly\) inefficient does not mean that a UBI would be more efficient.
1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: The fact that poverty still exists does not mean that existing welfare programs are ineffective. This is somewhat similar to saying that laws against murder "are not doing enough" since some murder still occurs.
1.3.1.2.1.4. Con: Poverty rates were declining decade over decade before the expansion of social welfare spending. Since the creation of the welfare state and its associated safety nets, poverty rates have ceased to decline in the US. This suggests that welfare has a harmful effect on poverty rates, and the answer is to provide less of it, not double down with a UBI. [Poverty rates - 1950 to 2015](http://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/failed-war-on-poverty.jpg)
1.3.1.2.1.5. Pro: Universal Basic Income is an important step towards eradicating World Poverty. People are poor not by choice. For example, people born into poverty, unable to find jobs, disabled & unable to work, etc., who therefore have no income or means of survival. On the other hand, there are those born with silver spoons in their mouths living in opulence without the need to work for an income. This is obviously "fated" and beyond the individual's control; "fate" has obviously not been fair. Needs action.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: While the efficiencies of the current welfare systems are already high, that doesn't mean they couldn't be more efficient.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: With that high level of efficiency it is possibly less risky and costly to try something else than to further upgrade current system.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: The main issue addressed by the [grandparent claim](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1634.1730) is the misconception that traditional welfare programs are highly inefficient. It does not need to prove that traditional welfare is more efficient than UBIs; rather, the parent here needs to suggest that UBIs are more efficient than traditional welfare—and quantify that improvement, to the extent possible.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: Even if the majority of the capital goes towards the beneficiaries, the money may not be being spent very effectively.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: [The Politico article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/20/how-san-francisco-turned-its-tenements-into-treasures-215391) seems to suggest that the public-private partnership system was a successful case of targeted/means-tested housing subsidies/benefits.
1.3.1.2.3.2. Pro: Technically speaking most of the money spent on [public housing](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/20/how-san-francisco-turned-its-tenements-into-treasures-215391) goes towards the beneficiaries, but results in very poor quality housing compared to housing offered by the private sector for the same cost.
1.3.1.3. Con: Existing welfare systems have burdensome sets of conditions and application processes. A UBI would remove these burdens.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: '[Workfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workfare)' programs require people to participate in cheap labour or volunteer work. This is a form of modern day [slavery](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-simon-duffy/workfare-is-modernised-slavery_b_2773051.html).
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: These conditions can include [urine drug testing to access welfare checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_testing_welfare_recipients) or weekly [unscheduled visits](https://www.gov.uk/dwp-visit) at the homes of welfare recipients.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: No explanation has been offered as to why this is "unfair" or "unreasonable"; on the contrary, many people would consider it reasonable \(at least on the surface\) that one must undergo periodic drug tests in order to receive government support.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: Targeted welfare programs are superior to a UBI.
1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: A UBI affords choice and agency to individuals to make economic decisions that targeted welfare programs cannot give them.
1.3.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Choices can be facilitated in a variety of other ways. For instance, [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher) and [housing](http://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/policy-basics-the-housing-choice-voucher-program) vouchers can be used to increase the choices between government services for poor individuals.
1.3.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Vouchers still limit choices to government approved options and dictates about how much people should spend on specific things. A UBI provides a higher level of agency.
1.3.1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The most direct and efficient method of facilitating choices in a society is through a common currency exchanged for goods and services within a free market environment.
1.3.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Government has greater access to research institutions and therefore macro-level information. This can be used to manage inter-generational dynamics better than an individual is able to.
1.3.1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: For instance, moving young children into better areas has little effect on their parents, but massively improves their [expected earnings](http://scholar.harvard.edu/hendren/publications/effects-exposure-better-neighborhoods-children-new-evidence-moving-opportunity). Thus parents may be reluctant to move without information about how their futures will be affected, which governments are better placed to access.
1.3.1.3.3.1.2.2. Con: Macro-level information is useful for setting macro-level policy that impacts numerous groups. Less so for micro-level decision making where individual circumstance and chance play a massive role in resource distribution.
1.3.1.3.3.1.2.3. Con: Macro-level information is costly to collect and often goes out of date soon after it is made available.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3. Con: It is disingenuous to claim that money is equivalent to choices. Behavioural evidence shows that people tend to be risk loving, discount expected losses, and are [unable to conceptualise distant future benefits](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-poor-economics/). Often this results in people wasting money on unwise purchases.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: Money is equivalent to choice, as in many cases people can purchase goods or services that actually influence their own future choices towards wise outcomes. For example, the wealthy spend a lot of money purchasing [commitment devices](http://messymatters.com/akrasia/) that enable or incentivise self-control, such as medical insurance or a personal trainer.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3.2. Pro: People treat losses as less likely to affect them adversely than they actually are. This is why people drive drunk and choose not to wear seatbelts, when the rational choice is to do neither of these things.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3.2.1. Con: This is highly subjective. There is no actual evidence suggesting most people would take those risks.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3.3. Con: This is more likely to happen in situations where people are encouraged to think short term, and have no stability. People are more likely to consider long term impacts when they know their basic needs will be provided for as long as they make wise decisions.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3.4. Con: The behavioral evidence cited above has been contradicted numerous times, including in the science study referenced in [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/your-brain-on-poverty-why-poor-people-seem-to-make-bad-decisions/281780/) article, which notes that poverty and the lack of stability causes bad decision making rather than it being an innate characteristic.
1.3.1.3.3.1.3.5. Con: Money enables individuals to invest in education. Education extends occupational possibilities and choices.
1.3.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Allowing recipients to select their own providers can save money on contracting and oversight for the companies selected to provide traditional welfare services.
1.3.1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: It also allows for competition in service quality even when offering services to the less wealthy.
1.3.1.3.3.1.5. Pro: Welfare benefits are often tied to a specific situation, which means that getting out of that situation results in the loss of those benefits. This can trap people in their situations. Conversely, a UBI allows for any change in circumstances without threatening such a loss.
1.3.1.3.3.1.6. Pro: In order for a state to provide housing, education and food for everyone, there would be needed a partly socialistic system, which althrough the history has been proven to not work. On the other hand, a state that supports private industries to help people with food, housing and education would be more viable.
1.3.1.3.3.1.7. Con: A UBI will dismantle not-for-profit essential welfare infrastructure like public food storage & distribution. This will lead to conflict and strife during times of shortage and waste in times of plenty.
1.3.1.3.3.1.7.1. Con: People freed from the requirement of performing paid work \(or provided with additional income\) by the existence of a UBI may - and many likely will - choose to devote their time and/or spare finances to altruistic or charitable projects, bolstering not-for-profit services.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8. Pro: Targeted programs are inherently paternalistic, insofar as they assume that the government is better suited than the disadvantaged themselves at making decisions benefiting their well-being.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1. Pro: People are best at making economic decisions for themselves, as they know their own needs and circumstances and can thus better account for where to direct money.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.1. Con: People tend to underestimate their future needs and often struggle to plan ahead. This is especially true when it comes to saving for future health problems because people often do not take seriously the possibility that they will be affected.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.1.1. Con: National health care will still exist under a UBI model.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2. Con: Dominant members of households can misuse UBI payments to further their own needs instead of providing for their families.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.1. Con: This problem can apply to any family with capital of any kind.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: The same is possible with welfare checks.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.2. Con: Considering everyone would be receiving the same UBI, it would be difficult for any individual in a family to totally abuse their power and waste money in a way that wouldn't be obvious to other members of their family.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.2.1. Pro: With a UBI, housewives will have their own money and no longer be completely dependent on their partner's salary.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.3. Pro: There is less accountability for how one uses income comparted to conditional grants or particular items.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.4. Pro: [Analysis of Canadian expenditure surveys](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0335.00148/abstract) found that the gender of the recipient of a marginal increase in income predicted whether or not that income would be used to finance child care. This suggests that women should be targeted with grants to more efficiently improve social welfare, rather than everyone receiving equal incomes.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.4.1. Con: The analysis is made with data from 1992, it is possible those gendered divisions have changed after more than 20 years.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.4.2. Pro: In the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \(NREGS\) in India female [NREGS](http://www.usc.es/economet/journals1/aeid/aeid14213.pdf) income goes towards children, while male income does not \(at least in the proposed categories, i.e. clothing and footwear\).
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.5. Pro: Often income would go into a shared bank account for a couple living together. Targeted welfare can often more easily reach women or children directly.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.3. Pro: The needs of people are not static and there are unexpected costs that occur \(e.g. fees for a child's school trip\). Allowing people themselves to account for these changes is better.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.4. Con: Targeted welfare, such as providing conditional or item-specific benefits, is not mutually exclusive to the poor also receiving cash grants.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.4.1. Con: Some cash grants are not equivalent to a complete unconditional cash grant that offers full agency to those making decisions and not just partial agency.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.5. Con: It is very easy for governments to analyse consumption patterns and account for seasonal changes.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.5.1. Con: This kind of research is useful for analyzing broad trends, but it is inadequate for addressing different families with different circumstances and challenges.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.2. Con: Most targeted programs only make minimal assumptions about the needs and desires of the disadvantaged: they provide things such as money, food, and childcare that are of universal value.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.3. Pro: Welfare programs provide benefits designed for the average person who uses welfare. Most people do not reflect the average and have diverse needs, which can be better met by individuals making their own choices.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.3.1. Con: Most welfare programs, as a baseline, provide money to those in need. Money can be used by people to purchase what they need, regardless of what those needs are.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.4.1.
1.3.1.3.3.1.8.3.2. Pro: A UBI helps decentralise the management of funds by allowing more local involvement in the process.
1.3.1.3.3.1.9. Pro: A UBI shifts purchasing power from the government to individuals, thereby incentivizing what people to purchase what they actually want rather than what the majority wants them to want.
1.3.1.3.3.1.9.1. Pro: Targeted welfare programs empower government busybodies to tell poor people how to live their lives.
1.3.1.3.3.1.10. Con: A UBI may be misused by the lower income population due to a lack of expertise in household financial management.
1.3.1.3.3.1.11. Con: This also affords UBI recipients the ability to exhaust their entire income on addictive substances \(sugary foods, alcohol, drugs, etc.\) which is why no one supports a full replacement of all social programs with UBI. There is no evidence that I am aware of that suggests that human beings make rational decisions when their incomes rise.
1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: In some countries, governments guarantee a percentage of their salary to people who have been fired from their job. Often, that is a rate that would far exceed that of a UBI. This gives unemployed people of all incomes enough of a buffer to handle jobless periods.
1.3.1.3.3.2.1. Con: The duration of these guaranteed salaries is limited. A UBI would provide a source of income indefinitely.
1.3.1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Most targeted unemployment benefits have time limitations. Across Europe, only Belgium guarantees unlimited unemployment benefits. In other countries, the benefits last from 3 to 24 months for a worker with 22 years of contributions \([European Commission, pg. 5](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/2015/unemployment_benefits_20151126.pdf)\).
1.3.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: [In Germany](https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/germany/working/unemployment/unemployment-benefits)(If the claimant has no children, they receive 60 percent of their previous net earnings. If caring for children under 18, this rises to 67 percent.), the government guarantees those eligible for unemployment benefit at least 60% of their previous salary.
1.3.1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: However the high percentage of the former salary is only provided for some months. Afterwards the affected individuals experience a significant downgrade in payments.
1.3.1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Unemployment [programs](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/2015/unemployment_benefits_20151126.pdf) in some European countries offer around [75%](http://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-page/official-issues/benefits/unemployment-benefit/requirements) of their last earned income rate for 1 to 2 years.
1.3.1.3.3.2.4. Con: These programs operate like an insurance scheme - people must have been earning a salary in the first place, and thus contributing to taxation.
1.3.1.3.3.2.5. Con: This is only true for people who meet certain criteria, such as having officially worked at least 6 months out of the last 12 or having worked at their last job for at least 3 years. Also: these benefits are usually cut off the second this person accepts a job - any job, even one that pays 10 times less than the "poverty line".
1.3.1.3.3.3. Con: Targeted welfare programs incentivize people to be able to qualify for the program \(e.g. not working\). This kind of incentive is generally dysfunctional, as are countermeasures to address the dysfunction. UBI addresses this problem by eliminating all qualification criteria, thereby making it neutral with regard to dysfunctional incentive.
1.3.1.3.3.4. Pro: Welfare programs have the advantage that they can direct welfare spending in order to promote positive choices by the recipients. Because a UBI provides direct cash payments this is not possible.
1.3.1.3.3.4.1. Con: [The vast majority](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no) of welfare recipients spend the money they receive responsibly.
1.3.1.3.3.4.2. Pro: Food vouchers can be used to direct the spending of the poor towards improving their diet and away from harmful choices such as drugs or alcohol.
1.3.1.3.3.4.2.1. Con: Even targeted assistance programs only place soft limits on spending. Any assistance that can be used to purchase goods \(ie food stamps\) [can be easily sold on a black market](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/19/food-stamp-black-market-rise/).
1.3.1.3.3.4.2.2. Pro: At-risk families will tend towards addiction and spend a UBI on marijuana, drugs, alcohol and/or cigarettes. This would make these type of families more dependent on Social Services, costing the government even more. Funding like food stamps for all, is better as it restricts purchases to certain socially agreed tradable items. However recipients can still work and so earn money to purchase luxury items.
1.3.1.3.3.4.2.2.1. Con: There is no factual base for such a claim. [evidence](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-myth-of-welfare-and-drug-use) exists to [support](http://ifyouonlynews.com/politics/nine-myths-the-right-loves-to-believe-about-welfare/) that [claims like this are myths](https://groundswell.org/7-lies-about-welfare-that-many-people-believe-are-fact/)
1.3.1.3.3.4.2.2.2. Con: Replacing various government assistance programs like SNAP with UBI allows for greater efficiency in distributing money. Instead of having to get government housing assistance in one place, food purchasing assistance in another, unemployment assistance in another, etc, one simple system would address basic income needs.
1.3.1.3.3.4.2.2.3. Con: To draw specific attention to something mentioned elsewhere on here: research by the federal government tells us that the percentage of people on welfare who are on drugs is about the same as in the U.S. as a whole. While many people imagine that people on welfare are more likely to be on drugs, that does not bear out in the research.
1.3.1.3.3.4.2.3. Con: Non-perishable foods can be sold or bartered away, although typically at a loss relative to the store price. Thus, the effect that food vouchers have on poor people who would buy drugs or alcohol over food is that they spend even less on food and even more on drugs than if they'd just had money to spend how they wanted.
1.3.1.3.3.4.3. Pro: Welfare programs often offer direct rebates for purchases that aid in securing employment, such as buying professional clothes or repairing a car need for a commute.
1.3.1.3.3.4.4. Con: Unlike targeted welfare, the point of UBI is precisely to empower people financially and spend such money freely, not being forced to follow a specific worldview as to which spending is positive and which is negative.
1.3.1.3.3.4.4.1. Pro: It is not the role of the government in a free society to direct the life choices of its citizens, so long as those life choices do not infringe on the rights of other citizens. The point of UBI is that the citizens themselves, and not the government, are better at deciding how their aid money can be best spent to most efficiently help their lives.
1.3.1.3.3.4.5. Pro: Cash disbursements have a tendency to be misused. It would be better to address societal problems more directly to make sure the money is used for positive outcomes.
1.3.1.3.3.4.5.1. Con: This claim contains no proof that its suggested methods would be any more effective than the provision of a UBI.
1.3.1.3.3.4.5.2. Con: Providing a UBI does not prevent any of these things from being implemented, and may in fact allow more time for individuals to provide labour to such causes.
1.3.1.3.3.4.5.3. Pro: People's basic needs can be addressed directly by providing soup kitchens, night shelters, used clothing distribution, free schooling and free healthcare.
1.3.1.3.3.4.6. Con: The government can still influence the spending by taxing undesirable items, such as cigarettes or alcohol, less favourably.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7. Pro: Society has the principled right to build paternalistic incentives into its provision of welfare, since welfare is funded through taking away money from the rest of the taxpayers and giving it to a particular person. As such, taxpayers should be able to impose conditions on the receipt of that money.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.1. Pro: In Australia, parents who refuse to [vaccinate](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/asia/australia-anti-vaccination-welfare-cut/) their children can lose up to $11,000 in benefits a year since this refusal is not supported by taxpayers or public policy.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.1.1. Con: There is no reason why a UBI couldn't have basic requirements attached to them, such as vaccinations, schooling, and other public health and safety needs.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.1.1.1. Con: Making UBI contingent on people obeying government mandates, no matter how reasonable, compromises the universal part: there's a real risk of it becoming the government paying people to make certain choices and not others.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.1.2. Con: People refuse vaccines, use drugs, or contribute to various causes for reasons other than welfare. To punish those individuals by leaving them outside of the welfare system is a violation of their basic dignity.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.2. Con: Foremost society has a duty to help underprivileged citizens according to the basic human rights in the constitution, instead of a right to demand certain behaviors.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.3. Con: The structure of those programs is decided by people who have enough power to get a majority of the legislature to vote in their favor — and that is rarely the powerless. There's no reason to expect that such conditions, imposed by the powerful on the weak — would have the effect of protecting the weak from the powerful.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.4. Con: A UBI would not necessarily have to be funded by taxes. It could be funded by a sovereign wealth fund that is sustained with the proceeds of the use \(or abuse\) of our natural resources, eg mineral leases, public land forestry, fines on polluters. This money is our birthright, literally the “commonwealth” the founders envisioned.
1.3.1.3.3.4.7.5. Pro: When the rest of society grants money, charitably, to certain individuals, it is perfectly reasonable to design the conditions of that money to encourage the recipient to make socially optimal, rather than individually optimal, decisions.
1.3.1.3.3.5. Pro: According to the vast majority of experts, [replacing current welfare programs with UBI is a bad idea](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/universal-basic-income).
1.3.1.3.3.5.1. Con: This is a very biased survey, proposing to replace several essential services and valuable subsidies with a very low UBI. Many people who support UBI as a concept would vote against this particular proposal.
1.3.1.3.3.5.1.1. Con: The "very low UBI" in the proposal was roughly $13,000 per person. Across the entire United States \(assuming roughly 250M eligible recipients\), this would cost over $3,000,000,000,000 \($3 trillion\). 
If $13,000 is too low, it does not seem that anything "sufficient" would be affordable, as discussed by this [super-con.](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1634.1473)
1.3.1.3.3.5.2. Con: Policy effectiveness is a not a matter of voting. We rely on similar examples and previous studies to gauge the potential effects of new policies.
1.3.1.3.3.5.3. Con: This statement is misleading. A more accurate statement would read "A handful of experts don't agree that this particular version of a UBI would be successful."
1.3.1.3.3.5.4. Con: The thesis proposed in the survey tied UBI with elimination of basic public health insurance in the US. Health insurance is not a welfare program.
1.3.1.3.3.5.5. Con: This links to a relatively small panel of economists, not a sampling of all relevant experts across disciplines, making the wording of this claim highly misleading.
1.3.1.3.3.6. Pro: Many targeted welfare programs provide certain necessary goods \(food, medicines, education supplies\), unlike a UBI that will provide only money and will increase the number of things poor people need to worry about.
1.3.1.3.3.6.1. Con: Many welfare programs also offer cash that the recipients need to worry about distributing.
1.3.1.3.3.6.2. Pro: Poor people might experience anxiety from the necessity of managing money by themselves, as they were used to have a government providing goods for them.
1.3.1.3.3.6.2.1. Con: This is the same situation they'll be in when paid a wage.
1.3.1.3.3.6.2.1.1. Con: Even when being paid a wage the people may still be receiving some government benefits \(e.g. medicare\) that take some of the burden of budgetary planning off of the poor people's shoulders.
1.3.1.3.3.6.2.1.2. Con: Someone who is being paid a wage can be expected on average to be more fiscally/personally responsible than someone who is unable or \(perhaps temporarily\) unwilling to get a job. For example, someone may not be able to get a wage because they suffer from mental health issues—mental health issues which also may prevent them from budgeting well.
1.3.1.3.3.6.3. Con: Families know better than the state in which areas they need to spend, and in which they need to spend less.
1.3.1.3.3.6.3.1. Con: This assumes that individuals will generally act rationality, but this is a flawed assumption. Given this, "free range" money reasonably may not always lead to better provision of needs than traditional welfare.
1.3.1.3.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: Gambling is generally an irrational activity: it is empirically and theoretically known to \(occasionally\) be addictive, financially destructive, and mathematically illogical. Yet people still engage in this activity.
1.3.1.3.3.6.3.1.2. Pro: All people exhibit some degree of cognitive biases and other basic "thinking mistakes." One of the most notable is that of planning failure, as exemplified through procrastination. Another common example is that of the [gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy), which causes some people to inaccurately assess the probability of crucial outcomes. Other important examples include [egotistical and confirmation biases](https://www.inc.com/sam-mcroberts/7-cognitive-biases-that-are-holding-you-back.html), such as where we choose to believe something simply because we want it to be true.
1.3.1.3.3.6.3.1.3. Pro: Hard drug usage \(e.g. meth, heroine, crack\) is generally considered to be an irrational activity, sometimes brought on by misleading environmental information. For example, if someone is misled by friends or the general culture he lives in that the drugs are not harmful—or that the habit is sustainable and the pleasure outweighs the harm—then they may irrationally turn to such drug usage.
1.3.1.3.3.6.3.2. Con: The parent claim does not offer any empirical studies to support what it is claiming.
1.3.1.3.3.7. Pro: Traditional welfare programs allow governments to target specific issues in specific communities, a benefit that is not available with a UBI.
1.3.1.3.3.7.1. Con: UBI can [target poverty](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/universal-basic-income-is_b_10251176), whatever the cause. If specific communities are poor, they will be implicitly targeted by a UBI; but targeting them explicitly generates ill-feeling toward those communities.
1.3.1.3.3.7.2. Con: UBI allows for the government to be able to cover almost everyone's needs using only one system. Subsequent welfare programs that are smaller in size can then be established to help certain individuals.
1.3.1.3.3.7.3. Con: Politicians focusing intervention on specific groups fosters corruption, as well as making those groups beholden to the politicians that keep them under the focus of welfare.
1.3.1.3.3.7.3.1. Pro: Out of a pool of equally needy people, politicians have incentive to enter into a cooperative relationship with the most organized, most politically active groups: this would basically amount to people who can otherwise not get enough money being forced to vote for whoever promises to keep them on welfare, as well as leave out people who might be needy, but are not a part of one of these client groups.
1.3.1.3.3.7.3.2. Pro: Welfare programs are there to support low-income people. Low-income people are the most vulnerable to be controlled through a program grant. Giving the individuals the possibility of deciding how to apply their income would prevent polítical or sectorial interests from controlling those people.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4. Pro: There are groups in society who require more support from the state than others. For example, those with illnesses and disabilities who require specialised care cannot live off a small amount of money but have no ability to work to increase their income.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.1. Con: In every case except for those who are not physically healthy or able, the UBI will be sufficient for living expenses because that is how the amount is determined.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.1.1. Con: Cost of living differs drastically by region. For example, if a UBI in the United States is set at the poverty line, those who live in Manhattan will not be able to afford basic living expenses.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.1.1.1. Con: Initiatives like the [London Living Wage](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/london-living-wage) calculate how much more money people living in an expensive city need in comparison to other places. Although this is a voluntary approach for businesses, a similar compulsory measure could be included in a UBI.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This would result in uneven wages, giving people incentive to move into cities. This would compound itself over time, making it more expensive to operate and more difficult to fund.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.2. Con: The medical treatment of illnesses and disabilities is covered by health insurance. A UBI enables individuals to pay for theirs.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.2.1. Con: If an individual is allotted $10k a year worth of UBI payments, it would be not enough to cover health care costs in addition to daily living expenditures.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.2.1.1. Con: It would be $10,000 in addition to their employment income, which would be enough for people to afford most health care services.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.3. Pro: Groups with special needs, such as the severely ill or disabled, are able to get greater levels of assistance under targeted welfare programs than what a UBI would offer.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.3.1. Pro: Across [the many different welfare systems](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/which-best-countries-live-unemployed-disabled-benefits), disability payments either exceed or top-up existing unemployment/welfare payments.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.4. Pro: The loss of those extra support resources from targeted welfare schemes could lead to dire health problems for the chronically ill, who may no longer be able to afford adequate healthcare under private or increasingly privatized systems.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.5. Con: It is right to defend a system where the poor are no longer forced into government endorsed establishments. Most benefits are in-kind: only 24% of US government benefits are direct cash assistance where governments have the authority to dictate what kinds of products the poor buy and who they buy those products from \([Brenkman, p. 125](http://bien2016.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/BIEN2016_Sess4_Brenkman_en.pdf)\).
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.6. Con: In systems with no public universal healthcare, the fact that the UBI helps the poor pay for their health will create demand for clinics that offer rates cheap enough for low income earners to afford.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.6.1. Con: This requires doing so to be profitable, and it is not clear that even with access to a UBI, the poor in countries without universal healthcare - like America - would be able to pay enough to make opening low-cost clinics worthwhile.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.7.4.2.1.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.7. Con: Under a system of in-kind welfare, governments are responsible for responding to the needs of constituents where they often inaccurately underestimate the needs of those with chronic illnesses. Market incentives provide competition and choice to people who are diverse with differential needs.
1.3.1.3.3.7.4.7.1. Con: The market does not care about those who cannot afford their products.
1.3.1.3.3.7.5. Con: Overcoming shortcomings in certain areas, like infrastructure, is still a responsibility of the government regardless of whether a UBI is implemented.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: A UBI would fix the threshold and [poverty trap](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty-trap.asp) effects induced by the current means-tested schemes.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: Since it is universal, a person is free to raise their incomes without having to worry about losing their benefits. This fixes the perverse incentive that exists with traditional welfare programs.
1.3.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Welfare creates a "perverse incentive" not to work as, especially with low wage jobs, individuals can find themselves worse off. The UBI does not create this perverse incentive.
1.3.1.3.4.1.2. Con: The level of taxation that UBIs require would create an even larger perverse incentive not to work.
1.3.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: With a UBI, tax brackets can be adjusted, in order to produce incentives to perform work in the lower brackets.
1.3.1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: With an UBI in place, taxation can be applied more heavily to activities which are no longer performed by humans due to automation and AI proliferation, creating incentives for new and innovative human activities which are virtually tax free.
1.3.1.3.4.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.7.8.5.5.4.1.
1.3.1.3.4.2. Pro: Most existing means-tested anti-poverty schemes exclude people because of their complexity, or because people don’t know how to apply or whether they qualify. With a UBI, people currently excluded from benefit allowances will automatically have their rights guaranteed.
1.3.1.3.4.3. Pro: [The Speenhamland system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system) was a form of outdoor relief intended to mitigate rural poverty in England at the end of the 18th century and during the early 19th century. It was the first UBI experiment and it was at the time very successful.
1.3.1.3.4.3.1. Con: The speenhamland system \(Berkshire Bread Act\) was a welfare system, not a UBI. Poor families were given extra money by the parish to top up wages enough to buy bread.
1.3.1.3.4.4. Pro: Welfare is a system that is built to merely keep people on sustenance, and never provides them with the resources to pull themselves out of poverty.
1.3.1.3.4.4.1. Con: The alternative to a UBI is not just status quo welfare but rather using all of the money that would go towards a UBI to massively expand welfare. This means welfare could include things such as education, which would allow people to escape poverty.
1.3.1.3.4.4.2. Pro: Benefits received from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \(SNAP\) are [not enough](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/03/468955099/the-snap-gap-benefits-arent-enough-to-keep-many-recipients-fed) to keep most beneficiaries fed. Many families are still forced to visit a food pantry each month.
1.3.2. Pro: The reliability of a UBI, relative to other forms of welfare, allows the poor the ability to better plan and budget their spending.
1.3.2.1. Pro: A UBI can be spent in productive ways \(e.g. investing into a business\) that traditional welfare cannot. This creates social mobility.
1.3.3. Pro: A UBI helps reduce governmental, bureaucratic, and regulatory burdens.
1.3.3.1. Pro: UBI reduce administrative control on citizen life, by making help unconditional, hence removing administrative power through arbitrary decisions
1.3.3.2. Pro: UBI is possibly the most cost effective solution for addressing homelessness, poverty, and crime as the overall cost is less than the cost of policing, medical care and lack of opportunities induced by poverty.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: A UBI is a proactive approach to preventing abject poverty in the population, and proactive approaches are typically superior to reactive approaches. Studies have demonstrated [significant anti-poverty benefits](http://bassiounigroup.com/is-universal-basic-income-an-effective-way-to-eliminate-poverty%EF%BC%9F/) from the implementation of a UBI.
1.3.3.3. Con: Reducing government bureaucracy has a cost. Moving to a UBI system would put thousands of government employees, currently working in the welfare system, out of work. The transition will be difficult, and needs to be handled delicately.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Maintaining inefficient programs to preserve jobs will lead to a very inefficient society in the long run. The cost of a delicate transition period is a one time cost, whereas the cost of keeping people at work to support inefficient welfare programs is a continuous cost.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: The transition would be softened considerably by the new UBI program.
1.3.3.3.3. Con: At least some existing government employees would be needed to handle the logistics of the new UBI system.
1.3.3.4. Con: UBI is a centralized system therefore it is subject to the [single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure) problem.
1.3.3.5. Pro: A process applied to many people equally is a lot simpler than many independent agencies and laws coming into play for fewer people.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: It may be simpler, but some people do not deserve or need a UBI \(wealthy individuals, for example\). Filtering out fewer people - who are in actual need - allows them to get more of the available resources.
1.3.3.5.2. Pro: A UBI is simpler to administer and is therefore less prone to denying deserving people coverage because of bureaucratic inefficiencies \(delays, miscategorisation of people, and other barriers to access\).
1.3.3.5.2.1. Pro: Many people are unaware of the fact that they are eligible for government programs; for example the US [has more than $300 million in unclaimed pension benefits](http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/24/pf/unclaimed-money/index.html). This lack of information often prevents them from accessing their entitlements.
1.3.3.5.2.2. Pro: With a one-size-fits all income transfer there is less need for governments to waste resources tracking down issues such as welfare fraud or when people cross into higher income thresholds.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1. Con: A UBI is subject to fraud.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: In the US, [federal agencies](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/fraud-and-abuse) are often sloppy in their administration of programs, and Congress provides little serious oversight.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: A UBI is much easier to administer than other welfare programs — all it requires is that the government send a check. This has little margin for error or exploitation.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.2. Con: By the same argument, the military has documented waste in the billions, year after year. Yet it is tolerated in the name of the greater good.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: It is not well tolerated by some; there are plentiful criticisms of the American military, both inside and outside America.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.2.2. Con: This claim aides that the central government presiding over the military will have difficulties preventing UBI fraud if the same government wastes billions on other programs.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.3. Con: This is just as much an argument for no UBI as it is for a UBI. If there was UBI in the US it would be administered by the same flawed and inefficient system as current programs, which means that the same challenges would persist.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.4. Con: This is a systemic issue of congress and federal agencies, and shouldn't relate to UBI specifically. This is an issue which should be addressed regardless of subject matter.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.4.1. Con: If we accept that congress is sloppy, etc. then to say that we should implement this policy without first fixing said issue seems ill advised.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Using this argument we should stop building schools because some construction companies are corrupt.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.4.2. Con: We are discussing UBI specifically. The systemic issue existing does not detract from its affects on UBI and fraud.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.5. Con: Then the argument should be towards an improvement of program implementation, not the elimination of programs that benefit the people.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.1.5.1. Con: This discussion is about a UBI; however, and in the US, a UBI doesn't yet exist. So no elimination of programs is being considered. At this point it's more of a matter of the US shouldn't implement this program within a broken system.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: Fraudulent use of the funds could include people claiming the UBI payments of care-dependent or deceased relatives.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Deceased people can easily be removed from eligibility lists when they are registered as dead.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Care-dependent people still merit a UBI payment. If those providing their care are collecting it and spending it on their behalf - with their permission - it is unclear why this is a problem.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The problem is that the family members may not actually be spending it on behalf of the care-dependent; they may just be taking it for themselves.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This would constitute financial abuse, which already happens with present-day pensions and disability and care payments. It is a separate issue, not an argument specifically against the UBI.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It is an argument specifically against the UBI because prevention methods would be less effective with UBI. That is to say, even if stronger laws/enforcement against this kind of financial abuse are enacted, the introduction of a UBI would increase the amount of financial abuse by making it far easier and widespread/applicable.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: A UBI will incentivize certain people to have children irresponsibly so they can receive more money "for them".
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Deliberately claiming another's money and using it against their best interests would constitute domestic abuse, which would be penalized and thus disincentivized.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: This would mean that a parent who buys food for their child \(paid for partly by the child's UBI\) would be commiting domestic abuse, which seems absurd. In practice, a UBI would probably allocate a children's income to their parents until they are 18 or not living at home.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Irresponsible use of children's UBI payments by parents is too hard to police properly.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Only if you give the child's UBI to the underage child or to their parents, instead of having it held in trust until they're old enough to make decisions about it.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.3. Con: Parents as the legal guardians of their children will have the right to administer their UBI payments until the children are of legal age.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: And because this amount is unconditionally paid to everybody, also to children, a UBI creates an inherent incentive to give birth to many children. As legal guardians, parents can freely dispose of the children's UBI.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.2. Con: This same incentive also exists under traditional welfare programs, most of which provide additional benefits to dependents.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: People across Europe are massively abusing children's allowance systems like the [German one](https://www.thelocal.de/20180321/germany-paying-350-million-in-child-benefits-to-children-abroad).
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.3. Con: This is nothing but supposition.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.4. Con: A UBI is generally considered to be an amount that is paid to everybody, and everybody gets the same amount. It is not depended on individual circumstances.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.3.1.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.5. Con: A UBI incentivises individuals to pursue their own individual aspirations by eliminating the barriers of poverty. Those who no longer envision their lives as being stuck in a multigenerational cycle of poverty would be less inclined to limit their options through an accidental pregnancy and less inclined to see the benefit of having a child when they could pursue their individual goals instead.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.6. Con: The distribution for having children could be based upon the marginal cost of an extra child as determined by the poverty guidelines. This would greatly diminish this effect.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.7. Con: This is assuming that UBI payments would be sent to underage citizens in a way that allows their parents to abuse it, as opposed to \(for example\) being held in trust and issued as a lump sum upon majority.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8. Con: A UBI encourages more people to have children, solving the low birth rate problem that exists in many Western countries.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1. Con: Countries with relatively high Human Development Index \(HDI\) ratings experience a [demographic transition](http://www.economist.com/node/14164483): fertility \(defined as the number of children born by a woman over her lifetime\) drops from around eight to near one and a half. As a UBI would further increase the HDI rating of a country \(in particular the income per person aspect\) this trend is likely to intensify.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.1. Con: One explanation of this phenomenon is the extensive entering of women into the [the workplace](http://www.economist.com/node/14164483). A UBI would mitigate the need for a job and enable women to focus on their motherhood, if wished. This could raise fertility rates again.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.1.1. Con: This assumes women enter the workforce because they need to, rather than because they want to.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Exactly how many people enter the workforce because they want to? Since when is joining the capitalist system vs being a marginalized "poor" outcast, a choice? People who "choose" to work are already either enjoying some kind of unearned income, or have lowered their quality of life to conform to what little they may legally get for free in the system.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.1.2. Con: The financial independence would allow women to pursue individual enrichment, such as gaining education, a desired career, an artistic pursuit, or travel opportunities. This freedom will let them put off motherhood until they are financially secure; thereby reducing birth rates
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Motherhood can be considered among the many forms of individual enrichment a woman might pursue.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.1.2.2. Con: That is not the case if having more children would increase the amount of money they would receive.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.2. Pro: If rich countries generally have [lower](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) fertility rates, childcare costs are not the only [factor](https://evolution-institute.org/article/why-do-modern-people-have-so-few-children/) decreasing fertility and thus a monetary increase like a UBI is unlikely to boost it.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.3. Con: This claim indirectly implies we should avoid developing countries \(or reducing poverty\) in order to increase the birth rates. This is barbaric.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2. Pro: The lack of [financial resources](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/the-real-reason-were-not-having-kids/) is an important reason why many individuals hold off on having children. A UBI mitigate this issue and helps the affected individuals to fulfil their desire to have children.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.1. Pro: The [average child](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/the-real-reason-were-not-having-kids/) in the U.S. represents an investment of $304,500 from the moment of birth to the child's 18th birthday. This is a significant amount.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.2. Pro: In the USA [child-care costs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/06/the-staggering-cost-of-daycare-when-you-make-only-the-minimum-wage/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.f500cb489981) account for at least 30% of a minimum-wage worker’s earnings. In New York and Massachusetts the cost rises to as much as 80%.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.3. Pro: Surveys have shown that [European](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) women want to have two or more children \(2.36 on average\). While countries in north-west Europe approach that number, in southern Europe they do not. Government action in the former, through child benefits, tax breaks, maternity leave or nursery provisions, may be a key factor.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.4. Con: UBI contributes to the planet's biggest future problem, that of over-population. By removing the responsibility of being able to afford having children, it will lead to a vicious downward spiral of starvation and violence as more people compete for less and less life-sustaining resources such as food and water.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.4.1. Con: Birth rates are increased in poverty, not in abundance. Hans Rosling [spoke](https://youtu.be/2LyzBoHo5EI?t=898) about this topic.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.4.2. Con: Over population should be considered a serious problem but using financial positions to keep people from reproducing is perhaps an irresponsible approach. If we need to be careful with our population then that issue should be addressed directly and honestly and people should be informed of it rather than relying on an unrelated aspect of society to steer some people away.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.4.3. Con: Overpopulation is now being shown to be a[non-issue](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2017.html), people are very aware of it and have reacted without being prompted. There have been fewer births recently than in a long time.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.5. Con: That claim is very much contrary to the evidence of the people that have more children are generally low income.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.6. Con: It may not be a good idea for people who do not have moneymaking know-how or a sense of responsibility to raise children who would grow up to have similar traits.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.6.1. Con: In a society under UBI, "responsibility" would become far more diverse than simply "providing for yourself" and "not living beyond your means".
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.3. Con: The birth rate [isn't too bad](https://www.google.com/search?q=birth+rate+in+us&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS750US750&oq=birth+rate&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.13972j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). This assumes that finances are the main reason people don't have more kids.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4. Con: There is no reason to assume low birth rates would be a problem.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4.1. Pro: A birth rate below the replacement rate reduces human population \(without harming\), which is arguably desirable in this current state of overpopulation.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4.2. Con: A low birth rate in one area or cultural segment will lead that segment to disappear in the long term, hence being taken over by other ways of thinking or living.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4.2.1. Con: The disappearance of certain cultural segments is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4.2.1.1. Pro: The existence of certain cultural segments is not objectively good or bad for the society, therefore it is hard to argue with certainty that their disappearance will be bad.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4.2.1.2. Pro: Many cultural segments have disappeared along human history and it is hard to quantify whether this fact was detrimental to humanity as a whole in terms other than intuition.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.4.2.1.3. Pro: The disappearance of certain cultural segments and the appearance of new ones is one of the factors that enables cultural evolution.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.5. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.2.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.6. Con: The World population \(and US population\) are climbing rapidly. China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa are currently overpopulated, requiring significant food imports to sustain the population.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.7. Con: Lower birth rates might be a better way of conserving resources especially among those with greater difficulty with job retention strengths.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8. Con: The [annual cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child#United_States) of raising a child is likely more than a base income of, for example, ten thousand dollars. Welfare policies give benefits to parents, but that happens only because governments acknowledge the immense cost that goes with it.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.6.3.14.1.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8.2. Con: A UBI is not meant to cover all familiar needs, but gives an incentive to parents that otherwise could not afford raising a child only with their jobs.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8.3. Con: No welfare policy is given solely out of recognising immense costs. The government would not be financially incentivising something it does not want to encourage.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8.3.1. Con: Medicare and other provisions of healthcare are given out because the government recognizes the immense costs of healthcare for the elderly and disabled.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8.4. Con: Children would likely be included in a UBI. An extra income would cover many of the expenses related to a child.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.9. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.8.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.4. Pro: The existing high rates of [benefit fraud](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57091551) are an indicatation of how easy it could be to abuse a system like UBI.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.3. Pro: Fraudulent use could include people creating false documentation in order to get paid more than once.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.3.1. Con: In order to avoid overspending on fraudulent persons, there is an incentive to monitor for fraud more carefully.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: An incentive to monitor for fraud more carefully means a need for more bureaucracy, which is contrary to the claim that a UBI would reduce bureaucracy.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Similar kinds of fraud can exist in the current system; the parent does not explain why a UBI system would be more subject to fraud.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The incentives for identity theft/fraud are already strong in developed economies. It is unclear that extracting traceable regular, relatively small UBI payments will be more attractive than e.g untraceable one-off, high value credit card fraud.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.4. Con: UBI reduces the types of fraud possible to carry out identity fraud. This makes it much simpler and easier to fight than many types of fraud.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: Most countries have a national ID number, and UBI could certainly be implemented alongside a stronger national identification database.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.4.2. Con: It's easier to fake an identity, than to fake an identity and make it look qualified to whichever entitlement program is being defrauded.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5. Con: UBI is difficult to defraud due to being universal and unconditional.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: Whereas conditional income assistance can be exploited by taking the money without a genuine effort to move out of the program, a universal system has no such conditions and thus there is less room for exploitation.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: [In Kenya,](http://basicincome.org/news/2016/11/kenya-unconditional-cash-transfers-towards-unconditional-basic-income-randomized-controlled-trial-come/) the move from conditional to unconditional payouts is underway, and the effects are mostly positive, with little abuse of the system.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: A 12 year basic income experiment in [Kenya](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/kenya-village-disproving-biggest-myth-about-basic-income-2017-12) shows that people typically spend this money on necessities like education, medicine, and food.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: Because a UBI is unconditional, benefit fraud will likely decrease. The need to forge documents or misrepresent the truth in order to obtain benefits will become obsolete.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Because everyone knows exactly how much and how often they should be receiving their payments, there is almost no room for corruption.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.2.2. Con: Not obsolete - the room for fraud/corruption would be almost entirely limited to attempting to claim for another person - alive, dead, or fictional.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Which is likely still more easily uncovered than most welfare fraud committed today.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.2.3. Pro: UBI registration will encourage a more accurate population count, thus removing the need for an expensive census. The stringency of registration rules would affect the subsequent rate of fraud within the system.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.2.3.1. Con: The census data is richer than that collected via a UBI.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.3. Pro: Controlling one universal income which applies to everyone with no distinction is easier than multiple sources of financial help that depend on the person's characteristics.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.4. Con: All government benefits are subject to fraud, including a UBI. Therefore, no government benefit program should exist, including UBI.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.4.1. Con: Ignoring the plight of large numbers of poor people can lead to rioting and other disruptions of peace.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.4.2. Con: While it is impossible to eliminate fraud from government benefit programs, the problems that would arise form eliminating them are much worse than the cost of keeping them.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.5. Con: The universal availability and equal distribution would actually make it more susceptible to fraud, because there's less scrutiny so it's easier to just invent a fake identity and collect multiple payments. With the current entitlement system, in addition to creating the fake identity, you have to make that fake identity look eligible for the entitlement.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.7. Con: [Blockchain](https://futurism.com/the-first-blockchain-based-universal-basic-income-experiment-just-launched/) can be used to set up a transparent, immutable UBI system, that can be verified by anyone. [Grantcoin](http://www.grantcoin.org/) is an example of an UBI project that runs on the blockchain. It has been running for more than a year.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.7.1. Pro: Part of the answer to the problem of income inequality and meeting basic human needs will come from technology. Block chains could be a cost effective platform to create better mechanisms for managing public welfare spending.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.7.2. Con: Implementing UBI on a blockchain would need to go together with major social education and implementation of matching payment methods.
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.7.3. Con: Blockchain contracts are also vulnerable, and can fail in spectacular ways. [A hacker stole $31 million of Ether.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-hacker-stole-31m-of-ether-how-it-happened-and-what-it-means-for-ethereum-9e5dc29e33ce)
1.3.3.5.2.2.1.8. Pro: UBI replaces many social welfare programs with central administration. This process streamlines transfer payments, it also creates an slush fund for demagogues. A diffuse & complicated system is difficult to suborn. A centralized source of patronage payments creates an irresistible and attainable slush fund for machine-politicians.
1.3.3.5.2.3. Pro: Means-tested benefits often [exclude many](https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/jan/14/means-testing-benefits-not-efficient-fair) who are in need of support. Since a UBI is universal, those who need the money most would receive it.
1.3.3.5.2.4. Con: That ease comes at the cost of inefficiency of expenditure. The best system would efficiently spend money \(allocate it where it is most needed\) and assume it gets there \(eliminate bureaucratic efficiencies\), but logistical errors in a system do not warrant an entire systemic overhaul.
1.3.3.5.2.4.1. Pro: Allowing individual \(distributed\) decision-making provides for the money to flow where it is most needed \(in the recipient's informed opinion\), since the recipients of the UBI stipend will decide how to spend the money.  If the money is most needed in adjacent communities/sectors from those where it was initially disbursed, market forces will eventually drive the UBI money in that direction.
1.3.3.5.2.5. Con: Assuming that even a minimal level of currently existing welfare programs need to remain, the existence of a UBI disincentivizes the state to quickly reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies.
1.3.3.5.2.5.1. Con: Having fewer welfare programs allows the state to focus on making them efficient instead of having to spread its attention across all of the currently existing programs.
1.3.3.5.2.5.2. Pro: The presence of a UBI will demand government attention directed to implementing it. This means that less attention will go towards making other social welfare programs more efficient.
1.3.3.5.3. Pro: A UBI is cheaper to administer than existing welfare systems and thus frees would-be bureaucrats to contribute to the economy and thus wastes less money.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Current welfare systems are [complex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268176421_Complexity_in_welfare_systems_governance_and_the_changing_borders_of_the_third_sector_researching_two_local_multi-sectoral_partnerships) and fragmented between a range of issues and services. This necessitates \(and has resulted in\) a significant [bureaucracy](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/9/6/899569/-) which is highly cost ineffective and reduces the proportion of the welfare budget that is actually distributed.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: In Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, roughly [90 million euros is given in welfare, but it costs 16 million](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/dutch-city-utrecht-basic-income-uk-greens) euros to run the bureaucracy.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: If the UBI replaces all other monetary welfare payments, it cuts related bureaucracy to zero, as it is transferred completely automatically to everyone every month.
1.3.3.6.3. Con: Even if welfare systems are overly complex, it does not necessitate UBI, which may come with unknown issues, as a solution.
1.3.3.6.3.1. Con: While UBI might not be the only solution, it does have one big advantage: simplicity. It would apply to everyone, so no need for huge administrations handling huge amounts of paperwork, and people wouldn't have to 1-know that they can apply for it \(not always obvious, especially for isolated people\), 2-prepare complicated applications \(which once again can exclude the people who need the most assistance\), 3-wait for said applications to come through \(even though their need might be urgent\).
1.3.3.6.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.3.3.6.5. Con: A UBI could be rife with weaknesses compared to traditional welfare programs—or problems of its own—requiring a whole new \(i.e. unfamiliar\) bureaucracy. As a result, the supposed efficiency increases might be nonexistent or likely minimal at best.
1.3.3.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.
1.3.3.6.5.2. Con: In convention welfare programs, the primary function of bureaucracy is to verify means testing on a case by case basis. In the absence of means-testing, it is difficult to imagine any function for the hypothesized bureaucracy. Hence the most reasonable conclusion is that such bureaucracy would not need to exist.
1.3.3.6.5.3. Con: It 'could' be rife with weaknesses but need not be. For example, if you have a universal basic state pension scheme that kicks in at a certain age \(66 ish and rising in the UK \), then the only mechanism needed would be to reduce the age threshold.
1.3.3.6.5.4. Pro: A blanket dividend such as UBI struggles to account for geographical disparities in the cost of living. In some regions, recipients might receive proportionally too much or too little as compared to other recipients in other areas.
1.3.3.6.5.4.1. Con: People can choose where they want to live, balancing tradeoffs such as cost of living vs services available and lifestyle. A UBI would prevent government from implicitly subsidizing certain geographic areas.
1.3.3.6.5.4.1.1. Pro: UBI that offers a consistent federal income, rather than heavily location-based benefits, makes moving away from overcrowded and expensive cities more appealing to low-income people.
1.3.3.6.5.4.1.2. Con: The cost to move is finite. Unless a newly implemented UBI accounts for this cost, some people in high cost of living areas will be trapped.
1.3.3.6.5.4.1.2.1. Con: It would be up to an individual to work a job to earn the funds to make a move to a city with lower living costs where the UBI will carry more financial weight. Undeveloped regions would begin to grow as a result of this incentive.
1.3.3.6.5.4.2. Con: The amount of UBI individuals receive could be tied to the cost of living of the areas they live in.
1.3.3.6.5.4.2.1. Con: There is no support that a central regulating body would be capable of making such complex analyses; on the contrary, it seems unlikely that such regulating bodies would be capable of efficiently/accurately doing this.
1.3.3.6.5.4.2.2. Pro: Cost of living is easily and regularly calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)
1.3.3.6.5.4.3. Con: A UBI could account for geographic disparities in cost of living \(COL\) which would have the advantage of enabling people to move to cheaper areas with far less risk and allowing for income to be injected into areas with no current job market. UBI would therefore help alleviate COL disparities and create many new markets.
1.3.3.6.5.4.4. Con: UBIs would encourage people who can work remotely to move to areas with low costs of living. This could lead to a repopulation of neglected rural areas and take housing pressure off cities.
1.3.3.6.5.4.4.1. Con: People who work remotely already receive at very least a modest salary, therefore the incentive would already be there and not increased by UBI.
1.3.3.6.5.4.4.1.1. Pro: Without the UBI on top of their incomes, remotely working individuals have a higher incentive to move in low-cost areas.
1.3.3.6.6. Con: Current welfare systems may or may not be complex/fragmented and require more bureaucracy, but these extra costs should be weighed against the UBI's extra costs: money which is paid to the 100 million \(or so\) people who would already be well off without an income boost. These costs could easily be as high as $500 billion or more per year \(just assuming a mere $420/month payment\).
1.3.3.6.7. Pro: Navigating bureaucracy takes time that a person can better spend seeking employment, caring for others, in leisure or in the community.
1.3.3.6.8. Con: While UBI may simplify many forms of welfare, a system to provide additional means-tested benefits is needed. To be fair the UBI sufficient for a single home-owning person will not meet the needs of a single person with children having to pay rent. Not all the bureaucracy disappears.
1.3.3.6.8.1. Pro: UBI could replace the basic unemployment benefit but systems would still be required to provide other welfare benefits such as disability, child care, etc. The admin savings claimed may not be as great as claimed.
1.3.3.6.8.2. Con: Children would also receive a UBI.
1.3.3.6.8.3. Con: It would not have to eliminate other assistance.
1.3.3.6.9. Pro: Income redistribution agencies absorb about two-thirds to three-quarters of each dollar budgeted to them in overhead costs. Using government data, Robert L. Woodson \(1989, p. 63\) calculated that, on average, 70 cents of each dollar budgeted for government assistance goes not to the poor, but to the members of the welfare bureaucracy and others serving the poor. Michael Tanner \(1996, p. 136 n. 18\) cites regional studies supporting this 70/30 split.
1.3.4. Con: There are alternative policies that are superior and more efficient to a UBI.
1.3.4.1. Con: The existence of alternatives, even more effective ones, does not make a UBI a bad idea.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Choosing less effective and inferior solutions can be seen as a bad idea.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: If there are better alternatives, countries should provide those, not UBI. \(We are not discussing whether UBI is a good or bad idea, we are discussing whether it should or shouldn't be implemented.\)
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Many suggest that UBI would actually be [more successful](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/18/20919322/basic-income-freedom-dividend-andrew-yang-automation) if accompanied by other social programs.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: The UBI, when combined with other social programs, would result in even higher costs, including all of the negative consequences thereof.
1.3.4.2. Pro: A [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) \(NIT\) refund is equivalent to a taxed UBI, but more cost-effective.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Even though the negative income tax would be more cost-effective, it has other major disadvantages.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: If implemented in a country where tax returns are awarded once a year, a negative income tax will provide this source of welfare in one lump sum once a year.
1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Relying of single lump sum payment to provide support for an entire year results in a difficult budgeting challenge for people who may already have difficulties in that area.
1.3.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: A welfare system paid in a lump sum may not adequately help an individual who experiences a sudden change in their financial situation.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: A negative income tax only helps lower-income members of society, whereas a UBI helps more of the middle class.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1. Con: A negative income tax can in theory be designed to have very high thresholds for when income taxation begins. For example, such a policy may not even begin taxation until $100,000.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: As the labour market in society is becoming increasingly automated, the lack of jobs would make a negative income tax ineffective.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: The lack of jobs has little impact on the effectiveness of negative income taxes: negative income taxes [do not](https://smartasset.com/taxes/negative-income-tax-explained#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20qualify%20for,it%2C%20regardless%20of%20employment%20status.) \(necessarily\) require someone to be employed to receive benefits.
1.3.4.2.2.2. Pro: Automation and the increased use of technology [affects](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation) the whole socio-economic spectrum from low to higher-income professions.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: As many as [45%](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation) of the activities individuals are paid to perform can already be automated by adapting current technologies.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: It has been estimated that [47% of US jobs are at risk of automation](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) by 2040. There is no way for the law of creative destruction to catch up. The great depression hit its height at 30%, and UBIs are the only feasible solution to keep money flowing through the economy while we adapt.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: In 2016, 45% of [McDonalds](https://www.thestreet.com/story/13511123/4/mcdonald-s-rolling-out-self-ordering-kiosks-in-europe-will-u-s-be-next.html) restaurants in Europe rolled out in-store kiosks to automate the ordering process. While convenient, the kiosks take the place of jobs with raising minimum wage costs.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Even creative domains are at risk of being automated.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: There is [software](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/this-news-writing-bot-is-now-free-for-everyone/) that generates texts and stories and it is already used by the Associated Press to cover [sports](https://www.poynter.org/2016/the-associated-press-will-use-automated-writing-to-cover-the-minor-leagues/419489/).
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: A supercomputer successfully created a totally AI based [movie trailer](https://phys.org/news/2016-09-supercomputer-world-ai-created-trailer.html).
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.2.3. Con: The current methods for creating art using an AI are based on pattern and rule recognition followed by recombination of preexisting data. Artificial Intelligence currently has no idea of context and cannot create art without specific human direction.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Between 2000 and 2010 the US lost 5.6 million [manufacturing jobs](https://www.ft.com/content/dec677c0-b7e6-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62) and 85% of these losses can be attributable to technological change \(mainly automation\).
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: Fast spreading new [technologies](https://www.ft.com/content/dec677c0-b7e6-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62) like advanced robotics or 3D printing will obviate millions of low-skilled jobs.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.5. Pro: In the [medical sector](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety) deep-learning systems are already more accurate than humans in classifying malignant tumors from CT scans, or wrist fractures from X-ray scans.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.6. Pro: A new software by JPMorgan \([COIN](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance?cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social)\) for Contract Intelligence is able to replace whole teams of lawyers and loan officers, interpreting commercial-loan agreements faster and with fewer errors.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.7. Con: [Very few occupations—less than 5 percent—are candidates for full automation today.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/A-future-that-works-Full-report-MGI-January-2017.ashx) A surplus of human labor is much less likely to occur than a deficit of human labor, unless automation is deployed widely.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.8. Con: The Frey and Osborne paper ["is a set of guesses with lots of padding to increase the appearance of 'scientific precision'.”](https://robotenomics.com/2016/07/28/new-research-fears-of-technological-change-destroying-jobs-may-be-overstated/) Researchers at the OECD analyzed the Frey and Osborne study and conducted their own research on tasks and jobs and concluded that: “automation was unlikely to destroy large numbers of jobs.”
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.9. Pro: It is estimated that [4 million jobs](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hello-self-driving-cars-goodbye-41-million-jobs-2016-09-15) in the US will be replaced by self-driving cars over the next decade.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.10. Pro: ATMs are substituting bank employees worldwide, the same as Home-banking is: nearly all done via technology.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.11. Con: That prediction of replacement is based on current day jobs and the probability of automation based on the predicted abilities of automatons, not other factors such as labor costs, automaton costs, market demand trends or future industries. Schumpeter's [entire creative destruction concept](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/the-evolution-of-office-technology-from-the-typewriter-to-the-tablet/) is one that explains exactly why such predictions and fears never measure up to actual real world outcomes.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Fewer than [5%](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation) of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. Thus, it is likely that positions will not entirely disappear, only the tasks and activities humans perform will change.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Technological progress occurs rapidly and what is not possible today could very well be possible in a few years.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.2.2. Con: As human-performed activities will be reduced, jobs will transform from full-time to part-time. This will result in lower wages and fewer benefits.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: About 60% of all occupations could see 30% or more of their constituent [activities automated](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/where-machines-could-replace-humans-and-where-they-cant-yet) with today's technologies.
1.3.4.2.2.2.1.2.3. Con: Occupations do not have to be entirely automatable to result in significant job losses. An occupation that is, for example, 60% automatable, is likely to result in employers reducing their staff in that occupation by 60% and reallocating the unautomatable work accordingly.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: UBI is necessary to combat the fact that AI will be able to do any task better than humans, physical and cognitive. Unlike the previous industrial revolution, both physical and mental jobs will be replaced.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Society will reach a point where general artificial intelligences will be able to learn at a faster rate than humans, thus rendering human labor inefficient and economically impractical.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: This can already been seen with IBM's artificial intelligence system, [Watson](http://time.com/4960778/computers-smarter-than-humans/). It has the increasing ability to learn and to solve problems that are too complex to maintain in the human mind.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.2. Con: The technological singularity is not a 'fact' at all. It is a hypothesised possibility of a future we might live in.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.2.1. Con: You don't require singularity to have most jobs replaced by highly specialized AIs.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.3. Pro: As AI increases, more and more jobs will become obsolete. UBI will only make sense at this point since the majority of people will not be able to make an 'honest' living anymore.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.4. Pro: A UBI would enable AI to do work that no longer should be done by humans - binary, repetitive, programmable. This frees humans to do work which is creative, exploratory, self fulling, voluntary, for remuneration of not is their choice as they have a basic income to fulfill basic needs.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.4.1. Con: This is pro is contingent on having efficient and useful AI tools to achieve a rational savings enough to create a universal income. Current machine learning allows us to have high level of sales development tools and makerting web software. While the advancements of ecommerce is a popular idea to suggest the removal of work forces and thus rationalize a UBI, there could be more jobs available for people to work that as a result of AI.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.5. Pro: This claim does not necessarily rely on the singularity but on the fact that as technology increases the productive capacity of each individual, there will come a time where two trends intersect- first a relatively small number of workers will be able to produce sufficient goods for society and second that there will be a significant number of people who are incapable of developing the skills needed to be economically viable. A UBI is needed if 20% of the population is not economically useful.
1.3.4.2.2.2.2.6. Pro: Consumers are also workers, so if there are no workers, there are no consumers. A UBI provides money to consumers to keep the economy going, when all the work is automated. The economy exists to provide goods and services to consumers, they are therefore the primary source of money in the economic cycle.

1.3.4.2.2.2.2.7. Pro: Google's Deepmind [won](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/15/18226493/deepmind-alphafold-artificial-intelligence-protein-folding) by a huge margin against all researchers in the annual protein folding prediction competition \([CASP13](http://predictioncenter.org/casp13)\).
1.3.4.2.2.2.3. Pro: UBI will become increasingly necessary as advances in technology render larger and larger portions of the population to be unemployable.  UBI would help us retain societal order, rather than mass unemployment causing chaos. [Humans Need Not Apply - CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)
1.3.4.2.2.2.4. Con: Policy acceptance is more dependent on perceived vulnerability than actual vulnerability. Insofar as most higher-income professionals do not view themselves at risk, they are therefore still unlikely to support a policy that they see as irrelevant to their interests.
1.3.4.2.2.2.5. Con: Executive-level jobs tend to rely on more transferable general management and administrative skills. It may be true that single-industry workers are most at risk of obsolescence if their factory closes down whereas professionals, managers, executives and technical occupations have comparatively less trouble transferring to a laterally-related field.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: A negative income tax achieves one of the goals of a UBI by cutting down the costs of welfare administration.
1.3.4.2.4. Con: Whether or not a negative income tax can be more cost-effective depends to a large extent on the individual countries and their administrative systems.
1.3.4.2.4.1. Pro: The negative taxation mechanism would not be 'cheaper' in the UK: We do not have 100% interaction with the Inland Revenue. The majority of people are taxed though their workplace \(PAYE\) and payroll deductions. Some, such as the self employed, do have direct interaction \(self assessment process, similar to the US \) . The unemployed have no contact at all. [www.economicshelp.org](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/inequality/tax_uk/) and [www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns) .
1.3.4.2.4.2. Pro: In the UK the cheaper way would be as though an 'early onset' pension. The 'channel' for paying it should be the pension department \(DWP \) that \(by virtue of a National Insurance link\) does have near-universal interaction with all people, unlike tax department \(HMRC\).
1.3.4.2.4.3. Con: Many countries have existing [revenue services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_service), and an NIT uses that existing infrastructure.
1.3.4.2.5. Pro: A UBI wastes resources by distributing funds to the already wealthy. A negative income tax does not have this problem.
1.3.4.2.5.1. Con: Under many methods of funding a UBI, the wealthy end up partially paying for it in the first place.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: Wealthy citizens will pay more in tax than they receive from the UBI.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1. Con: This tax would have been paid anyway, so should not be considered when deciding between a welfare/UBI system.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: If the UBI comes with new taxes implemented specifically to help pay for it, then those taxes would not have been paid anyway.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the new taxes primarily target wealthy people \(as opposed to being an across-the-board raise\) then the program is just a negative income tax in disguise.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Introducing new taxes involves its own set of costs that would need to be evaluated and balanced against the benefits of having a UBI.
1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Higher taxes can lead taxpayers to try to more actively [minimize their tax burden](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1211/how-taxes-affect-the-economy.aspx), resulting in stagnant or lower tax revenues.
1.3.4.2.6. Pro: Negative income taxes distort wealthy people's incentive to work less than a UBI does. Under a UBI, wealthy people are taxed at a percent of their income and then a flat amount is returned to them under the UBI. This makes their marginal tax rate higher than if they were simply subject to a NIT.
1.3.4.3. Pro: A [work guarantee](https://www.kialo.com/the-us-government-should-guarantee-every-citizen-a-job-24455.1) is preferable to a UBI.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: A work guarantee will help workers [retain](https://www.socialeurope.eu/job-guarantee-programs-careful-what-you-wish-for) their job skills they would otherwise lose if unemployed for long periods of time.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: A work guarantee would negate the ideal perspective of each individual determining their own meaning in life.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: People have different preferences in life, and given the vast amount of opportunities for different careers, it's principally wrong to deny them these opportunities. Some may want to be philosophers, while others might want to become biohackers or DNA-explorers.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: A UBI is not able to provide individuals with purpose, self-worth, or social contact. A work guarantee can do so.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Con: A UBI is preferable to a work guarantee because it allows people to define for themselves what they see as a sense of purpose, meaning in life, identity etc. whether that be work or something else which is most likely still useful.
1.3.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Currently unpaid roles such as parenting and caring for loved ones/family, would continue to be unvalued with a work guarantee. A UBI would give carers this sense of purpose, self-worth and social contact that they deserve.
1.3.4.3.3.1.1.1. Con: A UBI would not directly change the social status or recognition of unpaid family roles.
1.3.4.3.3.1.2. Pro: People will work harder and be more motivated when working towards goals they personally understand, identify with and/or see the value in.
1.3.4.3.3.2. Con: Looking at [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs), it becomes very questionable how a work guarantee is supposed to do better in providing purpose and self-worth to individuals.
1.3.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: [A 2015 UK survey](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom) found that 37% said no and 13% were not sure - when asked if they think their work makes a significant contribution to the world.
1.3.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: [A poll in the Netherlands](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom) concluded that 40% of respondents believed their jobs had no reason to exist.
1.3.4.3.4. Con: A work guarantee will create distortions in the economy by crowding out private-sector activity, which can reduce economic growth.
1.3.4.3.4.1. Con: The job markets are becoming smarter and are being based on big data. This will help find the 'right' job for everyone in the private sector.
1.3.4.3.4.2. Con: Many of the world largest employers are state-owned. The potential distortions created will be minor.
1.3.4.3.4.2.1. Con: The fact that government employers already have a huge impact on the economy through government monopolies in various sectors is no argument that even further government incursion into the job market will produce only minor distortions.
1.3.4.3.4.2.2. Pro: The world's number one employer is the [United States Department of Defense](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/photos/the-worlds-30-largest-employers-will-surprise-you/ss-BBKxFrN#image=31) \(2.87 million employees\).
1.3.4.3.4.2.3. Pro: [China's armed forces](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/photos/the-worlds-30-largest-employers-will-surprise-you/ss-BBKxFrN#image=30) are the second-largest employer \(2.35 million employees\).
1.3.4.3.4.3. Pro: Jobs provided by the government will destroy the purpose and efficiency of a free market.
1.3.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: If governments create many jobs for people that would otherwise do unpaid care work, there will be A LOT of care workers, many more than actually needed \(inefficient\) and private care institutions become kind of obsolete.
1.3.4.3.4.3.2. Con: There is no such thing as a purely 'free' market. National, federal, and local governments interfere with employment by subsidies, enticement, and taxation.
1.3.4.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: Governments are [lobbied](https://www.itif.org/publications/2018/03/26/how-ensure-americas-life-sciences-sector-remains-globally-competitive) to support sectors , [often with success.](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/the-uks-industrial-strategy)Therefore the conceptual free market does not exist. [US example](https://thewordenreport-governmentandmarkets.blogspot.com/2016/12/modern-day-mercantilism-donald-trump.html)
1.3.4.3.5. Con: A work guarantee does not help people who cannot work because they are disabled, ill, or a caregiver for a family member who is disabled or ill.
1.3.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.
1.3.4.5. Pro: A [participation income](https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/blog/opinion/what-about-participation-income) would be better than UBI.
1.3.4.5.1. Pro: If there is some requirement to contribute to society in some way \(work, volunteer, go to school, create art, start a business, teach, mentor people, join the military, etc.\), the government could use the program to encourage people to contribute to society in specific ways.
1.3.4.5.1.1. Con: If work is required for a UBI, it goes against the premise of a UBI which is provide a living wage for all without work needed. It therefore becomes a “fast track” of sorts to get a job. However, we currently have more positions available for work than unemployed. If the person wanted a job, the opportunities are available right now and a UBI wouldn’t be needed.
1.3.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Lack of social contribution is one of the biggest hindrances to a UBI. A Participation Income would prioritize self worth and self improvement while providing a support model.
1.3.4.5.1.1.2. Con: In Australia, the ratio of unemployed workers to jobs can get as high as [18:1](http://unemployedworkersunion.com/job-seekers-v-job-vacancy-data/).
1.3.4.5.2. Con: The government should not have the ability to determine whether someone is contributing to society.
1.3.5. Pro: A UBI can help tackle different types of inequality.
1.3.5.1. Con: Studies have shown that a UBI does very little to decrease inequality \([p.1](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UBI-ESG-Memo-082319.pdf)\). If implemented and inequality still remains, there is likely to be political unrest on both sides.
1.3.5.2. Con: Universal Basic Income would not completely address economic inequality because it would not change the fact that at least some higher end services and goods would be too expensive for somebody on such income to afford, such as private health insurance.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: A UBI may not eliminate inequality \(and total equality may not even be desirable\) but it will help to prevent inequality from reaching levels which create suffering, and create a safety net for those on the "short end" of the "inequality stick".
1.3.5.2.2. Con: The desire to have access to luxury products and higher end services are still good incentives for work.
1.3.5.2.3. Con: Universal health care would not require a health insurance for basic health services.
1.3.5.2.4. Con: The aim of the UBI isn't so that we can afford anything we wanted to, but that we would have every opportunity necessary to survive and succeed in life.
1.3.5.3. Con: People don't want to create financial equality for all \(as a UBI would provide\) but instead demand financial fairness, [where their efforts are rewarded and opportunities are accessible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/people-dont-actually-want-equality/411784/).
1.3.5.3.1. Con: UBI would not create financial equality for all, as those who worked for pay or sold desired goods, ideas, or services could earn money above and beyond the provision of the UBI. This would also allow for efforts to be rewarded and opportunities to be accessible.
1.3.5.4. Con: Without other policies, a UBI alone would not be able to address the structural causes of inequality.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: Having a UBI could reduce the political will needed to stop other welfare programs from shrinking or being discontinued. However, these other programs that would be necessary alongside a UBI.
1.3.5.4.1.1. Pro: The all-encompassing and comprehensive nature of UBI is unlike any other form of welfare \(which is much more targeted and small scale\). Given this, a UBI is likely to be seen as a complete solution to poverty and a replacement for current welfare policy.
1.3.5.4.1.2. Pro: Since instituting welfare programs requires political capital and public goodwill, a majority of which will be used instituting a UBI, it is unlikely that the general public will be sympathetic towards additional welfare programs if a UBI is implemented.
1.3.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: For those in the middle and lower classes, there is unlikely to be buy-in towards a system that also distributes money to wealthy individuals who are not in financial need.
1.3.5.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Wealthy people are able to meet their basic needs already. A UBI is not necessary for them to achieve adequate housing, medical care, education, or proper nutrition as it is with middle and lower class individuals.
1.3.5.4.1.2.1.2. Con: The money paid out to the wealthy through a UBI will be offset through increases in progressive taxes.
1.3.5.4.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: A UBI can be combined with shifting taxing schemes from income-based taxes towards capital-based taxes, which would increase the liquidity of money and ensure that capital has a reasonable return rate while also forcing those who own capital to invest it in value-creating activities instead of just "sitting on it".
1.3.5.4.1.2.2. Pro: The public is reluctant to fund welfare because our society has deeply ingrained the capitalist idea of rewarding individuals for effort and working hard. Hard work is seen as a virtue, and something deserving of reward, and those with wealth they have not themselves earned \(for example, the rich children of billionaires\) are vilified.
1.3.5.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: Rich people are likely to believe that those in poverty are receiving money for nothing. Even now, with welfare usually contingent on demonstrating that one is at least looking for employment, stigma against those who "leech off welfare" without contributing is rampant.
1.3.5.4.1.2.2.2. Con: It tends to be poor people who do not work that are discriminated against, while rich people, including [inheritors](http://www.executivestyle.com.au/heir-style-the-rich-kids-who-have-it-all-2xbt0) and rich children, can become idols.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3. Pro: In Switzerland, the concept of a UBI was rejected [by close to a 3-1 margin](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060&sa=D&ust=1479913397736000&usg=AFQjCNGl2VcGG-v8Z_Qa1w8vKXvWgh59Cw), reflecting how politically unpopular a UBI is, and how much it is likely to squander political capital towards welfare if instituted.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.1. Con: While Switzerland may have rejected the vote, 64% of Europeans in general were in favor of a UBI according to [a 2016 poll](https://daliaresearch.com/two-thirds-of-europeans-for-basic-income-dalia-ceo-presents-surprising-results-at-future-of-work-conference-in-zurich/).
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.2. Con: [A recent survey](https://futurism.com/survey-reveals-nearly-50-of-americans-favor-a-universal-basic-income/) in the US, a country known to favour free-markets and oppose government policy that could be construed as socialist, found that nearly half of Americans would support a UBI.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.3. Con: As Switzerland already has the second [highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita) GDP per capita, its interest in implementing a UBI is obviously lower than that of comparatively poorer countries.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.4. Con: Switzerland is an economically conservative country with a relatively small welfare system. More truly liberal countries such as Finland and the Netherlands are currently piloting the program with little backlash.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.4.1. Con: One concern brought to light by the [Finnish experiment](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/ubi-finland-centre-party-unemployment-jobs/) is that a person's allotment of the UBI replaces their state benefits, which are controlled by labour unions. A person may be loth to accept UBI and be blocked out of his/her union as a result.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: This a situation entirely unique to Finland.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.4.2. Pro: At the outset of the Finnish UBI experiment, [over half the population was in favour](http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/study_over_half_the_population_supports_basic_income_scheme/8583547) of the scheme.
1.3.5.4.1.2.3.4.3. Con: In the case of Finland, this is potentially due to the fact that their pilot program is only a 'partial basic income', available only to [unemployed](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-finnish-experiment/) participants, who would likely not oppose an influx of free money.
1.3.5.4.1.2.4. Con: Numerous additional welfare programs will ideally not be required under a UBI system. This model is intended to replace the fragmented and often inconsistent programs that states have in place currently.
1.3.5.4.1.2.4.1. Con: Effective use of welfare monies requires that individuals actually spend income on measures that improve their welfare. A UBI cannot guarantee this - which in the long run is more likely to perpetuate the social problem in question, compared to means testing or in-kind assistance.
1.3.5.4.1.2.5. Con: A UBI appeals [across the spectrum](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/) - for example, to liberals who see a duty to help those in poverty without putting unduly restrictive conditions on that help, and to fiscally concerned conservatives who object to the inefficiency and bureaucracy of current welfare systems \(Milton Friedman [supported a form of UBI](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/universal-basic-income/)\). Therefore, a UBI is unlikely to undermine sympathy for other welfare programs.
1.3.5.4.1.2.5.1. Con: Even though a UBI appeals to both liberals and conservatives, their reasons are mutually exclusive. Because conservatives would see a UBI as a strategy to replace most of the existing welfare state, it would likely undermine their support for other welfare programs, whereas for liberals, a UBI would supplement existing safety-net programs \(e.g. childhood education subsidies, comprehensive health insurance etc\).
1.3.5.4.1.2.5.2. Con: It is likely that the implementation of a UBI would be fraught with division over where the funds would come from. For example, conservatives may not want increased taxes and liberals likely would, at least compared to cuts to public services.
1.3.5.4.1.2.5.2.1. Con: That is also true for any budget or tax reform discussion in any given government, not something specific to a UBI.
1.3.5.4.1.2.5.3. Con: While many may claim to support a UBI in principle, when it comes to implementing such a policy and very real sacrifices have to be made in the budget, it is likely that these opinions will change. Decreases in funding towards institutions like education, or the military could prove very unpopular.
1.3.5.4.1.2.6. Con: Whilst it is true that there will be limited demand for most welfare programs, some programs without the stigma of poverty will likely still have sufficient political capital: e.g. funding for children with disabilities.
1.3.5.4.1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.7.2.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7. Con: Given that everyone receives something under a UBI, once normalised, it may actually increase the balance of political capital for welfare. Extreme cases would likely still have public support on top of the standard of living that a UBI guarantees for everyone.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.1. Con: This argument is premised on the notion that individuals' utility from the UBI outweighs the loss of utility from a higher tax rate and perceived infringement on their quality of life. Middle-class individuals might receive more UBI back from the state than they have to pay in taxes, but the perception that their hard-earned monies are being taken away does resonate with voters squeezed by the changing economy.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.1.1. Con: If a policy would financially benefit people, the government should work to fix people's perception of the policy instead of giving up on it.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.2. Con: UBI neglects political reality because wealthy citizens receive payments regardless of whether the system is in the self-interest of any beneficiary; whether it be bureaucrats, special interest groups, or voters. All political incentive is driven by the pressure of beneficiaries. Since there is no beneficiary, there cannot be any political incentive and thus a UBI will not be ratified.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.2.1. Con: There are people who will vote for a political entity who proposes to implement a UBI, whether because of personal self-interest, moral and ethical reasons, or other reasons entirely. The idea that people act purely out of self-interest is patently incorrect in practice.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.2.1.1. Con: Politicking is inherently immoral. Politicking does not include the dissemination of policies, so movements such as the abolishionist movement are exempt from this issue. UBI, however, does not fall into that category. Political voting is at least amoral. Therefore, there being a sufficient motivation among citizens for UBI on moral grounds is unlikely.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The moralities of the policies proposed by political parties and candidates do have an effect on which ones get voted for by citizens, so they are relevant.
1.3.5.4.1.2.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.7.2.
1.3.5.4.1.3. Con: Political will can be renewed and expanded rather than permanently depleted.
1.3.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: It is the role of the Citizens to demand from their government those services that ensure equity. A person with a severe disability requires extra services to ensure individual equity. Political will stems from the voice of the citizens who choose their representatives. Political will for a social welfare safety net will not be found in those who would seek to place the fate of citizens in the hands of the corporate class.
1.3.5.4.1.3.2. Pro: One a UBI has been passed the political will needed to do so will quickly renew \(as the policy becomes normalised\) and can then be used to support other policies.
1.3.5.4.1.3.3. Pro: If there continue to be deficits in the public economy that need addressing, such as daycare, or basic nutrition, or housing, then there will still be demand for targeted programs to support those societal needs.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4. Pro: Political events such as economic crises or right-leaning governments are inevitable and mean that the levels of welfare provided often follow a feast/famine cycle. Given this, a UBI provides a circuit-breaker solution that shores up some minimum level of support even as political will for welfare flucates over time.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: When existing welfare programs are cut or restructured, having a UBI in place will help tide over those affected until the new programs are implemented.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4.2. Con: A UBI can also be dismantled or reduced. This is especially problematic because a UBI would be, by far, the biggest welfare program.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4.3. Con: Once established, a UBI changes the structure of the economy and societal psychology, and therefore is a commitment. If then, at any point, some serious crisis pushes the government to cut the UBI, it may be a deadly twist for the economy and people.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4.3.1. Con: This is true, but at the same time the changes to the economy and societal psychology could equally push people to care more about each other's welfare, be more interconnected, and respond better and with a more united front to any given crisis.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4.3.2. Con: This argument applies to many other systems, like schools, firemen, police, social security, etc. That did not stop previous generations from creating those systems. There are cases around the world where these systems have indeed collapsed, with disastrous consequences; but the people recognize they are necessary and try really hard to re-establish them. A UBI would probably enter in that category if it is created.
1.3.5.4.1.3.4.4. Con: Unlike most welfare programs, UBI is easily reduced, altered, or removed entirely. All it would take to slash benefits for millions is altering a few numbers in a law code.
1.3.5.4.1.4. Con: The amount of welfare might decrease, but given that there is often a welfare gap that systematically excludes certain individuals even in the best versions of welfare, a UBI is a more equitable distribution of resources which maximizes overall welfare.
1.3.5.4.1.4.1. Pro: Even if it has more monetary weight, a UBI cuts bureaucracy costs and removes the disincentives to work that afflict many welfare systems.
1.3.5.4.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.3.5.4.2. Pro: A UBI would not address educational inequality, which is one of the [main drivers](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/choice-inequality-education-system-social-segregation) of inequality overall.
1.3.5.4.2.1. Pro: Those with less overall income would be still be less able to afford expensive high quality schools.
1.3.5.4.3. Pro: A UBI would not challenge the current oligopolistic structure of our economy, which would continue to create an unequal society.
1.3.5.4.3.1. Con: If automation is not a threat, but rather the way things are, then we should treat the symptoms of this economic system. A UBI is a way to do this.
1.3.5.4.3.2. Pro: A UBI would exacerbate the structural forces that drive inequality, by making a larger portion of the population unemployed and dependent on the government.
1.3.5.4.4. Pro: Despite the Seneca Nation paying [$8000 annually](https://ifstudies.org/blog/what-can-we-learn-from-native-americans-about-a-universal-basic-income) to each tribe member, unemployment, poverty and theft continue to rise.
1.3.5.4.4.1. Con: There are other factors involved in the underprivileged situations endured by many indigenous people, such as poor education and cultural integration.
1.3.5.5. Con: A UBI does not share wealth because it gives a portion of funds to those who are already wealthy. This does nothing to resolve financial inequality.
1.3.5.5.1. Con: While a UBI does not correct income inequality, it can create equality of opportunity.
1.3.5.5.1.1. Con: A UBI is not enough to create equal opportunities for both the poor and wealthy.
1.3.5.5.1.1.1. Con: There is a difference between equality of opportunity and equality of economic income. Equality of economic income would never be reached and would potentially lead to an economic paralysis, while equality of opportunity would be the incentive to make everybody participate in the work market.
1.3.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: The wealthy have educational advantages since they can pay for prestigious university tuition and tutors.
1.3.5.5.1.1.3. Pro: Members of wealthy families often have the opportunity to gather capital very easily in order to found a business or make investments.
1.3.5.5.1.1.4. Pro: Wealthy individuals often have networks with peers and good connections that make it easier for them to find jobs.
1.3.5.5.1.1.5. Pro: If only wealthy countries offer UBIs, then only wealthy countries will benefit, leaving poorer countries at an even greater disadvantage.
1.3.5.5.1.2. Pro: A UBI would provide people with a sufficient amount of money to allow everybody to have access to food, health, education and housing.
1.3.5.5.1.2.1. Con: Food, health & education - yes, maybe. But housing is a mostly fixed supply - regardless of how much money you give people, everyone cannot have access to housing unless there is more supply than demand. This isn't usually the case due to the inherent difficulty of creating new housing units.
1.3.5.5.1.2.1.1. Con: There are currently houses and units left unoccupied for economic reasons - and/or because the landowner prefers the loss of no tenant rather than the risk to their investment - in at least some countries.
1.3.5.5.2. Con: The rebate offered to the wealthy by a UBI is not of consequence given that those people pay more tax than they receive in government services. It is just effectively a slight change in their tax rate.
1.3.5.5.3. Con: The implementation of a UBI will most likely require tax rates to become more progressive overall, and thus levels of financial inequality will decrease.
1.3.5.5.4. Con: Because a UBI is a flat rate, the portion it gives to the poor could double their current income. To the wealthy it would only be a marginal increase. In relative terms this is a huge decrease in inequality.
1.3.5.5.4.1. Pro: This is referred to as the [diminishing marginal utility of income](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/12309/concepts/diminishing-marginal-utility-of-income-and-wealth/).
1.3.5.5.4.2. Pro: A person making $1000 and receiving a UBI of $500 would see their income increase by 50%;  a person making $10,000 and receiving a UBI of $500 would only see an income increase of 5%.
1.3.5.5.5. Pro: Giving everyone welfare, including the uber wealthy, is not the solution to problems with the way mean-tested schemes of welfare are calculated. The solution needs to be to change the way welfare is calculated.
1.3.5.5.5.1. Con: Removing the concept of "welfare" will go a long way to solving perception issues such as this. The whole idea of a universal income is that it is earned by one's place in society and is not a 'handout'.
1.3.5.5.6. Pro: A UBI would further increase the economic gap because the needy would use it for necessities and the rich would bank/invest theirs.
1.3.5.5.6.1. Con: A UBI would not be a significant increase to the finances of highly wealthy individuals, but would be a significant improvement to less well-off people - both those who would use it to eat and those who would use it to invest in owning their own home.
1.3.5.5.7. Pro: This means that minorities are still in the same socio-economic position they were before relative to the privileged in society.
1.3.5.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.5.4.
1.3.5.5.7.2. Con: This is an over simplification. When you have not enough money to make it through the month, your position is much more desperate that when you don't have money for leisure. To deny this basic comfort on the base of "relative wealth" is to forget that there is more similarity of experiences between poor people everywhere in the world than within the "steps" of a single social pyramid.
1.3.5.5.7.3. Con: Minorities are much better off when they have economic security.
1.3.5.5.7.3.1. Pro: Even groups who lack the social cohesion, self identification and social recognition of minorities will benefit from this. It will effectively surpass current efforts to increase the quality of life in the current narrative and support structure.
1.3.5.5.7.3.2. Pro: The idea of a UBI is that even the poorest would have enough money to cover basic expenses.
1.3.5.5.7.3.2.1. Pro: By choosing to work, they can earn additional income, which would be disposable income. This would never be possible without a UBI since all of their money would go towards making ends meet.
1.3.5.5.7.4. Pro: Minorities continue to experience a wage gap in the workplace. A UBI does not solve this discrimination.
1.3.5.5.7.4.1. Con: [Some feminists](http://basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf) see a UBI as an “emancipation fee”, and criticize the welfare state because they argue that it is largely based on a traditional model of male breadwinner and female housekeeper. They conclude that a UBI can be useful to overcome this form of discrimination.
1.3.5.5.7.4.1.1. Pro: A UBI is a way of reevaluating the economic value of the work women have primarily handled in the past, while also promoting the economic independence of women. UBIs are an “Emancipation Fee” paid to promote women’s liberation \([Katada, p. 3](http://basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf)\)
1.3.5.5.7.4.1.1.1. Con: UBI payments go to men as well as women, and regardless of contributions to housework, childcare, eldercare or other traditionally unpaid female labour.
1.3.5.5.7.4.1.2. Con: A UBI returns women to the home, and contributes to a backlash that runs counter to women’s liberation and independence.
1.3.5.5.7.4.2. Con: A UBI was never designed to — or claimed to — eliminate workplace discrimination.
1.3.5.5.7.4.3. Pro: [Gay](https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/evidence/PX0605.pdf) government employees in the US earn 8% to 29% less than their heterosexual counterparts.
1.3.5.5.7.4.4. Pro: [Transgender workers](http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/NTDS_Exec_Summary.pdf) experience rates of unemployment at double the rate of the general population due to firing, wage discrimination, or harassment. This has a negative impact on their income.
1.3.5.5.7.4.5. Pro: The [racial wage gap](http://time.com/4390212/race-wage-gap-pew-analysis/) in the US shows that Black men earn only 73% of white men's hourly earning and Hispanic men earn just 69%. These numbers have not significantly changed in 35 years. Its unlikely that UBI will change this.
1.3.5.5.7.4.5.1. Con: Improved social mobility due to reduced paycheck-to-paycheck budgeting allows them to find better and less discriminatory opportunities, and will help close this gap.
1.3.5.5.7.4.6. Con: If someone is not dependent on a certain job, they can choose more freely to walk away from workplaces where they are not treated fairly with less risk of endangering their means for subsistence.
1.3.5.5.7.4.6.1. Pro: The fact that labor would no longer be forced into sub-poverty conditions by an employer or else face starvation and social chastisement should they "fail to keep a job" will change the job market drastically and empower everyone.
1.3.5.5.7.4.6.2. Con: This wage gap disparity is widespread. The likelihood of a minority finding a job with fair wages in comparison to those not considered a minority is slim.
1.3.5.5.7.4.6.2.1. Pro: Despite some forward progress, [white men](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/) still tend to out-earn minority groups such as Black and Hispanic men, and all women.
1.3.5.5.7.4.6.2.2. Pro: Minorities often have [more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2017/05/17/minorities-who-whiten-resumes-get-more-job-interviews/#7d06c1ad7b74) obstacles to hiring, such as excluding any references to their race on their resume.
1.3.5.5.7.4.6.2.3. Con: Minorities will be empowered to become entrepreneurs and their representation in companies will increase as a consequence of UBI. This will assist in the correction of the indicated problem.
1.3.5.5.7.5. Pro: Minorities will still be locked out of certain employment opportunities for prejudicial reasons.
1.3.5.5.7.5.1. Pro: There are [many accounts](https://www.revealnews.org/article/when-companies-hire-temp-workers-by-race-black-applicants-lose-out/) of temp agencies hiring out with direct orders not to hire Black Americans, despite equal opportunity employment policies.
1.3.5.5.7.5.2. Pro: [Hiring practices](http://thelasource.com/en/2011/10/31/university-study-finds-prejudice-in-hiring-practices/) in Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto favored applicants with English sounding names over Asian sounding names.
1.3.5.5.7.5.3. Con: Whether or not this is true, this is no reason not to offer a UBI. If this is true it means we should be looking for ways to reduce this prejudice. It does not mean we should give up on other ways to help a given minority, i.e. it is no reason not to offer a UBI.
1.3.5.5.8. Con: -> See 1.2.7.8.5.
1.3.5.5.9. Con: Only by making UBI universal will the wealthier support the provision of such an income rise for the poorer. As the wealthier seem happy to pocket universal benefits too \(even when claiming to disagree with them\).
1.3.5.5.10. Pro: Wealth can be equally shared by effective taxation and welfare programs.
1.3.5.5.11. Pro: According to the [relative income hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_income_hypothesis), consumers make purchases and save money depending on their percentile position within the income distribution. A UBI may increase spending, but does not improve the income gap.
1.3.5.5.11.1. Con: This does not account for the fact that a UBI is a redistribution program. The money that goes to those who are poor comes from those who have more, so there is a difference in relative income.
1.3.5.5.11.2. Con: These two points are unrelated. Whether or not UBI will increase spending \(unclear\) has no bearing on the income gap, which it does address.
1.3.5.6. Pro: Most advocates of a UBI emphasize equality of opportunity, saying that “each person should have equal opportunity to pursue a conception of the good life” \([Allahyar, p. 8](https://www.academia.edu/8447710/Universal_Basic_Income)\).
1.3.5.6.1. Pro: It is difficult for the poor to improve their position without a basic safety net that provides reliable access to education and income. A UBI will provide this.
1.3.5.6.2. Pro: Experiments with UBIs [showed](http://qz.com/765902/ubi-wouldnt-mean-everyone-quits-working/) that teenagers put off getting part-time jobs to focus on school, leading to noticeable improvements in high school performance.
1.3.5.6.2.1. Pro: Dropout rates [fell](https://qz.com/765902/ubi-wouldnt-mean-everyone-quits-working/) in Dauphin, Canada after their UBI experiment.
1.3.5.6.2.2. Pro: [UBI experiments](https://qz.com/765902/ubi-wouldnt-mean-everyone-quits-working/) led to double-digit increases in high school completion among participating families in New Jersey, Seattle and Denver.
1.3.5.6.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.2.2.1.
1.3.5.6.2.4. Con: [Youth allowance](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/youth-allowance) fixes this same problem in a more targeted and efficient way.
1.3.5.6.3. Pro: Equality of opportunity is recognized as a [human right](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).
1.3.5.6.3.1. Con: No benefit can be guaranteed unconditionally to some without enforcing an unconditional obligation on others. Before distributing money as a UBI, all the money must first be collected, plus the overhead required to complete the redistribution process. When the cost of enforcing the transfer is included, UBI is negative sum and constitutes Legal Plunder, as defined by French economist Frederic Bastiat in his 1850 work, [The Law](https://mises.org/library/law).
1.3.5.6.3.1.1. Con: This assumes that all the production comes from human activities. This is already changing with automation and artificial intelligence, which would push most of the income toward activities which are not performed by humans and therefore removing one side of the equation defined by Bastiat.
1.3.5.6.3.1.2. Con: The idea that the UBI is always a negative sum does not take into account the fact that people with less money spend most if it, therefore it goes back into the economy. In contrast, much of the money from the top 1% is not put back into the economy since it is saved offshore, used to speculate in stock markets \(not natural market forces\) and to unfairly influence governments.
1.3.5.7. Pro: Implementing a UBI would reduce income inequality.
1.3.5.7.1. Pro: A hypothetical $12k UBI if implemented in the US would be [enough to reduce its Gini index](http://www.scottsantens.com/does-basic-income-reduce-income-inequality-gini) \(a measure of income inequality\) from 0.6 to 0.46; bringing it on par with that of the Nordic states.
1.3.5.7.1.1. Pro: A $12k per year UBI would cover a large portion of my survival expenses freeing up the time I presently use working to meet my basic needs, to do other more effective and self-actualizing things.
1.3.5.7.2. Con: Income inequality is not inherently bad because it provides good economic incentives. The promise that you can make it to the top if you work hard makes it more likely that people advance their economic position.
1.3.5.7.2.1. Con: These are the twin myths of meritocracy and trickle down economics, neither of which have ever been proven in a real world setting.
1.3.5.7.2.2. Con: If that were true, we would have miners and road workers as presidents.
1.3.5.7.2.3. Con: This asks people who know that they work hard long hours to accept that the only reason they are still in poverty is that they aren't working hard enough. Anyone who does not see the problem here is encouraged to go out, and try doing this directly.
1.3.5.7.2.4. Con: This argument asks us to ignore the sloth, and underhandedness characteristic of many, if not all, members of the upper class.
1.3.5.7.2.5. Con: The average person should ask if the reason they are not rich is due to a lack of trying, and evaluate the above claim based on their conclusion.
1.3.5.7.2.5.1. Pro: Investment is easier when one has greater access to starting capital and/or loans.
1.3.5.7.2.5.2. Pro: People who are already among the wealthy \(or who belong to families which are\) have access to information and strategies which are not commonly taught or provided to the lower classes. Even if they can eventually gain access to this information \(through courses, etc.\), it is not a routine part of their formative years and education.
1.3.5.7.2.5.3. Pro: The old adage of "it's not what you know, it's who you know" often proves true; growing up and/or living in wealthy circles makes one more likely to receive opportunities for further wealth.
1.3.5.7.2.6. Con: If this promise is a false promise, as there is reason to believe, it effectively amounts to deception at best and slavery by deception at worst.
1.3.5.7.2.7. Con: Income inequality is an inherently bad thing, as it leads to stress, relationship breakdown and crime amongst other things.
1.3.5.7.2.8. Con: The [great gatsby curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby_curve) shows that the greater inequality is, the lower social mobility is - so that even though there might be greater incentives, its actually much harder to get to them.
1.3.5.7.2.9. Con: People like all animals do not need to "better themselves". We need to have needs met such as food, water, community, etc.
1.3.5.7.3. Pro: Capitalism has a tendency to lead to the accumulation of capital into the hands of a few \([Piketty, 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century)\) leading to an inevitable stratification of income levels and the collapse of the middle class. A UBI is a way to redistribute wealth, stimulating consumer demand and businesses.
1.3.5.7.3.1. Con: UBIs tamp down support for more fundamental reforms like land redistribution, or like reformulating the economic system to reward something other than immediate self-interest. Previous welfarist proposals have been lauded by reactionaries as "[saving capitalism](https://www.hoover.org/research/how-fdr-saved-capitalism)". UBIs work the exact same way.
1.3.5.7.3.2. Con: Capital accumulation is not reduced by a UBI. By increasing [reservation wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_wage) and reducing the desirability of hiring workers, capitalists gain a justification to leave workers out of the market.
1.3.5.7.3.2.1. Con: A major redistribution between the population translates into a reduction of capital.
1.3.5.7.3.2.2. Con: By increasing the lowest wage which workers would accept, employers will expect workers to be highly competent and rigorous, stimulating work efficiency.
1.3.5.7.3.2.3. Con: Workers still need to be hired to fuel capitalism, so they cannot be left out of the market.
1.3.5.7.3.3. Con: Inequality can be reduced in less disruptive ways, such as by encouraging [inclusive growth](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEBTDEPT/Resources/468980-1218567884549/WhatIsInclusiveGrowth20081230.pdf) and economic participation.
1.3.5.7.3.3.1. Con: Income inequality being reduced in less disruptive ways does not solve for the root cause of inequality, but it rather runs the risk to lead to worse conditions where individuals can still use income inequality to oppress individuals that have a lower standard of living.
1.3.5.7.3.4. Con: The effect of stimulating consumer demand will be mitigated by the extent to which prices are raised by businesses.
1.3.5.7.3.5. Pro: Consumer demand isn't stimulated when individuals do not have the autonomy to spend how they wish. With a UBI, individuals can finally choose what to invest in.
1.3.5.7.3.6. Pro: When robots take over the jobs, people will still need money to buy the products robots are making. A basic income is a great idea because people have more free time to start a business or become an artist or what ever and start earning more money with the things they like to do in life, this way more money will be created for the government by paying taxes on the extra income they create!
1.3.5.7.3.7. Pro: The profit employers make by effectivization tends to go to people with an already high standard of living rather than employees which are in more in need of the profit - which could be implanted through fewer working hours with sustained monthly wage. The free market's inability to deal with this calls for wealth-distribution measures, such as a UBI.
1.3.5.7.3.8. Pro: UBI allows those who previously had no capital to participate in capitalist endeavours of enterprise. This is preferable than being excluded from it and forced to rely on others because of their lack of opportunity.
1.3.5.7.4. Pro: Studies show that Alaska \(the only state with UBI at present\) is also the state with the lowest financial inequality. In [2015 Alaska had the 2nd lowest income inequality, but today it has the least.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5wdb/only-state-free-money-alaska)
1.3.5.7.4.1. Con: Alaska may offer a poor case test. It’s geographical and demographic markers, may make the state too anamolous — too much of an outlier — to properly transfer to the US mainland.
1.3.5.8. Pro: Introducing a UBI would help reduce wealth inequality.
1.3.5.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.7.3.
1.4. Con: A UBI might erode the personal and societal incentives for financial responsibility, self-improvement, and hard work; at least for some people.
1.4.1. Con: Due to [modern technologies](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/332468) and high productivity, not every member of society must participate in the workforce in order to maintain decent living standards.
1.4.1.1. Pro: With current levels of technology, it does not take one person's work to feed another.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Consider a combine harvester reaping a field. It takes only one person to drive it, and a specialist to maintain it \(who also maintains other machines\). However, this field may produce enough grain to feed hundreds or even thousands. And while other work such as irrigation is also required to reach this output, that work is equally enhanced by technology, such as massive irrigation arrays.
1.4.2. Con: Once implemented, a UBI can be seen as a kind of inheritance we receive from society. Receiving an inheritance can not be seen necessarily as a disincentive for financial responsibility, self-improvement and hard work.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If this inheritance pays only for an individual's basic needs, they still might pursue financial responsibility, and should keep hard-working for reaching their desires, dreams, and aspirations.
1.4.3. Pro: When a basic standard of living is available to all, some people will not [contribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_fraud_in_the_United_Kingdom) to its upkeep. This creates [resentment](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QORW1i6XDKgC&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=welfare+resentment+surveys&source=bl&ots=CfzLza5DRM&sig=FgGV1gEjyqMN_IWkZonVnSGO82s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw9ZanoefWAhWJTrwKHfwVAyoQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q&f=false) within those who do contribute; an aspect of human nature that a UBI plays out on a much larger scale than alternative redistribution schemes.
1.4.3.1. Con: While this is a valid concern, one of the considerations when structuring a UBI would be to make the stipend [considerable enough](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/17/770962701/a-game-changer-andrew-yang-explains-how-he-d-give-every-american-1-000-per-month?live=1) to make an economic difference but not enough to be work replacement. It's not meant to be a livable wage.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Not every job contributes to the funding of the UBI, e.g., low-wage or part-time jobs are hardly taxable.
1.4.3.2. Con: Current implementations are certainly lacking for our observation, but the implementation in Alaska seems to suggest the opposite. It is wildly popular even though Alaska is incredibly conservative. [The APFC has been in place since 1980.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund) [A recent paper](http://humcap.uchicago.edu/RePEc/hka/wpaper/Jones_Marinescu_2019_labor-market-impacts-universal-transfers.pdf) found that the dividend has had no effect on employment rates and actually increased part-time work by 17%.
1.4.3.3. Con: If everyone receives a UBI, people overall will feel less resentment for those who receive UBI without contributing to society.
1.4.3.4. Con: Following this logic we should get rid of disabled people instead of trying to fit them in to society.
1.4.3.5. Con: People who have a good life do not have as much incentive to resent others, as they have less stress and thus less reason to seek a place for blame.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Resentment, stemming from jealousy, is a common human emotion which isn't eliminated by higher socioeconomic status. Crucially, the prominence of higher opportunity at a lower rate of investment fundamentally disregards the meritocracy of the traditional 'good life', which generates an exceptionally higher incentive for jealousy.
1.4.3.6. Con: The success of a policy should not be measured by what people think about those who benefit from it, but rather the benefit it provides to society. Given a UBI is an economic policy it's success should be measured by its economic benefit.
1.4.3.6.1. Con: It is also a humanitarian and welfare policy. This makes it a moral issue in a way most economic policies are not. It is a responsible government's duty to look out for the best interests of all its populace, whether they are wealthy and economically powerful or not. A UBI could be argued to be a way of doing so.
1.4.3.6.2. Con: A policy that creates widespread resentment could result in a net negative for society.
1.4.4. Pro: A UBI grows people's sense of entitlement and makes it harder for them to see the value of hard work.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Hard work can be intrinsically valuable because when one works hard, one builds self-esteem.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.6.3.14.4.
1.4.4.2. Con: Not everybody considers hard work as a virtuous value. For some, it is a sad necessity to be minimized.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: The puritan work ethic of modern capitalism propagates a harmful ideology that equates one's self-worth with their productivity and economic achievements.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: John Stuart Mill was an early advocate against the 'gospel of work'; that work should be considered just only if instrumental to some greater object; [not as an end unto itself.](http://abolishwork.com/2014/01/15/some-anti-work-comments-from-john-stuart-mill/)
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: If we had UBI we would be a lot more productive and creative as we would not have to worry about where our next meal was coming from nor would we be tied up in menial, soul-destroying labour simply to make others richer.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Con: One's worth to society is shown through how much they contribute to society. This is fair because the more one contributes to society, the more they get out of society.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Con: What is here said, and what is perceived are very rarely the same thing, even if it is not the intent to communicate these harmful ideas, the harm still occurs.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2. Con: There are innumerable contributions made to society that are not recognized monetarily.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Raising the next generation of children is often considered one of the [hardest jobs](https://www.motherhoodandmore.com/9-reasons-why-parenting-is-worlds/)(Being a parent comes with more responsibility and stress than any occupation, but there’s no paycheck, no seasonal bonuses, no monetary compensation of any kind. And generally speaking, the more time you spend parenting, the less money you make. There’s also no paid leave from parenting. In fact, much of the time, you have to pay someone else to watch your kids so you can have “time off.”), yet it is not paid.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In a super crowded world, having children is not a valuable contribution, it just creates another person to consume our limited resources. It shouldn't be endorsed.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Many individuals act as [unpaid carers](https://forwardcarers.org.uk/info-advice/are-you-a-carer/). In doing so they provide support and assistance to friends and family with physical or mental health conditions that would otherwise need to be paid for by the [taxpayer](https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/press-releases/facts-and-figures)(Carers save the economy £132 billion per year, an average of £19,336 per carer.).
1.4.4.2.1.2.3. Con: By that same logic we ought not care for the elderly and those unable to work, or tie down children with a social debt they have to pay off upon reaching adult hood.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: The richest value [working smarter](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/anthony-w-orlando/the-rich-arent-rich-becau_b_4791626.html), not harder. They leverage their time and skills in order to provide the highest output with less time, resulting in more time for enjoyable activities, or work if they choose.
1.4.4.3. Con: One's being rich achieves the same effect. Since we accept and encourage wealth in society, this would not be a reason to protest the implementation of a UBI.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Wealth is accrued as a function of financial responsibility, self-improvement, and hard work. Therefore, it can be assumed that those attributes have already been learned by the wealthy.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Many people are more wealthy than others due to their position of birth, not their efforts or abilities.
1.4.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: As of 2010, between [55-65%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/06/people-like-estate-tax-whole-lot-more-when-they-learn-how-wealth-is-distributed/) of wealth in the US was inherited.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: We do not accept and encourage wealth in society per se. Accruing wealth through theft, for example, is not encouraged. Rather, we encourage value provision, and use money as a tool to incentivize the provision of value.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: If \(net\) value is provided to individuals then, definitionally, value is added to the society that individual inhabits.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: Having wealth is not the same as earning wealth. One example where the two diverge is inherited wealth.
1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: It appears many people and countries feel fine about inheritances, which only incentivize "self-improvement and hard work" in the first dying party that built the wealth, not in subsequent recipients.
1.4.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: According to a [UK poll](https://www.gransnet.com/online-surveys-product-tests/inheritance-tax-survey), 42% of respondents believe that inheritance tax should be abolished immediately and 73% consider it a form of double taxation and therefore unfair.
1.4.4.4. Con: People are entitled to these things, because we should [own a share of the resources of the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Steiner%E2%80%93Vallentyne_school) that is ours in common.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: The wealth of a nation is predicated on common knowledge acquired over generations and is the proper inheritance of everyone.
1.4.4.5. Con: The UBI is an additional payment within a capitalist economic system. It does not change either the prevalent economic system or the incentive scheme.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: Existing studies suggest that one's incentive to work is not meaningfully reduced for recipients of a UBI \([p. 3](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24312.pdf)\).
1.4.4.6. Pro: UBI enforces the idea that people owe others just because they are the citizens of the same country.
1.4.4.6.1. Con: A nation cannot perform all of its necessary functions unless it requires its citizens to contribute money and/or labor to benefit some or all of its other citizens.
1.4.5. Pro: While a government introducing UBI seems to help the poor in the short term, in the long term it can harm them by removing the poor's incentive for them to work and develop their self-sufficient skills needed to provide for themselves in the long-term.
1.4.5.1. Con: The extra income a UBI provides is likely to encourage and potentially make it easier for individuals to improve their lives.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Hiring a financial planner can cost between [$1,000-$2,000](https://www.moneyunder30.com/when-is-it-time-to-hire-a-financial-advisor) to create a comprehensive financial plan. A UBI can help fund this investment, which can have a positive affect on one's overall finances.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: People are often forced to make [short-term decisions](https://medium.com/\@megha0111/how-scarcity-affects-the-decision-making-c891df0fd560) when their resources are scant. The extra income may allow them to plan for their future better.
1.4.5.1.3. Pro: People will have more time for self-improvement and education if they are not forced to seek money from employers to survive.
1.4.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.4.5.1.3.2. Con: Although the extra time "could" be used for productive activities such as self-improvement and education, not all people are willing to spend their free time for those.
1.4.5.1.3.3. Pro: The virtues of financial responsibility, self-improvement, and hard work apply to the goal of getting 100% employment in capitalism that is human-dependent. However, if the goal changes to 0% employment and complete automation, these virtues fail and new virtues would need to take their place to allow humans to still contribute or at least have a purpose.
1.4.5.1.3.3.1. Con: While "financial responsibility" and "hard work" may not be as useful in the future as they are now, it would be foolish to abandon them before we actually have the automated infrastructure to safely let them go as virtues.
1.4.5.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Yes, it would be foolish to let go of such virtues, but this could be tacked by, educating the masses on how to cope with the major shift and how to focus more on self development, now that they are free to do so.
1.4.5.1.3.3.2. Pro: UBI creates the space for "hard word" and "financial stability" to be replaced with "creative output" and "network solutions". Rather than amassing more things, we can strive towards a society that is highly resilient and self-sustainable. The churn of automation would be less of a threat, because more people would be safe to pursue self-employment.
1.4.5.1.3.3.3. Con: UBI is simply a mechanism to maintain the rich/poor divide and not an attempt to bridge it. UBI will only prolong a dependence on a financial social ranking. Society has surpassed the need to rank individuals by wealth however we/the world still rely on this outdated system.
1.4.5.1.3.3.3.1. Con: Not having money is maintaining the rich/poor divide. Ubi wouldn't change it completely, but it would at least give the people a chance to move up.
1.4.5.1.3.3.4. Pro: Hard work is not an intrinsic utilitarian or moral goal. For example, we embrace labor multiplying technologies such as tractors, dishwashing machines, laundromats, automobiles, and other tools and social systems that facilitate radical reductions in labor without a corresponding perception of moral failure or laziness.
1.4.5.1.3.4. Pro: Many people are interested in being productive or good at something for the [enjoyment of it](https://www.elitedaily.com/wellness/blood-sweat-tears-happiness/1259555).
1.4.5.1.3.4.1. Con: The things that people wish to be productive and good at are often different from those that pay well and contribute to tax revenue, which is why many people prefer their personal projects to those of work.
1.4.5.2. Con: A UBI would benefit those who otherwise struggle to finance themselves to work towards a greater goal.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: A UBI would be beneficial for those who fight for the environment's protection.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: A UBI would help NGOs that dedicate themselves to environmental protection, as they can save activists' salaries and thus have more available capital.
1.4.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: More people will be able to donate their time instead of just money.
1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: Citizens who are concerned about the environment will be able to donate larger amounts with the help of a UBI.
1.4.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Considering much of the redistributed income will go towards the poor, as the wealthy citizens' gain is marginal, it seems unlikely they will donate higher amounts to the environment. It is more likely they will spend the money on education, food, health care, and housing.
1.4.5.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Lower Incomes donate a higher percentage of income  than any other income bracket. The IRS’s 2011 Statistics of Income file on individuals who itemize on their tax return shows a relationship between total adjusted gross income and charitable giving as a percentage of AGI. Those with income between $100,000 and $200,000 contribute, on average, 2.6 percent of their income, which is lower compared to those with income either below $100,000 \(3.6 percent\).
1.4.5.2.1.3. Con: Many of the wealthy who donated or invested much of their income to the protection of the environment will no longer be able to do so because of the increase in taxes.
1.4.5.2.1.3.1. Con: If charity [donations](https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/overview) are fiscally [deductible](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions), a lot of wealthy individuals will still donate.
1.4.5.2.1.4. Con: Since a UBI enables a person to pursue basically any cause they want, it doesn't provide any special advantage to environmental activism.
1.4.5.2.1.5. Pro: A US study suggests that race, gender, and class can have an impact on environmental activism \([p. 40-41](https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/gtr534.pdf)\).
1.4.5.2.1.6. Con: Environmentalists may be more concerned with how [increased consumerism](https://www.fastcompany.com/40463533/a-universal-basic-income-would-do-wonders-for-the-u-s-economy) brought about by a UBI will negatively impact the environment.
1.4.5.2.1.6.1. Pro: Increases in consumerism can have [a negative influence](https://grist.org/living/consumerism-plays-a-huge-role-in-climate-change/) on climate change. Implementing a UBI may increase this influence.
1.4.5.2.1.7. Pro: Social workers and NGO workers, who are helping a lot of people, are paid very poorly for their meaningful work. This deters many people from entering the non-profit sector.
1.4.5.2.1.7.1. Pro: Governments are [investing less and less](https://books.google.it/books?id=JcPiBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298&lpg=PA298&dq=crisis+government+cut+social+aid&source=bl&ots=PUj8DMEcpk&sig=OEDtkapMpf1Efhh8BW8cXng47S0&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJoLnh563RAhVEVhoKHUnwApoQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=crisis%20government%20cut%20social%20aid&f=false) money for social aids, leaving to NGOs the important role to replace this obligation. A UBI would reward their work with governmental funds.
1.4.5.2.1.7.2. Con: A UBI does not make this work relatively more appealing, as the bonus income will equally apply to all jobs.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Activism for social causes is often harmed by a lack of income among their supporters.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: Many fear that if they get arrested at a protest, they will not be able to afford to [pay for a lawyer](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/06/10/what-it-can-cost-to-get-arrested-at-a-protest/). With basic income, more will be able to afford these costs.
1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: Many [fear getting fired](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/can-you-get-fired-for-attending-a-protest.html) from their jobs for participating in a protest. That fear would be less acute if people had a solid base of income to rely on.
1.4.5.3. Con: Forcing people to work under threat of starvation, homelessness, or death is barbaric.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: Once the state claims the rights over lands, water, and any useful resource, and prevent people to use those to survive, the minimum that the state could do is to provide the basic needs to its population.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Con: The basic needs of people differ on an individual basis. For example some people have need for medical treatment that is not needed or deemed as a basic need by most.
1.4.5.3.1.1.1. Con: This does not mean that the state should not provide things which are basic needs for all. Specific programs can also be put into place to address specific needs.
1.4.5.3.1.2. Con: The state does not claim rights over land, water or any useful resource. Individuals buy these resources and trade it among themselves, if the government truly owned these resources like they do in communist countries, than yes it would be the responsibility of the state to distribute these resources to their citizens
1.4.5.3.1.2.1. Con: In most countries, government legislation permits and manages the claiming, purchase, and sale of such resources.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: Starvation, homelessness, and death all happen in nature if one does not work towards obtaining resources for their own survival. Therefore, not providing resources for free isn't barbaric.
1.4.5.3.2.1. Con: Nature is barbaric - the point of a society is to do better than that.
1.4.5.3.3. Con: If people do not work for the food or land they are consuming, than they are actively consuming the goods produced by someone else without compensating that person. The state is not forcing the individual to work to eat food the state creates, the state is protecting the individuals right to sell the fruit of their labor to their neighbor and receive compensation.
1.4.5.3.4. Con: Forcing someone to work for food and then giving half of what they worked for to someone who does nothing is barbaric. Requiring that people function as adults and do their part to earn their own food is called participating in society.
1.4.5.4. Con: People are motivated to be productive by more than just money. After meeting basic needs, almost everybody seeks a sense of purpose, and of social value. Money alone is a poor way to achieve these.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: There has never been a time in human history where all basic needs have been met without having additional responsibility. Purpose has always arisen out of responsibility. Even before money was invented, purpose and societal value was found in cultivation and trade.
1.4.5.5. Con: Poverty does not provide an incentive to work and be productive; it is a barrier to it.
1.4.5.5.1. Pro: [The analysis](https://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/publications/india-basic-income-experiment/) of a UBI experiment in India indicates that a UBI in the long term increases the productivity and motivation of the recipients.
1.4.5.6. Pro: Humans are too complex to suggest that a UBI, untethered from providing value to society, would be beneficial to all. Some would benefit and find their own way to/continue to contribute and some would quickly devolve into hedonism and/or nihilism. This will include the lazy and unmotivated and also those whose upbringing and/or culture did not instill altruism or accomplishment as important values. It will create a self-perpetuating underclass.
1.4.5.7. Pro: A UBI will promote the false idea that there is such thing as a free lunch because people will constantly receive something for doing nothing. The renowned economist Milton Friedman wrote a book about how there is no such thing as a free lunch-[amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Theres-Such-Thing-Free-Lunch/dp/087548297X). A UBI appears to be ‘free’ but it will in reality be very costly, to one group or another.
1.4.5.8. Pro: A UBI promotes stagnation and irresponsibility among the poor. After welfare reform in the 90's limiting who could receive welfare, and making it more of a temporary thing poverty rates and unemployment rates fell. [Poverty & Unemployment Data](https://fee.org/articles/undeniable-welfare-reform-increased-work-and-reduced-poverty/)
1.4.5.9. Con: People in poor and uneducated communities already have a [low understanding](https://motivationgrid.com/rich-mindset-vs-poor-mindset/) of, and limited incentive or ability to implement, these factors into their lives, in which a UBI cannot erode any further than the level where they already are at.
1.4.6. Con: In the hypothetical case of [half the population](http://www.businessinsider.com/over-half-of-jobs-in-the-eu-at-risk-2014-7) or in some cases [two thirds of the population](https://futurism.com/un-report-robots-will-replace-two-thirds-of-all-workers-in-the-developing-world/) being at risk of job loss, a UBI reverses consequences that weren't linked to either good or bad choices. In such a scenario, even many of the productive and responsible would benefit from a safety net.
1.4.7. Con: Some people might be highly internally motivated by psychological and/or sociological factors, rather than purely due to external factors. Therefore, a UBI is less likely to substantially change their behavior.
1.4.7.1. Pro: People have other incentives for self-improvement, such as obtaining a sense of accomplishment or mastery.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: A UBI would allow us to think about other options than financial incentives like personal growth and benefits for society.
1.4.7.2. Pro: The thesis presupposes that human beings are primarily motivated by their own consumption. However, humans are primarily motivated by an existential calling. After all, one would not be interested in sustaining their life if it did not have [meaning](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-meaningful-life/201807/search-meaning-the-basic-human-motivation) for them.
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: Most people do not consider the meaning or purpose of their life to be to accrue wealth, and instead accrue wealth in service of other goals.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: Many people undertake volunteer work.
1.4.7.3. Pro: One's productivity is not [dependent](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/why-the-gap-between-worker-pay-and-productivity-is-so-problematic/385931/) on money, which a UBI provides, but rather [happiness](https://inside.6q.io/5-great-reasons-why-happiness-increases-productivity/) and [supply and demand](http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/price/factor-of-production-demand-and-supply/3889). Thus, a UBI wouldn't necessarily lead people being less productive.
1.5. Con: Providing a UBI may create harmful political consequences.
1.5.1. Pro: A UBI increases the risk of a [tyranny](https://quillette.com/2017/10/09/universal-basic-income-threat-tyranny/) of a diminishing minority responsible for wealth creation, while the majority will have no leverage to mitigate this minority.
1.5.1.1. Con: Since [people don't stop working any significant amount under a UBI](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/19/21112570/universal-basic-income-ubi-map), this wouldn't happen.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.
1.5.3. Pro: UBIs could be used by political elites to avoid addressing structural injustices.
1.5.3.1. Pro: A UBI replacing the myriad number of welfare programs means that welfare as a political issue will only have a single dimension: at what rate should the UBI be set. This can distract from other policy options that could more strategically target injustice and welfare needs.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Passing a UBI may mean that welfare and poverty will be seen as a 'solved' issue, which requires no further help from the State.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: This is an argument against literally any attempt to fight poverty. This risk does not outweigh the policy's tangible benefits for the poor.
1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.1.
1.5.3.1.1.3. Con: If society believes that welfare and poverty is a "solved" issue, then it is a fault of the society, not the UBI.
1.5.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: UBI can help improve faulty perceptions and beliefs around poverty.
1.5.3.1.1.4. Con: Just because an UBI exists, does not mean that people are not in poverty. This poverty will still be visible to the people and the state.
1.5.3.1.1.5. Pro: Equality of opportunity, which can be achieved through affirmative action policies, is unlikely to be popular when huge portions of the budget are already being spent on a UBI.
1.5.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Affirmative action policies rarely cost money to implement. It is unclear why the cost of a UBI would influence whether they are implemented.
1.5.3.1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.6.1.
1.5.3.1.1.6. Pro: A bigger issue concerning inequality relates to distribution of wealth. There is a danger that UBI will act as a distraction, and disguise the bigger issue. This is especially the case in an era of accelerating technology, when profits to GDP have been hovering around an all-time high and we seem to be seeing a winner takes all society evolve, with the creation of natural monopolies in technology verticals, such as search, social media, room bookings, car sharing, etc.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Because it is universally accessible, a UBI does nothing to address specific sociocultural issues of minorities. If anything the 'equality' it provides erases differences and unfairly redirects blame for poverty back onto minorities.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Many socio-cultural issues exist because of the economic disadvantaged state of minorities. A UBI alleviates this economic discrepancy.
1.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: Poverty is an endemic issue for minority groups; but one whose root cause is systemic discrimination in the past and present. These underlying issues are overlooked, meaning a UBI is easily characterised as a 'universal handout' that will fix the issues of poverty in minority communities.
1.5.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Just because it will fix the poverty of everyone does not mean that it will not also fix poverty in minority groups.
1.5.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Poverty, whatever the cause, is primarily a financial condition. Any measure that eases that condition does so regardless of social divisions and other disadvantages. Systemic bigotry against minorities that may hinder further advancement of members of a given group is a separate issue that requires unrelated counter measures.
1.5.3.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Dealing with the symptoms of an ailment often helps expedite recovery.
1.5.3.1.2.3. Con: Because if people take the free living wage provided by the government and squander it on something unnecessary, it really is their fault if they are out of their living wage.
1.5.3.1.2.3.1. Con: UBI will actually help fix the spending habits of the poor. Studies show that bad spending habits[come from a mindset of the scarcity of now](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/03/science/la-sci-poor-people-decisions-20121103), and when people are given enough resources to think about the future those habits disappear.
1.5.3.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The fact is, most poor people [do not spend](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083428) in the way we assume and peer reviewed studies say that policies that contain food price inflation, improve decent-paying job opportunities for the urban poor are likely to reduce the use of negative coping strategies.
1.5.3.1.2.4. Con: A nation's choice of redistribution schemes is not the only tool by which to address specific differences in equality and so UBIs should not be dismissed as a means to provide economic relief to all individuals.
1.5.3.1.2.5. Con: The fact that, while working to alleviate a particular immediate problem, a UBI does not fix every other issue is not an argument against a UBI.
1.5.3.1.2.6. Con: A law that ameliorates a symptom instead of a root cause can still have value. For example, distributing food or money to combat hunger does nothing to aleviate the root causes of hunger, but still adds tremendous value to humanity.
1.5.3.1.2.6.1. Pro: Many diseases are treated with "supportive care" to make things easier for the body in other ways, allowing it to focus its "efforts" and energy on the primary illness.
1.5.3.1.2.7. Con: A UBI is not the solution to discrimination. A UBI is the solution to automation. Discrimination must be fixed separately. If discrimination were fixed, we would still need a UBI. Therefore, misuse of a UBI for the sake of discrimination is not a reason to oppose a UBI.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: It is possible for a UBI to co-exist with a bare minimum degree of social welfare programs. These welfare programs could address other injustices.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: More important than a flexible income are the necessities of life: access to clean food, air, and water, a doctor when you're sick, a roof over your head and a good education. We should fight for universal access to these goods first.
1.5.3.1.4.1. Pro: This fight should take place at an individual and community level. A UBI gives these communities more to work with.
1.5.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: A UBI would help people to find the time and means to engage in activism.
1.5.3.1.4.2. Con: A UBI should provide that instead.
1.5.3.1.5. Con: When people are free from concerns about their own destitution they will be empowered to mobilize around the plights of their fellow citizens. A UBI makes sincere prioritization of other's needs possible in a way that is currently impossible for most citizens.
1.5.3.1.6. Con: "Strategic" often translates to more complex, and complexity is more difficult to fight through democratic means. A UBI would simplify political discussion to a level that can be impacted by votes.
1.5.3.1.7. Pro: If a country were to hit a rough patch economically, putting UBI on a hold would throw those dependent on it back into poverty. UBI addresses the symptoms, not the problem.
1.5.3.1.7.1. Pro: Once the welfare system is focused into one monetary sum, it will become a political target subject to erosion at each election. Over time, politicians will drive the payments down to win votes, leading to increased poverty. The poor today have multiple options to address income, housing and healthcare. Rolling those into one payment subject to political whim is a high risk strategy for the poor.
1.5.3.1.7.1.1. Con: The poor are already under this kind of attack. A UBI might actually mitigate this as it would reduce desire for "incentive" and "work requirement" schemes. It would be simpler to implement as well.
1.5.3.1.7.1.2. Con: With it all being in one sum, it would be harder for politicians to skim some money off the top as they do now. Ie. Take 2% off of $20 in 5 different values and nobody will notice, but take 2% off of $100 once and it becomes more pronounced.
1.5.3.1.8. Pro: UBI is unsustainable in a democracy because over time because organized voting blocs will lobby and vote for increasingly larger payments out of the public treasury. Enough politicians will be incentivized to dispense them in exchange for consolidating their political power.
1.5.3.1.8.1. Pro: Ultimately the level of UBI would become distorted by politicians looking to curry favor from the population receiving them. Such biased inputs would ultimately lead to unsustainable redistribution, as people are unlikely to turn down increasing amounts of UBI.
1.5.3.2. Pro: A UBI is used as a way of merely making [techno-capitalism](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/universal-basic-income-equality-tech-silicon-valley) — a system that fuels inequalities \([Suarez-Villa, p. 162](https://books.google.es/books?id=UjMHDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=technocapitalism+and+inequality&source=bl&ots=Iej_CriTK6&sig=eB_Qycqzfe2b7lS6RswdkJyr7FA&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL7-DeuojUAhWJjCwKHVhaAcYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=technocapitalism%20and%20inequality&f=false)\) — more tolerable for people, instead of addressing the root causes of exploitation and economic inequality.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Silicon Valley, the epitome of techno-capitalism, [strongly supports](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/silicon-valley-universal-basic-income-y-combinator) a UBI; therefore, the companies expect that they will benefit.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: [Silicon Valley's](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/silicon-valley-lawmakers-1-trillion-plan-save-trump-country/) congressional representative Ro Khanna has proposed a 1 trillion dollar earned income tax credit expansion as a form of basic income, doubling the income going to low-income families.
1.5.3.2.1.2. Con: Appeal to authority is logical fallacy. Silicon Valley's support doesn't provide justification, as they are neither political, nor economic experts.
1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: A motive for Silicon Valley to support UBI can simply be explained by the notion that Silicon Valley just wants everyone to be able to buy their products.
1.5.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: The motive does not gel either. By pushing for a UBI, they are also pushing for a higher general tax rate on themselves.
1.5.3.2.1.2.3. Con: If one takes a free market approach to equality and growth then one must accept that Silicon Valley \(representing a huge market share of automation\) must be a source of good 'knowledge' on such a topic in a free market.
1.5.3.2.1.3. Con: The fact that Silicon Valley supports UBI is a given since they are the main drivers behind the techo-capitalism and would thus, reasonably, support policies supporting its continued growth.
1.5.3.2.1.4. Con: This is conformation bias. A number of local governments and organisations strongly support UBI and have no interest in techno-capitalism.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: If techno-capitalism provides the impetus to implement an effective universal welfare system, that would help address economic inequality directly.
1.5.3.2.2.1. Con: Actually, income inequality might increase with a UBI because there would be no more societal pressure to create meaningless jobs. Which means there will be an automation boom and significantly fewer jobs; meaning income inequality would actually increase. So, while covering the basic needs of the majority of the population would certainly pacify it, the political and relative economic power of the vast majority would be greatly reduced.
1.5.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: This would divide society into two camps, those solely reliant on UBI and those working or owning along with a UBI. That is, the powerful and the weak whom face an uphill battle maintaining rights and power balance in the long term. Specifically, jobs become scarcer and capital is more concentrated due to growing tech monopolies and automation. On such a trajectory any safe guards fall by the wayside where convenient for elites.
1.5.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: We already have those classes, and the problems that come with them, it's just right now the weaker class gets nothing.
1.5.3.2.3. Con: The fact that a UBI is not a universal panacea is not an argument against a UBI.
1.5.3.2.3.1. Con: But it's not just that it's not a cure all, it actually creates new problems. The newest problem is that affordability will not be fixed, and the rich will still get richer by simply hiking up the prices of goods.
1.5.3.2.4. Con: While there may be structural inequalities in varying degrees \(depends on the country\), the fact is people are not equally skilled and success \(as measured in whatever way\) tends to accumulate to a small set of individuals. In this sense you can't take away all the causes of inequalities no matter what you do.
1.5.3.2.4.1. Con: Inequality is not the only problem a UBI is intended to address; absolute poverty and related illnesses and fatalities are also a critical issue a UBI would go a great way towards addressing.
1.5.3.2.5. Con: The emergence of the internet has turned the average citizen into a source of income for many corporations that essentially sell your identity to advertisers. A UBI would be a reasonable and necessary redistributive structure in light of our current economic framework.
1.5.3.2.5.1. Con: The general refusal to pay for Internet services resulting in the monetization of user data is not justification for mandating that the services make less money.
1.5.3.3. Con: A UBI inherently levels the playing field to remove structural injustices.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: A UBI incapacitates citizens as it creates a financial dependency on the state.
1.5.3.3.1.1. Con: Every job existing before the implementation of a UBI would presumably still exist afterwards and can still be applied for. At lower wage levels many jobs are already supported by the government anyway. In the UK, each [supermarket](https://www.citizensuk.org/taxpayer) is subsidized, so they can underpay their workers and pay their shareholders.
1.5.3.3.1.2. Pro: Citizens will become reliant on the UBI once they start using it to support ongoing business or personal projects. This creates a dependency and thus a bargaining chip for governments.
1.5.3.3.1.3. Con: Modern social welfare structures currently exist, with strings attached — you can't be homeless and get housing assistance, you need to be in college to get pell grants, and you must be working to get the earned income tax credit etc. By equalizing the payments and removing the strings attached to social programs, the influence of politicians and bureaucrats is lessened relative to the status quo.
1.5.3.3.1.4. Con: Public subsidies for business \(like arts programs\) are currently used as bargaining chips by governments. Restructuring those into a UBI \(welfare for people instead of corporations\) would remove bargaining chips from the hand of governments.
1.5.3.3.1.4.1. Con: Social programs addressing the needs of individuals are also used as bargaining chips by governments.
1.5.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: As a UBI is universal and unconditional, it could not be used as such.
1.5.3.3.1.5. Con: Every single entity within a society is dependent on the state through the social contract.
1.5.3.3.1.5.1. Con: The degree of the dependency varies strongly.
1.5.3.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Even the wealthiest of people are at the mercy of chance, nature, and crime without the state making sure they are not victims and/or helping them recover fro such events \(e.g. rebuilding disaster zones, policing, firefighting etc\). People tend to underestimate these guarantees given by the state and take them for granted thinking they are not dependent on them when in fact everyone is just as dependent. If anything the dependence of the wealthy could be even greater as they have more to lose.
1.5.3.3.1.6. Pro: The poor will be more reliant on the state if the only method they have for reducing inequality is through state provision. This creates a perverse incentive to not challenge the state or demand social change.
1.5.3.3.1.6.1. Con: A UBI would not disincentivize the poor to challenge the state, rather they might have new challenges that do not concern economics anymore, but rather social or political issues.
1.5.3.3.1.6.2. Con: People retain all the mechanisms to enact social change that already exist; this policy does not limit their abilities.
1.5.3.3.1.6.3. Con: The poor are already reliant on the state, and usually have to "earn" their welfare through makework, such as seeking and applying for jobs that they have no chance of getting. Removing this requirement makes them less dependent on the state, because they can take chances on jobs or enterprises without facing destitution if they fail.
1.5.3.3.1.7. Pro: Multiple generations of UBI could lead to dependence on a delicate system that requires a lot of social cooperation to sustain. If this system ever collapses because subsequent generations take it for granted, the effects could be disastrous.
1.5.3.3.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.3.4.3.2.
1.5.3.3.1.8. Pro: A UBI creates a fragile core centered around global government in a high-tension time in history. This core could collapse at any moment and create catastrophe.
1.5.3.3.1.9. Pro: A UBI would disallows an individual to attain a higher standard of life by trapping them within a limited income and lifestyle. By issuing a limited income, people will come to rely on that income solely. Assuming that welfare would remain in many countries, there would be even less incentive to improve ones life and lifestyle. Many poor and uneducated are content to keep status quo, but the ones that would "Dream" of something better, would ultimately lose.
1.5.3.3.1.9.1. Con: Individuals desiring a higher quality of life or additional goods and services could always still earn money through paid employment.
1.5.3.3.1.9.1.1. Pro: This would be actively advertised and encouraged by businesses seeking employees, who must now compete for labour as people are not beholden to them merely for their living expenses.
1.5.3.3.1.10. Pro: It would be harmful for citizens to become solely reliant on the government to provide sustenance. As the population grows, the system would become unaffordable, leaving a low skilled workforce with no means to support themselves.
1.5.3.3.2. Pro: People with "invisible", poorly documented or otherwise hard to prove disabilities can receive a UBI without tolerating questioning or having to produce proof.
1.5.3.3.3. Pro: UBI is a good starting point for establishing much broader systemic economic reform. The establishment of a UBI standard that is matched with a variety of other economic factors would allow our whole society to be enriched by innovation and cultural development. It seems over simplified to suggest that it would stifle self determination; If done with, integrity it may  allow individuals to focus on their true passions and become innovators as well foster a stronger democratic-capitalist system.
1.5.3.4. Pro: Cultivating dependence on the state through UBI reduces the bargaining power of the governed. Only when the state depends on its population for their labour, and when the people have the ability to withhold it, do the people have any power over the state save for that of violent revolution.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: In a democratic society the power lies in the vote. The elected officials would gain power if they could convince their constituents they would support and/or increase the UBI.
1.5.3.4.2. Con: Most persons in mainstream western society are dependent on private employers, which could be argued to be worse and less empowering than being dependent on the state.
1.5.3.4.3. Pro: If the income provided by a UBI does not offer more than basic subsistence, or at least a significant improvement relative to low wages currently offered by employers, it could leave people desperate and on the edge of poverty and insecurity, reinforcing [poverty traps](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/poverty-trap).
1.5.3.4.3.1. Con: Even just reducing the stress of the poorest strata of society will lead to positive shifts in society and their lifestyle.
1.5.3.4.4. Pro: A UBI would create political inequality, as people would become afraid to bite the hand that feeds them.
1.5.3.4.4.1. Pro: A UBI would become a political tool that, like welfare, is used by politicians to gain or hold power. As with welfare programs, UBI recipients would be held hostage by corrupt politicians and processes that divide those who receive a UBI from those who pay the taxes to provide UBI.
1.5.3.4.4.1.1. Con: If the UBI is a net positive for enough families say more than 50%, it would be very difficult politically to hold it hostage. Like countries with National Health Care, it is almost impossible to roll it back.
1.5.3.4.5. Pro: A UBI can be used to placate the general populace in order to lessen opposition to the government or calls for more fundamental reforms.
1.5.3.4.5.1. Pro: The [Saudi Arabian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/10/03/saudi-government-budget-cuts-prove-basic-income-is-no-solution-to-slow-economic-growth/#1376eff54bbe) government provides its citizens with a form of UBI in order to keep them happy and thus cement government power and the prevailing societal conditions.
1.5.3.4.5.1.1. Con: The Saudi system is not a UBI but rather large-scale public employment and spending that systematically excludes women and religious minorities.
1.5.3.4.5.1.1.1. Con: The difference between a UBI and such an employment program is negligible.
1.5.3.4.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The difference is not negligible if you are a woman or religious minority; it is the difference between receiving a healthy living wage and between receiving nothing.
1.5.3.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: It cannot even be called an UBI if it is not universal.
1.5.3.4.5.1.1.3. Pro: Saudi Arabia has [guaranteed jobs programs](https://www.businessinsider.de/saudi-arabia-giving-citizens-13-billion-hand-out-2018-1?r=US&IR=T); they have abandoned their UBI. If you cannot find a job, the government will give you one and pay you monthly till they find you private sector work. As of right now the boom going on there all the people that took advantage of the UBI and got educated without having to work all make six figures now. So before they changed the program, it allowed for the creation of millionaires from the slums.
1.5.3.4.5.1.2. Con: There is scant evidence that the UBI prevents social critique of the regime in Saudi Arabia. Causality is hard to determine, but pressure on the Kingdom seems to have increased since transfer payments from Oil wealth were introduced.
1.5.3.4.5.1.3. Con: Saudi Arabia, where people are being oppressed into compliance, is one of the states with the [worst human rights policies](https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110131191445/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/88.pdf) of the world. That the people of Saudi Arabia don't call for a change might have little to do with a UBI.
1.5.3.4.5.1.4. Con: Providing the public with a stable existence isn't a form of a control, it is a basic function of government.
1.5.3.4.5.2. Con: If everyone is "too happy" to care about bad social conditions, then what exactly is it that is so "bad" about them? By that logic any other kind of progress that makes people better off than before should be opposed too on the same grounds.
1.5.3.4.5.2.1. Con: While the logic itself is sound, the key element is that it cements "prevailing societal conditions", such as restricting the rights of their female citizens. The argument is akin to saying "The Colonial Slaves had food, shelter, and protection provided to them by their masters, why should they complain?"
1.5.3.4.5.2.2. Con: Privilege can blind people to the suffering and states of those not so privileged, such as first-world peoples having only a theoretical understanding of the suffering of those most disadvantaged in the third world.
1.5.3.4.5.3. Pro: For example, the oil-rich [rentier states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state) of the Middle East grant generous allowances to their subjects, allowing demands for rights to be ignored as there is no consequence to the state for doing so.
1.5.3.4.5.3.1. Con: It is up to voters to ensure that they do not trade basic comforts for basic rights. If a goverment says 'allow torture or you can't have security' voters can \(and have\) said 'we will not allow torture, you are still being paid to provide and responsible for security'. If they do not then any basic comfort or need can hold them hostage.
1.5.3.4.5.4. Con: Saying that the UBI is used only to cement government power is misleading. You can say the same for every form of welfare. Maybe the government could act only in an egoistical way but this is still something that makes people's life better. You don't need any proof, if the government gives money to the people it can't be considered something bad.
1.5.3.4.5.5. Pro: A UBI is a way of legitimising the capitalist system, by 'paying off' the electorate, disadvantaging future generations and nature.
1.5.3.4.5.6. Pro: A UBI can be used to lure voters or group of voters. Political parties can use this as a campaign tool promising unjustified and economically non-viable income to poor voters. This could not just affect economy but also undermines principle of free and fair voting.
1.5.3.4.6. Con: People currently depend on the state for physical security \(police, military\), environmental protection \(clean water\), power, etc. The state cannot withhold universal protections to assert power, they can only withhold limited exceptions.
1.5.3.5. Con: Any program that promotes social equality could be used by elites to avoid addressing structural issues. However, such programs in general weaken the influence of elites by empowering the disadvantaged.
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: A UBI will empower the politically marginalized by freeing them from the shackles of wage slavery. When people are free to think and organize without fear of destitution they will be able to take control of their democracy and enact their political might on structural injustices.
1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: The ability to organize one's workplace without the threat of losing access to basic needs will be a great democratizing force.
1.5.3.5.1.2. Con: If the UBI is being provided by the government, organizing against the government would create a fear of destitution.
1.5.3.5.1.3. Con: By financing UBI through this system it would gain legitimacy. The structural injustices would be seen as a necessary evil in order to provide for the basic needs of everyone.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: A UBI together with automation will strengthen the position of high tax payers, by making the state dependent on their taxes \(to pay for UBI\).
1.5.3.5.2.1. Pro: If wealthy people already feel as though they are contributing towards the UBI, they are less likely to support other important initiatives.
1.5.3.5.2.1.1. Con: What the wealthy want and desire becomes less relevant in a world where massively more people are enfranchised.
1.5.3.5.2.1.2. Con: This same logic could also be applied to all of the social welfare programs, yet many wealthy individuals still distinguish between their own self interest and what is best for people broadly.
1.5.3.5.2.2. Con: Those high tax payers already control the state in the US, and elsewhere. This is a general problem of money in politics, not of welfare policies, UBI or otherwise.
1.5.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: The wealthiest actually pay less tax than anyone else, as a percentage of income, currently, allowing them more to spend influencing politics.
1.5.3.5.2.3. Pro: Assuming a UBI is financed through high marginal tax rates, this would make democracies \(e.g. US/UK\) even more extraordinarily protective of their most profitable industries, some of which may be globally exploitative, such as investment banking and resource extraction.
1.5.3.5.2.4. Con: A UBI will afford those with lower incomes more flexibility, which can allow them to organize politically. You could consider it a "strike fund" that allows labor and citizens to advocate for themselves.
1.5.3.5.2.4.1. Pro: A UBI might provide people with time to rally and create movements to solve inequality. The security provided by a basic income could allow people to become politically more vocal since they'd perhaps be less cautious about publicly holding a belief/opinion opposed to that of their bosses.
1.5.3.5.2.5. Con: A UBI does not necessarily have to be funded through taxes, or can be funded through taxes which are not dependent on an individual's income.
1.5.3.5.2.6. Pro: Historically and currently, in any government the more a population pays more in taxes, the more it is likely to be listened to by representatives or the state. Those on a UBI are not taxed, and will be beholden to the increasing control of those who will be taxed and who pay for the UBI. Systemically this will concentrate into fewer hands over time, leading to serfdom.
1.5.3.5.3. Pro: A UBI allows would-be political activists more time to engage in such activities without feeling as much financial pressure to engage in paid work instead.
1.5.3.6. Pro: A UBI may [create fiscal incentives for a country to reduce immigration](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/how-a-basic-income-in-the-u-s-could-increase-global-poverty).
1.5.3.6.1. Con: The idea that "reducing immigration is harmful" is a political and social value judgement. It is not widely shared enough to use as a reason for instituting an unrelated policy.
1.5.3.6.2. Con: When there is more economic stability among less wealthy people there will be less anger and anxiety directed towards immigrants and those with different cultures.
1.5.3.6.2.1. Con: On the contrary, people might just as well  become more resentful of the hand that feeds them, as they are completely dependant on it.
1.5.3.6.3. Pro: A UBI requires wealthy nations to maintain strict immigration policies to restrict access to citizenship from people from less wealthy nations. It would continue to incentivize the upward distribution of wealth \(specifically resources that provide wealth\) from poor nations to wealthy nations.
1.5.3.6.4. Pro: If every citizen is entitled to a UBI, that creates political incentives to discourage immigration. The biggest economic inequalities [are been rich and poor countries](http://timharford.com/2014/11/a-passport-to-privilege/), not within rich countries, and anything that could create big barriers to migration from poor to rich countries is counterproductive to global economic justice.
1.5.3.6.4.1. Pro: Immigration is a force for [reducing global inequality](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/01/28/migration-as-a-way-to-reduce-global-inequality/). Reduced immigration is therefore a net harm because it harms the welfare of humanity as a whole and makes borders more rigid in general.
1.5.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: Migration and remittances increases the welfare of families who remain in their countries of origin. In [Guatemala](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152089), having a migrant relative is associated with improved child nutrition.
1.5.3.6.4.1.2. Pro: Migration increases job opportunities and access to productive inputs to improve the effectiveness of labour. Both of these factors increase income for migrants in destination countries. Therefore, reduced migration increases global labour market inequalities.
1.5.3.6.4.1.3. Con: This is dependent on the actual reduction of migration.
1.5.3.6.4.1.3.1. Con: The United States would need 4 trillion a year to pay every citizen 15,000 a year. Adding 4 trillion a year to the national deficit would create inevitable desires to reduce immigration.
1.5.3.7. Con: The possibility that a system could be misused by malicious actors does not constitute evidence that the system would not be beneficial if used in good faith. If the system implemented faithfully would provide benefit, then the question of how to prevent abuse is a secondary \(if still important\) issue.
1.5.3.7.1. Con: Plenty of government policies if "implemented faithfully", would be beneficial, but it must be acknowledged that they aren't. A prime example includes regulatory capture, but in theory even a dictatorship, if benevolent, would likely be beneficial yet we recognize we should not support such a kind of government.
1.5.3.7.1.1. Con: It is possible to assess the consequences by performing experiments at a small scale. The fear itself of it failing cannot work as a deterrent, it is necessary to assess whether those fears are real or imagined. In the example of a dictatorship, it has been tried before over and over, however, most of the time it is not beneficial. It is not possible to say the same about an UBI unless experiments are completed.
1.5.3.7.1.1.1. Con: While it may be a good idea to test UBIs \(or not; it may not be practical to "test" UBIs on a "small scale"\), no examples of concluded, positive tests have been offered. Simply put, we cannot yet use the "possibility" of tests as support for the thesis.
1.5.3.7.2. Pro: Corruption is an evil in our society and is not affected by economic policies.
1.5.3.7.2.1. Con: That doesn't mean that economic policies aren't affected, or even directed by such corruption, to better benefit certain groups or individuals.
1.5.3.8. Pro: It is difficult to create political sympathy for the poor when they are already by far one of the largest spending items on a government budget \([e.g. US War on Poverty](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go)\). Therefore it is difficult to politically motivate for a structural reform while implementing this policy.
1.5.3.8.1. Con: The [largest spending item](http://www.businessinsider.com/2012-us-defense-budget-largest-since-world-war-ii-2011-7) on the US budget in 2012 was defense, not spending on the poor, and there was very little to no loss of political support for the US military.
1.5.3.8.2. Con: A UBI does not just go to the poor. It goes to everyone, including the middle class. Therefore, it should have more support than most welfare programs.
1.5.3.8.3. Con: The lack of political sympathy assumption is false. By this reasoning, it should be difficult to create political sympathy for the elderly because the vast majority of health care money is spent on them \(and this does not happen\).
1.5.3.8.3.1. Con: This comparison is flawed. Contrary to poverty, aging is a process almost every member of society will experience. Therefore political sympathy for the elderly is in the self-interest of \(almost\) all citizens.
1.5.4. Con: A UBI achieves both the progressive goal of providing a safety net for workers and the conservative goal of downsizing government - hence it can unify otherwise disparate political aspects of society to create a more bipartisan condition.
1.5.4.1. Con: A UBI doesn't ultimately achieve conservative goals.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Conservative goals often reduce safety, stability, health, quality of life, agency, and freedom for the underprivileged and less fortunate.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: A UBI would not necessarily downsize the government and so would not unify otherwise disparate political aspects of society.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: UBI could, at least partially, replace some government assistance programs like [SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program) \(formerly food stamps\) which have the same aim but are far more bureaucratic.
1.5.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Unlike cash transfers, assistance programs like food stamps are prone to [distributional leakages](https://economics.mit.edu/files/12488).
1.5.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.4.2.2.2.
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: A UBI hands even more power to a centralized structure through the non-voluntary confiscation of resources \(higher taxes\) eliminating individual agency and freedom. The power to choose how one spends their own resources largely disappears.
1.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: Conservatives aren't in favor of higher taxes for most anything — more authority over our collective resources increases the power of governments rather than decreases it.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Andrew Yang is gaining support for his 2020 Presidential campaign that centers around his "[Freedom Dividend](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/)" a UBI proposal that would guarantee $1000 a month to US citizens 18 & older.
1.5.5. Pro: Recipients may vote to raise their UBI even if it would create negative economic consequences.
1.5.5.1. Con: Some UBI recipients may have an incentive to expand the program, but net payers have an incentive to try and abolish or reduce the UBI because it is a drain on their incomes.
1.5.5.2. Pro: UBI creates well defined groups of recipients and net payers. It's easier to be a recipient, so there might be a tendency for the group of recipients to enlarge. The recipients are motivated to vote for more financial equality so inevitably enlarge the group of recipients now with even more democratic votes.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: This may not be an issue if the UBI rate is set to be low.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: In a representative democracy, politicians can resist pressure from recipients and refuse to pass the laws for more financial equality.
1.5.5.2.3. Con: Citizens can see this threat in advance and, at some point, will prefer the greater good over their own interests.
1.5.5.2.4. Con: Although the threat of a slippery slope seemingly exists for any welfare programme, welfare states do not actually experience this issue.
1.5.5.2.4.1. Con: Current welfare programs are not universal, so the groups of receivers have some limit to growth.
1.5.5.3. Pro: People in absolute poverty must care about themselves first. Any economic recession would increase their interest in redistribution and lower their responsibility to the whole society.
1.5.5.4. Con: Voters balance interests, whether tactical or strategic, for them or others. A UBI is not unique in creating something to balance out - Almost every government intervention does that.
1.5.5.5. Con: Welfare, changes in taxes, workfare, increased money supply - every intervention causes electoral conflict. If we were to instruct the government to avoid conflict of interests within the electorate, nothing would get done.
1.6. Pro: A UBI would improve the lives of many people.
1.6.1. Con: A UBI may increase the risk of political unrest.
1.6.1.1. Con: Increased wealth inequality has [led](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/most-political-unrest-has-one-big-root-cause-soaring-inequality) to a number of protests throughout the world. UBIs decrease inequality and so too the risk of political unrest.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Protests across Latin America have been [triggered](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/inequality-triggered-protests-latin-america-2019/) by extreme inequality.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: A UBI might be enacted at a time when it's not developed enough for mass use and people are too desperate for money, which could cause it to fail, due to people overpowering an incapable system \(like when the coronavirus generated mass unemployment to where people rioted and led to a lack of a [2nd stimulus check](https://www.shieldwallnetwork.com/2020/06/10/black-lives-matter-protests-mean-no-2nd-stimulus-check/) in the end\). Its failure only leads to more [inequality](https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/economy/2020/06/09/unplanned-stimulus-delivery-to-increase-inequality-instability) and unrest than before.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Con: A UBI can be adjusted to avoid this pitfall. Thus, it is not a reason to avoid implementing it outright.
1.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Due to an emergency situation or strong public pressure, politicians may be forced to rush to implement the UBI.
1.6.1.2. Pro: The [majority](https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/evidence-base/what-do-americans-think-about-universal-basic-income/) of Americans oppose a UBI. Going against the majority risks creating political tensions and unrest.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: This can be said for any new controversial policy and does not only apply to UBIs.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: One study is not conclusive. Given the economic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, it might well be that more Americans support a UBI in the future.
1.6.2. Pro: A UBI promotes [social justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice) by improving the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society.
1.6.2.1. Con: The distribution of societal resources should be targeted [at those most in need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls) of opportunities and support.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: It is unfair that those who are successful in life are treated unequally and excluded from governmental grants.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Those who are successful do not need these government grants to continue to be successful. Those who are struggling do. In either case, the passion and drive to better or add to the world should be the motivating factor, not the money. Thus, a UBI lessens the barrier to entry for such individuals that they may contend with those who are already successful. If they are truly successful on their own merits, it would indeed be fair on the grounds of keeping them honest.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Giving a UBI to wealthy citizens is a waste of money and resources. The money is way better used to help those in hardship.
1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: The assumption that wealthy citizens will "waste" the money given to them is not implicit. On the contrary, it is possible that, on average, wealthy citizens will contribute more per "dollar" received than citizens in need.
1.6.2.1.2.1.1. Con: [That wealth individuals waste their money by saving it](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7906) [is not an assumption.](http://factmyth.com/factoids/people-with-more-money-save-more/)
1.6.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.5.1.1.
1.6.2.1.2.3. Pro: As rich people save more money relative to their income than poor people and savings are macroeconomically bad UBI is inefficient.
1.6.2.1.2.3.1. Con: The saved funds are not simply put under the mattress but become reinvested in order to achieve a profitable return. Therefore, the saved proportion is available as loanable funds adding fresh capital stocks to the markets and as a result, increase the markets' [productive capacity](https://mnmeconomics.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/why-the-saving-rate-is-important/).
1.6.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Reinvestment is not as good for the economy as actually spending money is. An estimate of [the consumption multiplier is somewhere above 1.36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier#United_States_of_America), while [the savings multiplier, even if we assume the highest interest rate on a savings account is undervalued by a factor of 20, is 1.26.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/pf/savings-account-yields/index.html)
1.6.2.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Money in savings accounts is used by banks as collateral in their loaning and investment activities. In this way it doesn't 'sit there' but rather enables other productive uses.
1.6.2.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.2.3.1.1.
1.6.2.1.3. Con: Because almost all tax systems are progressive, those who are vulnerable and in need already receive more benefits than those who are better off. If anything a UBI makes this distribution even more progressive.
1.6.2.1.4. Pro: Some people will need more support then others, some will need less; a flat UBI check is probably going to run into a similar problems as flat taxes, and similarly simplistic tax codes. The lack of discretion will hurt those that need more help.
1.6.2.1.4.1. Pro: UBI doesn't account for differences of need between people from disability or illness.
1.6.2.1.5. Con: Targeted benefits inevitably have arbitrary cutoff points for eligibility, excluding some people who have essentially the same need for support as others, but fall just beyond the cutoff, or who have other extenuating circumstances that aren't addressed by eligibility criteria.
1.6.2.1.5.1. Con: Cutoffs could be easily removed by using a sliding scale, where applicants can get a variable amount depending on their needs, instead of being eligible for all or nothing depending on a cutoff point.
1.6.2.1.5.2. Con: This can be addressed by taking care over the criteria, and making sure they are appropriate. In theory the cutoffs should be a good thing, preventing those not in need taking resources which could go to those in need. If this isn't the case in practice, then the criteria simply need revisiting.
1.6.2.1.6. Con: Implementing a UBI does not exclude the possibility of providing extra benefits to those who may need them.
1.6.2.1.7. Pro: A UBI 'takes' money from those who need it to 'give' to those who do not. Those who need money most are given proportionately less than under other welfare distribution systems.
1.6.2.1.8. Con: Providing the same benefit to every citizen—even wealthy ones—makes it more likely that the UBI will remain dependable. Everyone who receives the UBI has a stake in keeping it going, so the more people who receive it, the more people will vote for officials who support the UBI policy. Social Security uses this strategy, and it's proven impossible for any politician to cut or even reduce benefits.
1.6.2.1.9. Con: This compromises democracy and encourages a client-patron relationship between groups and the politicians that secure their official "group in need the government must help" status.
1.6.2.1.10. Pro: Treating people who are unequal equally is not egalitarian and will not address current inequalities or produce a more equitable distribution of capital and income wealth as an outcome.
1.6.2.1.10.1. Pro: Universal access to a basic living wage above the poverty line that uses a simple and automatically-administered mean test would offer all the benefits claimed by a UBI without the cost burden of payments to people who currently don't need any financial assistance.
1.6.2.2. Pro: The UBI financially supports citizens who are engaged in meaningful but low or unpaid activities, such as: domestic labor, art, volunteering, engaging with politics, and pursuing higher education.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Many forms of creative expression, such as art or writing, are not pursued because only the most successful artists or writers can generate a self-sustaining income.
1.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: Even the pursuit of creative activities as a way to achieve a financial reward may in many cases lead to those activities [being enjoyed less and pursued less effectively](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/motivation.html).
1.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: Wikipedia and many other open-source community creations are an example of unpaid work that has great societal value. A UBI would help reward and sustain these valuable resources.
1.6.2.2.1.3. Con: Producing quality "creative expression" is a hard work. Assuming that introduction of unconditional income will increase the total amount of high quality works of art is unfounded and naive.
1.6.2.2.1.3.1. Con: "Practice makes perfect", or at least has a positive relationship with quality. Additional time permitted for artistic endeavour \(such as by a UBI reducing the stress of providing for basics\) will increase the quality of artistic production.
1.6.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: Simple probability statistics disagree with this thesis. A greater number of artistic creators, even using the Infinite Monkey Theorem as a productivity yardstick, will invariably increase the number of quality artistic works being created.  More artists means more art means more good art. While the average quality of UBI-funded art may be less, but more great art will invariably get produced if there are more artists making art.
1.6.2.2.1.4. Pro: An UBI enables artists to live without the need to commodify their art so that it can be sold.
1.6.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: Artists, who have always struggled to find funding adequate enough to develop their oeuvre, will benefit greatly from a reliable income.
1.6.2.2.1.4.2. Con: Artists struggling to earn enough money to make a living is a price signal meaning that, for people, that art has more costs than benefits. In order to allow that art to be created, people would have to give up things that are more important.
1.6.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: Many contemporary artists [receive pressure](https://books.google.se/books?id=aXCHJ9CBQLEC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=pressure+on+artists+to+mainstream&source=bl&ots=zDsQLQ7nBa&sig=ACfU3U2i6qhIUlarF9MMvybsqcx5f7u63g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4sdjk073lAhVC2aQKHU_XASEQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=pressure%20on%20artists%20to%20mainstream&f=false) from producers to alter their work to better appeal to a mainstream audience, against their own desires or creative vision.
1.6.2.2.1.5. Pro: A UBI will enable artists to do what they do best rather than having to scrape by, spending most of their time working minimum wage jobs. The benefit to society is that we have an infusion of arts and culture.
1.6.2.2.1.6. Pro: A UBI will help to subsidize independent and critical thought and thus help bring new ideas into fruition.
1.6.2.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.5.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.1.7.
1.6.2.2.3. Con: If a contribution is valuable to society, then market forces will already define a fair price for such a contribution.
1.6.2.2.3.1. Con: "Meaningful contribution to society" is a vague and ill defined concept. To the extent economic policies incentivise certain behaviours they should do so in a targeted fashion to ensure the outcomes are positive and progress is measured relative to costs.
1.6.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Yes, it's a vague concept, but that's kind of the point. A number of activities that contribute to society, not only in wellbeing/community, but in solid economic gains, are undervalued. Childcare and aged care for example; or the arts. In contrast the current system, seems to incentivise only property barons, mining magnates, and telemarketers — often groups that actively detract from public good.
1.6.2.2.3.1.2. Con: The previous claim provided a number of examples that helped to clarify the broad category of "meaningful to society."
1.6.2.2.3.1.3. Con: There is much labor that is important — child care, art, charity, self-education and improvement — but is not compensated under the present form of capitalism. UBI would allow persons who raise children, create beauty, and do good works to sustain themselves without being forced to spend the majority of their time doing other jobs just to support themselves.
1.6.2.2.3.1.3.1. Con: The first beneficiary of self-education is oneself. If it is beneficial for also for a second party it can make a decision to sponsor the hopeful student. This ensures that the studies are progressing, as it costs funds. With unconditional UBI for all, this reality check won't work.
1.6.2.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Nobody and nothing exists in a vacuum - self-improvement and self-education will inevitably benefit one's neighbours as well, through processes as simple and basic as information and knowledge spreading through conversation, as well as whatever active uses the person puts their education, improvement and knowledge towards.
1.6.2.2.3.1.4. Con: A UBI will distribute the decision of what is meaningful work. Instead of having politicians decide what is "meaningful" and design policies that actually achieve the objective, you have lots of people with the ability to spend time/money on what they think is important. In that context it's not vague and ill defined, it's the average of the population's well-defined preferences.
1.6.2.2.3.2. Con: In the case of America the market system specifically does not define a fair price for such a contribution due to skewed distribution of wealth and price influence.
1.6.2.2.3.2.1. Con: Further skewing the market by use of involuntary wealth transfers would exaggerate this problem rather than fixing it.
1.6.2.2.3.3. Con: If you solve a problem for a rich person "society" rewards you much more than if you solve a problem for a poor person. Even if your contribution toward the poor person had a greater impact on their life. For instance, tutoring a poor kid or tutoring a rich kid provides different rewards for the same contribution. \(tried to place the tutoring example as a pro, to separate things\)
1.6.2.2.3.3.1. Con: Directing resources to the already well resourced can be the most efficient investment. For example, if an expensive worker is delayed by one hour in getting to work, the lost production is much greater than if an inexpensive worker is delayed by the same time. Allocating a private car to the expensive worker may be justifiable even though allocating a private car to the less expensive worker would not be.
1.6.2.2.3.3.2. Con: The above claim falsely assumes that wealth is always unearned and concludes it unfair that a rich person can outbid a poor person. However, wealth is often earned, therefore the ability to outbid more for a contested resource must sometimes be acknowledged to be a reward for earlier effort.
1.6.2.2.3.4. Con: Market forces stop making sense when people stop being able to pursue the best value deals. When people are no longer players due to lack of funds, they are unable to reward contributions made available towards them.
1.6.2.2.3.5. Con: Many market failures exist. For example, a family member caring for an elderly person is not rewarded by the market, while paying a stranger to do so is.
1.6.2.2.3.6. Pro: Individuals differ in their valuation of contributions. The market economy is the only means by which we may discover those valuations.  A "contribution to society" is meaningful and valuable only insofar as the members of that society are willing to pay for it.
1.6.2.2.3.6.1. Con: Willingness to pay for something does not mean that a financial transaction has to take place. The opportunity cost \(for example of a missed salary\) is also information about the value of something to a member of society.
1.6.2.2.3.6.2. Con: Roads are pretty valuable, yet society doesn't pay for them as part of a market economy.
1.6.2.2.3.6.3. Con: Police in general are pretty valuable, yet police that individuals pay for are called protection rackets, and are a determent to society.
1.6.2.2.3.6.3.1. Con: Actually, they're called "security firms" and are widely engaged. Protection racketeering is more along the lines of blackmailing victims with property damage and extorting money out of them on these grounds.
1.6.2.2.3.6.3.1.1. Con: Security firms work within the established framework of the law, have tons of oversight, and limited power —  they are basically the deputies of the goverment-run police and can't really be evaluated as an independent agency
1.6.2.2.3.6.4. Con: By the reasoning provided, intellectual property is not valuable. It would be better not to encourage the monopoly for any length of time. While some question the extent of our monopolies, most people see a little value in them.
1.6.2.2.3.6.5. Con: This statement highly values bribable officials. [Society](https://globalcompliancenews.com/anti-corruption/anti-corruption-laws-around-the-world/) tends not to overly care for them.
1.6.2.2.3.6.6. Con: Market exchange does not account for 'positive externalities' and 'negative externalities'.
1.6.2.2.3.7. Pro: A UBI removes the incentive to deliver precisely those goods and services most highly valued by individuals. The value of a good or service to an individual is only measurable by what that individual is willing to forego to attain it, namely, what they are willing to pay. By flattening the price disparities between different activities, a UBI will dilute the information contained in prices and lead to inefficient allocation of resources.
1.6.2.2.3.7.1. Con: The UBI is not paid to the product, but the person.
1.6.2.2.3.8. Con: Market forces value the jobs that are harder to fill, not the jobs with the biggest contribution to society.
1.6.2.2.3.9. Con: In capitalist societies there are many instances where jobs that provide the least use value are rewarded with higher wages than those that provide intrinsic value.
1.6.2.2.3.9.1. Pro: Use value is a good or service that is intrinsically valuable, or at least an instrumental good not far removed from a good in itself. Occupations that deal in exchange values are those which mediate goods and services, but themselves are not productive; advertising etc.
1.6.2.2.3.10. Con: Many jobs exist where people perform them out of a sense of duty or vocation - these jobs are frequently poorly paid, because people are willing to endure low wages in order to work in their chosen field, and because it is felt that a better wage might encourage people to seek the job for the money rather than a "purer" reason. In some cases, such as teaching or nursing, people then leave the field in order to pursue better paid jobs, because they can no longer afford to follow their vocation.
1.6.2.2.3.11. Con: Hard work and reward do not correlate.
1.6.2.2.3.11.1. Con: Hard work is not limited to physically hard work. Achieving "large returns" on investments consistently is very hard work, although not physical.
1.6.2.2.3.11.2. Con: “Hard work” is the wrong term. Work which has higher societal benefits would be more accurate. Athletes \(professional game players\) produce no material goods, but they are paid millions because people enjoy watching them. Investment banking isn’t physically hard work but is an important engine in growing the domestic economy.
1.6.2.2.3.11.2.1. Con: Investmant bankers spurred the 2008 financial crisis. Collateralized debt obligations and preditory lending allowed bankers to leverage their risk onto the pockets of tax payers in pursuit of personal profit. Their actions did not help American society. Skilled trades people help grow society.
1.6.2.2.3.11.3. Con: "Hard work" is an ambiguous term. It can mean physically taxing work - this indeed does not correlate with pay. But "hard" can also mean "hard to learn/acquire necessary skills" - in this meaning hardness does correlate with pay.
1.6.2.2.3.11.3.1. Con: This form of hard work should correspond with pay. Manual labor causes many health problems, both immediately and over time \(ex.: spinal misalignment, hernia\). There's general some risk of direct injury or loss of life involved with labor jobs, such as shelving collapses, forklift accidents, loading dock accidents, and others.
1.6.2.2.3.11.3.1.1. Pro: No one was ever been killed from learning calculus. The proposed 'thinking' form of hard work does not imply danger.
1.6.2.2.3.11.4. Con: If individuals are resentful of the current circumstance for reasons like low-return labor, then reducting that resentment by eliminating those positions with a UBI does not contribute to decreased productivity and societal incentive. The threat to societal incentive pertains to increased opportunity space.
1.6.2.2.4. Con: The state could sufficiently support people for meaningful and/or social contributions by paying people specifically for these contributions rather than giving everyone an unconditional income.
1.6.2.2.4.1. Con: State actors rarely do well with picking which activities are useful or productive. Better to keep the state out of it and let the laws of basic economics and market forces guide such decisions.
1.6.2.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.8.4.1.
1.6.2.2.4.2. Con: There are many accidents that result in valuable contributions. Allowing anyone to be able to try allows more accidents to happen \(not to mention the intentional benefits\). If we don't support people trying and failing, we won't have enough trials to make any significant progress.
1.6.2.2.4.2.1. Con: There was no such support US during 19th or 20th centuries but the rate of both economic growth and innovation there was huge during most this centuries. There are plenty of other countries that enjoyed the high growth without having special support for failed entrepreneurs.
1.6.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: In many areas, "practice makes perfect" or at least has a positive relationship with quality of work produced. Permitting people to practice and indulge in areas of interest to them, even if it does not initially produce valuable goods, may permit valuable work to be produced in the future, or provide inspiration that may lead to societally beneficial innovation.
1.6.2.2.4.3. Pro: A targeted welfare system is more able to account for this.
1.6.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Specific benefits might be paid to single parents, or people working as caretakers for dependent family members.
1.6.2.2.4.4. Con: There is likely to be a high amount of bureaucracy and fraud that would be involved in tracking every hour of care, cooking, helping out neighbours and then rewarding these actions.
1.6.2.2.4.5. Con: It is impossible to track how many hours of reading and research and leisure, sometimes spread over decades, went into the making of one invention.
1.6.2.2.4.6. Con: If someone would be otherwise engaged in criminal activity, doing nothing is in itself an improvement. UBI may well make those who would otherwise engage in crimes less desperate.
1.6.2.2.4.7. Pro: Even if the UBI rewards persons who currently perform unpaid \(but valuable\) contributions, such as artists or stay at home parents, it rewards everyone equally. Thus it is not a fair form of pay that recognises certain unpaid contributions are more valuable and laborious than others.
1.6.2.2.4.8. Pro: If society currently under-appreciates the contributions of important sources of unpaid labour, such as stay at home parents, a UBI may provide them some financial compensation but its universal nature denies them any form of specific recognition of their labour.
1.6.2.2.5. Pro: Domestic labour currently receives poor support in society. Instituting a UBI would better support [domestic labourers](http://interactions.eldis.org).
1.6.2.2.5.1. Pro: A UBI can decrease the necessity to work long hours, thus providing working partners more time and energy for domestic labor efforts. This essentially helps both individuals.
1.6.2.2.5.2. Pro: The value of unpaid care in the US is estimated at [$691 billion](http://www.washington.edu/news/2015/06/16/study-reveals-surprising-truths-about-caregivers/); over 4% of GDP.
1.6.2.2.5.2.1. Con: Unpaid care could and should be addressed by targeted programs, rather than a UBI which just indiscriminately provides everyone with money.
1.6.2.2.5.3. Con: Historically, recompense for domestic laborers came in the form of having their basic needs provided for by the partner that worked, therefore UBI isn't necessary.
1.6.2.2.5.3.1. Con: The traditional model has many disadvantages, in particular for the unpaid domestic laborer.
1.6.2.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: The traditional model leaves the unpaid worker vulnerable to abuse and otherwise at the mercy of the provider, who can provide exactly as much or as little as they please, unless the unpaid domestic worker has effective legal recourse.
1.6.2.2.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: An unpaid domestic worker is/was unlikely to have effective legal recourse due to lack of resources under the traditional model.
1.6.2.2.5.4. Con: There are more direct and effective ways to compensate for child/aged care.
1.6.2.2.5.4.1. Pro: In an experiment in an old-age home in Holland, [free housing](http://www.universityherald.com/articles/53852/20161207/dutch-university-students-free-housing-exchange-valuable-service-elderly.htm) was given to students in exchange for time they spend with elderly residents.
1.6.2.2.5.4.2. Pro: Access to healthcare for children and aged populations would be a more effective way at compensating for child/age care as it more specifically addresses the target groups.
1.6.2.2.5.4.3. Pro: Tax deductions or credits for having or adopting children, would be a specific compensation for childcare. This is not only more effective, but also signals that the state values those who take care of their children.
1.6.2.2.5.4.4. Con: Those methods are not mutually exclusive with a UBI; moreover they only compensate for some aspects of raising a child \(healthcare, or 9-5 care\) rather than the entire endeavour.
1.6.2.2.5.5. Con: Unlike employment, a UBI would support all domestic labourers, including the ones that were neglectful of their work.
1.6.2.2.5.5.1. Pro: As domestic labourers receive pay in the form of UBI regardless of how well they work, the incentive to do a good job is lower.
1.6.2.2.5.5.1.1. Con: As the UBI isn't tied to the work of domestic labourers, it doesn't have any effect on their incentives.
1.6.2.2.5.5.1.1.1. Con: The satisfaction of receiving a disposable income could replace the desire to seek satisfaction in other ways, such as through doing a good job as a domestic labourer.
1.6.2.2.5.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.2.5.5.1.1.1.
1.6.2.2.5.5.2. Pro: Domestic labourers shouldn't be rewarded for doing a bad job. However, receiving a disposable income every month would make them feel like they're rewarded for the things they do, regardless of how poorly.
1.6.2.2.5.5.3. Con: The majority of parents are good; to punish them for the actions of the bad ones is unfair.
1.6.2.2.5.5.4. Con: There are plenty of discriminatory systems that can co-exist with a UBI, such as criminal sanctions, child services interventions, and the withdrawal of non-UBI benefits or privileges.
1.6.2.2.5.6. Con: The fact that their valuation of such services is not as high as some would like represents a valid difference in personal priorities and is not a structural imbalance in need of reform.
1.6.2.2.5.6.1. Pro: If this work were of high value to parents, the caretakers of the aged, and the aged themselves, they would be willing to pay for it in proportion to that high value.
1.6.2.2.5.6.2. Con: People cannot be willing to pay money they do not have, as in the case of stay at home parents who either are not provided a fair portion of the family's income, or are simply in a lower-income socioeconomic bracket.
1.6.2.2.5.6.3. Con: Historically, caretaking roles have been undervalued for a number of reasons, including the expectation for women to perform them for free, merely in return for housing and basic necessities \(and often with a side of abuse\). This historical impact has not yet entirely faded.
1.6.2.2.5.6.4. Con: This claim assumes most people are enlightened capitalists able and willing to think in such terms. This is not true. Most people do not make rational purchasing decisions based purely on capitalistic logic and ideals.
1.6.2.2.5.7. Pro: A UBI benefits caregivers and gives a decent life to people with disabilities.
1.6.2.2.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.5.2.1.
1.6.2.2.5.8. Pro: Unpaid labour tends to be highly gendered with the bulk of work expected to be fulfilled by women. In this context it is important to implement systems that support women in these roles and provide greater financial autonomy.
1.6.2.2.5.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.5.7.4.1.1.
1.6.2.2.5.8.2. Pro: A UBI alleviates the stress of insufficient [maternity leave](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ritarubin/2016/04/06/united-states-lags-behind-all-other-developed-countries-when-it-comes-to-paid-maternity-leave/#20f54bd05ada) for expectant mothers and their families.
1.6.2.2.5.8.2.1. Con: The problem of insufficient maternity leave \(which the article notes is a major problem in America\) could be addressed by increasing maternity leave support, rather than providing everyone with unconditional money regardless of whether they likely need it more or less than the average person.
1.6.2.2.6. Pro: With basic needs guaranteed people will be more able to engage with politics and the democratic process.
1.6.2.2.6.1. Pro: If sustainable, a UBI helps keep people invested in the society that is supporting them, leading to less likely chance of revolutionary action.
1.6.2.2.6.2. Pro: A UBI would strengthen democracy. On the one hand, people would not feel as forgotten, but rather as a part of society. On the other hand since there would more free time - it would be a real oppurtunity to take part in democratic processes.
1.6.2.2.6.2.1. Pro: Citizens would have more free time to become politically active/involved.
1.6.2.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: Engaged and involved citizens hold the government accountable and ensure that it is working in the people's best interests.
1.6.2.2.6.2.1.2. Con: Even if it'd be so most of them would rather be involved in quite passive ways - by reading the press, attending meetings with politicians etc. which could lead to an even further expansion of goverment control over them.
1.6.2.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: A UBI would mitigate the current personal financial costs to core democratic activities, such as Jury Duty.
1.6.2.2.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.4.1.1.
1.6.2.2.6.2.3. Pro: The disenfranchised might feel as though somebody actually cares about them, which might even encourage some of the more troubled people to seek help.
1.6.2.2.6.3. Pro: Taking fewer shifts at work may allow people to vote or attend a town hall or a school board meeting. This allows lower income employees time to be more politically engaged in their communities so that they are better able to represent their own interests in government. [\(Berry 2012\)](https://politicsandculture.org/2012/05/02/leisure-the-sacred-gesture-and-human-dignity-thorstein-veblen-and-josef-piepers-understandings-of-leisure/)
1.6.2.2.6.3.1. Pro: Increased political engagement is good because it allows political forces to represent the people more easily. Increased political engagement will also help increase trust in government, leading to a better civil service.
1.6.2.2.6.3.2. Con: Lower income employees lack political representation due to the lobbying power that being wealthy brings, not because they lack the time to be politically engaged.
1.6.2.2.6.3.2.1. Con: Lobbying power is definitely not the only reason. [Turnout inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/14/election2005.constitution) is a reality in most countries, thus regardless of the reasons \(though money and consequently time are probably among the factors\) the poor vote less and are less politically engaged.
1.6.2.2.6.3.2.2. Pro: Universal basic income will allow more people to lobby.
1.6.2.2.6.3.3. Con: Supplementing the income of higher-paid employees with a UBI \(since they would have received zero welfare beforehand\) gives them a greater ability to work less and increases their representation in government, which may work against the interests of lower income persons.
1.6.2.2.6.3.3.1. Con: High-paid employees usually have [high](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneywisewomen/2012/03/21/average-america-vs-the-one-percent/#75150af22395) levels of [spending](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/25/wealthy-americans-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-income-paying-bills), therefore a UBI that is above the poverty line is unlikely to cover their lifestyle if they work less.
1.6.2.2.6.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.2.1.2.
1.6.2.2.6.3.3.3. Con: The relative value of the basic income depends on the recipient. For someone who lacks political and economic power, a supplement of $4000 might change their behaviour. Giving the same supplement to someone who earns more than $100k a year won't buy them any representation they don't already have.
1.6.2.2.6.4. Pro: A UBI ensures that no citizen is forced to choose between earning and income and exercising their democratic right to vote in an election.
1.6.2.3. Con: Welfare redistribution schemes, in general, are unjust. Therefore, a UBI would be the same.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: If taxation is equivalent to, and enforced as a crime, no modern state would be able to function.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: A state that sustains itself by violating the rights and freedoms it was built to defend undermines its purpose.
1.6.2.3.1.1.1. Con: This assumes "defending people's rights and freedoms" is the purpose of a given state. If taxation is indeed theft, then such a state is a paradox - a criminal organisation whose purpose is to protect people from crime.
1.6.2.3.1.2. Con: Read the claim carefully, taxes for an involuntary wealth transfer are equivalent to crime, not all taxes.
1.6.2.3.1.2.1. Con: All taxes are involuntary, because one can't refuse to pay them without threat of governmental violence.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: Given taxation and redistribution policies are widespread, there is no reason to hold a UBI in particular to a different standard.
1.6.2.3.2.1. Con: Prevalence is no proof of legitimacy.
1.6.2.3.2.2. Con: This discussion is about a UBI though. No different standard is held, all wealth redistribution programs are immoral and equivalent to theft.
1.6.2.3.2.3. Con: Not all taxes are immoral. Defense is a service rendered to all people, and it would be near impossible for the military to selectively defend people. Therefore all people should have to pay for that service. Infrastructure, like roads, are a good that all people benefit from, therefore all people should have to pay for that good. Taxes for these purposes are not immoral. but taxes for a wealth redistribution scheme like UBI, welfare, etc. are. UBI isn't being held to a different standard.
1.6.2.3.3. Con: Taxes aren't crimes. They are simply citizens paying for the services their goverment provides.
1.6.2.3.3.1. Con: Any service by definition is something you voluntarily choose to hire and fire at will.
1.6.2.3.3.2. Con: Taxes are the involuntary apropriation of a part of an individual's wealth. A theft is the involuntary apropriation of a part of an individual's wealth. Taxes equal theft, and if society legitimates taxes, it is legitimating theft.
1.6.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Taxes are the legitimate exercise of one of a government's legitimate functions, which is to provide public services from public funds for the maintenance of society. Members within a society exist in that society, not in isolation, and benefit from their position within that society. It is reasonable and ethical for individuals to contribute, and be expected to contribute, towards maintenance of the society they are a part of and benefit from.
1.6.2.3.3.3. Pro: Governments defend people's right to private property, which could otherwise be breached in any number of ways \(theft, financially motivated murder...\) without consequence. In order to provide this protection, it is necessary for governments to source funding somehow. This is the principle behind taxes, which are not immoral in this light.
1.6.2.3.3.3.1. Con: But you've created a false equivalency and a straw man. The claim is that "Taxation for a wealth redistribution scheme is equivalent to crime". Not that all taxes are equivalent to crime. You've chosen a specific tax that actually provides a service to the person paying the tax. In the case of a UBI, the person paying the tax receives no good or service in return.
1.6.2.3.3.4. Con: Note the claim states that taxation specifically for involuntary wealth transfers are EQUIVALENT to crime, in that case specifically theft. More specifically, even if theft wasn't considered a crime for some odd reason\(anarchic society\), it would still be immoral.
1.6.2.3.3.4.1. Con: This claim makes a claim about anarchy that makes no sense. Anarchy doesn't recognize private property, not theft.
1.6.2.3.4. Con: The nature of political power in democratic society is that it involves individuals giving up power over one aspect of your life in order to gain benefits in the other.
1.6.2.3.4.1. Con: Individuals don't give up their power voluntarily, even if they are immensely better off with a democratic society. This is unethical and immoral.
1.6.2.3.4.2. Con: Not all wealthy countries are democratic.
1.6.2.3.4.3. Con: No benefit is gained by the person paying the tax for the UBI. Nor any tax based wealth redistribution program for that matter.
1.6.2.3.5. Con: Taxation is not theft given democracy defines the rule of law. Our law defines what is criminal and what isn't, meaning that legal taxation cannot be seen as a crime.
1.6.2.3.5.1. Pro: The costs and benefits of taxation can hardly be crimes if they exist by the assent of the majority of the voting population.
1.6.2.3.5.1.1. Con: This assumes that democracy and criminality are equivalent to morality. Democracies can and do act in immoral and criminal ways.
1.6.2.3.5.1.2. Con: The majority should not be able to decide what to do with an individual's resources. That's immoral, and demotivational. The US founding fathers recognized that they had to do something to protect minorities, that's why the senate exists.
1.6.2.3.5.2. Con: The claim you're attempting to refute states it is equivalent to crime, not that it is crime. It also doesn't state that all taxation is equivalent to crime, but that wealth redistribution schemes are equivalent to crime.
1.6.2.3.6. Pro: A UBI is a "means to an end" policy, where stealing is justified on the basis of knowing better and only the possibility, but no guarantee, of achieving an ends.
1.6.2.3.6.1. Con: From a [consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) standpoint, taking actions in order to achieve good ends even though those ends are not guaranteed describes all moral action outside of hypothetical situations where perfect knowledge is assumed.
1.6.2.3.7. Con: It could equally be argued that leaving people to suffer and die in poverty is equivalent to a collective societal crime.
1.6.2.3.7.1. Con: This is not a necessary consequence of forgoing a tax-based welfare program. These kinds of programs interfere in the voluntary non-profit/philanthropic sector, as well as the commercial market sector. There is no telling what altruistic and possibly more effective uses a person would have had for that money had it not been taken away from them via taxation.
1.6.2.3.7.1.1. Con: The private market and industries cannot be relied on to ensure the provision of basic human rights and reasonable quality of life.
1.6.2.3.7.2. Con: Rights, responsibilities, and things like crimes can only truly be applied to individuals, not societies. Societies are made up of individuals, but are not the same thing.
1.6.2.3.7.3. Con: Currently speaking, theft is on the books as a crime, not being charitable isn't a crime.
1.6.2.3.8. Pro: Wealth redistribution schemes are unjust because they violate the moral right individuals have over their private property.
1.6.2.3.8.1. Con: Property rights and capital ownership are community assets. Individuals with no property or capital need to be compensated by those who are hoarding these assets.
1.6.2.3.8.1.1. Pro: UBI mediates between the natural right of every human to a part of the earth and its natural resources and the liberal concept of individual ownership of those goods.
1.6.2.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: A UBI is a small step towards remedying the exceedingly imbalanced distribution of wealth generated with Earth's resources.
1.6.2.3.8.1.2. Con: Property rights are community assets but capital and property itself are not community assets. Control of natural resources \(e.g. land, water, spectrum and air\) belongs to the entire society which then sells temporary rights for exclusive use to individuals. Private property is a natural, inalienable right that is not granted by society. Everyone has at least some property; their body. We trade our labor to acquire more property. Our property is not a community asset unless we are slaves.
1.6.2.3.8.1.3. Pro: A UBI is not the redistribution of income from those who earned it to those who did not. A UBI is the redistribution of accumulated wealth from those whose ancestors hoarded it to those whose ancestors have provided the labor and intellectual capital which has created that wealth seance the end of the stone age. A UBI is not a handout, it is inheritance from all of your ancestors for 10,000 years.
1.6.2.3.8.1.4. Con: There is nothing communal about property rights. Only individuals can own things. Even corporations and the government are reduced to individuals when presented as legal entities.
1.6.2.3.8.1.4.1. Con: While it's true that only individuals can own things, property rights are not "things" by any common definition of the word. For example, an individual might hold a copyright on a book but it's a temporary right granted for a limited time by society. Nobody can actually own the story because an idea is not a "thing". Likewise real estate rights are not things. They are a temporary right granted by society. If there is no community, then there are no property rights, there's just property.
1.6.2.3.8.2. Pro: Anybody has the moral right to keep what they have worked for and legally obtained. A UBI robs people of their labor and private property \(i.e. money\) and gives it to those who haven't earned it.
1.6.2.3.8.2.1. Pro: UBI requires redistribution of fairly earned income from those who require "assistance" to those who do not.
1.6.2.3.8.2.1.1. Con: Not if it is financed from sources other than income taxes \(machine tax, carbon tax, funds from social security programs that would become obsolete, taxes on financial speculation, stimulus packages that are supposed to "trickle down" to the middle class\).
1.6.2.3.8.2.1.2. Con: This statement effectively says that those with income are the ones that need assistance. The fundamental tenet of civil society, and ultimately its purpose, is that we help each other survive. We do that by giving of ourselves when we can to others that need it. Meaning we take from those that can earn income and give it to those who can't. This is either poorly written or idealogically incongruent with the goal of living together.
1.6.2.3.8.2.2. Con: This argument is based on a vision of human nature that is not further elaborated upon. Instead of advocating for a greedy nature, I would plea for a social nature that is core to human being. In the end, people do like to share what they have both with their beloved ones and strangers. A UBI would not kill productivity or rob the laborer, but instead answer to a key feature of human nature.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3. Con: In nature, only the strongest person has that right — they can take anything from anyone else. Societies exist because of the collective recognition that such a state of anarchy is unjust and unproductive; and so they construct a legal system that protects the vulnerable from random acts of violence. The laws that enable these protections are the only 'rights' that exist.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.1. Con: Capitalism is not a zero-sum game. Everybody gets something from an exchange. Even those you would call "weak."
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.1.1. Con: Assuming rational actors, both only benefit if the opposite party has no control over what you can put on the negotiating table. This restriction is something we have written into the law, the courts, and the application of that law.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The fact that exchanges within the system is better for everyone, says nothing about the system as a whole. 
Capitalism removes access to most property from most people by allowing individual ownership of all things. So while two people trading to get what they want, more than what they already have, makes both better off, the property system that dictates the distribution of property makes most people worse off prior to the trade.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.1.2. Con: Trades or market transactions, are both not unique to capitalism. Capitalism is the result of our property laws.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.2. Con: If society as a whole decides what constitutes a law, then we cannot critique any of the rights it creates — anything that the collective implements is thus tautologically good.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.2.1. Con: This is a non sequitur. If there is a Constitutional majority that decides on what is a "right", it becomes one. The original claim was about what was A right, not what was right.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.2.2. Con: Society's laws are based on authorities such as divinity, or reason, and through those authorities it can be attacked, but these systems don't argue for unchangeable property rights to support people to the determent of all.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.2.3. Con: Society may be persuaded to change its mind. Most societies permit discussing forbidden acts  — at least up to a point.
1.6.2.3.8.2.3.3. Con: You don't have to construct a "legal system" which upholds "rights" either. At least you don't have to use that language. There can be a group of people who organize a self-defense squad to protect each other and their property.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4. Con: This argument can be equally applied to all forms of taxes. Yet taxes exist in nearly every society because their collective value overrides the individual harms.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1. Con: The question is, however, whether the problem lies in the argument, or in the assumptions made on the necessity of those taxes.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1. Con: Few people would argue for the removal of the military, the police, public road, or the sewer, and most of those that act upon this belief quickly die as a result of their lack of these facilities. Maintaining those takes money, and that money has to come from somewhere.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Many services have historically been provided through collective action. These kind of systems could return or be rejuvenated.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There have been historical cases of polycentric legal systems, where even the writing and administering of law was in essence [privatized](http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/JurisPoly.html).
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: These laws always existed in addition to, not instead of, actual law.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Commercial examples are effectively contracts, and as such require consideration not only for a person to be entered into the contract, but for the existing members of the contract to grant outsiders the protections of this contract, if these are not granted, abuse will happen.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Mutual respect doesn't keep criminals from robbing one's house, murdering you, or just about anything else, it has no enforcement mechanism for failure cases, and relying solely on it would be a disaster.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: There are many thieves, but few murderers. Clearly there is at least some aspect of mutual respect common to humanity that means we rarely cause each other grievous harm.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The warlords of Japan and Europe might have repelled foreign invaders, but they definitely killed, and took advantage of those they 'protected'.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If warlords did not draw some profit from those they protect, they could not afford to offer that protection.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.3. Con: There has also been someone that [tried to privitize public parking](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=412240643). Just because a thing can be privatized does not at all mean it is best for the public.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.4. Pro: Roads have often been built or maintained by collective action, often in the form of toll roads.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Toll roads are often disliked by the public.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Observation shows that putting a toll on a road reduces usage. See, for example: [Lindsey R. "Congestion Relief: Assessing the Case for Road Tolls in Canada." C.D. Howe Institute](https://cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed//commentary_248.pdf)
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Protests against tolls are not uncommon. For example, in the first month of 2018, the following protests were reported: [Lekki Toll Hike Area Boys smash phones and cameras as Lagosians protest new fares](http://www.pulse.ng/news/local/area-boys-disrupt-lekki-toll-protests-in-lagos-id7959535.html), [Gurugram residents take to streets to protest against toll plaza](http://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/civic-issues/article/gurugram-residents-take-to-streets-to-protest-against-toll-plaza/190828), and[Bayside Group To Protest Gov. Cuomo's Congestion Pricing Plan](https://patch.com/new-york/bayside/bayside-group-protest-gov-cuomos-congestion-pricing-plan).
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Political parties often try to win votes by promising to reduce \(or subsidise\) tolls. For example, in order to win support in Western Sydney seats, the NSW Labor Party, in Australia, committed the State to providing a cashback on tolls that has, so far, cost over $1.5 billion AUD.[Taxpayer bill for cashback scheme on Sydney toll roads hits $1.5 billion - and climbing](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/taxpayer-bill-for-cashback-scheme-on-sydney-toll-roads-hits-15-billion--and-climbing-20161207-gt6hiq.html)
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.4.1.4. Con: When costs are concentrated and benefits are spread thin and wide, those carrying the cost are usually louder than those who enjoy the benefit, which distorts perceptions.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.5. Pro: Power companies - like Edison's electricity company - have often been private, even when building substantial public infrastructure.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Power companies such as Edison were dangerous monopolies that ignored public safety to the point of giving [the Dodgers their name](https://gizmodo.com/the-la-dodgers-got-their-name-from-brooklyns-deadly-str-1687077696), and [suffocating innovation](http://jawadonweb.com/?page_id=900), all while using public resources.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The claim that "power companies have often been private" \(true though it is\) does not support its parent claim \("many service has been provided through collective action"\)
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.1.2. Con: The value of money is determined by the demand for it. A UBI lowers the people's demand for money and increases the government's demand for it, thus making people's money more valuable to the government via taxes. The less purchasing power the money has, the less valuable it is. Therefore, the government and businesses will be expected to provide more and better services with a UBI for the same price. A high marginal tax ensures a continuous supply of money for UBI disbursements.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.1.2. Con: Yes but your con is being applied to the argument that taxes are unjust in a general sense, and does not take into account the context of the tax \(e.g., to pay for UBI\). Your claim is infact a pro to the above claim, not a con.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.2. Pro: It could be equally claimed to be illegitimate to take income from A to help pay for B's security; for the courts used to enforce their rights; or for the use of other public goods that are available to all but are used disproportionately by some.
1.6.2.3.8.2.4.2.1. Con: Paying for someone's \(B\) security is legitimate only when B can't work for a living. Disproportional redistribution is the price we have to pay to know that we can count on help should we need it. It is like an insurance we pay for our comfort.
1.6.2.3.8.2.5. Con: In almost every UBI proposal, laborers stand to gain the most, and those looking for labor are provided freedom to seek it.
1.6.2.3.8.2.5.1. Con: This generalizes labor. Some laborers stand to 'lose' \(with higher marginal tax rates\) and some laborers stand to 'win' \(those who are at dead-end jobs to make ends meet\).
1.6.2.3.8.2.5.1.1. Con: Not many people are too concerned about slightly inconveniencing rich people, even if they are working rich people.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6. Pro: UBI may sound nice in theory, but any political theory which is developed without putting human nature into consideration can never successfully be employed. Given people's inherent selfishness, the better idea is to let people keep what they've earned as much as possible.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.1. Con: Human nature includes both competitive and cooperative aspects as outlined by [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). So while this statement considers the compete nature of humanity it fails to consider the cooperate nature of humanity as well.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.2. Con: The notion of "letting people keep what they've earned as much as possible" has led to the macroeconomic situation for which we propose the remedy of UBI in the first place.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.3. Con: Progressive taxation for the purpose of redistribution is being employed successfully nearly everywhere in the world.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.4. Con: It may not be possible for people to earn much in the first place, even if they put in a lot of effort and time towards such an earning, due to random chance \(like getting hit by a car in winter or cancer\). A UBI helps soften these blows from random chance by providing at least some form of security to the populace.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.5. Con: Part of "human nature" is the ability to reason, think rationally and change one's own mind; a capacity for improvement which could be used to accept and embrace a UBI, if indeed one wasn't part of the many who would already welcome and embrace such a thing.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.6. Pro: As nature does not guarantee human beings subsistence without labor, a UBI is a violation of natural law and fosters complacency. This leads to social disorder.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.6.1. Con: Nature supplies water and food without labor, it isn't a necessity in nature so UBI wouldn't violate any law. Theres no reason to think UBI would lead to social disorder behavior if those peoples life is provided by that same society.
1.6.2.3.8.2.6.6.2. Con: Humans already employ a wide variety of "unnatural" technologies and techniques in their day to day lives. There is no reason for humans \(or human societies\) to deliberately restrict themselves on the grounds of what is "\(un\)natural".
1.6.2.3.8.2.7. Pro: A UBI, like other welfare programs, involves many taking money from a few. The many have no right to take from the few just because they want it.
1.6.2.3.8.2.7.1. Con: The few don't have the right to take the amount of money they do from the many, that doesn't stop them.
1.6.2.3.8.2.7.2. Con: Capitalism is based upon expoitation of workers, as exploitation is the only way that a firm can make a profit \(see Marx\). Under our current laws, the few have the "right" to take from the many, but this is far removed from what is ethical.
1.6.2.3.8.2.7.3. Con: This assumes 'rights' are god-given, and not enshrined under law \(51% of people\) or Constitution \(67% of people\).
1.6.2.3.8.2.7.4. Con: There are many ethical and philosophical systems which believe the greatest good for the most people should be served as much as possible.
1.6.2.3.8.2.7.5. Con: 'Just because they want it' is not the principle upon which UBI rests. Rather, it rests on the principle that all economic surplus was created in part with some externalized costs \(unfairly\) borne by the populace as a whole. Thus, some of all wealth earned should be redistributed across the population in order to balance this inequality. UBI is a direct means to do this.
1.6.2.3.8.2.8. Con: In a world in which labor is replaced by capital \(machine, robots, etc.\) in production processes, an ever greater share of income is generated by machines. These can be taxed heavily without robbing people of their labor.
1.6.2.3.8.2.9. Con: If 'worked for' is a precondition to income, then inheritances should be outlawed. Earnings from dividends are also called into question, since it's the labor of others utilizing your capital that is creating the surplus - not your own labor. You would have to eliminate these forms of income \(and others\) to use this argument.
1.6.2.3.8.2.9.1. Pro: Investment and speculation falls into a similar "unearned" category, by this logic.
1.6.2.3.8.2.9.1.1. Con: Liberal ideology would suggest that investment returns are a result of risk managing.
1.6.2.3.8.2.10. Con: Workers are robbed of the fruits of their labor each time a profit is earned by a boss.
1.6.2.3.8.2.10.1. Con: Workers sell their time. By definition, no-one would buy that time, unless they can make a profit, so employment is most commonly a win-win exchange, not a win-lose exchange. This doesn't mean that employment cannot be exploitative, but profit is better understood as one party's share of benefits jointly earned. Even if that share is larger than would be fair, that still falls short of being theft.
1.6.2.3.8.2.11. Con: Society affords its members certain benefits. Taxes, to a degree, can be considered payment for these favorable circumstances provided to the individual.
1.6.2.3.8.2.12. Con: "A UBI robs people of their labor and gives it to those who haven't earned it" 
That's capitalism. The current winners are capitalists. Under UBI, the winners will be, on the whole, closer to 'everyone.'
1.6.2.3.8.2.13. Pro: If our economic system is inherently unjust, we should work on ways to improve how our economy rewards good behavior and punishes bad behaviour; rather than seeking to force a minimum standard of living in a way that decouples economic reward from productivity.
1.6.2.3.8.2.13.1. Con: The only way to have control over what our society deems worthy is through state intervention. This would lead to less freedom not more.
1.6.2.3.8.2.13.1.1. Pro: But if you believe that human freedom is a core ideal, than oneself should be the ultimate decider on what behavior contributes to society. A UBI would provide precisely that freedom to people.
1.6.2.3.8.2.13.2. Con: Seeking a minimum standard of living for everybody is required to comply with human rights and has nothing to do with economy.
1.6.2.3.8.2.13.3. Con: Not everyone will agree on what constitutes "good behaviour" and "bad behaviour", and to impose such standards would often lead to violations of freedom.
1.6.2.3.8.2.14. Con: Suggesting that people are only entitled to what they have worked for only produces a reasonable outcome in a society with no involuntary unemployment.
1.6.2.3.8.2.15. Con: This implies that the collective from which you receive benefit and a multiplier effect from has no right to charge for use of collective property. The property which allowed you to earn that income in the first place.
1.6.2.3.8.3. Con: The right to basic living conditions is a more important than the right to private property.
1.6.2.3.8.4. Con: We already do pay taxes to help support those who can't support themselves. This is just a different method of distributing that help.
1.6.2.3.8.5. Con: If a UBI was funded through taxation, it would be a legitimate government service.
1.6.2.3.9. Con: Permitting suffering and death due to poverty is cruel and immoral too. It should be weighed out against the cons of a UBI to see if it's worthwhile to have.
1.6.2.3.9.1. Con: UBI is economic suicide and will put more people in poverty when it quickly becomes unaffordable and the country defaults on its debt.
1.6.2.3.9.2. Con: Not all systems of ethics consider "allowing suffering" \(not helping\) to be immoral. [For more information see this article on supererogation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supererogation/).
1.6.2.3.9.3. Con: Some systems of ethics consider "allowing suffering" \(not helping\) as less immoral then "confiscating goods" \(harming\). See for example the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing harm \(DDA\) [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/)
1.6.2.3.9.4. Pro: Under [consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) systems of ethics, permitting a death to occur through inaction may be considered morally equivalent to killing a person, because the consequences are the same.
1.6.2.3.10. Pro: -> See discussion #7734: Taxation is theft
1.6.2.3.11. Pro: Forced redistribution is in conflict with the right to the pursuit of happiness. If people are equal in this right, they cannot be forced to spend their time \(money\) for others just because they are rich or successful \(unless they do any harm to someone\). If the rich are forced to give money to the poor, then their pursuit of happiness \(they demonstratively choose wealth to achieve happiness\) is sacrificed for someone else's comfort.
1.6.2.4. Pro: A UBI reduces the stigma of social welfare, because the payments are distributed to everyone in society.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: Stigma is caused by a certain thing's association with low status individuals or groups: in a society with a mature UBI tradition, and perhaps in one where UBI is new as well, being known to rely on UBI would be just as shameful as relying on welfare is in the real world.
1.6.2.4.1.1. Con: Money is inherently fungible, so the source is readily obscured where necessary, while foodstamps are obviously foodstamps.
1.6.2.4.2. Con: A UBI will entrench stigmas against several social groups rather than remove them.
1.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: Stigma likely [arises](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=SOPSL7y4cRYC&pg=RA1-PT121&lpg=RA1-PT121&dq=welfare+stigma+taxpayer+resentment&source=bl&ots=LKEKmQKU_Z&sig=1hRl3JJ3nS6Mv5H6GOjzM96EEDQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXrMzPosDQAhUOR48KHYepDzMQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=welfare%20stigma%20taxpayer%20resentment&f=false) from individuals being unable to work or being perceived as taking more from the collective resource pool than they give.
1.6.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: This perception is getting traction in states experiencing an electoral backlash against liberal values.
1.6.2.4.2.2. Pro: A UBI might add to anti-immigration sentiments, as citizens will likely be concerned with immigrants taking advantage of this system. This makes the lives of immigrants and perceived immigrants worse.
1.6.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: UBI guaranteed to any citizen creates greater economical inequality between citizens and non-citizens, be it foreign students, refuges or other migrants
1.6.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: The cost of financing incomes for migrants is difficult to justify politically. This is likely to cause migrants to be treated like second class citizens who will be further neglected by the lack of social institutions.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.1. Con: UBI is a scalable system. It is scalable as long as the taxes paying for it balances out with the increase in people receiving it. Enough immigrants contribute to innovation and companies to pay the immigrants that don't.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.2. Con: A large percentage of immigrants would not be economically dependent on the UBI due to the realities of most immigration systems, which give preferences to migrants with wealth, high levels of education, etc.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Economically dependent or not - once accepted as citizens those immigrants would receive a UBI as well.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.3. Con: Even where some immigrants are dependent on the UBI \(refugees, asylum seekers\) the overwhelming majority of all UBI payments are directed to local citizens rather than incoming immigrants.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.4. Con: This perception leads countries to not accept immigrants when they are needed to provide labor. Not only is this bad for immigrants, but also the countries that need them.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.4.1. Con: If someone comes to a new country to work, they will inevitably pay tax, therefore supporting the overall system, including a UBI. If that work finishes and they choose to remain, they should be  entitled to receive UBI themselves.
1.6.2.4.2.2.2.4.2. Pro: UBI on a national level would create a very exclusive nationhood, and could cause strong differences between citizens and non-citizens living in a country. Freedom of movement could suffer as xenophobia for social envy would arise.
1.6.2.4.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.6.4.1.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4. Con: A UBI is not likely to lead to anti-immigrant sentiment because it ensures that opportunities exist for all individuals, not just immigrants.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: Xenophobia [is often a response](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=edpsychpapers) to a lack of economic resources and opportunity; thus a UBI will increase social cohesion.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: Many pilot schemes have found that UBI [increases social cohesion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/universal-basic-income-wi_b_8354072.html) through community empowerment and mobilisation.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Alaska's long-running UBI scheme has contributed to it having the highest rate of well-being of any state across indicators that [include social and community well-being](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/162029/file-2513997715-pdf/Well-Being_Index/2014_Data/Gallup-Healthways_State_of_American_Well-Being_2014_State_Rankings.pdf?t=1437575309454).
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.2. Con: A UBI may only exacerbate existing trends in social cohesion. In relatively communal countries, it may build ties; [but in individualistic ones, it may actually increase the level of individualism](https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/max-harris/will-universal-basic-income-make-us-lonely).
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.3. Con: Providing all citizens with the means to be self-sufficient decreases the need for individuals to engage with the community through work.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Even if citizens do not engage with the community through work, there are many other ways: local associations, volunteering, leisure activities, sport, local festivities, etc.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.4. Con: Redirecting welfare spending from community services \(such as [soup kitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_kitchen) or free healthcare clinics\) towards individual income supplements would erode much community infrastructure that builds ties between strangers.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.4.1. Con: When every citizen has the means to pay for food, education or healthcare, some of these services are no longer necessary.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.5.2.4.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.6. Con: Pilots are not universal. Basic income works well for small populations that benefit from the 'hard' economy in the rest of the world, and in developing countries where income is very low.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.1.7. Con: [The article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/universal-basic-income-wi_b_8354072) is not about UBI schemes, it is about giving money to the poor people - with expectable result. Discussion about cost side of the problem is missing completely. People who are forced to give away their money might reduce social cohesion.
1.6.2.4.2.2.4.1.2. Con: Inequality is also supported by the [demonization](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review) and mischaracterisation of the poor by the middle and upper-classes. Those who do not lack opportunity and resources employ that tactic to maintain their superiority.
1.6.2.4.2.2.5. Con: Anti-immigrant sentiment will not occur because in order to gain the status of having a UBI, one needs to be registered either as a permanent resident or citizen of that government. Immigrants who do not pay taxes would not receive government benefits such as the UBI.
1.6.2.4.2.2.5.1. Con: Even if this is true, most immigrants strive to eventually achieve legal status, and subsequent citizenship benefits. This backlash still hurts them a lot.
1.6.2.4.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: For example, it likely harms efforts to grant visas and/or amnesty to illegal immigrants.
1.6.2.4.2.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: A UBI replacing current forms of welfare would make it harder for immigrants to become naturalized citizens.
1.6.2.4.2.2.6. Con: The economic benefits that migrants give by spending money in the system lead to far more benefits than their consumption of government expenditure costs.
1.6.2.4.2.2.6.1. Pro: Many undocumented workers pay tax despite not being eligible for many government assistance programs. On net they [contributed $12 billion to the US economy in 2010](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf).
1.6.2.4.2.2.6.2. Pro: Immigrants "[grease the wheels of the labor market by flowing into industries and areas where there is a relative need for workers](http://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/north-american-century/benefits-of-immigration-outweigh-costs.html)" and generate rises in income for both migrants and citizens.
1.6.2.4.2.2.7. Con: The claim that immigrants rely on the system is contingent on the fact that these immigrants contribute nothing to the economy, which is false.
1.6.2.4.2.2.7.1. Pro: Once migrants have the chance to work, they would pay taxes as everybody else. In this sense, nobody could claim that they don't deserve a UBI.
1.6.2.4.2.2.7.1.1. Con: This perception leads countries to not accept immigrants when they are needed to provide labor. Not only is this bad for immigrants, but also the countries that need them.
1.6.2.4.2.2.7.2. Pro: The majority of [immigrants](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/what-immigrants-say-about-life-united-states) have and value a 'strong work ethic', which often means they work long hours and many jobs. Even with a UBI, this work ethic is likely to continue.
1.6.2.4.2.2.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.2.2.2.4.
1.6.2.4.2.2.8. Con: Most anti-immigrant sentiment comes from people who feel that their own economic security is threatened. If they did not have to worry about their own livelihood anymore, they would likely perceive other people living a decent life in their proximity as less of a threat.
1.6.2.4.2.3. Pro: Middle class individuals who imagine themselves to be hardworking will feel resentment at having a vastly increased tax rate to fund UBI payments for discriminated minorities.
1.6.2.4.3. Con: A UBI assigns a specific and clear monetary value to welfare, which feeds into classist rhetoric, making easier for some people to complain about wastefulness.
1.6.2.4.4. Pro: Those most in need are spared the degrading experience of pleading with welfare officers on a regular basis to demonstrate that they fit into specific categories.
1.6.2.4.4.1. Con: Given the harmful effects of poverty in general, having to justify your need \(even in a degrading way\) is far from the biggest issue facing the poor.
1.6.2.4.4.2. Con: It is often quite simple to prove that one is entitled to a welfare payout by providing proof of unemployment, or showing an insufficient income.
1.6.2.4.4.3. Con: Communities are organized geographically based on socio-economic conditions and it is often an entire neighborhood that is on welfare. Proving one is part of a specific category is less degrading, because perceptively it is seen as a common experience, rather than a uniquely degrading one.
1.6.2.4.4.4. Con: We can likely tailor the current system to make admittance into a welfare program a more private affair done electronically or by mail.
1.6.2.4.5. Pro: Targeted welfare often entrenches Darwinian narratives about those in poverty, particularly where ethnic minorities are overwhelmingly overrepresented in those statistics. This increases discrimination in social interactions and also reduces political capital for useful measures.
1.6.2.4.5.1. Con: It is more realistic that targeted welfare entrenches the narrative that there are specific groups of people who are in special need of assistance, and that it is the state's obligation to assist these people, not that this assistance is a result of some kind of evolutionary deficit.
1.6.2.4.5.2. Con: Seeing which minority groups correlate with the type of, and need for, welfare, provides us with valuable data about how much inequality still exists in society. A UBI limits our ability to gain and use this data to fight said inequality.
1.6.2.4.5.2.1. Con: Government studies and surveys about income distribution across the population are still a powerful tool to determine inequality. Those studies can still be conducted with a UBI.
1.6.2.4.5.2.2. Con: A UBI may limit data that demonstrates inequality, but only to the extent that it actually reduces inequality.
1.6.2.4.6. Pro: Middle class voters are more likely to accept a tax hike for a UBI because they will actually see some return from this policy.
1.6.2.4.6.1. Con: If the tax hike is higher than the UBI payout, middle class voters are paying more than they are receiving, and will know that their money is going to people who may not even be working. This in turn reinforces stigmas against the poor.
1.6.2.5. Pro: A UBI would compensate people for the injustice created by the institution of private property.
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.3.8.1.
1.6.2.5.2. Pro: According to [Marxist thought](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/capitalism-and-unemployment-%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%94-marxist-view), capitalism is predatory by nature and requires poverty. One cannot be on top if there is no one at the bottom.
1.6.2.5.2.1. Pro: Marxist economics suggests that unemployment is a [permanent feature of capitalism](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/capitalism-and-unemployment-%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%94-marxist-view), as capitalism requires a permanent reserve army of labour. Unemployment is one of the [most common causes](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/unemployment-creates-poverty/) of poverty.
1.6.2.6. Pro: A UBI enhances the freedom and dignity of individuals.
1.6.2.6.1. Pro: Only a UBI can guarantee that every person is provided the basic amount of resources needed to survive.
1.6.2.6.1.1. Con: Alternatively, basic resources could be provided in-kind \(government-issued food, health care, shelter\). A UBI is not the only way to accomplish that aim.
1.6.2.6.1.1.1. Con: To be provided in-kind by the government would require a much higher cost due to the increased bureaucracy than simply giving people the money to do this themselves.
1.6.2.6.1.1.2. Con: This would limit the services able to be accessed by lower income people to the government supplied and would remove the free market advantages and personal choice
1.6.2.6.1.1.3. Con: This would provide a similar stigma to current government programs such as 'food stamps'
1.6.2.6.1.2. Con: Each person's basic amount of resources needed can vary, especially when it comes to healthcare. A person may still be precluded from required, costly medical treatments if the UBI is not high enough.
1.6.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: Funds from a UBI are not likely to be enough to cover the rising costs of healthcare or emergency visits.
1.6.2.6.1.2.1.1. Con: In developed countries people on low-incomes do not typically pay for their own health care. Even in the US there are medicaid provisions and the [costs of emergency visits are passed on](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/who-bears-the-cost-of-the-uninsured-nonprofit-hospitals).
1.6.2.6.1.2.1.2. Con: A UBI could increase in line with an index that tracks the cost of living \(including healthcare\).
1.6.2.6.1.2.1.3. Pro: Emergency visits in the US on average cost [$1,233](http://blog.bcbsnc.com/2014/04/5-emergency-room-myths-busted/). This would take a substantial amount from the monthly UBI payments to cover.
1.6.2.6.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The state is not covering the cost of this care for the vast majority of people under the status quo anyway.
1.6.2.6.1.2.2. Con: In many developed countries, healthcare is free at the point of need. In others, UBI would enable more people to afford health insurance. Even though UBI will not solve every problem, it may still be much more effective than current systems.
1.6.2.6.1.2.3. Con: The UBI money would still provide part of the healthcare cost, thereby making the rest more affordable. It would be much better than nothing.
1.6.2.6.1.3. Con: Supplying basic resources does not guarantee happiness or contentment.
1.6.2.6.1.3.1. Con: True, but a lack of basic resources guarantees ill health and intense stress that prevents someone from persuing the endeavours that do make happiness and contentment more likely.  See [Maslow's heirarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Hierarchy).
1.6.2.6.1.4. Pro: Universal Basic Income would allow everyone the opportunity to survive regardless of their ability to work and/or skills, training, etc.
1.6.2.6.1.4.1. Pro: Without work for income, one must resort to begging or theft to survive. If one is unable to even do those things, they would surely perish.
1.6.2.6.1.5. Con: A UBI may only guarantee that [the citizens](https://basicincome.org/news/2016/09/reconciling-ubi-immigration-concerns/) of a country get the resources necessary for survival. The aim of welfare should be to provide every resident, including non-citizens, with the means to fulfill their basic needs.
1.6.2.6.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.4.2.2.
1.6.2.6.1.6. Pro: UBI frees individuals from the constant worry of keeping their heads above water. This liberation from survival-mode encourages positive economic education, familial stability and increased joy. The psychic costs of a lifetime's survival  must be accounted for, and remedied.
1.6.2.6.1.7. Pro: A UBI will give the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society a little bit of housing security, which many have never had.
1.6.2.6.1.7.1. Con: This is more an argument for voluntary charity or means-tested social programs as it is for UBI, because extreme cases of poverty are relatively rare, and could be better dealt with programs aimed at that specific situation.
1.6.2.6.1.7.1.1. Pro: In the US, the number of chronically homeless individuals in 2018 was about [97k](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-report/). That's roughly 0,03% of the total population of [329 million](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/united-states-population/).
1.6.2.6.1.7.2. Pro: We are in "winner takes all" societies. Top performers capture a disproportionate share of the value created. In many professions, such as those related to arts, sports, or entertainment, there is a long tail of people which can't afford basic needs such as housing.
1.6.2.6.2. Con: A UBI would further erode individual liberty and responsibility, leading to more government control over citizens.
1.6.2.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.5.1.
1.6.2.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.3.1.
1.6.2.6.2.3. Pro: The incentives that a UBI provides to having children may lead to government-mandated breeding restrictions or forceful sterilizations to prevent certain groups from having children; a move that would harshly curtail [people's reproductive liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights).
1.6.2.6.2.3.1. Con: Even when security is provided the [birthrate stabilizes below the replacement rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#Fertility_J-curve) independently of culture.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2. Con: Given existing welfare schemes often result in parents being criticised for having children \(and thus receiving extra assistance payouts\) a UBI is likely to dramatically increase this effect and potentially lead to greater disincentives to having children.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.2. Pro: A UBI could lead to population control, as there can't be even the most basic income for everyone if the population gets big enough.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.3. Con: Planet Earth is overpopulated. A reduction in \(unsustainable\) birth rate in the mid-term could be considered an advantage of UBI, and could also allow room for population redistribution from more overpopulated regions.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: Later on, birth rates may increase closer to the replacement rate again when Earth and humans are under less resource strain, and the need for more people is more apparent, as opposed to there being a general knowledge of the overpopulated state of the world among educated people.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.3.1.1. Con: That there is "a general knowledge of the overpopulated state of the world among educated people" is a baseless assertion.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.3.2. Con: Depopulating one country so that people from another country can spread into the depopulated area is a policy that's been tried before, and is usually not good for the receiving country - empires throughout history have done this, but the most memorable policy to have this aspect as a focus in particular was the German concept of [Lebensraum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum).
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.4. Con: UBI may incentivise population growth to an unsustainable level since it removes the need to provide for the basic necesities of children.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.5. Con: Even if people would be highly criticised for having children if a UBI would be functional - it would rather lead to an increase in population, as extra money from the government for having children now leads to.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6. Pro: A UBI is likely to increase births. Having more children [increases](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com//2009/08/07/having-children-brings-high-carbon-impact/) a family's carbon footprint, particularly in developed Western countries. Thus any policies that encourage this should be avoided for the preservation and health of the planet.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.1.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.2. Pro: An uncontrolled fertility rate has already been the reason for governmental intervention, e.g. [China's One Child Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy), to contain the negative environmental and socioeconomic consequences.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.2.1. Con: A fertility increment - which in many countries is necessary to insure the rate of natural increase \([RNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_natural_increase)\) - is not an “uncontrolled fertility rate”. Moreover, the attempts to control birth rates by forced and brutal methods such the policies implemented in China have had [disastrous](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/chinas-onechild-policy-a-demographic-disaster/news-story/5a71127133138acec2644df76f01d9b0) demographical consequences.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.8.2.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.4. Con: US birth rate versus income refutes this claim entirely. Well-off people [have fewer kids](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241530/birth-rate-by-family-income-in-the-us/) so UBI will reduce birth rates.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.5. Con: While the claim that poverty is correlated, casually or not, with lower birthrates is dubious at best, even if the point is conceded, the solution to overpopulation surely cannot be opposition to proposals which aim to reduce poverty.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.5.1. Pro: Increasing poverty - or deliberately not reducing it where one could - as a solution to overpopulation is not far removed from a "kill the poor" solution.
1.6.2.6.2.3.2.6.6. Con: This argument implies that any amount of human suffering is acceptable if it reduces the birth rate.
1.6.2.6.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.
1.6.2.6.2.3.4. Pro: Since people can breed far beyond their means to acquire the resources of others, this may create resentment and a population beyond current capacities, leading to resentment and fights over resources. Since people are enabled to breed beyond their means they will then become a target for restrictions due to resource limitations or disruptions to quality of life from a surge of new children.
1.6.2.6.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.2.3.1.
1.6.2.6.2.4. Con: A restructuring of social programming into simple cash transfers allow people to decide what the money is spent on, rather than bureaucrats deciding for them. This enhances individual liberty and autonomy.
1.6.2.6.2.4.1. Con: Aside from a minarchist system there is no form of governance where no negative rights are infringed. There can be no individual liberty when people are forced by the government to transfer money to others \(coercive redistribution\).
1.6.2.6.2.4.1.1. Con: Individual liberty must be protected by some organization at some expense, as there are many individuals who would otherwise be willing to infringe others' rights for their own benefit. Therefore, some form of government is necessary and essential for protecting individuals' rights.
1.6.2.6.2.5. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.6.2.1.
1.6.2.6.2.6. Pro: There may be rules implemented in which an individual loses their right to their UBI based on certain circumstances or actions, making a tool to control behavior.
1.6.2.6.2.6.1. Con: Current social programs already do that. Current private contracts do that, as well.
1.6.2.6.2.6.1.1. Con: Just because other programs do this does not mean other programs ought to do it.
1.6.2.6.2.6.1.1.1. Con: It is probably wrong for existing programs, and individuals to exploit people, but this isn't a reason not to have a new program that might exploit people when all the existing ones definitely do.
1.6.2.6.2.6.1.2. Con: A UBI would be applied to a wider group, therefore it would affect more people and, by that lead to a greater erosion of liberty.
1.6.2.6.2.6.2. Pro: It is hardly a violation of due process for the government to regulate that of which is subsidises, i.e. the mandatory drug tests now [mandatory for those on welfare in Australia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-22/welfare-recipients-could-face-drug-tests-as-early-as-january/8827288). The same draconian laws could come to apply to all under a UBI.
1.6.2.6.2.6.3. Con: That wouldn't be a Universal Basic Income, then, as it would lose the Universal aspect.
1.6.2.6.2.6.4. Con: The conditions imposed upon current welfare recipients \(drugs testing; forced budgeting\) would be unpalatable if extended outside the lower classes. Thus they are unlikely to ever be conditions of a universal benefit.
1.6.2.6.2.6.5. Con: In that case, it cannot be really called an UBI, it would just be another welfare program. UBI as a program is only relevant if it is truly universal. Even people in the prison system should be entitled to an UBI, even if they cannot use it while they are in jail. This would provide them with either a way to help their families during incarceration or small savings for when they leave the prison, reducing recidivism.
1.6.2.6.2.7. Pro: The UBI would extend the reach of a government to the economic affairs of citizens.
1.6.2.6.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.3.1.
1.6.2.6.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.6.2.1.
1.6.2.6.2.7.3. Con: Having welfare programs actually puts the government in control of the citizens' lives, as welfare promotes doing nothing because people who work more, get less. With a UBI, people who work more, get more.
1.6.2.6.2.7.3.1. Con: It is not strictly true to say that people who work more get less under welfare programs. There are many jobs which pay more than welfare programs.
1.6.2.6.2.7.3.2. Pro: Welfare programs are designed to apply only to individuals with a specific income or less, which means that effectively, if a person on welfare is able to improve its income by only a couple of dollars above the cut, they will no longer qualify for welfare, eliminating a large portion of their income. This is an incentive for people to never to reach this point, effectively converting welfare into a way to limit the desire of people to progress.
1.6.2.6.2.7.4. Con: Citizens would continue to have the exact same power they have now: elect a new government that may or may not make changes to the UBI program.
1.6.2.6.2.8. Con: A UBI cannot erode personal liberty as it affords choice where none before existed. A UBI does not erode responsibility as it compels those previously without means to be responsible for utilising this new resource within their life.
1.6.2.6.2.8.1. Con: A UBI would be given to everybody, so it would also target those, who now have responsibility of earning at least a minimum of money to survive and erode that responsibility.
1.6.2.6.3. Pro: A UBI will reduce discrimination by empowering groups that traditionally lack influence due to economic barriers.
1.6.2.6.3.1. Pro: With a UBI, these groups now have the capital to receive an education and pursue high-skilled jobs. This will help remedy the lack of skilled professionals in minority communities.
1.6.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: Access to education and the ability to lift oneself from one class to another are more easily achieved when one has basic needs accounted for.
1.6.2.6.3.1.2. Pro: Minority doctors are more likely [to return to their communities](http://commonhealth.legacy.wbur.org/2012/02/minority-doctors-diversity) and service those who traditionally do not have access to medical care.
1.6.2.6.3.2. Pro: A UBI would improve the economic freedom of women.
1.6.2.6.3.2.1. Pro: Women would no longer have to [stay in abusive relationships](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/domestic-violence-abuse-bill-theresa-may-financial-independence-a8260736.html) due to a lack of income.
1.6.2.6.3.2.2. Pro: UBI would allow for more equal responsibility in parenting as both parents would be able to live off UBI and so not be limited by the constraints of [2-week paternity leave](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/paternity-leave-and-pay#:~:text=If%20you're%20an%20employee,to%20your%20normal%20holiday%20allowance) \(UK\).
1.6.2.6.3.2.3. Pro: A UBI can make a critical contribution to women's autonomy, security, and flexibility \([p. 14](http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/montreal2014/BIEN2014_Regehr.pdf)(A basic income could make a critical contribution to increasing adequacy, autonomy, security and flexibility for women, men and families in order to improve their wellbeing, close many of the cracks through which people fall into poverty initially and enable them to rebound from setbacks. It can reduce risk for everyone and provide more options to women to balance the varied demands of their lives and help close gender gaps in income, work time and access to learning)\).
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.1.8.1.2.2.1.
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.2. Pro: The guarantee of a UBI reduces the risks from part time work, thus helping females enter and leave the work force as they need or want.
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.3. Pro: Unpaid care work, such as supporting younger and older family members, is often a [burden disproportionately affecting females](https://www.oecd.org/dev/development-gender/Unpaid_care_work.pdf).
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.4. Con: This can only be achieved by reducing the autonomy, security and flexibility of other women \(via increases their taxes\). To justify helping some women by harming other women is hypocritical.
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.4.1. Con: Given men earn, on average, more than woman the redistributive effects UBI would actually be a net benefit to women at the cost of men.
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.4.2. Con: Assuming proportionate taxation, the effect on taxpaying women will be far less significant than the effect on women who depend on or gain significant benefit from receiving a UBI.
1.6.2.6.3.2.3.4.3. Con: Taxes besides income tax can be used to fund a UBI, as can non-taxation methods of increasing government revenue.
1.6.2.6.3.3. Pro: Allowing people to take advantage of opportunities when they arise without being limited by the current rules and restrictions of a benefit that often has restrictive criteria, allows people to be socially mobile when the oportunity arises.
1.6.2.6.3.4. Con: Economic "empowerment" to the bare minimum of basic needs does not allow marginalized voices to be heard because those individuals are still at the bottom of the heap, where there is a lot of noise. A UBI does not eliminate poverty, it simply redefines it.
1.6.2.6.3.4.1. Con: By providing money for basic needs, a UBI would allow marginalized individuals and groups to spend more time and possibly even money on making themselves heard.
1.6.2.6.3.5. Pro: A UBI would give individuals the agency to invest in their own communities.
1.6.2.6.3.5.1. Con: The decision to invest in a community is a personal choice. A UBI does not guarantee the extra funds will be used towards renewing the community.
1.6.2.6.3.5.1.1. Pro: It is plausible an individual in a poorer community will use the extra funds from their UBI payments to move into a better quality community rather than to stay and make improvements.
1.6.2.6.3.5.1.2. Pro: For many individuals in poorer areas, they are surviving with minimal necessities. Funds from the UBI are more likely to go towards more urgent needs like food, shelter, and healthcare than the community at large.
1.6.2.6.3.5.1.2.1. Con: The fact that each poor individual is able to afford better food, better housing conditions or better healthcare will necessarily have a positive impact in the whole community.
1.6.2.6.3.5.2. Con: It would be more effective to invest in those communities directly.
1.6.2.6.3.5.2.1. Pro: This way, it is easier to know the money invested is going towards directly improving the quality of life within these communities. With the UBI an individual can choose to use the extra income for other personal interests unrelated to improving the community.
1.6.2.6.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: This investment can go towards better housing, educational programs, and community initiatives that help to uplift the residents as a whole.
1.6.2.6.3.5.2.2. Con: Hierarchical investment in communities driven by people that don't actually live with the consequences of those investment decisions are less likely to result in community changes that the people in those communities would actually value for themselves.
1.6.2.6.3.5.3. Pro: Increased amounts of free time will better allow individuals to invest their human capital in improving the community and helping other community members.
1.6.2.6.3.5.3.1. Con: It would be more effective simply to invest in those communities directly.
1.6.2.6.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Top down and hierarchical investment in communities, often driven by people that do not actually understand specific necessities, are less likely to result in valuable changes for the communities.
1.6.2.6.3.5.4. Con: A UBI would equally give people more time to engage in anti-social behavior, which is also supported by a UBI.
1.6.2.6.3.5.4.1. Con: This claim implies there is some inherent moral failing that applies to the economically disadvantaged and not to all other people with wealth. This is socially irresponsible.
1.6.2.6.3.5.4.2. Con: There is no evidence that suggests people are more likely to engage in anti-social behavior than they are in positive community building efforts.
1.6.2.6.3.5.5. Pro: People who receive a UBI are more capable of contributing value, through voluntary work for example, than those who do not have an income above the poverty line.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6. Pro: Having to rely on government investment in local communities is problematic.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.1. Pro: Governments are often less capable of understanding where aid is most needed.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.1.1. Pro: Diverting welfare funds to a UBI helps these people buy the goods that they actually need.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.1.2. Pro: Governments often do not include members of these communities.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: The impact of this is that even if politicians then wanted to help members of these communities, their attempts to do so would be inefficient at best, and actively harmful at worst, as they do not understand the needs and concerns of the people living in these areas.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.2. Con: [The free rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) makes individual investment in the community harder. The central, coercive, coordinating mechanism of the government is necessary to make community projects work.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.2.1. Con: Free riding is vastly outweighed because people feel the urgency to change the unequal systems that currently exist.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.3. Pro: People in these communities lack the resources to lobby their local officials for change.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.3.1. Pro: They don't have the time or the money to engage in the political process.
1.6.2.6.3.5.6.3.2. Pro: Given that many of the poor are disenfranchised, the government ignores their situation and has no incentive to invest in impoverished communities.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7. Pro: With a UBI, investment within communities would better enable a process of organic change.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.1. Pro: Individuals that live and work in these communities best understand the needs of these communities. As such, they are able to prioritize which areas to invest in first and how to go about investing in the community.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2. Pro: UBI policies shift the provision of welfare from a national level to a local level, where individuals are more capable of investing in their communities.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.1. Pro: People are more responsible for investments they believe serve their own interests.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.2. Pro: With money from a UBI, individuals within at-risk communities have the ability to invest in fixing urgent problems in areas the government has not helped \(e.g. [Flint, Michigan water crisis](http://time.com/4269300/flint-task-force-report-water-crisis/)\).
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.3. Pro: It is easier for individuals to petition local institutions and local leaders for change.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.3.1. Pro: Local community leaders are closer and more reachable to people than national politicians.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.3.2. Pro: Local leaders are heavily involved in the community, which makes them accountable not only to their community but also to themselves.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.4. Pro: Leadership in local institutions is based on real abilities to manage money, instead of connections and nepotism \(which is usual at higher levels\). This happens because citizens have an interest in ensuring their community's success.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.4.1. Con: Leadership of local government is often deeply unaccountable, due to the low stakes of the powers that they have, and the inability of media organisations to individually scrutinise each local government. As a result, corruption can flourish at a local level even when it would quickly be stamped out at a national level.
1.6.2.6.3.5.7.2.4.2. Con: Citizens have an interest in ensuring the success of their country, state, province or city, too. It is unclear why this would be stronger for very local government than for more powerful and higher-ranking government bodies.
1.6.2.6.3.5.8. Pro: The UBI provides individuals with more money to buy goods from local businesses. This leads to more money circulating in these communities and contributes to their economic revitalization.
1.6.2.6.3.5.8.1. Con: A UBI does not guarantee that individuals will use this additional money within their own communities. It is plausible that an individual will continue to shop online or outside of the community for certain goods and services.
1.6.2.6.3.5.8.2. Pro: Welfare policy often forces consumers to buy goods from non-local private companies that the government associates with.
1.6.2.6.3.5.9. Pro: When individuals invest more in their communities and buy goods from local businesses, they flourish and private investors are more willing to invest in them [\(Greenup 2015\)](http://www.geektime.com/2015/12/17/how-a-universal-basic-income-could-fuel-entrepreneurship/).
1.6.2.6.3.5.10. Pro: A UBI can be a great method to facilitate full expression of individual potentials especially in communities where there is a large disparity of control and ownership of commodity resources among the members.
1.6.2.6.3.5.11. Pro: Altruistic individuals would be more able to put forward charity or other altruistic forms of work without having to worry about their own maintenance or profitability.
1.6.2.6.3.6. Con: Empowering marginalised groups is contingent on providing them meaningful amounts of wealth. An income just above the poverty line is neither meaningful wealth nor economic inclusion.
1.6.2.6.3.6.1. Con: A UBI provides as a baseline an income below the poverty line; increase your income above poverty line would then be relatively easy to achieve — so long as you work to supplement your UBI. Basic income schemes are characterized by a low clawback rate, such that it would be challenging to have even a part-time minimum-wage job and still sit below the poverty line.
1.6.2.6.3.6.2. Con: A UBI ensures one's most important needs are accounted for in a stable manner. This is still incredibly meaningful for disenfranchised groups and enables far more political engagement.
1.6.2.6.3.7. Con: There could be an increased dependence of cheaper "non-citizens" to provide the labour force. Eventually leading to an elite/subordinate citizen/ non-citizen segregated society.
1.6.2.6.3.7.1. Con: Our moral values are strongly against such things, at least in the West. So it's unlikely to happen at least in the current Western nations.
1.6.2.6.3.7.2. Con: "Non-citizens" who provide labour could become citizens and therefore recipients of a UBI.
1.6.2.6.3.7.3. Con: A valid point but something that could easily be avoided by providing UBI to anyone living in said country. Today, in most industrialised countries there are welfare programs taking care of workers, earning too little to make a living, anyway. So this would be a different distribution pattern.
1.6.2.6.3.8. Con: Minorities will still be at a socioeconomic disadvantage.
1.6.2.6.3.8.1. Con: Although minorities might remain relatively disadvantaged, their socioeconomic position would definitely improve in absolute terms.
1.6.2.6.3.8.2. Con: If the government's actions are oppressing minorities, then those in power should not be allowed to decide how social spending dollars are allocated. A UBI can only remove decision-making power from any bigots in public office and allocate it to the downtrodden instead. If the structure is oppressive, then removing power from the structure helps the oppressed.
1.6.2.6.3.8.3. Con: If a UBI does not worsen the socioeconomic disadvantages of minorities, this is not a reason not to implement a UBI, as it can lead to other improvements.
1.6.2.6.3.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.5.7.4.
1.6.2.6.3.9. Pro: A UBI would improve the lives of the poor.
1.6.2.6.3.9.1. Pro: Low-income government-[subsidized housing](http://www.urbancure.org/washington/article.asp?id=563&t=Government-housing-is-a-bad-idea) often leaves at-risks families no choice but to reside in crime-stricken 'pre-existing ghettos', which puts their safety and livelihood at higher risk. With a UBI, families will have a choice of where they choose to reside.
1.6.2.6.3.9.1.1. Con: A UBI would most likely not be high enough for people to afford an opportunity to relocate to any chosen housing.
1.6.2.6.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: Even if it were, then if all residents in such a community receive UBI, then all have equal opportunity to leave. Because the demand to relocate increases, so does the cost, and the opportunity to relocate decreases.
1.6.2.6.3.9.2. Pro: Giving the poor a higher baseline income allows them to better participate in price signalling \(relative to the middle/upper classes\) and [thus better drive demand for inexpensive but high-quality goods](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2016/04/22/the-unconditional-basic-income-and-the-hayekian-price-system/) that improve their lives.
1.6.2.6.3.9.2.1. Pro: Conditional grants \(such as food vouchers\) are a mechanism that force consumer choice towards particular goods and services, rather than a market-driven aggregation of individual preferences. Allowing consumers more agency over how they acquire goods more efficiently directs the market to provide the goods and services that individuals actually value.
1.6.2.6.3.9.2.2. Pro: A UBI would facilitate a more democratic capitalist society by providing all citizens with sufficient funds to 'vote' for the companies they want to exist through the purchasing of products and/or services. This informed consumption would provide a greater flow of capital to companies that meet the wants of the greater population forcing companies to adapt or be replaced. This is in contrast to a wealthy elite defining the direction and ethos of companies and thus the economy.
1.6.2.6.3.9.3. Pro: A UBI will provide basic human needs and enable higher intelligence in the lower class. When people have time to think about other things than surviving the day, they can better think, evaluate their choices, and make long term decisions. Hunger, stress and insufficient safety result in a preoccupied mind.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4. Pro: Wealth is also a significant predictor of [civic engagement](http://www.people-press.org/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/). A UBI will provide people from less advantaged backgrounds the agency and status necessary to push for the types of political change that would not be possible otherwise due to financial discrimination.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.1. Con: A UBI ensures that our most important needs are accounted for in a stable manner. This is incredibly meaningful and comparatively leads to far more political engagement, even if not all recipients become dedicated activists.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.2. Pro: Those on the poverty line have little energy to invest in the political process - outside of voting purely for financial reasons - due to work and life demands. By giving workers wage security \(and thus freeing decision-making processes such as voting from that economic incentive\) a UBI provides individuals room for potentially more thoughtful debate.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.3. Pro: A UBI changes incentives for politicians and pressures them to more actively target or incorporate traditionally politically excluded and disenfranchised groups.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.4. Con: They still only have a finite degree of political capital when engaging with elites. If wealthy people already feel as though they are contributing towards the UBI they are less likely to support these kinds of initiatives.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.4.1. Con: The majority decides what's best for the society, not just the wealthy.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.5. Con: NGOs and other special interest groups \(such as the NAACP\) are able to take on the burden of and fulfill this form of engagement.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.5.1. Con: These groups cannot \(and do not claim to\) speak to all of the diverse interests and desires of their own constituency. To claim that NGO's and hierarchical organizations can by themselves compensate for the political voices of millions is naive and dangerous.
1.6.2.6.3.9.4.5.2. Con: These NGOs and advocacy groups are much stronger and greater political forces in a world where their constituents have more access to capital.
1.6.2.6.4. Con: One of the [psychological benefits](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Warr3/publication/16154562_Psychological_aspects_of_employment_and_unemployment/links/564a2f8108ae295f644fbc44.pdf?inViewer=0&pdfJsDownload=0&origin=publication_detail) of employment is that it "provides a personal identity and status within social institutions. The employed person occupies a role, with associated rights and obligations which are not possessed by those out of work."
1.6.2.6.4.1. Con: This logic seems at face value like it would apply just the same to slavery. Slavery is obviously not desirable.
1.6.2.6.4.2. Con: The benefits of employment do not require that it be paid work. A UBI can enable people to do voluntary work for institutions or people who cannot afford paid staff, giving the workers the benefits of employment and providing value to society through their labour. Someone who cannot do voluntary work without risking losing their benefits is unable to provide value to society and gain the benefits of employment by volunteering.
1.6.2.6.5. Con: The fact that a system benefits some people is a weak argument in favour of it's morality. For example, if a person were to murder someone and take all their money, that would be objectively beneficial to that person, but it would ignore the effect on the other.
1.6.2.6.5.1. Con: Leaving people to suffer and die in poverty is also not moral behaviour, and taxing the mega wealthy likely wouldn't even change their personal lifestyles, merely affect their investments.
1.6.2.6.5.2. Con: Dignity and freedom are highly valuable and by UBI would be achived by taking away less important ones, therefore UBI is exchange from low value to high value, while mentioned example works in opposite direction.
1.6.2.6.5.2.1. Pro: UBI would be most probably achieved by higher taxation or decreasing spends on some other goods provided by goverment. Therefore it is exchange of possibility to keep all money you earn now \(by making this sum lower\) to freedom dignity etc. for those who are in greatest need of such values.
1.6.2.6.6. Pro: There are [societies which highly respect the elderly](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/25/what-other-cultures-can-teach_n_4834228.html) even though they do not actively earn money and frequently may cause costs.
1.6.2.6.6.1. Con: People care for the elderly because the elderly have cared for and paid the expenses for current generations. One doesn't respect one's elders because they appeared out of nothing, it is because elders have paved the way.
1.6.2.6.7. Pro: A UBI can have a positive impact on societal practices and culture by acknowledging the inherent humanity of all citizens.
1.6.2.6.7.1. Pro: A UBI provides unconditional help to all people, while existing welfare systems have limited range.
1.6.2.6.7.1.1. Pro: Providing a guaranteed payment to all citizens promotes the idea that human life is intrinsically valuable and should be supported.
1.6.2.6.7.1.2. Pro: The current economic systems is extremely unfair, often because of corrupt management and lack of workplaces.
1.6.2.6.7.1.3. Pro: Placing conditions on the receipt of social benefits saps political support from the idea as it divides society into recipients and contributors. For example, Medicare in the US receives broad support because it is so broadly applied.
1.6.2.6.7.2. Con: The idea that you are owed money simply for existing is toxic. Your humanity guarantees you protection from your fellow humans and the state - negative freedoms. It does not permit you to force your fellow citizen to serve you.
1.6.2.6.7.2.1. Con: There is no such thing as a pure "negative right". All rights require enforcement, and all enforcement requires labor. Even a right to be left alone is generally considered to require the labor of an enforcing police presence.
1.6.2.6.7.2.1.1. Con: A "negative right" is defined by no one having to do anything in order to respect it, as opposed to a "positive right" that requires action in order to not violate it. Enforcement is an entirely different matter, as it only becomes relevant to guard against and punish violations of rights.
1.6.2.6.7.2.2. Con: This individualism is simplistic. Actions by groups of fellow humans and the state negatively affect humans inadvertently - most humans, for instance, cannot simply leave organized society and subsist off the land, and thereby are inevitably reliant on the state/society and other humans for their subsistence, due to past and present actions of the state and humanity as a collective. This arguably creates a duty from the state to humans in general.
1.6.2.6.7.3. Pro: A UBI makes money less important and puts the value in making life wonderful. We tend to translate everything into economic terms; distracting our attention to what its important. When one feels secure with UBI its less probable that people will get distracted by concerns of financial security. One can focus on doing things, even for free, and let life's rewards come without fear.
1.6.2.6.7.4. Pro: A UBI eliminates mankind's existential angst. Waking up every morning with no worries about how to maintain your life unleashes the best in people.
1.6.2.6.7.4.1. Pro: If the only thing ensuring initiative would be the drive to provide oneself's sustenance, then there would be no volunteer organisations.
1.6.2.6.7.4.1.1. Con: If the point implied above were valid, organizing a UBI through voluntary contributions to a non-government organization would be the superior solution.
1.6.2.6.7.4.1.1.1. Con: The point above showed a valid counterpoint, saying it's not strong enough to support a whole economic policy does not nullify it.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2. Con: One of Ghandi's 7 sins is [wealth without work](http://www.mkgandhi.org/mgmnt.htm). The reason for this is simple: that our lives are enriched by purpose and accomplishment. Helping someone over a hump is one thing but paying charity over time reduces the quality of life which is inhuman.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.4.4.4.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.2. Con: This presupposes that those are virtues. However, these are merely tools that allow people to improve their living conditions or accomplish a goal when needed.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.2.1. Pro: A UBI instead frees people to find other ways to self-improve by removing the forced correlation between being able to eat and submitting to a job.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Too many people would instead take the opportunity to explore what they consider their undiscovered artistic genius. Combining a UBI with turnkey self-publishing could create a nation full of subpar poets and writers, indistinguishable from simple layabouts.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Artistic works contribute to society by allowing not only enjoyment, but new ideas to spread. The inspiration thus created could lead to many other positive results.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.2.2. Con: Different cultures have different perspectives on what is virtuous, so it is difficult to bring virtue into an objective argument.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.3. Con: This argument is deeply entrenched in the virtue theory of morality, to the point of ignoring any of the other ethical frameworks. [Social contract theories](http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/), for example, suggest that it's none of your business what other people do as long as it doesn't effect you.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.4. Con: Given Ghandi was a [deeply socialist political actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhian_economics), the levels of 'wealth' he is referring here probably refers to the resources of the rich; not a guarantee by the state that everyone is able to live just above the poverty line.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.4.1. Con: This is not an exclusive matter; "wealth without work" can easily refer to both scenarios.
1.6.2.6.7.4.2.4.1.1. Con: It seems much more plausible that Ghandi did not think of the state providing basic resources as a 'sin' given that was one of the policies he implemented and maintained.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3. Pro: A UBI will enable people to think about life's important questions more. The Earth and our human societies find themselves in the dire situations today, because we haven't given proper importance to the individual to answer these questions for themselves. Questioning life is what gets us out of this way of thinking, and is the beginning to a philosophical and spiritual education.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3.1. Con: Arguably, having an uninspiring and demotivating job makes us ponder these questions more than otherwise.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3.1.1. Con: Not for the majority of the population who live with minimum income to make their basic needs, they are more focused on surviving; hence not able to afford energy to improve society.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3.2. Con: There is no evidence that people will spend more time in contemplation of spiritual questions with a UBI. If a UBI is enabling recipients to partake in jobs and ventures that feel more meaningful for them, they may have less unstructured time.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3.3. Pro: For anyone whose primary concern is their own immediate physical and financial security for themselves and family, such personal need will eclipse any beneficial concern for community and habitat. UBI enhances the likelihood that most people will consider the common good.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3.3.1. Pro: Many people who work may wish to do more meaningful or charitable labour, but are aware there is less or no money in it in most cases.
1.6.2.6.7.4.3.4. Pro: UBI allows people to make more ethical decisions based on want and fewer coerced decisions based on need. Legally and socially criminal behavior for some is a choice but for many it is the only viable choice they feel they have to survive.
1.6.2.6.7.4.4. Con: UBI reduces worries about basic needs \(i.e shelter, food etc.\), but does not by itself deliver incentives to stretch for self-actualization \(i.e. following your passion\) rather than solely giving in to short-term driven urges \(e.g. playing video games for the sake of instant gratification\).
1.6.2.6.7.4.4.1. Con: An individual whose basic needs are met doesn't have to pursue self actualization, it is a personal choice. However if a UBI cannot make that individual seek self-actualization, neither can a job. So if nothing can truly make the individual want to pursue what's good for them, we can only reduce what prevents an individual from doing so.
1.6.2.6.7.4.5. Con: Existential Angst can also be a feeling of emptiness, or lack of purpose. If we accept [Maslow's Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) of needs to be somewhat true, we can fathom that even if basic human needs are met, there will always be other needs. A UBI doesn't really extinguish that angst.
1.6.2.6.7.4.5.1. Con: Accepting some of Maslow's hierarchical conception of needs entails recognizing that some needs are "higher" than others. Higher needs that follow from the fulfillment of "lower" needs are not subject to feelings of emptiness or angst, as fulfillment of needs leads to climbing the pyramid toward self-actualization.
1.6.2.6.7.4.6. Con: No amount of money will eliminate existential angst. But, feeling worried about your economic future is an incentive to seek work and growth. In this way a UBI reduces the marginal utility of producing.
1.6.2.6.7.4.6.1. Con: Work does not necessarily lead to growth. It can simply lead to stress, exhaustion, frustration, desperation, hatred, etc.. Poor job fits — and people feeling like they have little other choice but to remain in them — can even lead to depression and suicide.
1.6.2.6.7.4.6.2. Con: If you pay attention you will see that one thing that every great past thinker had in common is that none of them was worried about surviving. That said each person has their own spectrum of what is "essential to survival."
1.6.2.6.7.5. Pro: A UBI sends a message of trust from government to citizens. Trust is usually responded to by accepting responsibility and willing to be trustworthy.
1.6.2.6.7.5.1. Con: Welfare programs also send a message of trust from governments to citizens, as they have to trust that their benefits will be dispersed monthly, the same as UBI has been proposed.
1.6.2.6.7.6. Pro: Current welfare systems incentivize the poor to value working over their physical and mental health. A UBI affords individuals more freedom to enjoy a greater quality of life.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1. Pro: A UBI will allow individuals the opportunity to take fewer work shifts, giving them more time to pursue other interests they hold valuable.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.1. Pro: A UBI reduces the risks of working part-time or on a seasonal basis, allowing workers to better choose a schedule that suits their lifestyle.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: Our time is the most important commodity we each possess; allowing us to better allocate it is important to self-determination and happiness.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.1.2. Pro: The rise of [freelancing](http://www.afr.com/business/small-business/future-of-work-how-the-freelance-revolution-is-changing-the-meaning-of-a-day-job-20140508-jyw7q) and [casualisation](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/oct/17/the-casualisation-of-australias-workforce-is-nothing-to-panic-about) of the workforce is eroding the stability and financial security provided by full-time employment.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Freelancing and casualization are indicators that people as a whole are now more capable of providing for themselves in the market than they were previously.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.1.3. Pro: People's living expenses are relatively constant costs — rent, food, etc are all must be paid for on a regular basis. When people do not work consistently the need for 'income smoothing' becomes burdensome and risky as people must carefully budget for how future costs can be met with irregular incomes.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2. Pro: Fewer shifts allows more time for children, family, and ensuring proper health outcomes. This leads to the development of healthy and meaningful relationships that better both a person's physical and mental health.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2.1. Pro: Supportive healthy [relationships](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships) have shown to reduce harmful levels of stress that negatively affect the immune system.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2.2. Pro: A [75-year long study](https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/want-a-life-of-fulfillment-a-75-year-harvard-study-says-to-prioritize-this-one-t.html) came to the conclusion that good relationships are the most important factor to create sustainable and fulfilling happiness.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2.3. Con: These precise outcomes can be achieved through something like an earned income tax credit for low-income individuals, without necessitating a UBI.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: An earned income tax credit is also a lot more economically feasible, as it [costs less than a high UBI.](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/16/11948800/robert-greenstein-basic-income)
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2.4. Pro: Additional time spend with children can reduce mental health problems of future generations.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.2.5. Con: Work could be done in family businesses or at least with help of children in many cases, which would not only be good for relation, but also for the economy.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.3. Con: Incentives to work long shifts exist even under a UBI, and employers can design the system to their advantage. For example, employers might hand out promotions only to employees who work long shifts. Thus, low-income individuals are pressured into taking long hours in any case.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.3.1. Con: Under a UBI, the vast majority of people will have the option to not work 12 hours a day, even when bonuses for long hours are in place. Thus, a UBI offers more individual choice, which is likely to be used by many workers, not just those with low-income.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4. Pro: Reduced working hours allow more time for educational pursuits like earning a degree or taking classes in a subject of interest.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.1. Pro: With a UBI, people will have more income to easily afford more enjoyable educational experiences, like studying subjects within their interests or learning through world exploration.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: People are more likely to have better lives if they have better access to education and enriching experiences than if they spend their whole lives trying to maximize their productivity in a capitalistic sense.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.2. Pro: High and specialized education becomes increasingly important as more and more jobs are being replaced by machines, especially the lower-skilled jobs.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.2.2.1.1.3.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.2.2. Con: Moral-panic around increased mechanisation of the labour force has existed since before the industrial revolution, yet never actually come to fruition.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Overwhelmingly, technological advancements lead to job creation in other fields, due to increased net demand as a product of economic growth.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.2.2.2. Con: This is not correct. [Current trends](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FOJ_Executive_Summary_Jobs.pdf) could lead to a net employment impact of more than 5.1 million jobs lost to disruptive labour market changes over the period 2015–2020, with a total loss of 7.1 million jobs.
1.6.2.6.7.6.1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: The very same study suggests that these losses can be offset by a ['talent revolution'](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FOJ_Executive_Summary_Jobs.pdf) whereby strong leadership from government and business elites leads to job creation in new fields.
1.6.2.6.7.6.2. Pro: Society and government undervalue health and family life and instead [overvalue working](https://politicsandculture.org/2012/05/02/leisure-the-sacred-gesture-and-human-dignity-thorstein-veblen-and-josef-piepers-understandings-of-leisure/). We begin to value the quality of our own lives when we are not working solely out of necessity.
1.6.2.6.7.6.2.1. Pro: Under capitalism, the meaning of [leisure](https://politicsandculture.org/2012/05/02/leisure-the-sacred-gesture-and-human-dignity-thorstein-veblen-and-josef-piepers-understandings-of-leisure/) has been undermined by what is considered its opposite: work. Leisure is not merely free or unoccupied time, but rather time spent thoughtfully at your own discretion.
1.6.2.6.7.6.3. Con: If low-income people start substantially reducing the amounts they work, this is likely to trigger substantial political backlash to the UBI \(as low-income individuals are perceived to be leeching off of society\), which will result in reductions in the UBI and increased stigma against low-income workers.
1.6.2.6.7.6.3.1. Con: It requires a lot more political capital to reduce UBI payments \(because that affects everyone\) than to cut welfare entitlements.
1.6.2.6.7.7. Pro: United Nations' [Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) Article 25 states that "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family ..." In a world of increasing job scarcity and rising job specialization, requiring fewer workers, UBI could be the only sustenance for hundreds of millions of people.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1. Con: Recognising the 'right' to something doesn't mean that everyone has to be provided with it.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1.1. Pro: In some situations it's impossible to answer even most crucial needs.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1.1.1. Pro: There are places where high standard medical care is unavailable.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1.1.1.1. Con: A UBI will help to fund the purchase of medical services in such areas, thus incentivizing their provision and sale.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1.1.2. Pro: There are places where access to food and water is highly limited.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1.1.2.1. Con: A UBI will help to fund the transport and sale of food and water to such locales.
1.6.2.6.7.7.1.1.3. Con: The occurrence of such situations should be reduced, and a UBI is one possible vehicle to do so.
1.6.2.6.7.8. Pro: UBI is fair because those who work also get help, not only the ones who don't contribute to society.
1.6.2.6.7.8.1. Con: A UBI would help only those, who earn less than average, because it would be financed from taxes, so those who earn more would pay more for UBI to exist, than they recieve from it.
1.6.2.6.7.8.1.1. Con: This threshold to receive a net benefit would likely be much higher than just the average income level, given progressive taxation means that the most wealthy continue a disproportionate amount of tax revenue.
1.6.2.6.7.8.1.1.1. Con: Such tax would have to be highly progressive to function properly, because rich people have lawyers, who help them to minimise the amount of tax they pay.
1.6.2.6.7.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some of most richest would decide to move or at least pay taxes somewhere else.
1.6.2.6.7.8.1.1.2. Con: A highly progresive tax, which would be needed to support such option, would hurt the economy significantly by reducing the motivation to earn \(and by that produce\) more of those who provide huge part of GDP.
1.6.2.6.7.8.2. Con: A UBI would hurt richest, who provide significant input into economic development.
1.6.2.6.7.8.2.1. Con: Wealthy individuals are not the only source of input for economic development; collective projects and large-scale voluntary donations can also finance development, as can governments.
1.6.2.6.7.8.2.2. Con: Many wealthy people act against the common good, creating more damage than improvement.
1.6.2.6.7.9. Pro: The economic consequences of wealth redistribution must be seen in philosophical and material terms. UBI is a humanist approach: supporting people because they exist. Against this is a materialist approach dehumanizing people to be mere earners and not able to appreciate life's demands to advance oneself.
1.6.2.6.7.10. Pro: A UBI at the least should be considered a human right, as there are not near enough job opportunities to earn more than a basic amount of income.
1.6.2.6.8. Pro: A UBI provides people the [real freedom](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265291?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to pursue the realization of one's conception of the good life.
1.6.2.6.8.1. Con: A person who wants to laze on a beach can only be fed by taking from some other source of income. This is not enough to justify a UBI as a way to redistribute revenue.
1.6.2.6.8.2. Pro: The adoption of a UBI could help to change the narrative that working full-time is the only way to lead a fulfilling life, which will become important as that becomes increasingly unnecessary and/or inefficient.
1.6.2.6.8.2.1. Con: It is false to equivocate acceptance of technological advances with acceptance of a post-work world. As new industries unearth new market needs and generate new wants, new jobs in industries arise to replace those lost to obsolescence.
1.6.2.6.8.3. Pro: With a UBI, people will not be forced to settle for a job that only pays the bills, but will be free to explore career paths until they find a meaningful and fulfilling occupation.
1.6.2.6.8.3.1. Pro: A UBI gives the individual more freedom. It allows people to decide how to take part in society. There are no strings attached. People can decide whether they want to work or not and they would be urged to do the things they like and that would create happiness.
1.6.2.6.8.4. Pro: A UBI would allow people to focus on jobs that they are passionate about rather than simply monetary gain, and thus would improve mental health, job and life satisfaction, self-value and contribution to society.
1.6.2.6.8.4.1. Pro: This would also improve their effectiveness and productivity at work, due to increased effort and motivation.
1.6.2.6.8.4.2. Pro: An unconditional UBI separates work from income, so that you can do whatever you are best in - and not, what you have to do because somebody is willing to pay for it.
1.6.2.6.8.4.3. Con: If the contribution to society is one of value, then the associated job comes with an equally valuable salary. If the contribution to society isn't valuable, then society shouldn't subsidize it.
1.6.2.6.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.3.6.4.2.4.
1.6.2.6.8.6. Pro: A UBI would give the hardworking person a chance to work for something the person really believes in, rather than being a slave to someone else's project. This leads to a more satisfied world.
1.6.2.6.8.7. Pro: People who prefer to laze on beaches should not be compelled to work in order to feed themselves. The same goes for people who would opt for a part-time job, or take up volunteering, or start up a new business. A UBI [could provide everyone](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265291?seq=1&Search=yes&searchText=fed&list=hide&searchUri=%2Fbetasearch%2F%3Facc%3Don%26Query%3Dwhy%2Bsurfers%2Bshould%2Bbe%2Bfed%26fc%3Doff%26wc%3Don&prevSearch=&resultsServiceName=null&loggedin=true#page_scan_tab_contents) with a minimal sum that would support them in living the life they want to live.
1.6.2.6.8.7.1. Con: Most people prefer engaging in recreational activities to doing work. However, if all of these people chose not to work, society would not have enough productive labor to function.
1.6.2.6.8.7.2. Con: Freedom means choosing a path without being coerced by others, and accepting the consequences of one's actions. People who laze on beaches do not produce anything, yet a UBI would allow them to avoid the natural consequences: not being able to consume.
1.6.2.6.8.7.2.1. Con: Not entirely true: they would have less resources to consume than those who choose to engage in labour in order to fund additional consumption. "Lazing on a beach" does not in fact consume resources — it is an economically neutral activity.
1.6.2.6.8.8. Pro: A UBI can help individuals self-actualize and express themselves creatively. Being able to do so is a basic human right.
1.6.2.6.8.8.1. Pro: As set forth in many articles of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), every human being has a right to certain freedoms, including leisure, expression, human dignity, and development of personality. A UBI makes this more obtainable for everyone.
1.6.2.6.8.8.2. Pro: Working with an exclusive materialistic intention is sad as it makes humans subject to alienation.
1.6.2.6.8.8.3. Pro: The philosophy that guides a UBI is that a life free of poverty is a universal right, not a privilege earned through working.
1.6.2.7. Con: A UBI does not do enough to address the individualism which is at the core of class disparity. As long as capitalism exists so does profit, and profit creates power dynamics which allow for the perpetuation of individualistic ideologies.
1.6.2.7.1. Con: Capitalism, while far from perfect, has a lot going for it in terms of encouraging production and innovation. While it might be possible to replace it once we move into a post-scarcity society, at present the most efficient economic systems available are at least partially capitalistic.
1.6.2.7.1.1. Con: in many cases, scarcity, [is manufactured](https://eand.co/why-artificial-scarcity-is-killing-you-d19ff364c812).
1.6.2.7.1.1.1. Con: The term "post-scarcity economy" refers to the distinction in economics between scarce and nonscarce goods; artificial scarcity that increases the price of a good that *already has a price* is a different sort of scarcity, and it is disingenuous to conflate them.
1.6.2.7.2. Con: From an individualist perspective, the fact that a UBI does not "address" individualism is a good thing, and a policy that did so would just be trampling on individuals' rights and liberties in the well-worn name of "the greater good", like so many anti-capitalists [have done before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes).
1.6.2.8. Con: Providing work is a better vehicle to promote social justice than providing a UBI.
1.6.2.8.1. Con: Even if this is true, it may be much harder to provide work for all. On balance, therefore, a UBI is preferrable to help all people.
1.6.2.8.2. Pro: UBI does not give people meaning in their lives the way that work does.
1.6.2.8.2.1. Con: There are plenty of people whose jobs do not give their lives meaning.
1.6.3. Pro: A UBI will benefit the middle class, by increasing median household income among the middle class.
1.6.3.1. Con: Resource distribution in society will always be unequal. A UBI or any other welfare scheme does not alter this fundamental reality.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.1.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Government-funded research and education is a key driver of innovation, yet its returns mostly accrue to the owners of capital. By helping to circulate wealth from the rich to the lower and middle classes, a UBI helps recapture this public investment for the public itself.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: Those who are wealthy already benefit from technological advancement as they are the ones who own the means of production. The government does not also need to provide them with a UBI, that is just double dipping.
1.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.2.
1.6.3.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.2.1.2.
1.6.3.3. Pro: [Alaska, the only state with a UBI](https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/), has the [highest median household income for middle class](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/heres-how-much-money-middle-class-families-earn-in-every-us-state.html). Alaska's middle class make $80,000 per year, while middle class in all other states make less — up to $10,000 less.
1.6.3.4. Pro: Unlike current welfare schemes which only benefit the most disadvantaged in society, a UBI will benefit almost everyone by taxing those who have accumulated large amounts of wealth over a long period of time.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: The income gap continues to increase between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. A UBI would not only help close the gap, but would also all but eliminate the constant debate of a liveable minimum wage we've been having for over a decade.
1.6.4. Pro: A UBI would improve working capabilities and conditions.
1.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Employers will no longer be forced to play the role of social security guarantors. Therefore, employing people will be [easier, cheaper](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-dont-like-having-full-time-employees-2016-6?r=US&IR=T) and therefore more accessible.
1.6.4.3. Con: UBI [relatively disadvantages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16255446) the [working segment of a society](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/working-class), since it will be payed out from their taxes.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Freedom can be seen as the absence of enforcement. A UBI requires the enforcement of taxation, which by definition, impairs freedom.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: The additional purchasing power that net beneficiaries gain from UBI has to be taken from those who are net payers. The latter group's freedom is reduced because they have less control over the fruits of their labor.
1.6.4.3.1.1.1. Con: For most state's considering implementing a UBI, a social welfare system in already in place. If those systems are replaced with a UBI, the net payer's group freedom is not reduced any more than it already is. And the beneficiaries gain the freedom to choose how their UBI is spent.
1.6.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This is only true if taxation stayed the same as without UBI. However, most UBI models require substantial increase in spending compared to the current welfare state, and thus would require more taxation.
1.6.4.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Tax reforms to support a UBI would need to be highly progressive and focus on taxing luxury items.
1.6.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This could be argued to be a desirable and effective way for the tax system to operate, as it would tax the wealthy who could afford it to support those who are in need for essentials.
1.6.4.3.1.1.2. Con: There is no such thing as the isolated fruits of ones labour. Is buying shares on the stock market not a labour comparable to someone making minimum wage on 60 hours a week cleaning toilets? Society is contract, not a mass of individual interest.
1.6.4.3.1.1.3. Con: These individuals often rely on a market of consumers. The UBI would act as an economic stimulant that would benefit them too, in the long run.
1.6.4.3.1.1.4. Con: Net tax payers still owe society money in exchange for having an educated population that consumes their goods/services.
1.6.4.3.1.1.5. Con: This argument assumes that 100% of the production comes from human activities. This has already changed with massive automation and will change further with more and more AIs in charge of production. In that case, the "net payers" would not be humans, but automated systems and therefore there would be no loss of freedom for human actors.
1.6.4.3.1.2. Con: Not being able to afford a decent quality of life, often due to life circumstances not reasonably within your control, is not a dignified way for a human to exist.
1.6.4.3.1.3. Con: Spending the majority of your time merely trying to survive in an unfair \(and stressful\) financial situation does not offer many opportunities for freedom.
1.6.4.3.1.4. Pro: The only way to guarantee one person an income is to take from another through coercive force. Government is the only legitimate user of physical force. It should only be used to protect, not to take. To believe it is okay is to not believe in moral absolutes. In other words, anything is okay that one deems so within their conscience based on their subjective views, rather than the objective facts of reality.
1.6.4.3.1.4.1. Con: Deontological rules such as "Government is the only legitimate user of physical force" are subjective views about how morality works, not objective facts of reality.
1.6.4.3.1.4.1.1. Con: While true, by that logic no moral argument \(or very few anyway\) is valid. Just looking at Deontological, Consequentialist, and Virtue ethics theories, it will be nearly impossible to get all three views to agree on any issue. Therefore since you can't convince them all, you shouldn't try.
1.6.4.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: That you should try is something most moral systems can agree on: It is virtuous to try to convince people to be virtuous, convincing people to do good things is a good thing, and convincing people to maximise utility helps to maximise utility.
1.6.4.3.1.5. Pro: The State is unethical, because it's existence is based on the illegitimate monopoly of coercion, and its source of income is based on theft \(taxes\).
1.6.4.3.1.5.1. Con: Most people prefer living in a stable and orderly society to anarchy where force or coercion may be used by any individual against any individual and individual rights do not exist or are not enforced.
1.6.4.3.1.6. Con: Defining 'freedom' as the 'absence of enforcement' is intrinsically problematic. This is, essentially, an anarchistic look at freedom. Lack of enforcement only works if everyone can be relied upon not to take advantage of the lack of enforcement, which in turn rewards those who DO take advantage of the lack of enforcement.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: It is immoral to legislate that citizens who work hard for their pay, forfeit a portion of it to other citizens who didn't.
1.6.4.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.3.8.4.
1.6.4.3.2.2. Con: Not helping the poor is immoral. A UBI helps the poor and does it more efficiently and more gracefully so than welfare schemes.
1.6.4.3.2.2.1. Con: There are ways to help the poor without a UBI or welfare scheme, for example free-will charity. The poor are helped, no one is forced to give. Trading one immorality \(not helping the poor\) for another \(UBI\) when a solution exists that is completely moral \(charity\), is immoral in itself.
1.6.4.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Having free-will charity help the poor on the scale that UBI would is not, in fact, a solution that exists. It's impossible to make anyone voluntarily give to charity, because that's a contradiction in terms; no-one is personally rich enough to solve poverty by their philanthropy; and just hoping people will give to charity sufficient that UBI will be unnecessary is wishing you had better moral luck than you, in fact, have, not offering a solution.
1.6.4.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It's not been established that a UBI actually is necessary to begin with, so currently charity wouldn't have to meet that level.
1.6.4.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Charity has not, to date, managed to solve the poverty problem.
1.6.4.3.2.2.1.3. Con: [Charity is a power play](https://fee.org/articles/when-charity-is-actually-a-power-play/); the UBI gives the needy the power to help themselves.
1.6.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.6.2.3.8.4.
1.6.4.4. Pro: With the insurance of a UBI acting as a safety net, workers can challenge their employers if they find their working conditions unfair or degrading.
1.6.4.4.1. Pro: This serves as a check against the leverage typically held by employers. They now have a greater economic reason to ensure that their workers are satisfied.
1.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: UBI gives workers more power at the negotiating table. The choice is "work or don't have extra benefits" instead of "work or starve."
1.6.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Currently many workers hesitate to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and their family's livelihoods.
1.6.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: UBI allows less skilled workers to negotiate pay and working conditions with employers fairly, rather than from a position of desperation.
1.6.4.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.4.1.1.2.
1.6.4.4.1.3. Con: Everyone but the most poor have adapted to living beyond the meagre means offered by a UBI. This means that the income that an employer offers still affords them a large amount of power over employees.
1.6.4.4.1.3.1. Con: They can adapt to living on less just as much as they've adapted to living on more.
1.6.4.4.1.3.2. Con: Even so, the threat of losing your luxuries is not as grave as the risk of losing provision for your basic needs, or having to rely on welfare system that are not always certain or reliable, and often stressful or stigmatizing.
1.6.4.4.1.4. Pro: Many workers stay in jobs with unhealthy working conditions due to a tight job market. A UBI can alleviate this stress.
1.6.4.4.1.4.1. Pro: When workers are more able to leave bad jobs it leads to bad employers having persistently high turnover rates. This creates more effective pressure on the employer to deal with their problematic power dynamics and mitigate stressful working conditions.
1.6.4.4.2. Con: New ways of maintaining the power imbalance between the employer and the employee will be found.
1.6.4.4.2.1. Pro: The imbalance of power serves to increase productivity, as hierarchical management serves to guide and govern workers with a centralized system of rules and goals.
1.6.4.4.2.1.1. Con: It is morally abhorrent to use the threat of making someone jobless as a negotiating tool.
1.6.4.4.2.1.2. Con: The imbalance of power could also create antagonistic relations between employee and employer, which diminish productivity.
1.6.4.4.2.1.3. Pro: [Proper management techniques](http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2014/01/20/8-common-causes-of-workplace-demotivation/2/#390e499cf401) like rewarding success and addressing low performance increases overall motivation and productivity.
1.6.4.4.2.1.4. Con: This argument sounds very similar to the one used to justify slavery. Slavery is wrong.
1.6.4.4.2.2. Con: The power inbalance would be shifted towards the worker with a UBI, any countereffect on behalf of the employers is a seperate issue that could be argued in chicken-egg like fashion as the countereffect to the countereffect takes place.
1.6.4.4.2.3. Con: It would still increase the difficulty for the employer in maintaining said power imbalance, which is beneficial for the employees.
1.6.4.4.3. Pro: UBI could help make employing and being employed more voluntary. If employment is driven by grave need, it becomes voluntary only in name.
1.6.4.4.3.1. Pro: There cannot be a free labour market without a UBI. When labour sellers are forced under pain of starvation to sell their labour to any available labour buyer there is no free choice and no free market. The labour buyers have no such urgency.
1.6.4.4.3.1.1. Con: This ignores the various government safety nets that already exist, such as means-tested welfare \(e.g. unemployment benefits\). In short, UBI is not the only option for enabling greater job freedom.
1.6.4.4.4. Pro: A UBI would make wages depend less on bargaining power, and more on skill requirements and effort.
1.6.4.4.5. Con: -> See 1.6.4.4.3.1.1.
1.6.4.4.6. Con: Walking away is often too little, too late. For example, an unsafe workplace is often only exposed through serious accident. Proactive government intervention is better than retroactive employee action.
1.6.4.4.6.1. Con: Proactive government intervention can still continue even if a UBI is implemented.
1.6.4.5. Pro: A UBI would allow people to take the time to find a better job.
1.6.4.5.1. Pro: Having this time to find suitable work will stop the "revolving door" effect, where people on benefits are forced to take a job, hate it, and quit shortly thereafter.
1.6.4.5.2. Con: The additional time that people take to look for jobs would result in reduced time spent performing productive labor.
1.6.4.5.2.1. Con: In the US, only 30% of workers feel engaged in their jobs; [leading to productivity losses of around $500 billion a year](http://screenwerk.com/2013/06/25/gallup-70-of-workforce-not-engaged-costs-billions-in-lost-productivity/).
1.6.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Productivity tends to [increase](https://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work) when people enjoy the work they do. Allowing them to do so will therefore benefit the economy.
1.6.4.5.3. Pro: More time gives citizens a greater chance to find a job close to their current home and social environment \(family, friends\), which has a positive effect on their quality of life.
1.6.4.5.4. Con: A UBI will make citizens very picky and demanding concerning their job choices. Some positions and jobs would be very hard or next to impossible to staff.
1.6.4.5.4.1. Con: It is the companies' duty to create incentives in order to staff their positions.
1.6.4.5.5. Con: UBIs threaten corporations that depend on salaried employees that earn all of their income from them.
1.6.4.5.5.1. Pro: A UBI could lead to increased employee turnover if employees are able to quit due to small dissatisfactions. This hurts companies, and in the long run, the economy.
1.6.4.5.5.2. Con: If a business can't survive paying a fair rate to its employees, it shouldn't exist in the first place.
1.6.4.5.6. Pro: Taking renumeration to make ends meet out of the equation will also allow people to only pursue what is of interest to them. Counter-intuitively, the biggest impact will be in the job market, as [workplace efficiency was studied and known](https://www.emergenetics.com/blog/workplace-appreciation-gratitude/) to be proportional to the psychological effects of workplace appreciation & gratitude.
1.6.4.5.7. Con: This is not a feature unique to a UBI. It is something that targeted unemployment benefits manage to achieve quite well under the status quo.
1.6.4.5.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.2.
1.6.4.5.7.2. Con: While unemployment benefits help people seeking full time employment, they generally provide a disincentive to finding part time work, as reporting this work means losing part or all of their benefits for that period.
1.6.4.6. Pro: A UBI will help the labor market adapt to inevitable disruptions caused by [advancements](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/the-next-industrial-revolution/498779/) in automation and artificial intelligence.
1.6.4.6.1. Pro: The government has an obligation to ensure all citizens have the capacity to fulfill basic needs such as food, housing, education and healthcare. A UBI allows states to provide this basic level of welfare despite a fluctuating job market.
1.6.4.6.1.1. Pro: A UBI fulfills this obligation, while also maintaining individuals' ability to make choices and have control over their own lives \(unlike some forms of targeted welfare\).
1.6.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Some individuals would [spend poorly,](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-12-04/four-reasons-a-guaranteed-income-won-t-work) making it necessary to reinstate various welfare programs to help these people make better financial decisions.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some individuals, especially in societies like India or China where expenditure on status symbols is accepted as a practice, would be tempted to expend on largesse e.g. feasts for distant relatives or showy cars, despite it having little utility other than showing off.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It seems paternalistic to reject an entire policy for thinking that particular cultures will spend it poorly.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even if they may not spend it on ostentatious consumption, the likelihood is there - given that individuals in such situations face societal pressures to choose poorly, the state cannot assume that choice would be all that rational or beneficial.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: Some individuals, especially those in poverty who are used to purchasing cheap but comparatively less nutritious meals e.g. pre-packed or fast food, might not be incentivized to change their habits as much as they would if their food stamps were only applicable to fresh foods or “Healthy Choice” labeled meals.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: At-risk families will spend on cigarettes, drugs or alcohol instead of saving up for children’s education or spending on subsidized vocational training courses. This situation is comparatively less likely with in-kind assistance than with a UBI.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Households on welfare [statistically do not waste](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no) their income on alcohol and cigarettes. This perception is generally just scare-mongering from conservative groups.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Even if a tiny fraction of a UBI beneficiaries do abuse it, it only takes one sensationalist [news](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4076338/The-bizarre-benefit-frauds-2016-including-woman-claiming-superpowers-BLIND-driver.html) story to enable rhetoric against the policy and, more harmfully, against its most vulnerable recipients.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Even if the majority of individuals on welfare do not spend their money on alcohol and cigarettes, the prevalent perception is that there is a risk that they might do so with a UBI.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Welfare programs perpetuate the stigma that sees being poor as equivalent to being unable to make good decisions or adequately look after yourself or your family.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.1.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: The stigma against individuals in poverty exists for a multitude of other reasons, for example lack of familiarity with other cultures or lack of exposure to minority friends.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: This stigma or [otherness](https://othersociologist.com/otherness-resources/) exists even in societies that are not racially or culturally diverse, indicating that it has little to do with these things.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.2.3. Con: What can eliminate stigma is a removal of the perceived costs the poor place upon the middle-class taxpayers, and welfare is more constrained such that the poor structurally cannot make bad choices.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.3. Con: The use of alcohol and drugs is usually strongly linked to the [mental health impacts that result from being poor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449359/). A UBI will actually alleviate this phenomenon.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.2.2.1.5.1.1.1.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.4. Pro: Reinstating welfare programs would effectively double everyone’s tax bill and eliminate any purported cost savings that Government might claim from implementing the UBI.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Given the sheer cost of implementing a UBI, it is unlikely that both a UBI and more traditional welfare programs will be run at the same time.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.5. Con: This happens in any welfare system where people are allowed to control how they allocate the resources the State gives them.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Under a UBI, more individuals - especially those in poverty with substantial pressures affecting their decision calculus - have more income with which to potentially make poor decisions. Under means testing or in-kind assistance, fewer poor decisions will be made on aggregate.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6. Con: Most states will retain compulsory state-funded education systems to educate young people about sensible ways to spend their UBI payment. This kind of education allows for the provision of advice and support, while maintaining the dignity and autonomy of individuals.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Given the high rates of absenteeism, and because the school system educates children \(not their parents who receive UBI payments\) state education is unlikely to guarantee that people will spend their UBI payments sensibly.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Much of education-related welfare is concentrated on keeping low-income children in school \(e.g. [No Child Left Behind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act)\). The Government would likely remove these welfare programmes to fund a UBI. Hence, on the educational advocacy level, UBI and better public education are at least partially mutually exclusive.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Even if some education-welfare programs are eliminated, if a country has a strong public education that does not necessarily change with the implementation of a [UBI](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/universal-basic-income-finland-ubi-test-scheme-experiment-a7211241.html). That is the case of [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Finland), for example.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6.3. Con: Poor spending choices are often the result of coercion or manipulation that cannot be solved by education. Empowering those in poverty with a UBI payout is likely to embolden these oppressive actors, and put those in poverty at a greater risk of manipulation.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: A stable UBI in the hands of the financially illiterate is a beacon that draws in predatory loansharks or bogus employment middlemen. The advantage of a layer of bureaucracy with means-testing or in-kind assistance is that the Government's audit processes serve as additional check and balance to protect the financially illiterate.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Governments ensure - through various methods - that the conditions for receiving welfare are met, yet that does not prevent people who receive welfare from being the prey of loansharks, scams or any other dubious enterprises.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.7. Con: The mentioned group is not big enought to make an argument. Even if such group people do have to spend money on survival, only a part \(probably small\) of money will be wasted.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.8. Pro: It is better for the government to provide a social safety net as individuals don't accurately consider future risks.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.8.1. Pro: Governments have a paternalistic obligation to force individuals to devote their resources towards their safety and health. For example, that is the reason for seatbelt laws.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.8.2. Pro: Individuals might be likely to spend a cash bonus, not anticipating a future harm \(e.g. unexpected illness\). However, if the government provides welfare or subsidized healthcare, this protects individuals from unanticipated harms.
1.6.4.6.1.1.1.8.3. Con: People should have the agency to determine their own lives, even if that means that sometimes they will not make the most optimal choice.
1.6.4.6.1.1.2. Con: Individuals never have absolute choice in any society; our choices are constrained in the particular instance where they conflict with others' interests \(e.g. limitations on free speech\), or where they gave up their interests \(e.g. through taxation\) to enable our choices.
1.6.4.6.1.1.3. Con: As the state is the caretaker of collectivity, it ought to prioritize the efficient expenditure of taxpayers' money in the aggregate, over the marginal exercise of choice.
1.6.4.6.1.1.4. Con: Individuals are not stripped of all choice under a targeted welfare system. Individuals have a basis of good health, sufficient savings and education to make choices that significantly improve their quality of life \(e.g. taking a part-time vocational degree to upgrade skills\).
1.6.4.6.1.1.5. Con: The government has no mandate to provide any sort of welfare at all.
1.6.4.6.1.1.5.1. Con: The government has a moral obligation to ensure a basic humane quality of life for those under its care.
1.6.4.6.1.2. Con: The obligation of government is to ensure all citizens are able to meet their basic needs. That does not automatically prescribe a UBI as the chosen mechanism to do so. Targeted welfare and in-kind subsidies can do the same - at less extravagant cost.
1.6.4.6.1.3. Con: Many of the underlying causes of poverty, such as failing schools, substandard public services or institutionalized racism, are not addressed by a UBI.
1.6.4.6.1.3.1. Pro: Funds would be better allocated towards reversing or mitigating these deeply entrenched issues.
1.6.4.6.1.3.2. Pro: Since a UBI would tie up a significant amount of government funding, it is unreasonable for the government to assume that they can fix these deeper issues while simultaneously paying for a UBI.
1.6.4.6.1.4. Con: The government is responsible to ensure every person has the capacity to fulfill basic needs. Providing those needs is not within the mandate of the government.
1.6.4.6.1.5. Con: This is not an argument for a UBI; this is merely an opinion on what is the role of the state and description of UBI. This is not an explanation of why it would be good or bad.
1.6.4.6.2. Con: The loss of a fulfilling job cannot be compensated for by UBI payments.
1.6.4.6.2.1. Con: Those experiencing poverty or welfare dependency also have a need for fulfillment, which UBI may be able to provide.
1.6.4.6.2.2. Con: Having more free time enables people to instead have a fulfilling hobby they can choose more freely than a job.
1.6.4.6.2.3. Pro: People relying on external motivation to feel fulfilled where monetary gain is an important factor might not feel as fulfilled if they no longer need this mechanic.
1.6.4.6.2.3.1. Con: A UBI isn't designed to eliminate work, but to start people at the poverty line instead of zero. Those motivated by financial gain will still have the opportunity to pursue financial gain.
1.6.4.6.2.4. Con: The central goal of a UBI is addressing poverty and economic turbulence, not creating fulfillment.
1.6.4.6.3. Con: It is too early to predict whether automation will actually take enough jobs that the economy couldn't support normal employment, with some arguing that the belief that this will lead to unemployment is actually an ['economic delusion'](https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson).
1.6.4.6.3.1. Pro: Technological innovations automatically cause [compensation effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment#Compensation_effects) that strongly mitigate their consequences.
1.6.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: In the past, [new technologies](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety) have always created more jobs than they have destroyed.
1.6.4.6.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.1.
1.6.4.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: New technologies lead to increased productivity which in turn creates more wealth, cheaper goods, greater spending power, and ultimately more jobs.
1.6.4.6.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Whilst this is true, in the US, for example, average incomes have been relatively stagnant for the last 30 years, whilst the National wealth has increased significantly. Wealth creation has always been transferred to the already wealthy, with little benefit for the middle, and working class.
1.6.4.6.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is untrue. From the mid 1800's until the mid 70s [productivity grew in line with real term wages.](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/what-happened-to-the-wage-and-productivity-link/)
1.6.4.6.3.1.2. Con: However, some [economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment#Compensation_effects) have concluded that those compensation effects are reduced or, at least, need to be studied [further](http://ftp.iza.org/dp6291.pdf) due to new technologies such as computerization.
1.6.4.6.3.1.3. Pro: In Germany, there is a huge number of robot-intensive industries and a high degree of automation. However, this does not negatively affect [total employment](http://voxeu.org/article/rise-robots-german-labour-market).
1.6.4.6.3.1.3.1. Con: Although total employment has not been intensively negatively affected, [roughly 275,000](http://voxeu.org/article/rise-robots-german-labour-market) full-time manufacturing jobs have been replaced by robots in the period 1994-2014.
1.6.4.6.3.1.3.1.1. Con: As those significant losses in employment could be offset by job gains outside manufacturing, robots and automation only have changed the employment market's[composition](http://voxeu.org/article/rise-robots-german-labour-market), but not the total employment rate.
1.6.4.6.3.1.4. Pro: New jobs always replace old. We’ll need automation maintenance & improvement, and emerging resource production \(such as algenol farms and silicon & lithium mining\).
1.6.4.6.3.2. Con: Though we can't predict it with complete accuracy, there are observable patterns to follow. Not only can we vaguely see where technology is headed, we can observe the attitudes of various employers to new development to determine how employment is likely to rise or fall.
1.6.4.6.3.3. Pro: The presumption that technological change will inexorably create pressure on employment is not demonstrated while economic history suggests higher global productivity is not detrimental to strong employment. This tends to make UBI pointless in that respect.
1.6.4.6.3.3.1. Con: A UBI would not create redundant jobs, but rather allow people a better chance to find or create a needed job.
1.6.4.6.3.3.2. Con: A UBI could be beneficial to absorb the short term changes in the labor market dynamic, even if in the long term society would be able to adapt without UBI.
1.6.4.6.3.4. Pro: A future of massive job automation/displacement \(where new jobs aren't created, it's futile to retrain displaced workers, and indefinite unemployment benefits are their only hope to get by\) is extremely speculative/hypothetical at this stage. We should instead focus on optimizing our education system for the 21st century, so everyone \(all ages, all social classes\) have the opportunity to acquire in-demand skills...if jobs do become scarce, the "haves" must face fierce competition for those jobs
1.6.4.6.4. Pro: A UBI allows workers to maintain dignity and pay bills while training for new skills higher in demand in the market dynamically, rather than playing the "skills-based education" lottery.
1.6.4.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.2.2.
1.6.4.7. Con: Companies could use a UBI as a justification to offer lower wages.
1.6.4.7.1. Pro: Companies are constrained in the current environment by people needing enough wages to, at the least, survive. If a UBI provides this level of subsistence instead then employment wages act as a marginal top up and can be offered at lower rates.
1.6.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.6.4.7.3. Con: Companies will still be restricted by their respective countries laws with respect to minimum wage.
1.6.4.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.6.4.7.4. Con: Employers would be forced to increase wages for low-wage jobs, since many low-wage workers would drop out of the labor force if a UBI were enacted.
1.6.4.7.4.1. Pro: [The law of supply and demand](https://www.mackinac.org/3818) applies to labor just like it does most things that are bought and paid for. The more an employer is willing to pay for an hour of somebody's time, the more persons will be willing to accept the employment.
1.6.5. Con: A UBI can improve the lives of many members of society in the short run. However, the long-term negative effects would outweigh the initial short-term gain.
1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.
1.7. Pro: A UBI is an effective tool for societies to prepare for and embrace future developments and technological progress.
1.7.1. Con: If the UBI is prohibitively expensive, it may prevent societies from making investments that are needed to respond to future shocks and changes.
1.7.2. Pro: Demographic change in many Western countries is decreasing the amount of money going into pension funds for retirees. UBI will help assure that people receive a sufficient amount of money in their retirement.
1.7.2.1. Con: If there is a decreasing amount of money feeding into pension funds, it is unlikely that countries would be able to finance UBI which could be a lot more costly.
1.7.2.2. Con: Welfare schemes, like Social Security, already discourage saving for retirement. Enacting an even more expensive UBI makes retirement self sufficiency even more difficult and less incentivized.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: Nobody is "self sufficient" \(short of someone living in the wild\), it's just a question of how any given individual depends on society.
1.7.2.3. Pro: In many Western countries, people are [living longer and birth rates are falling](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/ageing/articles/livinglongerhowourpopulationischangingandwhyitmatters/2018-08-13), leading to the population as a whole becoming older.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.
