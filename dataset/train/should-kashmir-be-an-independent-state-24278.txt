Discussion Name: Should Kashmir Be An Independent State?

1. Kashmir should be an independent state.
1.1. Pro: The Kashmiri people want to be independent.
1.1.1. Con: Kashmir is incredibly divided on this issue.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In the Hindu Jammu division to the south, support for independence is [under 1%](https://www.bbc.com/news/10161171).
1.1.1.2. Pro: [On average](https://www.bbc.com/news/10161171), 44% of people in Pakistani-administered Kashmir favored independence, compared with 43% in Indian-administered Kashmir. This fails to carry an overall majority on either side.
1.1.1.3. Con: A [Reuters poll](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kashmir-poll-idUSDEL29179620070813) concluded that only 3 percent of the mainly Muslim inhabitants of Srinagar think Kashmir should become part of Pakistan, and 7 percent prefer Indian rule.
1.1.2. Con: Kashmir already has a degree of independence granted by the [Indira-Sheikh Accords](https://thedispatch.co.in/the-indira-sheikh-accord-1975/) which grants Kashmir special status.
1.1.2.1. Con: The autonomy granted by the Indira-Sheikh Accords has been [eroded since 1953.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/article-35-a-how-jammu-and-kashmir-s-demand-for-autonomy-has-shaped-up-since-independence/story-mmhKcOugKwpwGrFIKh7gQJ.html) Efforts to bring autonomy back in line with the Indira-Sheikh Accords have been largely unsuccessful.
1.1.2.2. Con: There is a [court case](https://www.news18.com/news/india/article-35a-supreme-court-adjourns-hearing-to-january-2019-1862583.html) currently before the Indian Supreme Court which seeks to remove the "special status" accorded to Kashmir.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The Accords recognise Kashmir's [different historical path to form part of India](https://www.newslaundry.com/2017/09/12/a-brief-history-of-kashmirs-vanishing-autonomy) and preserve a measure of the states former independence.
1.1.2.4. Pro: The Indira-Sheikh Accords grant Kashmir the right to make policy relating to many areas including welfare, cultural matters, social security, personal and procedural law.
1.1.3. Pro: Polling indicates that independence is the [most popular](https://www.bbc.com/news/10161171) position across all zones of Kashmir compared with becoming part of either India or Pakistan.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Any Kashmiri that argues to be with India or Pakistan may be due to insecurity of it being taken over by the other nation. If both India and Pakistan were to agree on it's independence, vast majority would want to be independent.
1.1.4. Pro: In the Kashmir valley support for independence is between [74% and 95%.](https://www.bbc.com/news/10161171)
1.1.4.1. Con: Polls which ask Kashmiri Muslims whether they support independence should be [treated with caution](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/57075/why-an-independent-kashmir-is-not-good-news-for-both-pakistan-and-india/): many support independence only as a means of escaping Indian control, as opposed to an optimal solution.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Opposing Indian control is a perfectly legitimate reason to support independence.
1.1.4.2. Con: A survey of 3,700 people is not representative of Kashmiri opinion.
1.2. Pro: If Kashmir is part of either Pakistan or India it will never be stable or successful.
1.2.1. Con: As a part of India or Pakistan, Kashmir would have greater protection from aggressive actions by the other state than if it was independent.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Both countries are nuclear powers. Because of the risk of [Mutually Assured Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction), neither side is likely to launch an attack on another's sovereign land.
1.2.1.2. Con: Kashmir's important geostrategic location in between the two countries ensures that they will not allow the other country to take over or exert control over it.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Pakistan and India have been fighting over Kashmir since 1947, with [territorial gain](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/08/world/kashmir-fast-facts/index.html) in the region being a major incentive in the wars fought between the two powers.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Both countries have been involved in [cross-border skirmishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Pakistan_border_skirmishes_\(2016%E2%80%932018\)) over Kashmir.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Both sides have fought full-scale wars against each other twice in [1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948) and [1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965) over the territory in Kashmir.
1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: In [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War), Pakistani soldiers disguised as Kashmiri militants infiltrated positions on the Indian side of the Line of Control.
1.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: The Indian Army claims that Pakistan [violated the ceasefire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42856494) in Kashmir 860 times in 2017. This is the largest number of violations reported since the ceasefire went into effect in November 2003. It has also approximately doubled the number of violations reported in 2015 and 2016 \(405 and 449 respectively\).
1.2.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Since [no international observers monitor](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42856494) the Line of Control between Indian-occupied and Pakistani-occupied Kashmir, these reports are all but impossible to verify.
1.2.1.2.1.5. Pro: Pakistan claims that India violated the ceasefire in Kashmir [1,900 times in 2017](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42856494).
1.2.1.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.2. Pro: Kashmiris will not have fair representation in Pakistan or India.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Pakistani Kashmir is administered as two provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit Baltistan, both of which have elected assemblies. However, neither of these assemblies has the parliamentary representation or rights of [other Pakistani provinces.](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/pakistani-kashmir)
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Pakistan's federal government controls [key executive functions](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/pakistani-kashmir) in these territories without any accountability to the local voters.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: This trend may be changing - a [recommendation](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/pakistani-kashmir) was submitted to the federal government in March 2017 by a parliamentary committee recommending greater integration of Gilgit Baltistan.
1.2.3. Pro: A neutral confederation of States replacing the old princely State of Jammu & Kashmir, will bring stability and advance economic progress in Asia, [much like](http://www.nancho.net/fdlap/kashmir/hapkash.html) [Switzerland](http://tanveerandkashmir.blogspot.com/2010/09/neutral-kashmir-natural-equilibrium.html) did in Europe.
1.2.3.1. Pro: An independent Kashmir will greatly enhance [water management technology](https://tanveerandkashmir.blogspot.com/2011/04/from-cbms-to-obms.html) in the region because [its survival will depend on efficient supply of that water to the thirsty plains of India and Pakistan](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/25/are-india-and-pakistan-on-the-verge-of-a-water-war-pulwama-kasmir-ravi-indus/) thus averting future wars over water.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Kashmiri neutrality would allow India and Pakistan to devote more time and resources to the needs of their own citizens.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: India's vast military takes up valuable resources which might otherwise be spent on its own citizens.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: India has the world's [third-largest military by personnel, and fifth-largest defence budget](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/india/2017-10-16/will-india-start-acting-global-power).
1.2.4. Con: Kashmir historically has been a prosperous and [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amritsar_\(1846\)) state.
1.2.5. Pro: Neither Pakistan nor India are likely to settle for Kashmir becoming part of the other state.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Due to its physical contiguity with India and Pakistan and physical access, Kashmir has great geo-political, strategic and military importance for both countries. [\(Pandow, p.4\)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/68a7/31a406811326eb3932e393fa35f19d73dcaf.pdf)
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Both countries would fear that Kashmir might be used as route for [state sponsored terrorists](https://www.cfr.org/interactives/global-conflict-tracker#!/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan) to infiltrate their lands.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: The Government of India would always fear that independent Kashmir would be used as a route for terrorists infiltrating into India. They would attempt to control the vital border regions, and always intrude on the new state's sovereignty.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: An independent Kashmir would be a safe haven for terrorist organizations.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Extremist organizations, such as [ISIS and Al-Qaeda](https://southasianvoices.org/real-dangers-islamic-state-al-qaeda-kashmir/), currently operate in the region.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Lashkar-e-Taiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Taiba#Objectives), which has links to Al-Qaeda, is particularly active in the region.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: An independent Kashmir would likely reduce motivation for Lashkar-e-Taiba.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A resolution to the Kashmir crisis would likely mean that its funding sources from Pakistan would dry up.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Terror outfits such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad are [funded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/pakistan-based-terror-groups-fund-terrorism-in-j-k-through-charity/articleshow/57498198.cms) through charitable donations in Pakistan.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: One of its stated objectives is to "[liberate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Taiba#Objectives)" Muslims residing in Indian Kashmir. Once Muslims are "liberated" from Hindu rule this objective and recruitment tool will be gone.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The objectives of religious militant organizations are ever-expanding.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Zakir Musa, the commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, has explicitly distanced himself from the 70-year-old independence movement in the valley and from elements who wish to merge with Pakistan, declaring his fight is to establish [Shariah law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/22/kashmir-conflict-shifts-top-militant-fight-islam-independence-zakir-musa) in Kashmir.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The [Taliban](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~amjad20s/classweb2/page2.html), created by USA, fought against the Soviets in the Afghan invasion because the USSR was a Godless country invading Muslim lands. In 2001, many of these militants launched an attack on US soil because they termed USA's actions as 'un-islamic'.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: A divided Kashmir gives room for terrorist organizations to recruit more members.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Pakistan-India conflict within Kashmir is what has led to the presence of [young men with arms](https://southasianvoices.org/real-dangers-islamic-state-al-qaeda-kashmir/), the most easily [radicalized demographic](https://newrepublic.com/article/131948/risk-radicalization).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Kashmiri militancy is focused on [liberating the region](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-18738906) as opposed to a global Jihad. Therefore, Kashmiri militants are unlikely to join an organization which has a separate goal.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Many militants in Kashmir who have carried out attacks profess ideologies of Islamic fundamentalism and are linked to global Islamist militants.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Jaish-e-Mohammed, who was responsible for the[2018 Sunjuwan attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Sunjuwan_attack), has [ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaish-e-Mohammed) to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Both the young men and the arms will not leave Kashmir once it becomes independent.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The presence of so many troops and armed forces in the reason is in and of itself a cause of violence. After independence, their numbers would be substantially reduced.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: There are [up to 600,000 soldiers, paramilitaries and police](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/kashmir-its-time-for-india-take-a-risk-8624005.html) in the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The Indian AFSPA \([Armed Forces Special Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_\(Special_Powers\)_Act)\) makes it almost impossible to prosecute troops, giving them effective immunity for any offences they commit against civilians. Human rights groups argue that it is responsible for [epidemics of rape and assault](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2017/03/the-norm-of-sexual-violence-and-impunity-in-jk-2/), targeted at the civilian population.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Immunity from prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_\(Special_Powers\)_Act), combined with the communal enmities of Hindus and Muslims in the region, gives the soldiers both incentive and capacity to inflict immense violence upon the locals.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4. Con: An independent government might still require significant armed forces to address security problems in Kashmir. There may continue to be unrest for various reasons.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Many militant groups who are active in Kashmir have [causes](https://southasianvoices.org/real-dangers-islamic-state-al-qaeda-kashmir/) which transcend independence.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: There are issues that would exist in a newly independent Kashmir which could continue to radicalize existing militant groups.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Since the [overwhelming majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir) is Muslim, post-independence Kashmir is likely to have a predominantly Muslim government. Given the history of [communal violence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/10236064/Kashmir-Violence-escalates-between-Hindus-and-Muslims.html) between Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir, the government is likely to have discriminatory policies against Hindus.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Kashmir already has a [history of persecution](https://thediplomat.com/2016/01/the-persecution-of-kashmirs-minority-hindus/) of the Hindu minority by the Muslim majority.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2. Pro: Even if Kashmir was independent, Pakistan would continue trying to exert influence over it, undermining its sovereignty and viability, including its ability to have an independent foreign policy.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Kashmir is incredibly important to Pakistan as the source of its major [rivers](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/18522/is-there-a-solution-to-the-kashmir-dispute/).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Control of the six major rivers in Kashmir is one of the few areas in which India and Pakistani have [successfully cooperated](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/57075/why-an-independent-kashmir-is-not-good-news-for-both-pakistan-and-india/). The Indus Water Treaty, brokered by the World Bank in the early 1960s, is still in place, and divides control of the rivers relatively equitably. A similar international framework could allow the parties to continue to cooperate in a world in which Kashmir gained independence.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: If Kashmir became independent, the Indus Water Treaty would have to be renegotiated and rewritten in its entirety, and this time an agreement might not be reached.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Pakistan-India relations are currently [very poor](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/editorial/a-glimmer-of-hope-dims-in-india-pakistan-relations-1.773215).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Pakistan has already [raised concerns](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pakistan-raises-indias-violation-of-indus-waters-treaty-with-world-bank/articleshow/64271901.cms) that certain Indian hydroelectric projects are in violation of the Indus Water Treaty. If the Treaty had to be renegotiated, it is likely that India would carry forward with its current actions and choose not to formalize a new set of agreements.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Pakistan would attempt at all costs to control Kashmiri foreign policy to stop it allying with the Indian state against Pakistan.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Pakistan has a long history of sponsoring terrorism and training terrorists for destabilizing Indian-administered Kashmir. [Musharraf admits Kashmir militants trained in Pakistan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11474618).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.2.2. Pro: Pakistan has a history of fearing ["encirclement"](https://www.hudson.org/research/12808-pakistan-s-worst-nightmare) by multiple neighbours, such as Afghanistan and India.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The lack of any political progress on Kashmir's future [disillusions](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/03/asia/violence-kashmir-isis-intl/index.html) the people of the valley, thereby making them prime targets for terrorist recruitment.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: [Human rights abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir) by the Pakistani and Indian armed forces in Kashmir are likely to radicalize locals, encouraging them to take up arms against these forces.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Without Pakistan and India's military presence, these organizations are likely to grow.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: India has spent [Rs.40.735 billion](http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/can-t-buy-peace-centre-has-spent-rs-4-735-crore-on-kashmir-policing-since-89-1468604171.html) on Kashmir policing since 1989 while Pakistan has agreed to allocate [Rs.108.2 billion](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1715915/1-budget-2018-19-ajk-budget-rs108-2-billion-outlay-presented/) to Kashmir in the 2018-2019 budget.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Due to Kashmir's [water resources](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/20117812154478992.html), it has great economic importance for both Pakistan and India.
1.2.5.3. Pro: An independent Kashmir would not be seen as a "win" for either Pakistan or India, making it more palatable for both parties.
1.2.5.4. Pro: India would not allow Kashmir to become part of Pakistan as this would allow control of the [Karakoram Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakoram_Pass) to pass to Pakistan.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: If the Karakoram Pass were in Pakistani territory this would allow Chinese and Pakistani forces to link [undermining Indian's security](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19780731-indian-defence-experts-worried-about-karakoram-highways-strategic-implications-to-security-818510-2015-01-31) along itself entire northern border.
1.3. Pro: Kashmiri independence is necessary to bring an end to the violence in the region.
1.3.1. Con: Kashmir need autonomity. The people of the region have and continue to bear the brunts of the actions of their forefathers. Being an independent country would engulf more chaos as now the fight for the region by two countries Will now increase in number and only foster aggrevation of war
1.3.2. Con: Religious tensions are likely to increase in an independent Kashmir.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.1.
1.3.2.2. Con: Religious tensions already exist in Kashmir. The benefit of independence is that the specifically Pakistani/Indian tensions will at least be removed.
1.3.3. Pro: If the status quo is allowed to continue, there will always be a risk of far worse violence in future.
1.3.3.1. Pro: President Bill Clinton famously called the disputed border in Kashmir ["the most dangerous place in the world"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-worlds-most-dangerous-place-is-already-at-war-282458.html).
1.3.3.2. Pro: There is always a risk of Pakistan and India going to war, and for the war to enter Kashmir.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: The costs of war deter Pakistan and India from going to war.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: It jeopardizes the government's chances of getting re-elected since the people face enormous costs.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Civilians are likely to [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties) in wars.
1.3.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Infrastructure is destroyed and maximum resources are diverted from other sectors to defense, thereby stagnating a [country's economy](https://ritholtz.com/2014/06/top-economists-say-war-is-bad-for-the-economy/).
1.3.3.3. Pro: There has been immense violence in Kashmir due to Pakistan and India's geopoliticking over the region.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Between 1989, when the anti-India insurgency began, and 2002, [at least 35,000 Kashmiris](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/world/border-tension-a-growth-industry-for-kashmir.html) were killed in the fighting. The real total may be double that number.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Pakistan is involved with anti-India terrorist groups in Kashmir.
1.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Con: Pakistan has consistently [denied involvement](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44400243) with any terrorist groups.
1.3.3.3.3.2.1. Con: Countries deny sponsoring terrorism because of the [repercussions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-sanctions-iran-russia-oil-network-it-says-funds-hamas-hezbollah/) they would face. Simply because countries deny sponsoring terrorism does not mean they don't it.
1.3.3.3.3.3. Con: Increasing international isolation acts as a massive deterrent for Pakistan to be involved with terrorist groups, and it is likely that the relationship will be abandoned.
1.3.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: Pakistan has been placed on the [FATF grey list](https://nation.com.pk/28-Jun-2018/fatf-decides-in-favour-of-keeping-pakistan-on-grey-list) because of it being implicated for laundering money to terrorist organizations.
1.3.3.3.3.3.2. Con: US sanctions were [ineffective](https://www.orfonline.org/research/42912-u-s-sanctions-on-pakistan-and-their-failure-as-strategic-deterrent/) in stopping Pakistan from developing its nuclear program.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Any future conflict in Kashmir would run the [risk of drawing in China and the United States.](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2019/03/how-future-wars-between-india-and-pakistan-could-draw-us-and-china)
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.5. Pro: The Kashmir state has the capacity to act as a [buffer state](http://www.kashmirlit.org/is-independent-kashmir-possible/) lying between Pakistan and India. Rather than escalating conflict, it could prevent conflict between the countries.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Historically, [many other regions](https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/buffer_state_54.htm) have successfully acted as buffer zones.
1.3.5.2. Con: If India loses control of Kashmir it will no longer have the [mountain ranges along the Line of Control to use as a defence](https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/columnists/understanding-the-importance-of-kashmir.html) against Pakistani military action.
1.3.6. Pro: China currently uses the [threat of further military action](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/7/31/is-china-the-next-big-player-in-kashmir) in Kashmir as a foreign policy tool against India. If Kashmir were independent it could no longer be used as a bargaining chip against India.
1.3.7. Con: If Kashmir cannot sustain a stable government and military this may cause further violence in the region.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Many Kashmiri political parties have militant wings. Once elected, they are likely to use coercive methods to clamp down on dissent.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: [Hizbul Mujahideen](https://www.refworld.org/docid/3f7d4df20.html) is the militant wing of the political party, Jamaat-e-Islami.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: [Lashkar-e-Taiba](https://www.peaceinsight.org/conflicts/kashmir/conflict-profile/key-people-and-parties/) was founded in 1994 as the militant wing of the Marqaz.
1.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.3.
1.3.7.3. Pro: There has been considerable [rivalry and friction](https://scroll.in/article/903075/kashmir-national-conference-pdp-have-long-been-rivals-but-are-they-really-ideological-opponents) between the two major Kashmir regional parties - the National Conference and the People's Democratic Party.
1.4. Con: Kashmiri independence is not viable.
1.4.1. Pro: [Kashmir](https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir-terror-attack) is too young to fend itself from terrorism emanating in her western borders. At the same time she needs the power of a democratic process which India can provide in the long run.
1.4.2. Pro: Surrounded by two countries thirsty for [water and energy](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/20117812154478992.html) with growing populations the prospects of an independent Kashmir are grim. It is more likely that Kashmir will be dragged into another conflict.
1.4.3. Pro: Regional stakeholders would not be in support of an independent Kashmir.
1.4.3.1. Pro: China would be unlikely to support Kashmir becoming independent. As the major global power in Asia, if China chooses not to support Kashmiri independence this could undermine the viability of an independent Kashmir.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: China has economic interests in Kashmir since its One Belt One Road initiative [passes](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/kashmir-dispute-hinders-china-pak-corridor-chinese-media/articleshow/55492090.cms) through the region. An independent Kashmir may not be beneficial to these interests.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Despite this interest, China has continued to [publicly affirm](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-denies-shift-in-stand-on-kashmir-issue/articleshow/58498861.cms) that the Kashmir issue should be negotiated between India and Pakistan.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: China is quickly [becoming the biggest investor](https://www.ft.com/content/898fa38e-4882-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb) in Asia. Investment is crucial in a new state in order to strengthen and develop the economy, it is therefore crucial China supports an independent Kashmir.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: An unstable Kashmir would be beneficial for China as it would weaken and distract Indian security forces.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: This would benefit China as there are a number of [disputed areas](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-india-border-tension-remains-despite-growing-economic-ties-us/articleshow/59030904.cms) along the Sino-Indian border.
1.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: Chinese and Indian armed forces have taken part in armed standoffs on the border as recently as [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_China%E2%80%93India_border_standoff).
1.4.3.1.4. Con: China would be able to exert its influence over an independent Kashmir and gain control by, for example, [debt-trap diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy).
1.4.3.1.5. Pro: Currently China controls a region of Kashmir called [Aksai Chin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksai_Chin). China claims that Aksai Chin is rightly part of the [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang) \(an autonomous region of China\). It is unlikely China would accept an independent Kashmir that included any part of the Aksai Chin region.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Indian opposition to Kashmiri independence makes the project unworkable.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: If India ever wanted to punish an independent Kashmir, it would have plenty of tools with which to do so. The new state would have to appease India on most major issues.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: The majority of Kashmir's economy is intimately linked to India's, thanks to decades of Indian control.
1.4.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: The Government of India has been [eager to integrate Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the Indian economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir#Economy), to the greatest degree possible.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Pro: Kashmir receives enormous amounts of aid from New Delhi, totalling [$812 million per annum](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/world/border-tension-a-growth-industry-for-kashmir.html). This program has considerable local benefits: Indian-controlled Kashmir has one of the [lowest rates of poverty in India \(4%\).](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/world/border-tension-a-growth-industry-for-kashmir.html)
1.4.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: 90% of funding which the Government of India gives to Kashmir [comes in the form of grants](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/world/border-tension-a-growth-industry-for-kashmir.html). For most other states, at least 70% of Government money comes in the form of loans.
1.4.3.2.2.3. Pro: If India were to close its border with an independent Kashmir and cut off trade, the economic effects would be devastating.
1.4.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Kashmir's economy is [overwhelmingly agricultural](https://www.britannica.com/place/Jammu-and-Kashmir#ref276937), and needs to export agricultural produce to sustain its industries. If India were to close off agricultural exports, it could do immense damage to the region overnight.
1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Agriculture employs [70% of Kashmir's workforce](http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_jandk/sdr_jkch3a.pdf) and accounts for [60% of state income](http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_jandk/sdr_jkch3a.pdf).
1.4.3.2.2.3.2. Pro: Kashmir runs an enormous trade deficit and is heavily reliant on imported goods: its imports are worth [seven times more](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-hurriyat-mirwaiz-umar-farooq-pakistan-sheikh-abdullah-narendra-modi/story/1/7531.html) than its exports.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.
1.4.5. Con: An independent Kashmir is economically viable.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Kashmir has a much more literate and skilled pool of human resource than India and Pakistan.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: As per the [National Census 2011](https://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/jammu+and+kashmir.html), literacy rate of Indian administered Kashmir is 68.74% with 78.26% male literates and 58.01% female literates. Similarly, for Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the literacy rate is 74%.
1.4.5.2. Pro: In terms of livelihood, the valley could sustain itself through [tourism](https://www.ibef.org/states/jammu-kashmir.aspx), [handicrafts](https://kashmirreader.com/2018/09/19/on-the-importance-of-handicrafts-in-an-economy/) and [agriculture](https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/10/03/in-kashmirs-chota-punjab-the-vegetable-boom-is-scripting-new-success-stories/).
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: An independent Kashmir could benefit from international tourism to many of its areas of natural beauty currently hidden from the world due to the [border tensions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/terror-and-security/near-economic-collapse-kashmirs-tourism-industry-decimated-indias/).
1.4.5.2.2. Con: The foreign exchange gained through tourism, handicrafts and agriculture may not be enough to "sustain" Kashmir.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.2.3.2.
1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: The government of Jammu and Kashmir currently [spends more than it earns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir#Economy).
1.4.5.3. Con: Kashmir has a [poorly performing economy.](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2017/07/kashmirs-staggering-economy-the-road-ahead/) It would be difficult for the newly independent state to change this.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.2.3.2.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: India and Pakistan, too, have poor economies. Yet, they are able to survive for all these years and hold their parts of Kashmir.
1.4.5.3.2.1. Pro: India trade deficit widened to [USD 17.13 billion](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/balance-of-trade) in October of 2018.
1.4.5.3.2.1.1. Con: [Trade deficits](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/14/news/economy/what-is-a-trade-deficit/index.html) do not necessarily correlate with economic strength or weakness.
1.4.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The US trade deficit is almost [500 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-trade-deficit-climbs-to-10-year-high-despite-tariffs-tough-trump-stance-2018-12-06), but one would not call it a "poor" economy.
1.4.5.3.2.2. Pro: Pakistan recorded a trade deficit of [PKR 383118 Million](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/balance-of-trade) in October of 2018.
1.4.5.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.2.1.1.
1.4.5.3.2.3. Pro: Both India and Pakistan have [extremely low](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html) GDP per capita compared to the rest of the world.
1.4.5.3.2.4. Con: India is the world's [third largest](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html) economy.
1.4.5.3.2.5. Con: Both India and Pakistan are some of the [world's fastest growing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate) economies.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: Destruction of infrastructure and violence has discouraged private investment in Kashmir. [\(Shekhawat, p.979\)](https://www.japss.org/upload/29._Seema.pdf)
1.4.5.3.3.1. Pro: Sales in the cricket bat industry have declined Rs 105 lakh to Rs 80 lakh from 2008-2010. [\(Pandow, p.6\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315832286_Investment_Industrial_Growth_and_Conflict_in_Kashmir_An_Analysis)
1.4.5.3.3.2. Pro: The basic infrastructure in terms of regular power supply, roads, communication systems, and drinking water remains poor in the state. [\(Mahapatra & Shekhawat, p.4\)](http://www.review.upeace.org/pdf.cfm?articulo=66&ejemplar=7)
1.4.5.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.2.2.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Lack of economic development in Kashmir is a result of the poor law and order situation.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: The threat of violence acts as a disincentive for tourists to visit Kashmir.
1.4.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.3.
1.4.5.5. Pro: Kashmir acted as a significant [trade transit](https://journals.openedition.org/asiecentrale/429) linking undivided India with Central Asia through the Silk Route. The restoration of old trade links and opening of new trade links is likely to boost the economy of Independent Kashmir.
1.4.5.6. Pro: India, Pakistan and China are likely to invest in Kashmir.
1.4.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.4.5.6.2. Con: It is likely that India, Pakistan and China would use foreign investment as a mean to exert control over Kashmir economically and politically.
1.4.5.6.2.1. Pro: Using aid and investment to exert control over other countries is a well established strategy in the status quo.
1.4.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: Part of the reason for the Israel's strongly [pro-American stance](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080080/israel-palestine-us-alliance) is the billions of dollars they receive in aid.
1.4.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: Part of the reason for Pakistan's strongly pro-Chinese stance is the aid and infrastructure investment projects \(such as the [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Pakistan_Economic_Corridor)\) that the Chinese give and participate in.
1.4.5.6.2.2. Con: This sort of indirect control is still preferable and less damaging to Kashmiri self-determination than direct military and administrative control.
1.4.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.4.5.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.4.6. Con: Since Pakistan supports the holding of a [plebiscite](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kashmir/back.htm) to decide the fate of Kashmir, it is likely to accept the result if it shows that the majority of Kashmiris want independence.
1.4.6.1. Con: Pakistan supports a plebiscite as envisaged under [UN Security Council Resolution 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_47). This envisaged a plebiscite on whether Kashmir would become part of India or Pakistan. Kashmiri independence would not be an option under such a plebiscite.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Pakistan's rhetoric surrounding the Kashmir issue is one full of support for the right to [self determination](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1162647/struggle-self-determination-pakistan-vows-support-kashmirs-freedom/) of the Kashmiri people. Even if independence wasn't an option on the initially proposed plebiscite, Pakistan's rhetoric makes it clear that it will support any free choice the Kashmiri people make.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: It is in Pakistan's best interest to appear to support a plebiscite as it undermines Indian control over the region. In reality Pakistan is unlikely to support a plebiscite or to respect the result if they were not in their favour.
1.4.7. Pro: Kashmir is not a single region; it is multiple regions. It makes no sense for it to have a single government.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Supposing independence was granted for an independent Kashmir, the Kashmiris unable to build a state would then be divided along [caste and tribal village lines against each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiris). They should not be given independence but instead should struggle for it so that the successors of this struggle can form an independent state.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Kashmir has been partitioned and its administration divided for decades: establishing a single governing authority would be complex.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: Germany succeeded in dismantling a [similar barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_German_border) when the country was reunified in the early 1990s.
1.4.7.2.2. Con: Such a situation is not unprecedented, East and West Germany [reunited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification) following several decades of split, hostile administration.
1.4.7.3. Pro: Kashmir's territory is physically divided by militarised borders, including [minefields and electrified barriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Control#Indian_Line_of_Control_fencing). The border is [776km long](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42856494) and is the [most heavily militarised on earth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42856494). Dismantling this barrier would be difficult and dangerous.
1.4.7.3.1. Pro: The whole India-Pakistan border, which is 1800 miles long, is heavily militarised. Both sides have laid [hundreds of thousands of landmines](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/10/india.kashmir). India has a stockpile of between [4 and 5 million mines](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/10/india.kashmir), Pakistan may have around [6 million](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/10/india.kashmir).
1.4.7.3.1.1. Pro: Minefields cause numerous deaths on both sides of the border: [in January 2002 alone there were two mass deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/10/india.kashmir): 11 people killed by an Indian mine, and 19 Indian soldiers killed by a similar Pakistani device.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.2.1.
1.4.7.3.3. Pro: There are only [three official crossing points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Control#Indian_Line_of_Control_fencing) between the Indian and Pakistani zones of control.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Different parts of Kashmir have wildly differing cultures and economies: these different needs cannot be met by a blanket political system.
1.4.7.4.1. Pro: Kashmir is split into [three areas](http://theasiadialogue.com/2018/07/02/kashmir-faces-new-crisis/) - Kashmir Valley, the most populated area, which is predominantly Muslim, Jammu region, which is majority Hindu, and Ladakh Valley, which has a very small population, cultural ties to Tibet, and is split between Buddhists and Muslim Shia.
1.4.7.4.1.1. Pro: A [survey](https://tribune.com.pk/story/49238/two-thirds-in-indian-kashmir-want-independence-poll/) showed that a majority of residents in the Kashmir valley wanted independence, while Indian Jammu and Ladakh wanted a complete merger of the state with India.
1.4.7.4.2. Pro: The Government of India has exacerbated the divisions between different parts of Kashmir by [distributing government aid unevenly](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-hurriyat-mirwaiz-umar-farooq-pakistan-sheikh-abdullah-narendra-modi/story/1/7531.html), and developing some \(mostly Hindu\) parts more than others.
1.4.7.4.2.1. Pro: The chairman of the Kashmir Economic Alliance \(KEA\), [Mohammad Yasin Khan, said of a recent aid package](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-hurriyat-mirwaiz-umar-farooq-pakistan-sheikh-abdullah-narendra-modi/story/1/7531.html) given by the Government of India, “The Rs 80,000 crore package is a conspiracy to trifurcate Jammu and Kashmir on communal lines. In the name of development, a mere Rs 6,500 crore have been allotted to the \[[Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley#Demographics)\] Kashmir province whereas Rs 13,000 crore have been given to \[[plurality Muslim, but sparsely populated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladakh)\] Ladakh. A huge chunk of Rs 11,000 crore has been given to \[[Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_Division#Demographics)\] Jammu.”"
1.4.7.4.3. Con: Many governments \(notably the Governments of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_India), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_China) and [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_Pakistan)\) succeed in ruling over multiple diverse regions. There is no reason why a government of independent Kashmir could not achieve the same feat.
1.4.7.4.3.1. Con: These governments, unlike Kashmir, are ruling over territories which want to be part of an independent nation together.
1.4.7.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.4.7.4.3.1.2. Pro: Pakistan's attempt to hold onto East Pakistan when the region no longer wanted to be part of the union failed, led to a [bloody war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War), and ultimately to the formation of Bangladesh.
1.4.7.4.3.1.3. Con: There are many [active separatist movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatist_movements_of_Pakistan) in Pakistan.
1.4.7.4.3.1.4. Con: There are many [active separatist movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatist_movements_of_India) in India.
1.4.7.4.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.7.5. Con: -> See 1.4.7.4.3.
1.4.7.6. Con: Kashmir was governed as a single region from [1846 to 1952.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_\(princely_state\))
1.4.7.7. Con: Federations are made up of states / provinces; provinces / states are made up of districts. What holds them together are enough similarities with respect to culture, religion, economics, politics, philosophy, morals, ethnic background, etc. Kashmir more than qualifies.
1.4.7.8. Pro: Given Kashmir should not be a single region with a single government, the status quo of division between India, Pakistan and China makes sense. All parties involved should accept the present lines of control.
1.4.7.8.1. Pro: Lines of control which allow heavily-Muslim areas to affiliate with Pakistan, and more diverse areas \(with large Hindu populations\) to affiliate with India, allow both religious groups to protect their traditional cultures, and allow both to be part of national communities which respected their rights and traditions.
1.4.7.8.1.1. Pro: The population of Pakistani-administered Kashmir is [almost entirely Muslim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir#Population) Permanent affiliation with the Muslim state of Pakistan would ensure that the rights of these Muslims are protected in perpetuity.
1.4.7.8.1.2. Con: Jammu and Kashmir \(the parts of the region which fall under Indian control\) have [majority-Muslim populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir#Demographics). It is unclear why affiliating with India \(a majority Hindu state\) would best protect the traditions, rights, and cultures of these populations.
1.4.7.8.1.3. Pro: [Nearly 30%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir#Demographics) of the population of Jammu and Kashmir practice Hinduism. Around [68% practice Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir#Demographics). These provinces therefore have a far more mixed and diverse population than Pakistani-occupied Kashmir, and would perhaps benefit more from affiliation with India \(an explicitly [secular state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_India)\).
1.4.7.8.2. Pro: If all concerned parties, especially the governments of India and Pakistan, were to recognise the present lines of control as legitimate, violence in the region would be substantially reduced.
1.4.7.8.2.1. Pro: The armies of both India and Pakistan engage in violent skirmishes along the lines of control in order to assert their countries' rights to the disputed territory. If each side recognised the other's present position as legitimate, these skirmishes would cease.
1.4.7.8.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.4.7.8.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.4.
1.4.7.8.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.5.
1.4.7.8.3. Con: The view that unifying Kashmir would be difficult \(or unwise, or illegitimate\) does not automatically mean that the present division of Kashmir is a legitimate one.
1.5. Con: Kashmir should be a part of Pakistan.
1.5.1. Pro: Kashmiri people [said they want to be in Pakistan](https://thewire.in/politics/farooq-abdullah-kashmir-china-slaves-karan-thapar-transcript), so it should be in Pakistan.
1.5.2. Pro: Pakistan has shown greater consideration for fixing the problems of violence and oppression in Kashmir than other actors, and is consequently likely to be able to form the most effective government in the region.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Pakistan's foreign office has [welcomed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/calls-inquiry-human-rights-violations-kashmir-180614082257845.html) UN reports criticizing the behaviour of both Pakistan and India in Kashmir.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Pakistani PM Imran Khan has [strongly condemned](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/384071-pm-imran-khan-strongly-condemns-indian-atrocities-in-kashmir) Indian atrocities in Kashmir.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Imran Khan [has spoken against Indian atrocities in Kashmir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IpIjbT31c) at the United Nations General Assembly, but Narendra Modi didn't even mention Kashmir in his speech.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Kashmir is essential to Pakistan's understanding of its [own nationhood](https://www.dawn.com/news/1352648), so Pakistan is likely to treat Kashmir as a part of the country rather than as an annexed territory.
1.5.2.4. Con: Significant opposition to Pakistani rule may force Pakistani forces to crack down on dissenting Kashmiris.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: [Mass killings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/balochistan-pakistans-secret-dirty-war) carried out by the Pakistani government in Balochistan have been in response to independence movements in the region.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: [Mass killings and atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) were carried out by the Pakistani government in response to calls for self-determination in Bangladesh.
1.5.2.5. Con: Pakistan's "moral" position on Kashmir is a recent phenomena which can be traced back to [1990](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/kashmir-policy-needs-a-fresh-appraisal/). It is better understood as a strategic position than a genuinely felt one.
1.5.2.6. Con: Projections from a Kashmiri plebiscite [have changed](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/kashmir-policy-needs-a-fresh-appraisal/) from favouring a secession to Pakistan to favouring independence in the decades since Partition. This implies that Kashmir has not been pleased with Pakistani policies in and regarding the region.
1.5.2.7. Con: In Pakistan administered Kashmir there is government oppression including strict limitations on [freedom of expression and freedom of association.](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/pakistani-kashmir)
1.5.2.7.1. Pro: The Pakistani government does not allow the participation of pro-independence political parties and [routinely arrests and detains members of the United Kashmir People's National Party.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12492173)
1.5.3. Pro: Integration with Pakistan is beneficial for the Kashmiri people.
1.5.3.1. Con: Integration with Pakistan would imply worse access to the larger Indian market.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Assuming existing tensions between India and Pakistan continue \(they might even worsen once Kashmir joins Pakistan\), trade between Kashmir and the rest of India would become difficult.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.2.3.
1.5.3.2. Con: Kashmir would inherit the economic problems of Pakistan.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Pakistan has [high public debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Pakistan) which has led in recent times to a [balance-of-payments crisis](https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/pakistans-economic-crisis/).
1.5.4. Con: Pakistan-controlled Kashmir has been rated "not free" while the rest of Pakistan and India-controlled Kashmir are rated "partially free" by [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf) \(map on page 13\). This indicates the Pakistani government may not be interested in the welfare of Kashmiris.
1.5.5. Pro: Kashmir has a [majority Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir) population, and Pakistan was built specifically to provide a [homeland for Indian Muslims.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-nation_theory)
1.5.5.1. Con: The concept of Pakistan as a homeland for Muslims \([Two Nation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-nation_theory)\) has failed.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Islamic customs and laws are enshrined in Pakistan's [Constitution](https://www.dawn.com/news/1148376).
1.5.5.1.2. Con: Even if the Two Nation Theory does not perfectly map onto current geographical realities, it does not change the fact that it was the governing principle of Partition.
1.5.5.1.2.1. Pro: The legitimacy of the borders of the subcontinent was decided in the Partition.
1.5.5.1.2.1.1. Con: These borders have been renegotiated in subsequent settlements such as the [Simla Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simla_Agreement).
1.5.5.1.3. Pro: Bangladesh, another Muslim majority country, [split from Pakistan in 1971](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangladesh/The-Pakistani-period-1947-71), implying that factors other than religious congruity are relevant to Pakistani nationhood.
1.5.5.1.4. Pro: India is home to over [150 million](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/indias-muslim-population) Muslims.
1.5.5.1.4.1. Con: There has been a history of Muslims in India suffering [violence](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/20/mobs-killing-muslims-india-narendra-modi-bjp) and state oppression.
1.5.5.1.5. Pro: There is increasing [debate](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GC19Df04.html) in Pakistan about the core Muslim identity of the state.
1.5.6. Con: Kashmiris do not want to be a part of Pakistan.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Pakistan sponsored militant outfits are responsible for [760 fatalities](https://www.rand.org/blog/2001/09/pakistans-role-in-the-kashmir-insurgency.html) between 1996 and 2000, thereby breeding resentment among the people of Kashmir against the state of Pakistan.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Both India and Pakistan acknowledge that the number of militants coming to Kashmir from Pakistani administered zones has [decreased](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-18738906) significantly.
1.5.6.2. Pro: The pro-Pakistani sentiment that does exist in Kashmir can better be interpreted as a [reaction to Indian oppression](https://www.dawn.com/news/1237193) than a desire for a Kashmir-Pakistan merger.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Surveys conducted in [Indian Kashmir](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/18522/is-there-a-solution-to-the-kashmir-dispute/) between 2007-2010 have shown that less than 10% of the Muslim population of Indian Kashmir would like to join Pakistan.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: This survey was taken before [Article 370 was revoked.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49234708)
1.5.6.4. Pro: Non-Muslims in Kashmir, such as the Hindus of Jammu and the Buddhists of Ladakh, have [never expressed any interest](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/2.stm) in joining Pakistan.
1.6. Pro: Kashmir meets the criteria for statehood.
1.6.1. Pro: The only relevant criteria for statehood should be to fulfill people's right to [self-determination.](https://www.unpo.org/article/4957)
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Kashmir fulfils the requirements set out in the [Montevideo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Convention) Convention on Statehood, which is part of customary international law and codifies the theory of Statehood.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Kashmir has a defined [territory](https://thenewinternationallaw.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/what-makes-a-state/).
1.6.2.2. Pro: Kashmir has a permanent [population](https://thenewinternationallaw.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/what-makes-a-state/).
1.6.2.3. Con: Kashmir does not have a body capable of governing the entire territory as it is currently governed separately by India and Pakistan. This is a requirement for statehood according to the [Montevideo Convention](https://thenewinternationallaw.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/what-makes-a-state/).
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Other theories of statehood, notably [the Constitutive Theory of Statehood](http://www.exploringgeopolitics.org/publication_worster_willliam_sovereignty_constitutive_declatory_statehood_recognition_legal_view_international_law_court_justice_montevideo_genocide_convention/), argue that a governing body is not a requirement for statehood. The requirements of the Montevideo Convention should not be treated as gospel.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: If Kashmir were to move towards independence, it would presumably establish a governing body which was ready to take control of its territory. The fact that it does not have one yet is not a reason that it could not have one in the future.
1.6.2.3.2.1. Con: Kashmir does not have many of the elements necessary for a functioning democracy.
1.6.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: It would be difficult for Kashmir to establish a functioning media. The media is currently under-developed due to [crack downs from India security forces](https://www.cjr.org/watchdog/journalism-kashmir.php).
1.6.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The Pakistan military and intelligence agencies have been responsible for [crackdowns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2018/07/11/a-dirty-war-on-freedom-of-the-press-in-pakistan/?utm_term=.f20db690450a) on local media networks, yet Pakistan is a functional democracy.
1.6.2.3.2.2. Pro: There are a number of [regional political parties active in Kashmiri politics](https://www.peaceinsight.org/conflicts/kashmir/conflict-profile/key-people-and-parties/) which could form the basis of a government.
1.6.2.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.6.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: The People's Democratic Party \(a Kashmiri separatist party\) has been [in coalition with the BJP since Kashmir's last election in 2014.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-30575235)
1.6.2.3.2.2.2.1. Con: The BJP pulled out of the coalition government in 2018 saying that political agreement between the two parties had become ["untenable".](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/20/asia/india-kashmir-bjp-intl/index.html)
1.6.2.3.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.
1.6.2.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.7.2.
1.6.2.4. Con: A key feature of a sovereign state \(defined in the [Montevideo Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Convention)\) is a capacity [to enter into relations with other sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state#Declarative_theory). This would be particularly difficult for Kashmir to do, because of probable pressure from India, Pakistan and China.
1.6.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3.2.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: India would be likely to retaliate strongly if an independent Kashmir were ever to attempt to align itself with Pakistan.
1.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.2.
1.6.2.4.3. Pro: Assuming one of India, Pakistan and China \(or all three\) object to the existence of an independent Kashmir, other powers would be unlikely to establish close ties with the newly independent state, for fear of antagonising an influential geopolitical actor and nuclear power.
1.6.2.5. Con: The Montevideo Convention represents only one theory of what constitutes statehood \(the Declaratory Theory\). There are [other competing theories](http://www.exploringgeopolitics.org/publication_worster_willliam_sovereignty_constitutive_declatory_statehood_recognition_legal_view_international_law_court_justice_montevideo_genocide_convention/), most notably the Constitutive Theory.
1.6.3. Con: Criteria for statehood established in the nineteenth century, for example at the [Congress of Vienna](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318110618_State_formation_and_recognition_in_international_law#page=10), hold that a state [only exists when recognised as sovereign by other states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state#Constitutive_theory). It would be difficult for an independent Kashmir to be recognised by the international community in this way.
1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.3.
1.7. Con: Kashmir should be a part of India.
1.7.1. Pro: [The Instrument of Accession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession_\(Jammu_and_Kashmir\)) \(IOA\) signed by Maharaja Hari Singh, to accede to India, was legally valid.
1.7.1.1. Con: The IOA was accepted under [coercive circumstances](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/07/analysis-kashmir-issue-since-independence/): Pakistani forces were already present and attempting to annex Kashmir, and signing the IOA was India's condition for helping the Maharaja.
1.7.1.2. Con: The Maharaja was not a popular leader, and was regarded as a tyrant by most Kashmiris as he used [brute force](https://nation.com.pk/16-Mar-2017/the-day-kashmir-was-sold) to suppress the population.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: During the [Poonch rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Poonch_rebellion), the Maharaja's troops attacked hundreds of people and burned down villages.
1.7.1.3. Con: Indian forces were in Kashmir before the Instrument of Accession was signed with India. That is a violation of the [Standstill Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standstill_agreement_\(India\)), which was designed to prevent the application of coercion on the ruler of Kashmir.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: Maharaja of Kashmir had no right to call in the Indian Army, because the Standstill Agreement held that the Maharaja of Kashmir was not a hereditary ruler and was merely a British appointee, after the British [defeated Ranjit Singh](http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho000000394u00076000.html) who ruled the area before the British conquest.
1.7.1.4. Con: This argument of The Instrument of Accession is no longer valuable as the will of the people must now be catered to.
1.7.2. Pro: Kashmir has cultural and historical links to India.
1.7.2.1. Con: This is also true for the territories which now form Pakistan and Bangladesh, but they are still sovereign, independent states.
1.7.2.2. Pro: The state of Jammu and Kashmir has one of the most important Hindu Pilgrimage sites, i.e. the [Amarnath Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarnath_Temple).
1.7.2.3. Pro: Chanting in [Sanskrit](http://www.greatshravasti.com/en/culture-and-arts-performances) forms an integral part of Ladakh's Buddhist lifestyle.
1.7.3. Pro: Integration with India is beneficial for the Kashmiri people.
1.7.3.1. Pro: The budgetary fund has allotted [30,000 crore INR](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/allocation-for-jammu-and-kashmir-at-rs-30757-cr-ladakh-at-rs-5958-cr-for-fy21/articleshow/73835579.cms?from=mdr) for Jammu and Kashmir for the 2020-21 fiscal year, supporting growth and development. Either with Pakistan or independently ,the financial support would be comparatively less.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Integration with India offers benefits to Kashmir in terms of connectivity and market access. India is one of the largest markets in the world.
1.7.3.3. Pro: India being a secular country with an independent judiciary would be effective in maintaining rights of Kashmiris once the current violence stops.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: An independent judiciary has not stopped the Government of India abusing the human rights of Kashmiri citizens in the past.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.2.
1.7.4. Con: The Indian state has continuously carried out mass atrocities in Indian held Kashmir. They have therefore ceded the moral right to the territory.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Indian troops have been responsible for mass [human rights violations](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/indian-troops-kill-6-kashmir-death-toll-hits-record-high-181123114305542.html) against the people of Kashmir, thereby breeding resentment among the Kashmiris against India.
1.7.4.2. Pro: In 2016, India's [crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding) in Kashmir led to 17,000 injuries and hundreds of people being blinded and killed.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Since 2001, the Jammu and Kashmir government has attempted to have soldiers held [accountable](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/06/peace-kashmir-india-must-address-rights-abuses-security-forces) for their actions in 50 cases, of which 47 were denied by the central government.
1.7.4.4. Pro: The Indian state routinely responds to protests in Kashmir with lethal or semi lethal weaponry such as [shotgun pellets](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/06/peace-kashmir-india-must-address-rights-abuses-security-forces), which are capable of blinding people.
1.7.4.4.1. Pro: This is in violation of the UN's [Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/firearms.pdf).
1.7.4.5. Con: Many states have committed atrocities on their own soil, but still maintain legitimate claims on territory.
1.7.4.5.1. Pro: Pakistan has carried out [mass killings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/balochistan-pakistans-secret-dirty-war) in Balochistan and yet still has recognized sovereign control over the territory.
1.7.4.5.2. Pro: Australia has committed [mass killings](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/05/map-of-massacres-of-indigenous-people-reveal-untold-history-of-australia-painted-in-blood) against its own aboriginal people, but still is seen as having a legitimate control over its territory.
1.7.4.5.3. Pro: The United States and Canada have committed [mass killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_massacres) against Native Americans, but are still seen as having a legitimate right over their territory.
1.7.5. Con: Kashmiris do not want to be a part of India.
1.7.5.1. Pro: India has consistently [rigged elections](https://www.thehindu.com/2002/03/28/stories/2002032804141200.htm) in Kashmir, indicating that it is aware that the results are unlikely to favour Indian aims.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Kashmiris protested against Indian actions in Kashmir outside the [UN headquarters](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/374712-kashmiris-protest-outside-un-headquarters-against-indian-atrocities-in-iok) during Sushma Swaraj's address to the General Assembly in 2018.
1.7.5.3. Pro: The popular Kashmiri insurgency suggests that Kashmir does not want to be a part of India.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: The indigenous Kashmiri insurgency is not that popular and has been significantly [boosted](https://www.rand.org/blog/2001/09/pakistans-role-in-the-kashmir-insurgency.html) by Pakistan.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: Pakistani intelligence agencies facilitate the [funding](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4416771.stm) and recruitment of insurgents.
1.7.6. Con: Since the 1990s, India has avoided and [thwarted any attempts](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html) at the UN's recommended plebiscite in the region and any third party mediation.
1.7.6.1. Con: UNSC Resolution 1172 urges the need to resolve the dispute through [mutual dialogue](https://web.archive.org/web/20090327133349/http://www.undemocracy.com/S-RES-1172%281998%29.pdf) without the need for a plebiscite.
1.7.6.2. Con: [UNSC Resolution 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_47) cannot be implemented since Pakistan failed to [withdraw](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html) its forces from Kashmir, which was the first step in implementing the resolution
1.7.6.3. Pro: This shows that India is uninterested in the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
1.7.6.4. Con: The UN resolutions on Kashmir are not [enforceable](https://www.rediff.com/news/2004/jun/26pak1.htm) by the Security Council, and are purely [advisory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_47).
1.7.6.5. Con: Engagement of Kashmiri citizens in Indian democracy shows that they accept the sovereignty of India. Therefore a plebiscite is not needed.
1.7.6.5.1. Con: There are no alternatives for the people of Kashmir since lower voter turnout will not remove Indian control over the territory.
1.7.6.5.2. Pro: [Jammu](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/civic-polls-overwhelming-voter-turnout-in-jammu-dismal-in-kashmir-valley/articleshow/66152152.cms) registered a massive voter turnout in 2018.
1.7.6.5.3. Con: Voter turnout in elections in Kashmir is [low](https://thewire.in/politics/kashmir-ulb-elections-2018-turnout) and continues to decrease.
1.7.6.5.3.1. Pro: The threat and [fear of violence](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1384761/world) leads to a low voter turnout.
1.7.6.6. Con: A plebiscite would not take account of all views relevant to the future of Kashmir.
1.7.6.6.1. Pro: A plebiscite would likely be limited to those currently living in Kashmir, however, many people from Kashmir have [moved to other areas in India and Pakistan.](https://www.boloji.com/articles/16367/kashmir-plebiscite-is-it-still-relevant)
1.7.6.6.1.1. Con: The plebiscite could easily be announced well ahead of time, allowing the people who have left Kashmir to decide whether or not they wish to return to vote.
1.7.6.6.1.1.1. Con: Many of these people are [refugees](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/09/201391711186325937.html) who are unlikely to return.
1.7.6.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Kashmiri refugees live in bad conditions in [refugee camps](http://www.atimes.com/article/forgotten-kashmiri-pandits-resent-life-refugee-camps/) and find it difficult to make ends meet. There is an opportunity cost to the process of returning such as taking out time to figure out if the violence is likely to stop or getting documentation done. That time could be spent in looking for a job and collecting money which they need to survive the day. Therefore, they are unlikely to return.
1.7.6.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many people are only able to [associate violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43578469) with that region since they have grown up with it and it is all that they know. Therefore, they are unlikely to accept that violence will decrease.
1.7.6.6.1.2. Con: The results of the plebiscite are more relevant to the people living in Kashmir than those who have left, so them making the decision is morally right.
1.7.6.6.1.2.1. Pro: The refugees are no longer part of the region, and it no longer affects them. However, the people who live in Kashmir are still part of the region and still affected by developments there.
1.7.6.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Many refugees still have [families](https://www.ips.org.pk/kashmiri-refugees-facts-issues-and-the-future-ahead/) and loved ones who reside in Kashmir
1.7.6.6.1.2.2. Con: Many of the refugees had very little choice in leaving Kashmir given the levels of violence and persecution they would have faced had they stayed.
1.7.6.6.1.2.3. Con: The refugees may wish to return to Kashmir, therefore its future is important to them.
