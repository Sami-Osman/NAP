Discussion Name: What Is The Best Drug Regulation System?

1. What is the best drug regulation system?
1.1. Prohibit the production, distribution, possession, and consumption of all drugs.
1.1.1. Pro: Drugs and drug addiction have hugely damaging [social effects](http://www.medic8.com/drug-addiction/social-effects.html).
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Several](http://www.narconon.org/blog/drug-addiction/the-most-common-drugs-that-make-a-person-aggressive-or-angry/) common drugs are known to induce anger, aggression, and violence.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Cocaine](https://www.lifeworkscommunity.com/blog/the-relationship-between-cocaine-abuse-and-violence) and [PCP](https://www.foundationsrecoverynetwork.com/can-drugs-make-people-violent/) have both been linked to increases in violent behaviour.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Although cannabis relaxes people in the short term, continued use can cause anxiety and paranoia, which can result in [violent outbursts](https://cannabissupport.com.au/cannabis-and-aggression/).
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Those who experience continued exposure to cannabis are at a higher risk of eventually becoming [violent offenders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961342).
1.1.1.1.3. Con: The statistical influence of narcotics on UK [murder rates](https://theconversation.com/the-influence-of-drugs-on-murder-rates-is-being-overstated-130961) was found to be inflated.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Drug users often harm not only themselves, but also their loved ones, dependants, friends, and society at large.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Drug users sometimes end up [stealing](https://luxury.rehabs.com/drug-addiction/when-someone-is-stealing/) from others to support their habit.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Drug addicts may give birth to [drug-dependent babies](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36703939), who must then suffer through [Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_withdrawal).
1.1.1.2.4. Con: The same can be said about alcohol.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Alcohol and tobacco induced illnesses [cost society](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4862676/) billions of dollars per year.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Second-hand smoking](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/) is potentially more harmful to society than hard drug use induced violence. However, tobacco remains a legal drug.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2. Con: The widespread existence of [anti-tobacco](https://www.who.int/features/2003/08/en/) campaigns clearly shows that society is working to reduce those costs.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: The legalisation of drugs would not stop society from running anti-drug campaigns to minimise their use.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Only heroin has a higher social harm score than alcohol, and even then it is almost the same \([p. 3](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000774)\).
1.1.1.2.4.3. Con: This is a reason to criminalise or curtail the use of alcohol, not a justification to legalise drugs.
1.1.1.2.4.4. Pro: [Alcohol](http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/stories/2014/01/30/3934877.htm) is responsible for more [violence](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) and harm than any other drug and yet it remains legal.
1.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Unlike many drugs, [alcohol](http://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) negatively influences the function of the [pre-frontal cortex](https://www.thescienceofpsychotherapy.com/prefrontal-cortex/), which regulates social interaction and behaviour. As a result, primed individuals tend to make poor decisions and generally act more emotionally and unreasonably.
1.1.1.2.4.4.2. Con: This can be explained by the [widespread](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) availability and use of alcohol, as well as its legal status.
1.1.1.2.4.4.2.1. Pro: If other drugs were legal, it is likely they would have similar or higher rates of violence compared to alcohol.
1.1.1.2.4.4.3. Pro: 26% of Australians report having been affected by [alcohol related violence](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281), compared to only 3.1% affected by violence associated with illicit drugs.
1.1.1.2.4.4.4. Con: The fact that a significant proportion of society can use alcohol and not engage in violence or other inappropriate behaviour indicates that many people merely use it as an [excuse](https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/alcohol-is-no-longer-an-excuse-for-appalling-behaviour-20190503-p51jqb.html) for their actions.
1.1.1.2.4.4.5. Pro: Research suggests that [two-thirds](https://www.verywell.com/domestic-abuse-and-alcohol-62643) of incidents of domestic violence happen while the perpetrator is under the influence of alcohol.
1.1.1.2.4.4.5.1. Con: The source also argues that there is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship between alcohol and domestic violence. In fact, some experts suggest that abusers [use alcohol as an excuse](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/svaw/domestic/link/alcohol.htm) for their actions.
1.1.1.3. Con: A study has found [smoking cannabis](https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/new-study-suggests-risks-marijuana-use-have-been-overestimated/) to be less harmful than other drugs like [alcohol](https://www.mpp.org/marijuana-is-safer-than-alcohol-its-time-to-treat-it-that-way/) [or tobacco](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/legal-pot/no-high-risk-marijuana-may-be-less-harmful-alcohol-tobacco-n312876). Thus, allowing it is reasonable.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Alcohol and tobacco are [responsible](http://drugfree.org/learn/drug-and-alcohol-news/who-report-smoking-and-drinking-cause-millions-of-deaths-worldwide/) for millions of deaths every year.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In the US in 2015, there were more than 10,000 driving deaths caused by alcohol consumption \([p. 1](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812350)\).
1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: [One in five](http://healthland.time.com/2010/08/27/one-in-five-americans-admits-to-drinking-and-driving/) Americans admit to having driven drunk at least once.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: This can be addressed by awareness raising campaigns \([p. 63](https://www.thecommunityguide.org/sites/default/files/assets/massmedia_AJPM1.pdf)\). Prohibition is not necessarily a more effective solution.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Prohibition [creates illegal markets](https://iea.org.uk/blog/prohibitions-create-black-markets-and-cause-violent-crime) which, once established, are difficult to fight.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Many countries](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug-trafficking/) receive [illegal drug traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade#Drug_trafficking_routes) from other countries. Prohibition requires coordinated actions between multiple countries to be successful, which would be very difficult.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A single legal market in one country does not affect the organized crime's revenue significantly. A supranational project is required to successfully beat down organized crime.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Cartels](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/mexico-cartels-connections-abroad/) do business and transactions globally.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: These markets exist in the absence of prohibition as well.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The black market in Uruguay has [expanded](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-05-08/uruguay-struggling-make-legal-weed-can-compete-illegal-stuff) since legalisation, with the number of growers doubling within a year.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [vast majority](http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/07/06/uruguay-marijuana-pharmacies/57627/) of pharmacies in Uruguay have refused to sell state-sponsored cannabis due to safety concerns, leaving the market in the hands of illegal growers.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The government could presumably force pharmacies to sell these drugs. This problem is not inherent to the policy.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: There would likely be fewer safety concerns if this policy was enacted in countries with lower rates of criminal violence.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Most home-growers are [reluctant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/uruguay-marijuana-cannabis-market-sale-legitmacy) to register with the government, leaving a large proportion of the market unregulated.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: It is likely that this is merely a short term effect, and people will shift to the legal markets once they become aware of its relative advantages in quality and safety.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: A legal market for drugs does not eliminate organized crime.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Even if it did not destroy the cartels, it would at least be a source of competition which would reduce their revenue significantly.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Drug dealers and gangs will be able to hide their illegal activity more easily when drugs are legalised.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: When drugs are legal, it is harder to trace people's ownership of them back to illegal suppliers, since possession is no longer a crime.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: Gangs and cartels could easily move into the legal market for drugs, particularly if regulations on production and distribution are lacking.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.3.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that the production and distribution of drugs would go completely unregulated.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Even when a profession is legal, organized crime will infiltrate it, as the involvement of the [Camorra](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mafia-dons-is-the-camorra-in-control-of-the-granite-city-9686541.htmll) in business illustrates. Thus, making drugs legal does not automatically break up the structures of these groups.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.4. Con: Most people are not criminals and if given a choice, would prefer to participate in the legal market.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: While "bootlegging" alcohol does exist to some extent currently, it is largely due to private [craft beer](https://www.aol.com/article/finance/2015/07/06/modern-day-bootleggers-craft-beer/21203876/?guccounter=1) production and trade and not in an effort to reap profit by producing an otherwise unobtainable product.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5. Con: The routes of organized crime are too expensive and thus would need to be given up.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5.1. Pro: [Submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narco-submarine) have been used to smuggle cocaine. This is very complicated and expensive compared to regular shipping.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5.2. Pro: The legalisation of cannabis in some [US states](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/how-legalizing-marijuana-securing-border-border-wall-drug-smuggling) has turned drug trafficking into a loss-making business for [drug cartels](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/31/10694644/marijuana-legalization-winning).
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5.2.1. Con: The loss of cannabis sales for Mexican cartels since laws were loosened in the US has encouraged cartels to [push harder drugs instead](https://inhomelandsecurity.com/mexican-cartels-marijuana-profit/).
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: This is only true in the event that the government is not able to make it sufficiently difficult for a black market to operate.
1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Given there are already a [multitude](https://www.mmm-online.com/home/channel/campaigns/6-campaigns-examining-drug-and-alcohol-addiction/) of such awareness campaigns in the US, even if these campaigns are effective to some extent, they don't solve the problem altogether.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: The consistent use of cannabis can have hugely [damaging effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana) on brain development, cognitive ability, and mental health.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Those who have used cannabis have an increased likelihood of developing mental health conditions such as [schizophrenia](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/there-link-between-marijuana-use-psychiatric-disorders) or [bipolar disorder](https://www.altamirarecovery.com/marijuana/cannabis-induced-bipolar-disorder/).
1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Some contact sports, such as boxing or [American football](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/cte-nfl-players-brains-study/index.html), are known to directly cause degenerative brain disease - and yet these sports are still legal.
1.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Impaired [neurocognitive performance](https://n.neurology.org/content/59/9/1337) may be particularly dangerous whilst [driving](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17278669/), for instance.
1.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: Cannabis has no effect on the ability to [ride a bike](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1307-y), implying that it does not have a significant neurocognitive impact where vehicle operation is concerned.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Consuming cannabis can be beneficial.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Long-term cannabis usage has negative effects.
1.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Frequent cannabis smokers are [6 times more likely](http://www.menshealth.com/health/does-smoking-pot-cause-lung-cancer) to develop lung cancer than non-users.
1.1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27249330) in New Zealand found that the consistent use of cannabis is less harmful than the consistent use of tobacco in the long term.
1.1.1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: Unlike cannabis, tobacco contains [nicotine](https://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com/marijuana-info/marijuana-vs-cigarettes/), which is thought to contribute to the hardening of arterial walls and thus be responsible for much of the heart disease caused by smoking cigarettes.
1.1.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Long-term smoking of cannabis can lead to obstructive lung disease \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720277/pdf/nihms130448.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.3.1.5. Pro: Long-term and intensive cannabis consumption can cause Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, which causes cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576702/pdf/nihms353647.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.3.1.5.1. Pro: In the US, [Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obscure-vomiting-illness-linked-to-long-term-pot-use/) has been seen more readily in states with relaxed cannabis laws, such as Colorado and California.
1.1.1.3.3.1.5.2. Con: The syndrome can be [easily cured](https://leaderpost.com/cannabis-health/cannabis-medical/if-your-cannabis-consumption-is-heavy-you-risk-developing-cannabinoid-hyperemesis-syndrome/wcm/5bc507ec-bf84-4fc8-a0f1-9bb4c935351c) by ceasing cannabis consumption.
1.1.1.3.3.1.6. Con: The long-term consumption of many foods has an equally or even more damaging effect.
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.1. Con: As the consumption of cannabis [stimulates the appetite](https://examine.com/nutrition/cannabis-munchies/) \(uncontrolled "munchies"\), users are more likely to be subject to some foods' negative side effects.
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.2. Pro: Sugar is a potentially dangerous substance with many \(sometimes drastic and drug-like\) negative effects on humans.
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.2.1. Pro: Excessive [sugar](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021) consumption drastically increases the likeliness of heart disease.
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.2.2. Pro: Sugar is highly addictive: the consumption of sugar releases significant amounts of [dopamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987666), equal to the consumption of tobacco or cocaine.
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.2.3. Pro: Excessive sugar consumption damages the [liver](https://www.orlandohealth.com/content-hub/how-sugar-can-harm-your-liver).
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.2.4. Con: Sugar has no link to increased mortality \([p. 1077](https://watermark.silverchair.com/1077.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqIwggKeBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKPMIICiwIBADCCAoQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMcgiAdEUsVdBWLnn2AgEQgIICVXGm5irpAEV-QQToOe2AP4RgCJEy8kJxEphPvmLU49CslsvrY2Xy_qPqcJDP6SZxdW7Qk-cPciNw6AdKXwh8N0UEhQGkqFqH_rDtWMq7zoOAjq3JxAHU78F1Uo_4XttOc0QDvY37tEp5P1-gfLDiqFawHGeytKE8nT-LpyNkhIrv8CRRHgeBFgbUNhANwQbFktytL6oeEHM3xAC9ssFq94XV7Tezuftfu6p4uMIxFSQ0wOBs7HVWXA61SQ5ntTF-5ZGLP3MYp6D0Lf0NCtKcOFUcXP4eFjlCM-IbBO1wPExCunCb9Q2P6mcfbsnjYjB3IcLTPBKhFrJRnBjDywVnUzzhxZVFD7yIJBJFYiMVi0dgW67r1ZZilEtxnJnEd-1D6349lemfvzklO0VoPqDCifqs_l9hOOpRQeiYfkM18igJpO41tZBiMPHc_7vCp5yF2cKFbFeAGhady07zGKLgeKZvsl6nNQlsQTHg3kw17L7ujJOmlPH9REfaaH8LYu0XN1Ahw7FAuSRCNhLgwTpXJKgtiPtIi66YIzxI26L2mXdXehzO047VAB3_lrLivLKxreKS37vB5UsAyxZUWtg-QTSfbrJIO85r6Zav_1vl5HDNs7bBUNagCd_9sCORuVIm3P7PjpqXzsUrY261rIWG3JTv7aoNp-WmqJIWIZIvE_u5hQJD3D7_6YjBB31yzb8Hc_zlgES96rgeMDk80rHBD1lfKkWY00bLOEH1guf096n6iVnReeW11MYgSvuIzzkKX65lKm1fKH_oDxTsQ99WEA__m0J1RQ)\).
1.1.1.3.3.1.6.2.5. Con: Sugar is not considered addictive, unlike drugs; equating the two is false \([p. 55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5174153/pdf/394_2016_Article_1229.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.3.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.
1.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Cannabis consumption aids relaxation, which improves health and well-being.
1.1.1.3.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Cannabis is a way to cope with [social anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1986747/).
1.1.1.3.3.3. Pro: [Cannabinoids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202504/) have many medical benefits.
1.1.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: [Cannabis](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2013/03/05/psychological-benefits-of-marijuana-usage/) has been found to have numerous benefits to mental health.
1.1.1.3.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.1.
1.1.1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Medical [cannabis](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/features/medical-marijuana-uses) is known to successfully help in treating pain, muscle spasms, nausea from chemotherapy, and seizure disorders.
1.1.1.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: Cannabis seems to be one of the best general painkillers during cancer treatment \([p. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730175/pdf/ECAM2013-510392.pdf)\).
1.1.1.3.3.3.4. Pro: Cannabis contains [THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol), which is a [bronchial dilator](https://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com/marijuana-info/marijuana-vs-cigarettes/). It opens up the lungs, which aids in the clearance of smoke and dirt.
1.1.1.3.3.3.5. Con: Negative data on the adverse effects of consuming cannabis [far outweighs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6181739/) its limited documented benefits.
1.1.1.3.3.3.6. Pro: Research by [Professor Mike Barnes](https://www.profmichaelbarnes.co.uk/medical-cannabis) showed that the use of cannabis as a medicine has multiple benefits while being generally safe and well tolerated \([p. 133](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0c_8hkDJu0DUDZMUzhoY1RqMG8/view)\).
1.1.1.3.3.3.7. Pro: Cannabis helps [increase the appetites](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/07/31/keep-toke-alive-356032.html) of very sick cancer patients.
1.1.1.3.4. Pro: Despite a few shared components, low to moderate use of cannabis is [less harmful](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/01/11282/marijuana-shown-be-less-damaging-lungs-tobacco) to users’ lungs than exposure to tobacco.
1.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.1.3.
1.1.1.3.4.2. Pro: [Smoking cannabis](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060526083353.htm) shows no link to the development of [lung cancer](http://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/news/20060523/pot-smoking-not-linked-to-lung-cancer#1), unlike tobacco.
1.1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: There is not yet a clear [consensus](https://www.verywell.com/does-smoking-marijuana-cause-lung-cancer-2248991) on the risk of cancer for cannabis users.
1.1.1.3.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.1.1.
1.1.1.3.5. Con: Cannabis is a [gateway drug](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/26/is-marijuana-a-gateway-drug/marijuana-has-proven-to-be-a-gateway-drug) to harder drugs like heroin.
1.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: [Studies](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010/index1.html) have shown that cannabis use increases the likelihood of using hard drugs later.
1.1.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Consuming soft drugs like cannabis [increases](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol20/vol20_iss10/record2010.24.html) the risk of becoming addicted to cocaine in the long run.
1.1.1.3.5.2. Pro: Sewage water samples indicate that hard drugs are used [more often](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/europe/wastewater-drug-tests/index.html?hpt=hp_t3) in the Netherlands, where cannabis is legal, than in other European countries.
1.1.1.3.5.2.1. Con: [London](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/04/cocaine-london-sewers-highest-level-europe-drug-uk) seems to have more traces of cocaine in its sewers than Amsterdam.
1.1.1.3.5.3. Con: There is no consensus on whether or not cannabis is really a [gateway drug](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010.html) to harder substances.
1.1.1.3.5.3.1. Pro: [Research suggests](http://healthland.time.com/2010/10/29/marijuna-as-a-gateway-drug-the-myth-that-will-not-die/) that though cannabis users are more likely than non-users to use harder drugs, this is because those people are more likely to try drugs in general and not because cannabis is a gateway.
1.1.1.3.5.3.2. Pro: The majority of cannabis users [do not](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug) progress to taking harder drugs later in life.
1.1.1.3.5.3.2.1. Pro: Nearly [half](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/6-facts-about-marijuana/) of Americans have tried cannabis at least once, but this did not translate into frequent use of strong drugs.
1.1.1.3.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Statistics on [heroin](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/heroin-addiction/faq/addicted-first-time/), for example, show that only a fraction of Americans make use of it.
1.1.1.3.5.3.3. Pro: The [DPRC research](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010/index1.html) demonstrates that it is not cannabis use but individuals' opportunities and unique propensities to use drugs that determine their risk of trying hard drugs.
1.1.1.3.5.4. Pro: Dealers that sell soft and hard drugs would try to push users to the more lucrative drugs, namely hard drugs, which also make them more addicted.
1.1.1.3.6. Pro: People become [mellow and relaxed](http://greatist.com/health/your-brain-on-marijuana) on cannabis, as compared to alcohol, which gets many people very emotional, aggressive, and agitated.
1.1.1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.2.
1.1.1.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.4.
1.1.2. Pro: Drugs have hugely destructive effects on the environment.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Opium production in Myanmar has caused vast [deforestation and soil damage](http://frontiermyanmar.net/en/the-poppies-and-the-damage-done).
1.1.2.2. Pro: Every pound of methamphetamine produced creates [six pounds of toxic waste](https://www.fs.fed.us/lei/dangers-meth-labs.php). These by-products can [destroy soil and water supplies](http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/environment-and-drug-production/) and have been known to kill animals.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Cannabis production is [immensely damaging](http://www.geocurrents.info/place/north-america/northern-california/unnecessary-environmental-destruction-marijuana-cultivation-united-states) to the environment.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: This is partially offset by the fact that [hemp production](https://cbdoiled.com/hemp-paper-vs-tree-paper/) is more efficient and sustainable than traditional paper alternatives.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Every [kilogram](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421512002285) of the final product of indoor-grown cannabis adds 4600kg of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: With legalisation, indoor growing will no longer be necessary as growers would not have to fear their plantations being detected.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: A single cannabis plant requires around [22 litres](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02526-3) of water a day.
1.1.2.4. Con: The war on drugs has done far more damage to the environment than drug production.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: The destruction of coca fields in South America forces producers to move location repeatedly, spreading the detrimental effects of their coca growing \([p. 6](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/uploads/e205c307-c17b-437b-bc35-cfb703bce4f2/impact-drug-policy-environment-20151208.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Producers are often forced into remote areas or national parks, exacerbating the environmental effects by destroying more ecologically significant areas.
1.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: The eradication of drug plantations in one country has led to the movement of production into other countries in the region. This is known as the [balloon effect](http://www.coha.org/the-balloon-effect-and-displacement-part-2-of-2/).
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Fumigation, the most common method of drug plantation destruction, destroys wildlife and crops, and causes health problems for local people \([p. 6](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/impact-drug-policy-environment-20151208.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Air fumigation of Colombian coca plantations has led to [deforestation and displacement](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512002837;) of local people.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: This is an argument to alter the ways in which drug activities and production are countered, rather than to allow drug production to continue unchecked.
1.1.2.4.4. Con: This statement is nearly impossible to support, as there are no detailed comparative studies of the environmental damage wrought by drug production and the war on drugs.
1.1.2.4.5. Pro: [Aerial eradication](https://www.tni.org/en/article/plan-colombias-aerial-spraying-a-failure-foretold) of drug plants failed to reduce supplies and instead destroyed farmers' livelihoods and caused environmental damage.
1.1.2.5. Con: Criminalising drugs does not eliminate the demand for them, and the demand incentivises supply. Therefore criminalising drugs does little to help the environment.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: Criminalising drugs means harsh punishments for suppliers and dealers. This decreases supply and therefore aids the environment.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: The addictive nature of drugs means that some people will always buy them.
1.1.2.5.3. Pro: [11.7%](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/national-drug-early-warning-system-ndews/national-survey-drug-use-health) of the American population is estimated to have used an illicit drug in the past month \(2018\). This is [far higher](https://mic.com/articles/110344/14-years-after-portugal-decriminalized-all-drugs-here-s-what-s-happening#.9aq9vA45s) than in Portugal, where drug use is decriminalised.
1.1.2.5.4. Con: Criminalisation does reduce demand to a large extent: potential drug users choose not to consume drugs for fear of going to prison.
1.1.2.6. Con: With legalisation, drug production processes can be regulated in order to make them greener.
1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Once legalized, regulations can be imposed to ensure that drug production does not involve deforestation.
1.1.2.6.2. Pro: Once legalized, drug production can be regulated to ensure that the amount of toxic by-products created do not exceed an amount that can be handled and disposed of by the relevant authorities without causing lasting soil or water damage.
1.1.2.6.3. Con: This would only be true if governments were motivated to take pro-environment decisions already.
1.1.2.7. Pro: [Cocaine farming](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/110218-cocaine-coca-farming-colombia-rainforests-environment-science/) contributes significantly to rainforest destruction.
1.1.3. Con: Prohibition is [generally inferior](http://www.drugsense.org/probreg.htm) to regulation as a mechanism to manage risk.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The prohibition of drugs is immensely costly.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The UN estimated that the illegal drug market creates a turnover of around [$360 - $400 billion annually](http://www.worldometers.info/drugs/). The legalisation of drugs would enable private companies and individuals to enter this profitable market.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: A report suggests that the [cannabis industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/22/marijuana-industry-projected-to-create-more-jobs-than-manufacturing-by-2020/#416afd73fa92) in the US will create more than 250,000 jobs by 2020.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: After the legalisation of cannabis in some US states the [legal cannabis market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/22/marijuana-industry-projected-to-create-more-jobs-than-manufacturing-by-2020/#416afd73fa92) created an estimated $7.2 billion in 2016 with an annual rate of growth of 17%.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: In 2015, the US [spent](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/chapter/economics) $9.4 billion on domestic law enforcement to prevent drug related crimes.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Governments would benefit from additional revenue through the implementation of a tax on legalised drugs.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Con: [High taxation](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/19/5-reasons-the-marijuana-black-market-wont-go-away.aspx) on legalised drugs is likely to drive consumers to continue purchasing them on the black market.
1.1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Consumers will be willing to pay higher prices for safer, higher quality drugs.
1.1.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Legalisation would likely come alongside regulation and oversight, to ensure that the quality is high enough to be safe.
1.1.3.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: If someone were to suffer from adverse effects after consuming a legally produced drug, the producing company would be held liable. This legal recourse would act as sufficient deterrence to legal drug producing companies from trying to cut corners.
1.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Drugs are among the most [illegally traded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade#Profits) goods. To receive taxes on such a product - with high demands and big sales - would bring billions to the government.
1.1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: In the US, taxes on the legal use of recreational cannabis in Colorado alone generated a total of $135 million in additional revenue, $35 million of which was designated for school construction projects \([p. 25](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa799.pdf)\).
1.1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: The additional revenue can be put back into health, social care, and deprived areas to improve the outlook of marginalized and vulnerable people in society, eventually reducing addiction and crime rates in the process.
1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Legalising drugs is likely to increase the need for spending on healthcare \([p. 208](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2S5JrOzNR1wC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=decriminalisation+would+cost+huge+amounts+of+money&source=bl&ots=t2ZcIz_ihE&sig=ACfU3U3jKyrLHc6QHiq6F6aIlblfuovfxA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilh936zrPqAhWyThUIHRA0BWwQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=decriminalisation%20would%20cost%20huge%20amounts%20of%20money&f=false)\).
1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: This spending may end up causing health funds to be diverted away from other important areas.
1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Increased health spending would take away from already underfunded areas, such as drug use [prevention](https://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/05/28/addiction.costs/index.html).
1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Since decriminalisation [does not appear](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/australias-recreational-drug-policies-arent-working-so-what-are-options-reform) to increase drug use in new or existing users \([p. 1](https://www.unodc.org/documents/ungass2016/Contributions/Civil/DrugPolicyAlliance/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Approaches_to_Decriminalization_Feb2015_1.pdf)\), it is unlikely legalisation would have this effect either.
1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: Healthcare associated with drugs misuse costs the NHS an estimated [£500 million](https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/24/addiction-took-hold-uk-cost-nhs-millions) per year in the UK. Legalised access to drugs and its detrimental effects is likely to increase this amount.
1.1.3.1.3.2.3. Con: This would only hold true in a case where most people would be willing to switch over to legal markets for drugs.
1.1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Taxation on comparable products has been shown to raise large sums.
1.1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: People drink and smoke far more than they consume drugs - this taxation would not raise comparable sums.
1.1.3.1.3.3.1.1. Con: People would consume more drugs if they were legal.
1.1.3.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: [85.5%](https://adf.org.au/insights/why-do-people-use-alcohol-and-other-drugs/) of Australians drink alcohol, while 10.4% of them consume cannabis.
1.1.3.1.3.3.1.3. Con: There are comparable percentages of marijuana \([12%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/284135/percentage-americans-smoke-marijuana.aspx)\) and tobacco \([13.7%](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm)\) smokers in the United States.
1.1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: Income from alcohol tax in the US amounts to [$6 billion](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/alcohol-tax-revenue).
1.1.3.1.3.3.3. Pro: In the US, revenues from tobacco tax amount to [$18 billion](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/tobacco-tax-revenue).
1.1.3.1.3.4. Con: Governments should not make things legal just for the sake of making more in taxes.
1.1.3.1.4. Con: Government decisions should not be dictated by cost alone.
1.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: If prohibition is the most effective strategy in reducing the drug-related issues in society, then its cost should not be a limiting factor.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: A cost-benefit analysis is standard procedure in policy decisions.
1.1.3.1.4.2. Pro: The American Civil War was incredibly [costly](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052970203990104576191061207786514?tesla=y) but was still necessary to bring [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War) to an end.
1.1.3.1.4.3. Pro: Shutting down all social welfare programmes would also reduce government expenditure. This does not mean that governments should do so.
1.1.3.1.4.4. Con: However, if cost is a meaningful factor in government decision-making, it should not be discounted simply for being a practical consideration, as opposed to a moral one.
1.1.3.1.4.5. Pro: Governments have a [duty](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/) to look out for the well-being of their people.
1.1.3.1.5. Con: When the spending is seen proportionately to the scale of the drug abuse problem, it actually appears quite reasonable.
1.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Substance abuse costs the US government [$600 billion](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost) a year.
1.1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: The amount includes prosecution and imprisonment - extremely costly factors that would cease to exist with legal drugs.
1.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: Between [40% and 60%](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/treatment-recovery) of recovered drug addicts will eventually relapse.
1.1.3.1.5.3. Con: It would only be reasonable if prohibition was effective at curbing drug abuse, which it clearly [is not](https://www.aclu.org/other/against-drug-prohibition).
1.1.3.1.5.4. Pro: Substance abuse costs UK businesses around [£100 billion](https://www.ukat.co.uk/drugs/hidden-cost-substance-abuse-uk-infographic/) a year.
1.1.3.1.5.5. Pro: In 2012, the global policing and interdiction of illicit drugs was estimated to cost over $100 billion \(USD\) per year \([p. 8](http://countthecosts.org/sites/default/files/AWDR.pdf)\).
1.1.3.2. Pro: Prohibition has unintended negative consequences.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Prohibition enables corruption in the police \([p. 25](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1837&context=facpub)\).
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Prohibition can [create greater demand](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/MCYp8g9EMAiTCTawk/scarcity) for the proscribed product.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Residents of Dade County, Fl., where phosphate-containing laundry detergents were outlawed, were found to have [more positive attitudes](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-01008-001) towards such detergents, compared to residents of neighboring counties where the detergents were still on sale.
1.1.3.2.4. Con: Many useful policies can have negative consequences. These should be worked around, and should not be reason enough to not enact them.
1.1.3.2.5. Con: Most of these harms will occur if any measure is taken by the government to discourage drug use or make access to drugs more difficult.
1.1.3.2.5.1. Con: The magnitude of these harms is intensified by prohibition.
1.1.3.2.6. Pro: Impurities and contaminations are a huge health risk for current users of illegal drugs.
1.1.3.2.6.1. Con: Drug users can purchase [drug purity testing kits](https://drugabuse.com/addiction/counterfeit-drugs/) to avoid dangerous, contaminated drugs.
1.1.3.2.6.1.1. Con: Professionals have argued that these kits are '[dangerously unreliable](https://drugabuse.com/addiction/counterfeit-drugs/)' and create a false sense of security.
1.1.3.2.6.2. Con: Dealers have an incentive to not dangerously contaminate their drugs - if users grow sick or die, they will stop purchasing, hurting the dealer's profits.
1.1.3.2.6.3. Pro: [Ecstasy](http://www.recoveryplace.com/blog/the-danger-of-impure-street-drugs/) is easily disguised with other substances. It often contains little to no MDMA and is composed largely of drugs such as ketamine, amphetamine, caffeine, and ephedrine.
1.1.3.2.6.4. Pro: [Heroin](http://www.recoveryplace.com/blog/the-danger-of-impure-street-drugs/) averages approximately 45% to 50% purity. Fatal overdoses are often attributed to its varying purity.
1.1.3.2.6.5. Pro: The purity level of cocaine can be anything from 10% to 90% \([pp. 349-351](http://www.unodc.org/pdf/WDR_2005/volume_2_chap7_cocaine.pdf)\).
1.1.3.3. Con: Alcohol works as a substitute that replaces the demand for drugs.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Applying high taxes to legal drugs \(like alcohol and nicotine\) has proven effective in reducing consumption and its related negative effects \([p. 1-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735171/pdf/nihms484985.pdf)\). This may be more efficient than prohibition.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Anything more than a standard VAT on drugs could imply that the government views them as an undesirable substance, meaning that stigmas around drug users would continue to exist.
1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that there would be a special tax on drugs.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Taxes on alcohol and nicotine are [regressive](https://iea.org.uk/publications/of-course-sin-taxes-are-regressive/) and disproportionately affect poorer individuals.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: High taxes can easily be [absorbed by suppliers](https://betterhealthforall.org/2010/03/26/minimum-pricing-of-alcohol-v-alcohol-tax/) who wish to keep their prices low in order to entice buyers.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: [The use of psychoactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202501/) has been part of human culture for thousands of years; drugs have been used for religious, medical, or recreational purposes.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The consumption of psychoactive substances creates religious and transcendental [experiences](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-religion-led-to-humanity-s-love-for-drugs): both are a relevant part of human evolution and significantly shaped human culture.
1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: There are several different [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_models_of_human_drug_use) explaining drug consumption evolutionarily, e.g. the Sexual Selection Hypothesis, and thus as part of human nature.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4993200/) found that alcohol is often used as a substitute for cannabis, particularly in environments that are harsh on drug use.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: The same [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4993200/) also found that there are several cases where alcohol and cannabis are complementary to one another, rather than substitutable.
1.1.3.4. Con: Prohibition could be accompanied by holistic education programs and awareness campaigns against drugs, so that people would remain well informed about their harms.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Research has found education programmes to be [effective](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49280574_Does_drug_education_work) in stopping, or delaying the onset of, drug use.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: Collective, multinational research in countries where drugs are prohibited shows that education programs alone are [unlikely](https://www.drugwise.org.uk/does-drug-education-stop-drug-use/) to prevent young people from taking drugs.
1.1.3.4.3. Con: [Decriminalisation](https://www.kialo.com/decriminalise-the-personal-possession-and-consumption-of-all-drugs-2027.2232?path=2027.0~2027.2232) could better achieve this end.
1.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: In the case of [decriminalisation](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/decriminalisation-or-legalisation-injecting-evidence-drug-law-reform-debate), most proposed punishments for drug use are no longer criminal conviction, but civil penalties such as fines, or diversions into education and treatment.
1.1.3.5. Con: Strict penalties in areas where drugs are prohibited are effective in decreasing their use, abuse, and possession.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: A war on drugs and the harsh policies associated with it have not been effective when implemented.
1.1.3.5.1.1. Con: Singapore's extremely harsh drug policy has been successful.
1.1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: Singapore claims that its [drug prevalence](https://www.hri.global/contents/610) rates are among the world's lowest.
1.1.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: Singapore's drug laws have [saved thousands](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/05/singapore-policy-drugs-bay) from drug addiction and the resulting harms.
1.1.3.5.1.1.3. Con: [Drug-related crimes](http://thediplomat.com/2013/11/singapore-and-the-death-penalty/) are far worse in Singapore than in countries like Turkey or Costa Rica.
1.1.3.5.1.2. Pro: The war on drugs in the Philippines has been [devastating](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/28/asia/philippines-voices-drugs-war/index.html) and harmful.
1.1.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: The government has [failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/in-philippine-drug-war-little-help-for-those-who-surrender.html) to provide effective treatment to those who confess to drug use, meaning that demand for drugs has remained high.
1.1.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: The war on drugs has [compromised internal security](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/kill-list-phillipines-duterte-mass-murder-china-united-states-rivalry-war-on-drugs) in the Philippines.
1.1.3.5.1.2.3. Con: However, these policies in the Philippines have helped reduce drug usage.
1.1.3.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: [66% of Filipinos](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/war-drugs-asia-succeeded-190218160811303.html) believe there is a decrease in drug use in their area.
1.1.3.5.1.3. Pro: In Latin America, the war on drugs mission ['Plan Colombia'](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35491504) has been ineffective.
1.1.3.5.1.4. Pro: In [Indonesia](http://idpc.net/alerts/2016/05/does-the-death-penalty-reduce-drug-use-and-drug-related-crime-data-from-indonesia), where execution is a frequent conviction for drug offenders, drug crime rates have not fallen.
1.1.3.5.1.5. Pro: The war on drugs in the United States has been a failure.
1.1.3.5.1.5.1. Con: Drug use has decreased towards the end of the [last century](https://today.law.harvard.edu/feature/war-drugs-succeeding/).
1.1.3.5.1.5.1.1. Con: This is only true for a few specific drugs. More common drugs such as [cannabis and ecstasy](https://www.recoveryfirst.org/blog/measuring-the-success-of-the-war-on-drugs/) have skyrocketed in usage.
1.1.3.5.1.5.1.2. Pro: Cocaine use decreased by [20%](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/weekinreview/echoes-of-prohibition-20-years-of-war-on-drugs-and-no-victory-yet.html) between 1988 and 1992.
1.1.3.5.1.5.2. Pro: The [drug-related crime rate](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/weekinreview/echoes-of-prohibition-20-years-of-war-on-drugs-and-no-victory-yet.html) increased during the US war on drugs, including machine gun battles between police and drug offenders.
1.1.3.5.1.5.3. Pro: By 2005, half a million Americans were [imprisoned](http://today.law.harvard.edu/feature/war-drugs-succeeding/) for drug offences.
1.1.3.5.2. Pro: Many [South Asian](https://drugabuse.com/the-20-countries-with-the-harshest-drug-laws-in-the-world/) countries that have extremely harsh penalties for possession and distribution of drugs also have some of the [lowest percentages](https://ourworldindata.org/drug-use) of drug use disorders in the world.
1.1.3.6. Pro: In the US, Prohibition in the 1920s is considered to have been a failure \([p. 1](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa157.pdf)\). There is no indication it would be successful this time.
1.1.3.6.1. Pro: [Prohibition](http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/alcohol-prohibition-was-failure) showed that a policy that runs counter to a significant demand is bound to fail.
1.1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Prohibition just made many [criminals rich](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/26/lawless-prohibition-gangsters-speakeasies), by having them import or distill alcohol illegally.
1.1.3.6.2. Con: As technologies become increasingly sophisticated, it is likely that states will be better able to control illegal activity.
1.1.3.6.2.1. Con: Criminals will also have access to new technologies, nullifying the advantage that law enforcement is developing.
1.1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: In the European Union, technological advancement is considered to have afforded criminal groups more flexibility and ease than they ever had before \([p. 3](https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/924156-v7-Crime_in_the_age_of_technology_.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: Researchers speculate that drug traffickers are likely to invest in drone technology in order to get past border crossing checks and similar obstacles \([p. 8](https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/924156-v7-Crime_in_the_age_of_technology_.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.2.1.3. Con: Criminals are unlikely to have technology that can rival actual states, with their considerably larger budgets and better connections.
1.1.3.6.2.2. Pro: There is increasingly more surveillance of every day life - [chat logs](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-scans-chats-and-posts-for-criminal-activity/) are monitored, [cameras](https://aithority.com/news/top-10-countries-and-cities-by-number-of-cctv-cameras/) have become more ubiquitous, and [money](https://www.offthegridnews.com/financial/spend-money-without-being-tracked/) is easier to trace.
1.1.3.6.2.2.1. Pro: All online transactions can be [followed](https://www.komando.com/online-shopping/googles-secret-page-records-everything-youve-bought-online/567885/), making it exceedingly tricky to sell and purchase drugs online when a state is actively keeping an eye out.
1.1.3.6.2.3. Pro: As states increase their presence on the internet, there are fewer channels of communication left to drug traffickers to safely trade their stocks.
1.1.3.6.2.3.1. Con: States still have little-to-no capacity to [regulate](https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/the-dark-web/) the dark web.
1.1.3.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: There were almost 250,000 separate listings for drugs on the popular dark web market 'AlphaBay' in a given year \([p. 5](https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/924156-v7-Crime_in_the_age_of_technology_.pdf)\).
1.1.3.6.2.3.2. Pro: It is possible to trace the [IP addresses](https://whatismyipaddress.com/get-ip) of people posting online, and finding out where they are posting from.
1.1.3.6.2.3.2.1. Con: Drug traffickers can avoid this through the use of [VPNs](https://surfshark.com/learn/what-is-vpn).
1.1.3.6.3. Con: [Prohibition of alcohol](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/5/18518005/prohibition-alcohol-public-health-crime-benefits) in the US during the first half of the twentieth century reduced consumption, alcohol related deaths, and may have been linked to a reduction in violent crime.
1.1.3.6.3.1. Pro: During the prohibition years, death from cirrhosis [fell](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/markmoore/files/actually_prohibition_was_a_success_101689.pdf) by two thirds.
1.1.3.6.4. Pro: Although consumption of alcohol [fell](http://www.nber.org/papers/w3675) at the beginning of Prohibition, it subsequently increased.
1.1.3.6.4.1. Con: The subsequent increase was only to [around 70%](http://www.nber.org/papers/w3675) of the level immediately prior to Prohibition.
1.1.3.6.4.2. Pro: The illegal liquor trade under Prohibition made criminals of [millions](https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/unintended-consequences/) of Americans.
1.1.3.6.5. Pro: With Prohibition, alcohol became more [dangerous](http://time.com/3665643/deadly-drinking/) to consume.
1.1.4. Con: Some drugs cause [more harm](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-rank-recreational-drugs-based-on-how-dangerous-they-are) than others. Treating all drugs equally fails to reflect this.
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.4.
1.1.4.2. Con: All drugs cause some form of [harm](https://www.nhs.uk/news/medical-practice/tobacco-alcohol-and-illegal-drugs-are-global-health-threat/). The fact that the amount or harm [differs](https://www.drugwise.org.uk/what-are-the-dangers-from-using-drugs/) does not mean that overall legislation should differ between them.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Even if all drugs were made illegal, there could very feasibly be differing punishments for different substances.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: The damaging effects of cannabis are exaggerated.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Detrimental effects of cannabis on the [adolescent brain](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cannabis-marijuana-legalisation-harm-brain-intelligence-development-mental-health-a8311126.html) have been exaggerated.
1.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Various scientists have concluded that cannabis presents more serious risks than people realize \([p. 88](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6461328/pdf/ms116_p0088.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.4.3. Pro: This is already reflected in the fact that drugs are [categorized differently](https://casapalmera.com/blog/top-8-drug-categories/) depending on how they affect the user.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: In the UK, drugs fall into one of [three categories](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/drugs-and-crime) - Class A, B, or C - depending on the severity of the harm they cause to the individual and society.
1.1.4.4. Con: Decriminalising drugs does not necessarily mean that they will be treated equally by society.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Even in a country with decriminalisation, it is likely that people will judge the use of hard drugs like heroin more than they would cannabis.
1.1.5. Pro: Drugs are dangerous to users' health and wellbeing.
1.1.5.1. Con: A number of recreational drugs may have [medical uses](http://www.livescience.com/41277-health-benefits-illegal-drugs.html) and health benefits.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: LSD can help treat depression and other severe mental illnesses \([p. 11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985449/pdf/fpsyt-10-00943.pdf)\).
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Scientists have found possible uses for LSD and other psychedelic drugs in [treating](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/23/lsd-ecstacy-health-benefits) anorexia nervosa, cluster headaches, and chronic anxiety attacks.
1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Small doses of magic mushrooms or LSD have been known to treat [cluster headaches](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/02/health.drugsandalcohol), and are also promising in treating [OCD](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6210694.stm).
1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: LSD can lead to a variety of [harmful physical side-effects](https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/lsd/the-harmful-effects-of-lsd.html).
1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: [Bad trips](https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/lsd/the-harmful-effects-of-lsd.html) on LSD can lead to panic attacks, a fear of losing control, and terrifying thoughts and feelings.
1.1.5.1.1.4. Con: LSD can produce [delusions and hallucinations](https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/lsd/what-are-the-risks-of-lsd.html).
1.1.5.1.1.5. Con: The use of LSD can impair decision-making and, in some cases, can [cause acute anxiety and depression](https://www.drugs.com/illicit/lsd.html).
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: [Ketamine](http://inventorspot.com/articles/magic_k_proves_be_magic_drug_depression) has proven to be quite adept at treating clinical depression, even in people who have not responded to other treatments.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Certain doses of amphetamine have proven to be able to stimulate nerve growth in humans suffering from conditions such as [ADHD](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670101/).
1.1.5.1.4. Pro: MDMA has been shown to have uses in dealing with certain ailments.
1.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: MDMA, the main ingredient in ecstasy, may be used in the [treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5260336/) of various psychological problems.
1.1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Victims of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \(PTSD\) have shown positive responses to treatments involving [ecstasy/MDMA](http://www.mdmaptsd.org/).
1.1.5.1.4.2. Pro: MDMA may be able to treat [Parkinson's](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3015-ecstasy-has-dramatic-effect-on-parkinsons-symptoms/) disease through the release of serotonin in the brain.
1.1.5.1.4.3. Con: MDMA has many dangerous [side effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly).
1.1.5.1.4.3.1. Pro: The increase in body temperature associated with the use of MDMA can lead to [organ failure](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/mdma-can-be-fatal-warm-environments). This effect is exacerbated in warm environments, such as might be found in nightclubs and bars \(where the drug is more likely to be imbibed\).
1.1.5.1.4.3.2. Pro: The ability of MDMA to induce feelings of empathy is associated with more [risky sexual behaviours](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26216562/), which may in turn lead to a greater risk of [sexually transmitted infections](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly) \(STIs\).
1.1.5.1.4.3.3. Pro: Evidence suggests that MDMA use could increase the risk of contracting [infections](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/08/drugs.research), including meningitis.
1.1.5.1.5. Con: The dangers of the majority of recreational drugs far outweigh any potential therapeutic value that they may have \([p. 10](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng46/evidence/full-guideline-pdf-2427186353)\).
1.1.5.1.5.1. Pro: If the harms of potential abuse outweigh the benefits of a successfully implemented medication programme, then it is not worth the risk.
1.1.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: Medicinal drugs might be of use to some small segment of people, but the harms of drug availability on the market would extend to all of society.
1.1.5.1.5.1.2. Con: This same logic could be used to oppose essential services, such as the establishment of schools - theoretically, the harms of children being [abused](https://www.ibbclaims.co.uk/site/services/child-abuse-and-trafficking/child-abuse-in-schools/) by strangers outweigh any benefits to be had from them being educated.
1.1.5.1.5.2. Con: This is only assumed and is unverifiable since laws governing drug classifications also affect their use by research laboratories.
1.1.5.1.5.2.1. Pro: The punishments for possession of illegal drugs make it risky for scientists to acquire even small amounts of these substances for medical research \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307971/pdf/pbio.1002047.pdf)\).
1.1.5.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.3.3.
1.1.5.2. Con: Not all drugs are harmful.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: The majority of therapeutic drugs, legal or otherwise, have physiological [side effects](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/what-are-side-effects/). Thus, the way in which a drug is [used](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/11/20/daily-circuit-high-price-drugs), rather than its legal status, dictates its safety.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Organ [toxicity](https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/dsd/documents/DDP/MedicalDirector/DangersOfOTC-MedsPt1-112513.pdf) is a common but dangerous side-effect of overuse of over-the-counter pain killers.
1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Even [vitamins](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819426-overview) can be toxic when taken in incorrect doses.
1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The harms of many drugs are [overstated](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/11/20/daily-circuit-high-price-drugs).
1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.2.
1.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: The harmful effects of [MDMA](https://www.inverse.com/article/46147-does-ecstasy-really-put-holes-in-your-brain-and-affect-serotonin) have been found to have been overstated.
1.1.5.2.2.4. Pro: Surveys have indicated that [LSD](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/hallucinogenic-health-trip-lsd-may-not-be-bad-for-you-says-study-8798900.html) is not as harmful as previously thought.
1.1.5.2.2.5. Con: Drug related deaths in many areas continue to rise.
1.1.5.2.2.5.1. Pro: Accidental drug overdose is the [leading cause](https://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/drug-overdose) of death in those under 50 in the United States.
1.1.5.2.2.5.2. Con: In recent years, the number of deaths caused by drug overdoses in the US has begun to decline \([p. 1](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db356-h.pdf)\).
1.1.5.2.2.5.3. Pro: Drug related deaths in England and Wales were at an [all-time high](http://www.sdf.org.uk/drug-related-death-figures-england-wales-reaches-record-number/) in 2016.
1.1.5.2.2.6. Con: The degree to which a substance is harmful is immaterial. The fact remains that most drugs have numerous [negative effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/criminal-justice/science-drug-use-discussion-points).
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: The [risks](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/8/20/17938380/marijuana-legalization-health-safety-risks-addiction) associated with consuming cannabis are typically considered to be quite mild.
1.1.5.2.4. Pro: In its pure form, [MDMA](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/pure-ecstasy-can-be-safe-for-adults-health-official-says-1.1229517) is not harmful to adults when consumed responsibly.
1.1.5.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.4.3.
1.1.5.2.5. Con: All drugs have [side effects](https://www.wingsforlife.com/en/latest/blog-why-all-medicines-have-side-effects-2900/).
1.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.5.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Hard drugs - heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine, for example - destroy people's lives and those of their families.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: Hard drugs are often not the cause of the destruction, but rather the means.
1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Social rejection is a determinant for drug addiction \([p. 19, 47](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/ndarc/resources/TR.228.pdf)\).
1.1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Multiple [psychological and environmental factors](https://www.healthyplace.com/addictions/drug-addiction/causes-of-drug-addiction-what-causes-drug-addiction) are thought to play a significant role in any person developing a drug addiction.
1.1.5.4.1.3. Pro: 86.8% of 364 young poly-drug users [cited alleviating depressed moods as a reason for taking drugs](https://academic.oup.com/her/article/16/4/457/558793).
1.1.5.4.1.4. Con: However, as long as drugs ultimately aid in this destruction, they should be held at least partly culpable for it.
1.1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.
1.1.5.4.3. Pro: Addiction [inhibits free choice](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2015/06/addiction-disease-free-will).
1.1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Hard drugs are extremely addictive, but it is difficult to comprehend the extent of this before one has become addicted.
1.1.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: Heroin and cocaine are amongst the [most addictive substances](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-5-most-addictive-drugs-in-the-world-a6924746.html) in the world.
1.1.5.4.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.5.2.
1.1.5.4.3.1.3. Con: Addiction is an unlikely outcome of drug consumption.
1.1.5.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Research](http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genes/) suggests that substance addiction is heavily influenced by genetics, meaning that people are predisposed to it because of their family history, and most people will not become addicts.
1.1.5.4.3.1.3.2. Con: Even if only a minority of drug users become dependent, this is enough reason to ban drugs given the massive harms of addiction.
1.1.5.4.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Addiction is so debilitating that some addicts [forget](https://easyread.drugabuse.gov/content/drug-use-hurts-kids) to take care of their children.
1.1.5.4.3.1.3.3. Pro: Most people that take drugs are [not addicts](https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/many-people-use-drugs-here-s-why-most-don-t-become-addicts/).
1.1.5.4.3.1.3.4. Con: Even a single dose of [heroin](https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/heroin/i-ll-just-try-it-once.html) can begin the course to addiction.
1.1.5.4.3.1.4. Con: Nicotine and alcohol are both legal yet are almost as [addictive](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2010/11/02/scoring-drugs) as hard drugs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. Thus, the addictive characteristic of a substance cannot be an argument in regard to its legal status.
1.1.5.4.3.2. Con: Addiction is a widely known side-effect of many drugs. It is a risk people can consider before engaging.
1.1.5.4.3.2.1. Con: [Cognitive dissonance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-choice/201610/cognitive-dissonance-and-addiction) affects the decision to take drugs. No-one taking drugs for the first or even the tenth time really believes that they will become addicted, despite the overwhelming risk.
1.1.5.4.3.2.2. Pro: In a similar vein, people are allowed to indulge in extremely [dangerous activities](https://www.morton-fraser.com/knowledge-hub/do-extreme-sports-come-extreme-liability) if they consent to and are aware of the dangers involved.
1.1.5.4.3.3. Con: Recent research has shown that addicts [can still make rational choices](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/the-science-of-choice-in-addiction/280080/).
1.1.5.4.3.3.1. Con: Although addiction does not remove choice completely, it makes saying no to drugs [extremely difficult](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/addicted-brains/201208/addiction-matter-choice).
1.1.5.4.4. Pro: The [drug krokodil](http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/krokodil.html) - a home-made alternative to heroin - is extremely difficult to withdraw from and leads to near certain death.
1.1.5.4.4.1. Con: Under a system of decriminalisation, it is unlikely people would choose to take this drug when other, safer drugs are more readily available to them.
1.1.5.4.4.1.1. Pro: [Krokodil](http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/krokodil.html) is a highly specific drug that is predominantly found in Russia used by those who no longer are able to afford heroin.
1.1.5.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Unlike most Western countries, the Russian Federation has no opioid [replacement programs](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/3/08-010308/en/) or methadone clinics. The lack of such programs fosters the development of illegal and dangerous replacements like krokodil.
1.1.5.4.5. Pro: It is very unlikely for a person to be functioning or healthy if they are a long-term meth or heroin user.
1.1.5.4.5.1. Con: This is not necessarily true; there may be many functional heroin addicts who cannot admit it or speak publicly about it for fear of stigma.
1.1.5.4.5.1.1. Pro: A high-earning businessman [admitted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3342179/Meet-corporate-high-flyer-manages-hold-100-000-year-job-shooting-deadly-drug-day.html) to a highly functional 20-year addiction in an article in 2015 under a false name.
1.1.5.4.5.2. Con: There are [many 40- to 50-year olds](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-05/heroin-users/5238674) holding down jobs and taking care of families whilst sustaining a heroin habit.
1.1.5.4.5.3. Pro: Long term meth usage is extremely [injurious](https://luxury.rehabs.com/crystal-meth-addiction/dangers/) to health, and can lead to cardiovascular issues, brain haemorrhages, strokes, etc.
1.1.5.4.5.4. Pro: Long term [heroin usage](https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/heroin/long-term-effects.html) can lead to collapsed veins, infections of blood vessels and heart valves, and carries a risk of AIDS and other transferable diseases.
1.2. Allow the use of drugs for exclusively medicinal purposes.
1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.2.2. Con: This system would be open to widespread abuse.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Recreational drug users could feign illnesses or convince doctors within their social circle to prescribe 'medicinal' drugs for recreational purposes.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Medical justifications for cannabis prescriptions are generally vague, such as 'chronic pain'. As pain is hard to show this makes cannabis available to nearly everyone \([p. 4](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.2.2.2. Pro: It would be relatively easy for people with illnesses to sell or supply drugs to others.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: This would still be [illegal](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/drug-possession/selling-prescription-drugs-illegally.htm), with harsh punishments for those who broke the law.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: However, the legality of their possession would make it far harder to catch them out.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: There would be no way for the state to verify that the ill people were actually the ones consuming the substances.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: The system could be strictly moderated.
1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: For instance, it could be made mandatory for medically prescribed drugs to be consumed within medical facilities, in front of a doctor.
1.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: If doctors suspect that their patients are not the ones consuming the drugs they are prescribing, they could freeze the prescriptions.
1.2.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Patients could be regularly drug tested to confirm this.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Corrupt doctors and physicians could illegally prescribe drugs in order to increase their [earnings](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/opioids-doctors-prescriptions-payments/).
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: A former New York assemblyman and doctor sold illegal prescriptions for more than [6 million opioid pills](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-opioids-idUSKBN17933P).
1.2.2.3.2. Con: This happens under the [status quo](https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/17/doctors-charged-illegal-prescription-opioid-crackdown/) and it is not a reason to ban prescription drugs.
1.2.2.4. Con: The possibility for abuse should not preclude us from taking actions which benefit people.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: The welfare state is similarly vulnerable to abuse, whether through fake claims, immigration, or health tourism. This does not mean that we should not invest in the welfare state, as it still provides useful social functions.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.5.1.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: The prescription of opiates for pain relief is open to - and indeed is subject to - [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic) by many, yet some territories continue to allow their use due to their therapeutic benefits.
1.2.2.5. Con: Many drugs that have the potential to be abused are already regularly prescribed by doctors to treat medical conditions. In such cases, there are safeguards in place to prevent abuse.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.3.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: There are [a number of doctors](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/health/in-demand-in-clinics-and-on-the-street-bupe-can-be-savior-or-menace.html) that prescribe opiates to patients that are highly addicted, who probably should instead be directed to rehab.
1.2.3. Con: The consumption of drugs with official medical backing leads to the perception that drugs are harmless or even healthy.
1.2.3.1. Pro: This impression will likely be intensified by pharmaceutical companies' marketing departments trying to sell large amounts of drugs.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Marketing created the image that aspirin is a harmless drug, when in fact there is evidence that it can cause [considerable health damage](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/you-can-skip-your-daily-aspirin-regimen).
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086018/) found strong indications that regular consumption of considerable doses of aspirin is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: The [FDA](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/6/5686722/dont-use-aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-fda-warns) recommends not to use aspirin as preventative medication to reduce the risks of heart attacks or strokes, as the potential health risks are higher than potential benefits.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Con: When assessed against the risks by clinicians on a case-by-case basis, aspirin can be an effective preventative treatment for serious cardiovascular events \([p. 152](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317158/pdf/0120147.pdf)\).
1.2.3.1.1.4. Con: When taken responsibly and as directed, aspirin is [safe](https://www.getreliefresponsiblyprofessional.com/aspirin-contraindications-interactions) and effective.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been known to use [direct-to-consumer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278148/) ad campaigns to [exaggerate the prevalence](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.19.2.110) of certain conditions in order to encourage the purchase of 'cures' which may cause more harm than benefit.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: Drugs could be made a controlled substance which would be illegal to advertise.
1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: There is [precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_nicotine_marketing) for this in the regulation and control of advertising of nicotine-containing substances.
1.2.3.2. Con: It is possible for something to be medically useful but still be seen as dangerous.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Many people are frightened and anxious about [chemotherapy](https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy/fears) in spite of it being heavily used in cancer treatment.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Regulated medicinal drugs can be sold with informative, knowledge-based warning labels.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: People have been significantly harmed by ingesting tainted and unregulated [CBD oil](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/01/cannabis-medical-cannabidiol-cbd-uk-consumers) in an attempt to access the documented benefits of cannabis. Legalising cannabis would mean that such products and their contents would need to be clearly and accurately catalogued in detail on their labels.
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Many people [assume](https://theconversation.com/history-not-harm-dictates-why-some-drugs-are-legal-and-others-arent-110564) some drugs are not dangerous because they are legal.
1.2.3.3. Pro: As they are prescribed by doctors or other medical professionals, many people [mistakenly believe](https://www.middlegate.co.uk/prescription-drug-abuse-dangerous/) that drugs available with a prescription must be completely safe.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Because they have been prescribed by a trusted professional, many of those abusing prescription drugs do not [recognise](https://www.lifeworkscommunity.com/blog/prescription-drug-abuse-is-a-growing-problem-in-the-uk) that they have an addiction.
1.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.
1.2.4. Con: The use of drugs for medical purposes under current legislation has already caused negative consequences. Therefore, an extension of this practice has to be avoided.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Potent drugs such as [opioids](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/29/health/gupta-unintended-consequences/index.html) are frequently used for medical purposes with a devastating effect: those painkillers increase the likeliness of a subsequent opioid addiction or even heroin consumption.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Opioids are [generally safe](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/prescription-opioids) if used responsibly.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Medical cannabis consumption has spillover effects and increases alcohol consumption in adults either as a substitute for it or together with it \([p. 21](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.5.1.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Even permissible and prescription drugs are open to being [abused](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/misuse-prescription-drugs/overview).
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.3.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Prescription stimulants can be misused given their abilty to produce [euphoric effects](https://www.drugrehab.com/addiction/prescription-drugs/stimulants/).
1.2.4.4.3. Pro: Prescribed sedative-hypnotic drugs can cause addiction as well as \(potentially fatal\) physical dependence \([p. 255](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4553644/pdf/yjbm_88_3_247.pdf)\).
1.2.4.4.4. Con: Prescription drugs have been shown to have medicinal benefits which [outweigh](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-05-painkiller-abuse-outweigh-benefits-chronic.html) the risks of addiction and abuse.
1.2.4.4.4.1. Pro: Despite popular belief, among people with no prior history of drug misuse who are prescribed opioids for [pain relief](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-05-painkiller-abuse-outweigh-benefits-chronic.html), fewer than 3% show signs of misuse.
1.2.4.5. Con: This is an argument for an overhaul of distribution and licensing methods, rather than for restricting access to therapeutic products completely.
1.2.4.5.1. Con: [Changes](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180730/NEWS/180739995/opioid-laws-hit-physicians-patients-in-unintended-ways) to recommendations of opioid access have left some patients unable to access the pain relief they required as doctors are [scared of the repercussions](https://www.statnews.com/2018/12/06/overzealous-use-cdc-opioid-prescribing-guideline/) of prescribing them.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: In 2018, the CDC released [updated guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/prescribing/CDC-DUIP-QualityImprovementAndCareCoordination-508.pdf) on assessing the needs of patients when prescribing opioids in order to help contain the drugs misuse.
1.2.4.6. Con: Although some medicinal drugs are abused in the status quo, this does not take away from the vital role they play in helping patients, which should be more important.
1.2.5. Pro: Allowing the medicinal application of drugs would increase the safety of their use.
1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.
1.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Medically allowed drugs would be dosage-controlled under supervision by patients' doctors \([p. 46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001746/pdf/dhps-10-045.pdf)\). This would help prevent overdose or complicated side-effects from inappropriate [self-medication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20615179/).
1.2.5.4. Pro: Deeper research carried out into the clinical applications and risks of substances such as cannabis \([p. 59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001746/pdf/dhps-10-045.pdf)\) would be less [restricted](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/04/07/600209754/medical-marijuanas-catch-22-limits-on-research-hinders-patient-relief) and better funded if they were medically legal.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: A [catch-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_\(logic\)) situation currently exists in regard to researching the medicinal applications of some illegal drugs, due to the laws surrounding how they are categorised \([p. 12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849133/pdf/nihms-778176.pdf)\).
1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Little evidence exists of the therapeutic effects of controlled substances as there are so few studies on them. Meanwhile, the lack of studies on the effects of illegal drugs is due to their tight regulation and assumed lack of medical benefit \([p. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849133/pdf/nihms-778176.pdf)\).
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.5.2.1.
1.2.5.4.3. Pro: Research into the health benefits of cannabis in the US has been limited, due to the [federal government's](https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/natural-products/Cannabis-research-stalled-federal-inaction/98/i25) refusal to legalise or downgrade the drug.
1.2.5.4.4. Con: Those wishing to legitimately research illegal drugs, with the resources to do so, can apply to their [governments](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/the-scientists-drug-dealer-how-researchers-get-illicit-drugs) to obtain samples.
1.2.5.5. Con: -> See 1.2.4.4.
1.2.6. Pro: Strict punishments for drug distribution can be enacted whilst simultaneously emplacing protective measures for those affected by illness and addiction.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Harm reduction has been successfully integrated into [sexual health programmes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528824/) for adolescents, where drug use can increase incidences of HIV infections, unplanned pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases.
1.2.6.2. Con: Medical cannabis legislation [increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099393) the number of overall cannabis users. This leads to an increase of those abusing cannabis.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: [A study](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/study-finds-increase-in-illicit-pot-use-abuse-in-s/) found strong indications that medical cannabis laws are responsible for an increase in the illegal consumption and abuse of cannabis in the affected US states.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: Medical cannabis legalisation creates a de facto legalised environment for cannabis.
1.2.6.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.6.2.2.2. Pro: Most implementations of medical cannabis legislation lack a patient registry and renewal system. This blurs the boundary between patients and non-patients \([p. 5](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.2.6.2.2.3. Pro: Supply channels are out of state control as home growing is often allowed where medical cannabis is legalised \([p. 5](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.2.6.2.2.4. Con: People would need to be able to show a [prescription](https://canex.co.uk/more-than-one-million-uk-adults-eligible-for-new-medical-cannabis-card/) in order to justify their consumption of medical cannabis.
1.2.6.2.2.5. Con: As medical cannabis is legalised, law enforcement is likely to think of new ways to identify people who are illegally consuming cannabis.
1.2.6.2.3. Con: [Replications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285867) of studies that showed an increase in cannabis use and lowered risk perception failed to confirm their results and rather illustrated that consumption stayed stable.
1.2.6.2.4. Con: Comparing [40 states](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23763418), only two showed signs of increased consumption following medical cannabis legalisation. This is likelier to be pure chance rather than causation.
1.2.6.2.4.1. Con: This study was focused on adolescents. Extending it to the population at large shows that adults are at a higher risk of abuse when medical cannabis is legal \([p. 24](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.2.6.2.5. Pro: Legalising medical cannabis allows the substance to enter the market through legal channels, increasing access for people who would not have risked the black market.
1.2.6.3. Con: Simultaneous attempts to legalise, but also regulate, the consumption of drugs - such as is done with [tobacco and alcohol](https://www.thoughtco.com/decriminalization-versus-legalization-of-marijuana-3368393) - sends an ultimately conflicted and confusing message to society.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Buprenorphine tablets can be distributed to help fight opioid addictions \(p[p. 8-9](https://idhdp.com/media/400258/idpc-briefing-paper_drug-policy-in-india.pdf)\).
1.2.6.5. Pro: The provision and distribution of clean needles by governments may help prevent the spread of HIV \([p. 10](https://idhdp.com/media/400258/idpc-briefing-paper_drug-policy-in-india.pdf)\).
1.3. Legalise most drugs, but with conditions and tests to ensure the safety of consumers.
1.3.1. Con: Meaningful conditions and tests would be impractically expensive to implement.
1.3.1.1. Con: The costs of testing would be far outweighed by the saving through legitimate regulation and taxation.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Drugs and other consumables approved for public use must undergo an extensive, multiphase, [evaluation process](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-information-consumers/fdas-drug-review-process-ensuring-drugs-are-safe-and-effective) to assess their safety before being granted release.
1.3.2. Pro: The legalisation of drugs is safer for both law enforcement and citizens.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Legalisation makes drug use safer.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Legalisation would lead to better quality drugs.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Users would be more likely to seek out a regulated supplier if possible as they would trust it to be more safe for them.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Organised crime can produce lower quality drugs at a lower price. If someone is addicted, they are unlikely to be able to care and, once they are high, unable to tell the difference.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that someone is an addict does not mean that they cannot assess quality and decide who to buy from.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: A drug produced at higher purity means less needs to be consumed in order to get an equivalent high. In this way even high quality drugs can be more cost effective for consumers.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: In addition, criminal organizations do not pay tax, which helps to maintain low prices.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The threat of punishment and jailtime for purchasing from a criminal may be enough to nudge addicts towards purchasing legally, even if the prices are a bit steeper.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: In order to increase their profit, dealers [stretch](https://www.oxfordtreatment.com/substance-abuse/crystal-meth/how-its-made/) drugs with dangerous chemicals that cannot be easily detected.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Because drugs are often connected to heavy [money laundering](https://ips-dc.org/drug_trafficking_money_laundering/), drug dealers are always on the lookout for ways to make the most money off the least amount of pure drugs.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Some people will still go through unofficial channels to get their drugs.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: People will still feel stigmatised for consuming their drugs and will not want it on an official record.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The legal status of drugs would not necessitate putting their purchase on an official record.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Those who are already indebted to drug cartels will be forced to continue to buy from them.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Cartels give drug users lower price drugs initially to get them hooked and then force addicts to pay back the money through [trafficking](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/the-downward-spiral-of-indebted-drug-addicts-1.2537158) for fear of the consequences.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: As most individuals will not be connected to drug cartels, they will likely buy their drugs from local street drug dealers.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: A large number of these local [street dealers](http://www.npr.org/2016/02/15/466491812/narconomics-how-the-drug-cartels-operate-like-wal-mart-and-mcdonalds) are [connected](http://www.kevindeutsch.us/blog/bloods-crips-and-cartels-how-american-street-gangs-work-mexican-narco-kings-flood-us-streets) to [cartels](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/05/gang-warfare-on-streets-chicago-fueled-by-sinaloa-cartel-heroin.html). If money is owed to these street dealers, money will ultimately be owed to drug cartels.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.3.3. Con: These people will not be numerous enough to sustain the cartels' business models in the long term.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: Even if drugs are legal, consumption may negatively affect individuals' chances of employment in some sectors \(such as aviation or emergency services\).
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.5. Con: It is likely that this number will still be heavily reduced compared to the status quo.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.6. Con: This is inevitable on some level, and should not affect policy-making past a certain point.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Legalisation would remove legislative barriers that [discourage scientific research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307971/) on drugs.
1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: The legal liability of the distributor or producer is somewhat unclear regarding unknown adverse health effect of a product.
1.3.2.1.1.4. Pro: If legalised, drugs would be more consistent in their composition and so overdoses would be less likely.
1.3.2.1.1.5. Pro: The drugs would not be contaminated with harmful substances, which is one of the main risks of drug usage.
1.3.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.
1.3.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.6.
1.3.2.1.1.6. Con: Legalising drugs does not guarantee that the quality of the drugs supplied is high.
1.3.2.1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.1.6.3. Con: Cannabis is [fairly easy](http://herb.co/2016/05/21/laced-weed/) to check for quality.
1.3.2.1.1.6.4. Con: [Pill testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_testing) is an easy tool to identify the quality of a drug.
1.3.2.1.1.7. Con: Access to higher quality drugs might in turn encourage more people to use them, potentially leading to more overall health risks.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Mandatory drug licence tests would ensure users are aware of the fatal consequences of irresponsible use.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Drug dealers in the illegal market have very little incentive to warn customers of the dangers of illegal drugs.
1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: First and foremost drug dealers are businessmen. As such, they have a vital interest in maintaining a large pool of healthy customers.
1.3.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Since drugs are addictive, they create their own consumers - drug dealers therefore do not need to put any effort into maintaining a clientele.
1.3.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Street drugs are often '[cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_agent)' with other substances in order to increase profits, and it is common for dealers [not to know](https://crimestopperssa.com.au/media-releases/six-things-your-drug-dealer-wont-tell-you/) exactly what their products contain.
1.3.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.1.5.
1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: A license test would likely contain a safety check by a physician. This would guarantee that adults are physically safe to take drugs.
1.3.2.1.2.2.1. Con: This assumes that doctors are capable of determining whether or not a person is physically fit to take drugs. However, the reasons why someone should not receive drugs are not necessarily immediately apparent.
1.3.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Even a limited test is preferable to the complete absence of checks on illegal drug use in the status quo.
1.3.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: People could be predisposed toward addiction - this would not necessarily show in any preliminary testing.
1.3.2.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.3.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: This safety check would be able to prevent people with pre-existing conditions, which make drug consumption [harmful](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002314.htm), from indulging.
1.3.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: Physicians would also be able to identify if people have a history of - or [predisposition to](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/genetics-epigenetics-addiction) - drug abuse, and in doing so screen out potential addicts from being able to access drugs.
1.3.2.1.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.5.2.
1.3.2.1.2.3. Con: Awareness would not necessarily translate into more responsible behaviour.
1.3.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Despite driving licenses being mandatory, many people still flout [safety regulations](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries).
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Mentally stable adults would use drugs in a responsible way in the same way that they do with alcohol.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: This ignores the highly [addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) nature of some drugs. Even responsible use initially can quickly spiral into a dangerous addiction.
1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.3.1.1.
1.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.3.1.3.
1.3.2.1.3.2. Con: It is practically impossible to use a highly mind-altering substance 'responsibly'.
1.3.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Flakka, a synthetic drug, causes [violent and antisocial](http://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/flakka-drug-crazed-overdose/2015/04/16/id/638865/) behaviour. It is also extremely easy to take too much by accident.
1.3.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.3.2.4. Con: Alcohol also alters one's [mental state](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/a/alcohol-and-mental-health). However a [large portion](https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2013/05/31/drinking-responsibly-Government-statistics) of society consumes it responsibly.
1.3.2.1.3.3. Pro: The communal use of soft drugs such as [alcohol](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120629211854.htm) and [cannabis](https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/28287/1/the-love-hormone-and-weed-both-make-you-bond-with-others) can be a bonding experience.
1.3.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: Cannabis has been found to increase socialisation through the stimulation of oxytocin release \([p. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2015/10/21/1509795112.full.pdf)\).
1.3.2.1.3.4. Con: Even when drugs are legalised, there is no safeguard preventing adults passing on legally bought drugs to illegal consumers, such as children.
1.3.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: This is the same with alcohol. Despite strict laws around the purchasing of alcohol for minors in many countries, a [significant](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking) percentage of them still consume it.
1.3.2.1.3.4.2. Con: This would obviously continue to be illegal, and therefore not be an important consideration when considering legality.
1.3.2.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Even if it continued to be illegal, it would ultimately increase the number of children with access to drugs.
1.3.2.1.3.5. Pro: All people have the right to a private life and to [personal autonomy](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/right/a-private-and-family-life/). What substances an individual chooses to use in their own body, therefore, should be a personal choice.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1. Con: A person cannot meaningfully consent to drug use.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Given the varied impacts that drug consumption can have on an individual, it is unlikely that users understand all the outcomes that it could have. This means that their ultimate decision is uninformed.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Presumably once drug use becomes legal, more of this information will be known and freely available so people can inform themselves.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: In the US, the [NIDA](https://www.drugabuse.gov/) already freely provides drug abuse related information.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.2. Con: Much of the variance in impacts can be put down to the varying [composition](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/10/ecstasy-molly-purity-us-synthetic-drugs-mdma) and [potency](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/28/clubbers-warn-overdose-risk-from-superstrength-ecstasy-mdma) of drugs that are produced illegally. Consequently, it would not apply in a world where drugs were legal.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.6.4.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.6.5.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.3. Pro: People's responses to identical [doses](https://www.futurity.org/small-variations-medications-effect-differences-1696272/) of the same drug can vary greatly depending on the individual. This makes drug use and its consequences extremely complex.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: For example, different [ethnicities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594139/) react differently.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Consenting to drug use can be seriously impacted by mental health.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: Many people turn to drugs because of trauma or unhappiness in their lives, which can mean they perceive themselves as having no other alternatives.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Most [drug users](http://theconversation.com/many-people-use-drugs-but-heres-why-most-dont-become-addicts-35504) can rely on supportive networks and loving families to limit drug-related harms.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: The '[Rat Park](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130910-drug-addiction-the-complex-truth)' experiment found that quality of life and living conditions have a huge influence on one's susceptibility to addiction.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: There is a high level of correlation between [poverty](https://borgenproject.org/addiction-poverty-connected/) and substance abuse.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.1.4. Con: If these people genuinely feel that they have no other alternatives, drugs can and should be considered a legitimate choice.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.2. Con: People with mental health issues can still make informed and consensual [decisions](https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/107979/schizophrenia-other-psychotic-disorders/dont-assume-psychiatric-patients).
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.2.2.1. Con: Having certain mental illnesses, such as [schizophrenia](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml), can cost people their [right to vote](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-disability-laws).
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3. Con: It is the duty of the government to ensure that information is made available so that people can make informed choices, even if they end up causing themselves some harm.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.1. Pro: Consent can be protected through education and awareness campaigns.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2. Pro: Most people already know about the dangers of hard drugs so it is possible to evaluate their consent.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: Anti-drug campaigns by both government and independent agencies are widespread and have had an educating effect.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The "Ice destroys lives" campaign by the Australian Government turned [half](http://www.news.com.au/national/federal-governments-ice-advertisements-turn-half-our-at-risk-kids-off-the-drug/news-story/ff26fe90d9d82c59ceacd00bface56ad) of at-risk children away from the drug.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The confrontational nature of this campaign may have had a [negative effect](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/shock-and-awe-ice-campaigns-a-turn-off-research-20150522-gh7as2.html) on children.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Anti-drug campaigns can have [counter-intuitive effects](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-03/science-psas-do-anti-drug-ads-keep-kids-drugs) by making even previously uninterested young people curious about what taking drugs might be like.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Campaigns like [Talk to Frank](http://www.talktofrank.com/) are informing children about the negative effects of drugs.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1.4. Pro: The campaign [Above the Influence](http://abovetheinfluence.com/) was found to be [effective](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-03/science-psas-do-anti-drug-ads-keep-kids-drugs) as only 8% of teenagers who were familiar with the campaign started smoking cannabis, versus 12% of teenagers who had not seen it.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.1.5. Con: Anti-drug campaigns often fall back on scare tactics rather than education, such as the [DrugsNot4Me](https://www.macleans.ca/society/health/an-accurate-reflection/) campaign.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.2.2. Con: There are many types of drugs outside [standard categories](https://www.unodc.org/drugs/en/get-the-facts/types-of-drugs.html), such as Krokodil, PCP, or N-Bomb. This makes appropriate knowledge of drugs difficult.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.3. Pro: The government should only step in to restrict people's choices when they cause someone else [harm](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-the-harm-principle/).
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.4. Con: Governments also have a [duty](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/drug-deaths-record-number-government-conservative-policy-legal-highs-illegal-killed-tory-policy-ons-a7873241.html) to prevent people from taking actions that will necessarily harm themselves.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.4.1. Pro: Governments try to protect people from making a variety of poor choices, for example with [seat belt laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation) and [sugar taxes](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/11/world-health-organisation-who-countries-tax-sugary-drinks).
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.4.2. Pro: [Suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation), for instance, is illegal in most of the world.
1.3.2.1.3.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.3.
1.3.2.1.3.5.2. Con: Even if drug users consent to use drugs, those around them do not consent to the damaging effects of drug use on their own lives and society.
1.3.2.1.3.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.2.1.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.5.1.3.
1.3.2.1.3.5.4. Pro: [Dworkin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Dworkin) ‘right to moral independence’ principle - the right 'not to suffer disadvantage...in the liberties permitted to them by the criminal law' - easily supports the idea that taking drugs should be a free choice \([p. 236](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40435955)\).
1.3.2.1.3.6. Pro: There are [many drug users](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/09/10/jonathan-caulkins/responsible-drug-use-possible) in society that already use drugs responsibly.
1.3.2.1.3.6.1. Pro: In fact, the [majority](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/habits-most-drug-users-are-happy-successful-people-with-a-taste-for-the-good-life-1292155.html) of young individuals consuming illegal substances lead fulfilling and successful lives.
1.3.2.1.4. Con: Certain drugs simply can not be consumed in a safe manner.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: Heroin causes [harm](http://drugabuse.com/library/the-effects-of-heroin-use/) to the body, especially when it is cut with dangerous substances.
1.3.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Unassisted heroin withdrawal can be [fatal](https://www.medpagetoday.com/blogs/doing-time/76060) unless carefully managed.
1.3.2.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.5.
1.3.2.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.4.
1.3.2.1.5. Con: Government policy should not only be oriented around safety, but also around sending the correct moral message to the citizenry.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Legalisation helps to contain violence in society.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: A legal, government controlled market for drugs eliminates a source of revenue for organized crime.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.2.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.
1.3.2.2.1.4. Pro: One of the consequences of Maastricht's ban on sales for foreign tourists was [more aggressive](https://www.thejournal.ie/maastricht-cannabis-marijuana-weed-pass-protest-939414-Jun2013/) street dealing, suggesting that decriminalisation eradicates income for criminals.
1.3.2.2.1.5. Pro: It is unlikely that criminal groups would be as successful as large companies at producing, quality assuring, marketing, and selling drugs.
1.3.2.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.2.1.5.2. Con: [Drug cartels'](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/how-much-are-mexico-s-brutal-drug-cartels-worth-1.1333213) revenue is bigger than, or at least comparable to, that of pharmaceutical companies.
1.3.2.2.1.5.2.1. Con: This may only be true because criminals are not in direct competition with companies. It is entirely plausible that a pharmaceutical company could put a cartel out of business if they were.
1.3.2.2.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Pharmaceutical companies already have extensive production, distribution, and marketing infrastructure set up; it will be very easy for them to move into the market for recreational drugs.
1.3.2.2.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5.2.
1.3.2.2.1.5.3. Pro: Drug companies have an immense advantage in being able to hire experts in each area; almost all of whom would not want to work for cartels, by virtue of them being illegal.
1.3.2.2.1.5.4. Con: It is unclear why drug companies would start producing recreational drugs, considering that \(most\) recreational drugs likely create a niche market only.
1.3.2.2.1.5.5. Pro: Legal companies have the ability to advertise through traditional channels \(television, newspapers, magazines\), giving them access to a user-base that criminal groups simply cannot hope to compete with.
1.3.2.2.1.5.6. Pro: Companies would have an easier time finding land to place their plantations and factories on as their work is legal. Criminal groups will necessarily have less land, and will typically be confined only to those areas where the law does not quite reach.
1.3.2.2.1.5.7. Pro: Once legitimate companies are involved in the business, they will likely [lobby governments](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government) to ensure that their business interests are protected, which would involve cracking down on black markets and criminal groups.
1.3.2.2.1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.5.2.
1.3.2.2.1.6. Pro: The price of drugs would come down dramatically, thus massively decreasing the profit margin for cartels.
1.3.2.2.1.6.1. Pro: As illegal drugs are not patent protected, they would likely be sold at base cost, like generics.
1.3.2.2.1.6.1.1. Con: If recreational drugs were legalised, they could be [patented](http://theconversation.com/pot-with-patents-could-plant-the-seeds-of-future-lawsuits-78580).
1.3.2.2.1.6.2. Pro: Governments would be able to sell the drugs more cheaply as they could run at a loss.
1.3.2.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: Uruguay's government sells a gram of cannabis for [$1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/06/uruguay-marijuana-regulat_n_5276097.html), which undermines the practice of illegal drug trafficking.
1.3.2.2.1.6.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.2.1.6.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.3.2.2.1.6.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.
1.3.2.2.1.6.3. Pro: There would be a greater supply of drugs which would likely decrease the cost.
1.3.2.2.1.6.3.1. Con: If they are legal, the demand is also likely to increase so this would be offset.
1.3.2.2.1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.1.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: The legalisation of drugs would dramatically reduce the violence associated with the drug trade. If legal, drug distributors would not be at odds with law enforcement.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Ending the War on Drugs would benefit the countries where the fight against traffickers and cartels is most active.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Ending the War on Drugs would not decrease the control and influence the cartels have over these countries.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.2.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.5.
1.3.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Drug cartels are now involved in [a range of illicit activities](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/06/22/legalizing-drugs-wont-stop-mexicos-brutal-cartels/) and not only in drug trafficking. Legalising drugs will not end cartel activity.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: Narcotrafficking is financing parties involved in [civil wars](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/drug-trafficking-and-the-financing-of-terrorism.html) and militant groups like [ISIS](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/isis-al-qaeda-drugs-trafficking-cartels-heroin-terrorism-a7684961.html).
1.3.2.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Investigators suspect that ISIS may be [taxing](https://www.rand.org/blog/2017/07/isis-is-so-desperate-its-turning-to-the-drug-trade.html) the movement of drugs through their territory.
1.3.2.2.2.1.3.2. Con: The claim that drugs are funding ISIS has been [challenged by experts](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ppvgw8/is-the-drug-trade-really-bank-rolling-terrorists) and is not backed up by solid evidence.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Due to reduced revenues from the drug business, criminal gangs would no longer be able to arm themselves.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Under-equipped gangs would likely be less willing to brave conflict against rival gangs or the police, reducing the total amount of violence.
1.3.2.2.2.2.2. Con: In countries like America, guns are relatively [cheap](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2014/08/12/inside-the-black-market-for-guns/#42e5685e181e) and accessible. It is unlikely that a hit to drug revenue will meaningfully impede criminal gangs from being able to purchase firearms.
1.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: [Prohibition](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/four-decades-counting-continued-failure-war-drugs) artificially inflates the price of drugs astronomically as there is no regulation of the prices. This in turn leads to people committing theft to be able to afford the new prices.
1.3.2.2.2.4. Con: The cheap production and distribution of black market drugs will continue to be illegal and a source of violence in the drug trade.
1.3.2.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.1.
1.3.2.2.2.4.2. Con: At the very least, the black market trade is likely to be smaller than it is in the status quo.
1.3.2.2.2.5. Pro: The legalisation of drugs may help decrease the exploitation of vulnerable [women](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/uruguay-marijuana-legalization-one-year-later/) in the drug supply chain.
1.3.2.2.2.5.1. Pro: Women are most often be arrested as street [dealers](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/uruguay-marijuana-legalization-one-year-later/) or traffickers.
1.3.2.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: The [majority](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/uruguay-marijuana-legalization-one-year-later/) of drug traffickers in Latin America are women.
1.3.2.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: Lower income, uneducated women are often viewed as '[expendable drug mules](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/feature/2014/04/15/women-paying-price-latin-america-drug-wars)'.
1.3.2.2.2.5.2. Con: When Amsterdam legalised cannabis, it saw an increase in illegal drug and human [trafficking](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/15/opinion/bennett-whitney-drugs/index.html).
1.3.2.2.2.5.3. Pro: The female prison population in Uruguay fell from [7.9% to 5.8%](http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/uruguay) following legalisation.
1.3.2.2.2.5.3.1. Con: There is no concrete evidence that this is due to the new drug policy. The information shows a decrease in female prison population, and this could be due to a myriad of co-occurring factors, not necessarily because of a change in the legal status of drugs.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.4.2.1.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Legalising drugs could help those struggling with drug addiction.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: With legalisation, there is likely to be an increase in services for drug users, which may help with their addiction problem.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Addicts are more likely to seek out support services if they don't feel stigmatised.
1.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Legalising or decriminalising drugs will not necessarily lift the stigma of drug consumption.
1.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Since some US states have begun to legalise or decriminalise [cannabis](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a21719186/all-states-that-legalized-weed-in-us/), the negative image and social stigma connected to the drug's consumption are decreasing.
1.3.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: The stigma surrounding addiction can [dissuade](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-stigma-of-addiction-is-more-dangerous-than-drug_b_5968ee14e4b06a2c8edb45fe) individuals from seeking help, treatment, and support.
1.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Methadone clinics and heroin injecting rooms become viable when drug use is less stigmatised.
1.3.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: There is also an incentive for legitimate companies to support the creation of these as it will protect the safety of their users and thus increase their profits.
1.3.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Methadone programs save addicts from typical drug-related dangers such as [dirty needles](http://www.towardsrecovery.com/methadone-treatment-controversy/).
1.3.2.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Freely [distributing](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-programming/prevention/needle-syringe-programmes) disposable needles is a far more cost-effective way to avoid the dangers of dirty needles.
1.3.2.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.5.
1.3.2.3.1.3. Con: Services for addicts could end up being very costly.
1.3.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Treating drug addiction, while expensive, has been found to be far [cheape](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost)r than the costs unchecked substance abuse exact from society.
1.3.2.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: One year of methadone maintenance treatment for a patient [costs](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost) approximately 4,700 USD, compared to the 24,000 of a full year of imprisonment.
1.3.2.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: The USA loses over a [trillion dollars](https://addiction-treatment.com/in-depth/what-america-spends-on-drug-addictions) per year to drug addiction and its associated harms.
1.3.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: Intensive in-patient rehabilitation centres can charge between [14,000 to 27,000](https://www.rehabs.com/addiction/how-much-does-rehab-cost/) USD per week.
1.3.2.3.1.4. Con: There's no reason to assume that legalisation would necessarily lead to more services for drug users.
1.3.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: If the legalisation was spurred by a libertarian impulse, where the government felt that it did not have the right to intervene too deeply into private life, it is highly unlikely that the government would invest money into addiction clinics and the like.
1.3.2.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The private sector could still set up addiction clinics, even if the government failed to do so.
1.3.2.3.1.4.2. Pro: Setting up private rehabilitation clinics is already legal - legalising drugs would not do anything to spur more people to open such services.
1.3.2.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: There are over [14,500](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/top-10-drug-treatment-centers/) specialized drug treatment centres across the USA.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: When drug ownership and use are illegal, in spite of them being victimless crimes, people can be sent to prison, which is harmful and unjust.
1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: It is easier to justify policies to help drug addicts \(such as safe heroin injecting rooms\) when their actions are no longer seen as taboo.
1.3.2.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.1.1.
1.3.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: While seen as taboo, a heroin injecting room is less likely to be perceived as a necessary medical precaution, and more likely to be seen as a government handout for drug addicts.
1.3.2.3.2.2. Con: Drug possession is not necessarily a victimless crime.
1.3.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.2.3.2.3. Con: The same argument would apply to any other non-violent crime, such as tax fraud.
1.3.2.3.2.3.1. Con: Perpetrators of tax fraud cause damage to the economy and people's livelihoods. Unlike drug possession, this is not a victimless crime.
1.3.2.3.2.4. Pro: Often it is not the drugs themselves which destroy people, but the criminal activities they get pushed into.
1.3.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: There is a [strong correlation](https://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/sexual-exploitation-and-substance-abuse/) between drug users and those who are exploited by the sex trade.
1.3.2.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: As well as being a pre-determining factor in such sexual exploitation, it is also a means of [coping](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3622163/) with it. Criminalising drugs is therefore an egregious misapplication of punishment on vulnerable people trying to cope.
1.3.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: Young people who use drugs are [more likely](https://www.ojjdp.gov/jjbulletin/9808/why.html) to join gangs than those who do not, since gangs can offer young drug users easy access to drugs.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3. Con: Drug consumption is harmful to people regardless of whether it is associated with crime. The use of [cocaine](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine) or [heroin](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin) can be very physically harmful in itself.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1. Con: Maintaining the ban on recreational drugs does not alleviate those harms for addicts; they have limited ability to stop their addiction and criminalising them will not help.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.1. Con: It has been posited that "the change from abuse to recovery is based on choice" \([p. 265](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047254/pdf/jeab-95-02-263.pdf)\); in that light, criminalising drug use remains a valid mode of reducing the choices available to an addict.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: Drug addiction is a complex [disease](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(11\)61358-5/fulltext) rather than a crime.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: Treating drug addiction like a curable disease can be immensely successful; as many as [40-60%](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/treatment-recovery) of recovered drug addicts never relapse after treatment.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: This is not a very large number, and implies that about half of drug addicts do end up relapsing.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Addiction is a [chronic disease](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) characterised by compulsive drug use and loss of control.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.3. Pro: Repeated drug use can lead to [brain changes](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/health-complications-addiction/chemical-imbalance) that challenge an addicted person’s self-control.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.4. Con: By definition, if someone is using drugs while they are illegal, they are committing a crime.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.5. Con: The fact that it is a disease does not mean that it is not a crime.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: [Pedophilia](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/mental-health-disorders/sexuality-and-sexual-disorders/pedophilia) is commonly classified as a mental disorder, but the abuse of children is still a crime.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.6. Con: The "addiction as disease" model is heavily disputed \([p. 263](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047254/pdf/jeab-95-02-263.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.3.
1.3.2.3.2.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.4.1.
1.3.2.3.2.5. Con: Not all drug related crimes are approached with incarceration. Many of those convicted can choose rehabilitative programs instead.
1.3.2.3.2.5.1. Pro: Having legal consequences for drug crimes does not necessarily mean imprisoning users. Punishments could range from fines to community services for crimes as minor as personal consumption.
1.3.2.3.2.5.2. Pro: Decriminalisation would still exact [civil penalties](https://adf.org.au/talking-about-drugs/law/decriminalisation/overview-decriminalisation-legalisation/), such as fines, on many people struggling with addiction, instead of offering rehabilitative support.
1.3.2.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.4.
1.3.2.3.2.7. Pro: It is sensible to focus on rehabilitating drug users and treating addiction like the [disease](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/is-drug-addiction-a-disease) it is, instead of incarcerating individuals.
1.3.2.3.2.7.1. Pro: Prison makes drug addiction worse, and introduces addiction to prisoners who have never used drugs.
1.3.2.3.2.7.1.1. Pro: Approximately [half](http://www.prisonerhealth.org/educational-resources/factsheets-2/incarceration-substance-abuse-and-addiction/) of all prisoners in the US meet the criteria for substance dependency or addiction.
1.3.2.3.2.7.1.2. Pro: The drug trade [thrives](https://www.thefix.com/content/prison-drug-dealing-oxycontin90211) in prisons; prisoners are able to easily access hard drugs inside.
1.3.2.3.2.7.1.3. Pro: Drug treatment programmes in prison [tend to fail](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/11/prisons-are-making-americas-drug-problem-worse).
1.3.2.3.2.7.1.4. Con: [Rehabilitative drug programs](https://www.wdp.org.uk/how-we-help/service-types/prison-based-services) can be offered in prisons.
1.3.2.3.2.7.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.2.2.
1.3.2.3.2.7.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2. Pro: Research shows that treatment is far more effective than prison in preventing recidivism and aiding reintegration \([p. 4](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-01_rep_mdtreatmentorincarceration_ac-dp.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.1. Pro: [77%](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/once-a-criminal-always-a-criminal/) of drug offenders will reoffend within three years of their release. Clearly, incarceration does not encourage users away from drugs.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2. Pro: [Methadone](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2000/03/5047/methadone-maintenance-found-be-more-effective-treating-heroin-addicti) programs have proven to be very successful in treating heroin addiction.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2.1. Pro: Methadone is safer for drug users than heroin.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.4.1.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.2.2.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2.1.3. Con: Methadone is implicated in [twice as many](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/us/17methadone.html?oref=slogin&_r=0) deaths as heroin use.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2.2. Pro: Methadone treatment programs have been found to reduce the level of acquisitive crime - crimes committed to buy drugs - to [one-eighth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9494936) of the level it was before.
1.3.2.3.2.7.2.2.3. Con: Methadone programmes have the undesired outcome of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and [increased perinatal mortality.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.13046/abstract)
1.3.2.3.2.7.3. Con: Jail acts as a [powerful incentive](https://www.newsweek.com/treat-drug-addiction-well-still-need-jail-time-392635) for users to get and stay clean.
1.3.2.3.2.7.3.1. Pro: For some addicts, a jail sentence may act as a [wake-up call](https://www.ashwoodrecovery.com/blog/is-jail-prison-ever-good-thing-addict/) by indicating the extent of their drug problem.
1.3.2.3.2.7.4. Con: There is no reason that these policies have to be mutually exclusive. We can attempt to rehabilitate those drug users who we are able to, while incarcerating others.
1.3.2.3.2.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.
1.3.2.3.2.7.6. Pro: It costs the government far more to pay for the incarceration of a criminal than to pay for the rehabilitation of a drug user \([p. 5](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-01_rep_mdtreatmentorincarceration_ac-dp.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.2.7.6.1. Pro: It is better to spend the same money on rehabilitating drug users and creating opportunities for them out of jail, than doing the same with them imprisoned.
1.3.2.3.2.7.6.1.1. Pro: An individual's [employment](https://careerwise.minnstate.edu/exoffenders/find-job/jobs-criminal-record.html) prospects are often severely limitied following a conviction.
1.3.2.3.2.7.6.2. Con: In more recent years, many local authorities have been able to [reduce](https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-population-and-spending) the amount they spend on correctional facilities.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: Drug addicts have made a bad decision in spite of an abundance of information about the harms of drugs - what is beneficial to them should therefore not be held to be very important.
1.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: Society should not be expected to make sacrifices for or prioritize people who actively choose not to care for themselves.
1.3.2.4. Con: Due to the level of stress the job incurs, police and other law enforcement personnel are already almost three times as likely to suffer [substance abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/sure-recovery/201803/police-and-addiction). Were legalisation to make drugs more accessible, it would further expose officers to the risk.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.4.
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.
1.3.5. Con: Legalisation opens the doors to the destructive effects of drugs on individuals and society.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Legalisation would lead to an increase in the number of drug users and therefore drug addicts.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: An increase in the number of drug users and addicts will have extremely negative consequences for individuals and society.
1.3.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: More than [70,000 people](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2017. This number would likely increase under legalisation or decriminalisation.
1.3.5.1.2.2.1. Con: More than 30% of those fatalities are caused by overdoses from [prescription opioid pain relievers](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates). Different drug legislation would be unlikely to affect this significant portion of overdose deaths.
1.3.5.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Many deaths occur due to addiction which was initially caused by [the legal prescription of drugs for medical purposes](https://www.unityrehab.com/blog/simple-injury-can-lead-heroin-addiction/).
1.3.5.1.2.2.2. Pro: A considerable number of individuals overdose as a way to [commit suicide](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avypkp/how-many-drug-overdoses-are-actually-suicides). This number is likely to increase if drugs are legalised or decriminalised, as the drugs can be more easily procured.
1.3.5.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In [South Dakota](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avypkp/how-many-drug-overdoses-are-actually-suicides), 29% of overdose deaths that occurred between 2008 and 2010 were classified as suicides.

1.3.5.1.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.5.2.
1.3.5.1.2.2.6. Con: The number of deaths from [street drug overdoses](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/) dropped from around 400 to 290 annually after decriminalisation measures were put in place in Portugal.
1.3.5.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.3.1.3.
1.3.5.1.2.4. Con: Addiction is only dangerous if stigmatized and untreated.
1.3.5.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.1.
1.3.5.1.2.4.2. Con: Even when treated, the risk of [relapse](https://brsrehab.com/blog/rehabilitation/relapse-inevitable-preventable/) is always present. As such, there is no cure for addiction.
1.3.5.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.5.2.
1.3.5.1.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.1.2.
1.3.5.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.3.
1.3.5.1.3. Con: Many teenagers consume drugs in order to [rebel](https://www.theedgerehab.com/blog/why-teenagers-use-drugs-what-every-parent-needs-to-know/). If there were no longer legal consequences for their consumption, it is unlikely that teenagers would resort to drugs in order to rebel against their parents.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: The legal availability of addictive substances leads more people to use them than when they are banned or regulated.
1.3.5.1.4.1. Pro: In the 1990s, a Yale Professor [estimated](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/debate/myths/myths2.htm) that if cocaine was legally available, cocaine users would increase five- to six-fold.
1.3.5.1.4.2. Pro: Legalising drugs will likely lead to [cheaper](https://newint.org/features/2012/09/01/drugs-legalization) drugs, which is likely to lead to an [increase](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/debate/myths/myths2.htm) in the demand for drugs, as more people will be able to afford them.
1.3.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: [A study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_liberalization#Prices_and_consumption) on the cocaine market indicates that a 10% reduction of the cocaine's price would lead to a 14% increase in the frequency of cocaine consumption.
1.3.5.1.4.2.2. Con: However, the implementation of regulations is likely to counteract the reduced prices through competition.
1.3.5.1.4.2.3. Pro: Potential legal repercussions cause illicit dealers to add a risk premium to their prices \([p. 5](https://www.academia.edu/2835091/Incarceration_of_drug_offenders_Costs_and_impacts)\). This inflates the cost of street drugs and reduces consumption.
1.3.5.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Many young criminals see prison time as a rite of passage and therefore do not fear it \([p. 5](https://www.academia.edu/2835091/Incarceration_of_drug_offenders_Costs_and_impacts)\).
1.3.5.1.4.3. Pro: This can be seen in the [legalisation](http://www.drugrehab.us/news/does-marijuana-legalization-lead-to-increased-use/) of cannabis in some US states.
1.3.5.1.4.3.1. Pro: This increase in addiction happened through the mere legalisation of cannabis for medical reasons. If wholesale legalisation were to take place, it is likely that these same effects would be greatly magnified.
1.3.5.1.4.4. Con: Black markets will meet the demand for these substances even if they are illegal, therefore causing addiction to still be a major problem.
1.3.5.1.4.5. Con: Evidence suggests that legalisation does not lead to increased consumption.
1.3.5.1.4.5.1. Pro: Despite the fact that [the Netherlands](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-smoke-the-most-cannabis/) have a very liberal drug policy, they are only 30th in line of cannabis consumption.
1.3.5.1.4.5.2. Pro: Countries that have decriminalised some or all drugs \(such as Portugal\) have not observed a long term increase in consumption. On the contrary, after a short period of slightly increased consumption it dropped [below pre-decriminalisation levels](https://mic.com/articles/110344/14-years-after-portugal-decriminalized-all-drugs-here-s-what-s-happening#.CpYhKGxdu).
1.3.5.1.5. Pro: Serious addicts do not contribute economically to society in a meaningful way, thus harming overall productivity. Therefore, people should not be allowed to use these substances.
1.3.5.1.5.1. Con: The fact that one person suffers an addiction should not interfere with another's autonomy and freedom of choice.
1.3.5.1.5.1.1. Con: Conversely, someone's autonomy should not create risks for someone else to fall into addiction.
1.3.5.1.5.2. Pro: Long-term addicts have heavily compromised [physical and mental health](https://drugabuse.com/long-term-effects-of-addiction/#physical-impacts), and recurring problems will prevent satisfactory work being completed or mean that they can’t find employment at all.
1.3.5.1.5.3. Pro: Many organisations proactively [discourage drug use](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/drug-testing-and-employee-monitoring#toc-0) among staff, instituting tests on the grounds of health and safety. In the event of a positive test, it is often in a company’s best interests to dismiss the employee, thus removing them from the tax paying proportion of society.
1.3.5.2. Con: Every decision a person can make has an effect on society and on those around them. This does not give society the right to arbitrarily enforce restrictions on practices that are no more harmful than unhealthy food or extreme sports.
1.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Drug use can impair a person's capacity to make clear decisions.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.
1.3.5.4.2. Pro: Drugs can induce [psychosis](http://www.dualdiagnosis.org/drug-addiction/psychosis/).
1.3.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.4.3.1.2.3.
1.3.5.5. Pro: In legitimising drug consumption, legalisation will lead to to a call for lower cost, [black market drugs](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mandy-saligari/drugs-legalisation-wont-work_b_2315148.html?guccounter=1), including potentially dangerous synthetic alternatives.
1.3.5.5.1. Pro: Synthetic [cannabinoids](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/synthetic-marijuana-is-far-more-dangerous-than-weed) and [cathinones](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1486827) are much more dangerous than their organic counterparts.
1.3.5.6. Con: Destructive effects upon the individual are of no concern to the rest of society, assuming that they are limited to that person.
1.3.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.5.
1.3.5.7. Pro: Allowing cannabis consumption comes with the risk of public nuisance and danger.
1.3.5.7.1. Pro: The smell of cannabis is a nuisance to people. In certain places, if the smell of cannabis leaves the personal property of an individual, the user is liable for a [fine](https://wheresweed.com/blog/news/2015/may/oregon-marijuana-legalization-2015-weed-smell-could-trigger-500-fine-in-pendleton#).
1.3.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.
1.3.5.7.3. Pro: The Netherlands has had so many problems relating to [drug tourism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/6168993/Dutch-to-ban-drug-tourism.html) as a result of legalised cannabis, that they attempted to ban it.
1.3.6. Pro: There are benefits to the consumption of some drugs.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.1.
1.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Drugs may [fuel creativity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/in-excess/201702/drug-use-and-creativity).
1.3.6.3.1. Con: While drugs might remove the inhibitions that stifle creative ideas, it is easy to build up a [resistance](https://www.mic.com/articles/88363/science-reveals-what-drugs-really-do-to-artists-brains) and lose your ability to experience the feelings that artistic inspiration is built on.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: Many people find that they [feel more creative](https://thegreenfund.com/does-weed-make-you-more-creative) under the effects of cannabis.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: Cannabis can [calm anxiety](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-smoking-pot-creative) that might prevent a creative person from expressing their ideas.
1.3.6.3.2.2. Con: Cannabis [reduces](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161004125829.htm) creativity.
1.3.6.3.3. Pro: In a late 1950s experiment, many artists believed that their pieces produced under the influence of LSD productions were [more interesting than and aesthetically superior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2723891/) to their other work.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: Small amounts of alcohol can improve [creative thinking](https://www.medicaldaily.com/drinking-alcohol-may-significantly-enhance-problem-solving-skills-240105) and problem-solving.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Drugs are fun if [used responsibly](http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/breaking-silence-responsible-drug-use/).
1.3.6.5. Con: [All drugs](https://emeraldcoastjourneypure.com/10-reasons-to-be-drug-and-alcohol-free/), including alcohol and nicotine, cause harm to the body and can have personal ramifications.
1.3.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.3.6.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.
1.3.6.5.3. Con: People affected by harder drugs tend to become much more violent and dangerous to other people than when consuming tobacco or alcohol.
1.3.6.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.6.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.2.
1.3.6.5.3.3. Pro: Synthetic drugs such as bath salts can cause '[bizarre and violent behavior](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3517997/The-science-bath-salts-Experts-reveal-dark-compounds-synthetic-street-drugs-cause-bizarre-violent-behaviour.html)' as well as [paranoia](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cathinones-bath-salts).
1.3.6.5.3.3.1. Con: Synthetic highs are cheap and often semi-legal substances designed to [substitute traditional drugs](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cathinones-bath-salts) like cannabis or cocaine. Therefore current drug policy is - at least partially - responsible for their rise in popularity.
1.3.6.5.3.4. Con: MDMA \(ecstasy\) - a relatively popular drug for recreational use - causes a contrary effect: it increases '[emotional empathy and prosocial behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24097374)'.
1.3.6.5.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.4.3.2.

1.3.6.5.5. Con: [Nicotine](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17670812/vape-e-cig-cigarette-juul-nicotine-addiction-vaping-smoke-health) in itself is [safe](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallysatel/2015/06/19/nicotine-can-save-lives/#47c449b26f43): its potential negative health consequences are negligible.
1.3.6.5.5.1. Pro: Nicotine is only harmful insomuch as it can cause addiction to tobacco, which is much more [harmful](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallysatel/2015/06/19/nicotine-can-save-lives/#6c295f986f43).
1.3.6.5.6. Con: Many things can cause harm to the body, but we do not ban all of them.
1.3.6.5.6.1. Pro: Many substances cause harm to the body when consumed improperly \(including [fast food](http://www.healthline.com/health/fast-food-effects-on-body) and [sugar](http://uk.businessinsider.com/effects-of-sugar-on-your-body-and-brain-2016-10?r=US&IR=T)\), but this is not a reason to ban them.
1.3.6.5.6.2. Pro: A sedentary lifestyle can also [harm the body](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322910.php) but we don't ban sitting for longer than an hour a day.
1.3.6.5.7. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.5.
1.3.6.5.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.3.

1.3.6.5.10. Pro: Smoking tobacco is widely known to cause a range of [health problems](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/health_effects/index.htm), both to the user and to those [around them](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand-Smoke.aspx), yet it remains legal.
1.3.6.5.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.1.
1.4. Decriminalise the personal possession and consumption of all drugs.
1.4.1. Pro: The decriminalisation of drugs would benefit those struggling with drug addictions.
1.4.1.1. Pro: When drugs are criminalised, drug users are seen as engaging in criminal activity and are [imprisoned](https://dualdiagnosis.org/jail-time-drug-users/). We are better placed to treat drug addicts as people with an illness rather than as criminals.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.1.

1.4.1.2. Pro: Portugal decriminalised all drugs in 2001. [As a result](https://mic.com/articles/110344/14-years-after-portugal-decriminalized-all-drugs-here-s-what-s-happening#.UP6LxiPPt), overall drug usage, drug-induced deaths, and imprisonment on drugs charges have all declined.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The [CATO Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute) found that decriminalisation had no adverse effect on drug usage rates in Portugal, and that they were now among the lowest in the EU \([p. 4](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/greenwald_whitepaper.pdf)\).
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Portugal has seen a [reduction in the rate of HIV infections](https://transformdrugs.org/drug-decriminalisation-in-portugal-setting-the-record-straight/) since decriminalisation.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Since decriminalisation, Portugal went from having a heroin epidemic to having [one of the lowest drug usage rates](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/portugal-drug-crisis-british-columbia-1.3962714) in the European Union.
1.4.1.2.4. Con: Portugal still has very strict [punitive measures](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/really-want-portugals-drug-laws/) in place for drug offences, such as confiscating one's passport.
1.4.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.2.2.6.
1.4.1.2.6. Pro: [UN drug policy](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/) experts say that Portugal's policy 'appears to be working'.
1.4.1.2.7. Con: In Portugal, decriminalisation made drug trafficking less dangerous, consequently reducing the disincentives to engage in the activity.
1.4.1.2.7.1. Pro: Portuguese courts reduced their punishments for drug traffickers as they increasingly identified them as consumers rather than traffickers \([p. 13](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Laqueur_\(2014\)_-_Uses_and_Abuses_of_Drug_Decriminalization_in_Portugal_-_LSI.pdf)\).
1.4.1.2.7.2. Con: In Portugal, where drugs are decriminalised, officials are developing ways to strengthen responses to [drug trafficking](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/drug-reports/2019/portugal/drug-markets_en) which takes place via the internet.
1.4.1.2.7.3. Con: Although the use of drugs in Portugal was decriminalised, their production, sale, trafficking, and distribution [remain punishable](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/19/8812263/portugal-drug-decriminalization).
1.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.3.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Decriminalisation would likely increase access to services for drug users.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.1.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: In [Portugal](https://news.vice.com/article/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin), decriminalisation was accompanied by needle exchange and opioid substitution programs.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Portugal offers mobile vans where heroin users can [inject](https://craftsmanship.net/portugals-path-to-breaking-drug-addiction/) in a clean, safe environment. Vans also offer mobile methadone administration units, as well as a first point of contact for those suffering with addictions.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.2.
1.4.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.3.
1.4.1.4.5. Con: This would only be true if decriminalisation was accompanied by active rehabilitation programs.
1.4.1.4.5.1. Pro: This would be very unlikely in poor countries which could not afford such programs.
1.4.1.4.5.1.1. Con: Even if governments could not afford these programs, once drug use is decriminalised, private parties could step in to provide rehabilitation by setting up centres and clinics.
1.4.1.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.2.2.
1.4.1.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.
1.4.1.4.6. Con: It is likely that the presence of increased services would at least partially be mitigated by equally improved access to drugs.
1.4.1.5. Con: Decriminalisation is likely to increase drug usage which, by extension, could increase incidences of addiction.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.2.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.3.

1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.3. Pro: Decriminalisation achieves the benefits of legalisation without incurring further harms.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Decriminalising drugs allows the government to avoid the mixed messaging that frequently comes with legalisation.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Decriminalising drugs allows them to remain illegal, thus keeping a firm [government message](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072016/) against their mass consumption.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: However, this illegality is a visibly empty threat, since the average person will not be punished in any way for possessing or consuming small amounts of drugs recreationally.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Decriminalising drugs introduces mixed messages of its own.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: For a government to reduce the penalties on drug use, but still keep them technically illegal, can lead to people being confused about whether or not drug use is as bad as they've been taught to believe.
1.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: The fact that drug use qualifies as a "[civil offense](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/decriminalisation-or-legalisation-injecting-evidence-drug-law-reform-debate)" rather than a "[criminal offense](https://www.libertyhouseclinic.co.uk/drug-addiction-crime/)" under decriminalisation may be confusing to people with a poor understanding of the law.
1.4.3.1.3.3. Con: All that is needed to avoid mixed messages is for governments to ensure that legislation remains [simple](https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/features/beautiful-law-design-visualisation-can-make-law-simpler-useful-even-fascinating), clear, and easy to access.
1.4.3.2. Con: Decriminalising drugs leaves space for [cartels, gangs](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/decriminalisation-or-legalisation-injecting-evidence-drug-law-reform-debate), and other illegal actors to monopolise and control the production and trade of drugs.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Decriminalising drugs only reduces the penalties for personal consumption, but does not help to legally provide or distribute drugs.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Without a legal alternative to street drugs, it is likely that decriminalisation would [increase](https://www.enthea.net/two-dissimilarities-with-portugal-decriminalization.html) the income and influence of drug cartels.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.7.2.
1.4.3.2.2.3. Con: Extending decriminalisation to cover [drug production](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2018/11/29/plan-decriminalize-opium-poppy-farming-Mexico-could-reduce-drug-cartel-violence/stories/201811010291) could reduce drug cartel violence.
1.4.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Poppy farming is the main source of income for many farmers in Mexico. Attempting to [contain the industry](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2018/11/29/plan-decriminalize-opium-poppy-farming-Mexico-could-reduce-drug-cartel-violence/stories/201811010291) has merely led to cartel battles for territory.
1.4.3.2.3. Con: On the contrary, decriminalising drugs allows states to continue their aggressive policies aimed towards cracking down on corrupt drug producers and distributors.
1.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.7.2.
1.4.3.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.7.3.
1.4.3.2.3.3. Con: Decriminalising drugs would likely cause governments to be laxer about pursuing drug related crimes and punishing them.
1.4.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: Since decriminalising drugs changes the nature of drug-related crimes from criminal to civil cases, it is effectively equivalent to the state arguing that drugs are not their business.
1.4.3.2.3.4. Con: States can do this just as well without decriminalising.
1.4.3.2.4. Con: If sufficiently large cartels and/or gangs exist, they will continue to pose problems and manufacture drugs whether they are legal or simply decriminalised. The problem is the cartel, not the policy.
1.4.3.3. Con: Legalisation offers a much more direct moral argument in favour of individual autonomy, while decriminalisation leaves its position hanging awkward and undefined.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.5.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Decriminalisation is likely to be a more publicly popular policy than legalisation, especially in societies which have strong stigmas against drug usage.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Over [80%](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/decriminalisation-or-legalisation-injecting-evidence-drug-law-reform-debate) of Australians support the decriminalisation of cannabis.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: Reducing the penalty for drug use is likely to be more popular than outright legalising drugs, especially in conservative societies.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: Some people may be concerned that the government would be openly favouring drug use in the event that drugs are legalised.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: Decriminalisation is unlikely to completely please both the people who are staunchly against drugs, and those that favour legalisation.
1.4.3.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.5.2.
1.4.3.6. Pro: Legalisation has never been achieved or attempted by any country, other than [Uruguay](https://transformdrugs.org/cannabis-legalisation-in-uruguay-public-health-and-safety-over-private-profit/) in 2017. Decriminalisation, conversely, has been [shown](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it) to reduce drug use stigmatisation, increase access to clinical services, and drastically decrease drug-related deaths.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.3.7. Con: Decriminalisation on its own is ineffective and should be [paired with other measures](https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/daphne-bramham-decriminalization-is-no-silver-bullet-says-portugals-drug-czar) in order to enact meaningful change.
1.4.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.2.
1.4.3.7.2. Pro: Those apprehended on drugs charges in Portugal - where drugs have been decriminalised - are offered [therapy](https://deserthopetreatment.com/addiction-guide/drug-industry-trends/other-countries-addiction-treatment/) and rehabilitation programs instead of jail sentences.
1.4.3.8. Con: Decriminalization without legalization would deny the government access to sales tax revenues for drugs.
1.4.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.
1.4.4. Con: Decriminalisation opens the doors to the destructive effects of drugs on individuals and society.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.4.4. Con: In spite of decriminalisation policies in [Austria](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/decriminalisation-or-legalisation-injecting-evidence-drug-law-reform-debate), there has not been an increase in the use of cannabis.
1.4.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.
1.4.4.6. Pro: Decriminalisation will lead to [low cost](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mandy-saligari/drugs-legalisation-wont-work_b_2315148.html), black market drugs, including potentially dangerous synthetic alternatives.
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.5.1.
1.4.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.7.
1.4.5. Pro: Decriminalising drug use would reduce government expenditure.
1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.3.1.2.
1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.4.
1.4.5.3. Con: Decriminalisation is likely to lead to an increase in health costs \([p. 208](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2S5JrOzNR1wC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=decriminalisation+would+cost+huge+amounts+of+money&source=bl&ots=t2ZcIz_ihE&sig=ACfU3U3jKyrLHc6QHiq6F6aIlblfuovfxA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilh936zrPqAhWyThUIHRA0BWwQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=decriminalisation%20would%20cost%20huge%20amounts%20of%20money&f=false)\).
1.4.5.3.1. Con: This assumes that decriminalisation would lead to increased drug usage. There is strong [empirical evidence](https://transformdrugs.org/drug-decriminalisation-in-portugal-setting-the-record-straight/) that this is not the case.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1.2.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.3.2.2.1.1.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: In the UK, treating drugs misuse was estimated in 2014 to cost the NHS around [£500 million](https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/24/addiction-took-hold-uk-cost-nhs-millions) per year. The potential increase to substance misuse in the event of decriminalisation would increase this figure.
1.4.5.3.4. Pro: The approval of The Portuguese National Strategy for the Fight Against Drugs \(NSFAD\) - the precursor to drugs decriminalisation in the country - led to a [12% increase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095539591400231X?via%3Dihub) in social costs in the 5 years that followed.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Decriminalisation would save government money being spent in criminal court, as offences would be [civil cases](https://adf.org.au/talking-about-drugs/law/decriminalisation/overview-decriminalisation-legalisation/) and thus might be dealt with in tribunals which tend to be much [cheaper](https://www.boltburdon.co.uk/blogs/service-charge-disputes-court-v-tribunal/).
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Judicial proceedings account for only [10%](https://recoverycentersofamerica.com/economic-cost-substance-abuse/) of criminal justice costs in the US.
1.4.5.5. Pro: The cost of drug-related incarcerations is very high.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: The costs incurred in incarceration are likely to be offset by the savings made in reducing the harmful effects of drugs in the society.
1.4.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.4.5.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.3.1.
1.4.5.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.4.
1.4.5.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.5.5.
1.4.5.5.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.
1.4.5.5.2. Pro: In the US, incarceration accounts for "[99%](https://recoverycentersofamerica.com/economic-cost-substance-abuse/) of costs associated with productivity loss due to crime."
1.4.5.5.3. Pro: In 2008, about a quarter of American inmates were non-violent drug offenders \([p. 1](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/incarceration-2010-06.pdf)\).
1.4.5.5.4. Pro: In the US, the average cost of incarceration for each federal inmate in the fiscal year 2014 was [around $30,000](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/03/09/2015-05437/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration).
