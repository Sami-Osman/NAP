Discussion Name: Should public displays of affection (PDA) be allowed in middle school and high school?

1. Public displays of affection \(PDA\) should be allowed in middle school and high school.
1.1. Con: Schools are not appropriate places for PDA.
1.1.1. Pro: Children have to learn that certain gestures are not appropriate in every context. Forbidding PDA in schools teaches them this.
1.1.1.1. Con: Showing one's affection for another seems appropriate in any environment as long as it is not disruptive.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are many environments in which showing affection is generally considered inappropriate.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Limiting the physical behaviour of students helps them understand that different situations call for different sets of acceptable behaviours.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Society has an obligation to promote the physical and sexual rights of adolescents in ways that are appropriate to their stage of maturity rather than seeking to impose unnecessary limitations on them \([p. 137](https://www.nswp.org/sites/default/files/body_politics_a_primer_on_criminalization_of_sexuality_and_reproduction.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Situational awareness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-28/how-to-hook-up-in-public-without-getting-in-trouble) is crucial to the understanding of what constitutes an acceptable PDA.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The ability to discern appropriate times and places for PDA is an essential component of [workplace decorum](https://adapture.com/romance-in-the-workplace-office-dating-etiquette-101/)(DON’T display physical signs of affection. It is easy for your emotions for your significant other to get the best of you and fog your judgement, but you need to refrain from showing physical signs of affection in the workplace. Public displays of affection could be seen as a sign of disrespect towards co-workers and could make others feel uncomfortable.) that students need to learn.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Schools should be concerned with establishing the same behaviours that will be expected of students when they graduate and enter the workforce.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: It is unreasonable to expect children to conform to the standards expected of adult professionals.
1.1.2. Pro: Students have to learn discipline and rigor at school.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Having the discipline and self-control to refrain from doing something like PDA, despite wanting to, is an important skill for any upstanding member of society.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Higher degrees of [self-control in childhood](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20110124/self-control-in-childhood-brings-adults-success#1) are associated with greater success later in life.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: [Personal empowerment](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/personal-empowerment.html) is equally important to student success. Disempowering students from making decisions about their social and romantic lives harms their ability to succeed.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: There are growing numbers of people who are unable to [show or receive affection](https://www.psychalive.org/why-people-respond-negatively-to-being-loved/) from others. Thus, schools that punish PDA contribute to this epidemic and harm society by depriving it of affectionate relationships.
1.1.2.2. Con: The primary objective of school is to educate students. Rigour and discipline are not the only ways to achieve this.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Attempting to impose rigour and discipline too strongly can cause students to rebel.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: A lack of childhood discipline is associated with [numerous problems](https://www.verywellfamily.com/surprising-reasons-why-we-need-to-discipline-children-620115)(Discipline is not only good for children, but it is also necessary for their happiness and well-being. Discipline is as vital for healthy child development as nutritious food, physical and cognitive exercises, love, and other basic needs. Without discipline, children lack the tools necessary to navigate relationships and challenges in life such as self-discipline, respect for others, and cooperating with peers.).
1.1.2.3. Con: Discipline and PDA are not mutually exclusive. Restricting PDA to an acceptable level is a form of discipline.
1.1.2.4. Con: A school that teaches children to be disciplined and restrained to the point of withholding the basic human instinct to show affection toward others is an institution that denies and erases their humanity.
1.1.3. Con: Education includes becoming familiar with concepts that are likely to affect everyday life, including showing affection for those you love. By allowing PDA, schools are allowing kids to be better prepared for adult life.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Displays of affection are commonplace in the real world, and learning to be able to deal with that is valuable for students on trajectory to work and live in that world.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Witnessing PDA is an [everyday occurrence](https://lancasteronline.com/features/pda-what-real-teens-think/article_919a5773-3438-5554-894c-73e2839fa4b9.html)(If you have recently been in a high school, \(or possibly a middle school\) or been to a shopping mall, park or turned on MTV you have more than likely seen multiple examples of public displays of affection \(PDA\). With so many people doing it, and how prevalent it is in the media, PDA seems like it is a normal teenage thing to do.) for adolescents in the US.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There are [many countries](https://blog.musement.com/us/around-the-world-in-public-displays-of-affection/) where PDA are considered completely inappropriate.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Many European cultures are incredibly [accepting](https://www.expatica.com/living/love/public-displays-of-affection-108636/)(To many outsiders, Europe can seem quite liberal when it comes to couples kissing and caressing in public places; that is, European couples seem to be flirting all the time, without everyone calling out for the couple to get a room.) of PDA.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: PDA often occur in many [films and TV series](https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword/?keywords=public-display-of-affection).
1.1.3.1.4. Con: PDA is also considered inappropriate in many workplaces as well. Since a student's job is to learn, limiting PDA in schools helps them understand how to act in a workplace as well.
1.1.3.2. Con: Adult life requires an understanding that some actions are not appropriate in given contexts. It is valuable for students to learn the difference between the educational environment in a classroom and the time in-between and after classes.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: This includes learning how to set, as well as follow, boundaries. Disallowing PDA is an excellent way of teaching this.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Maintaining a healthy relationship is an important life skill. Since some students don't get to see their significant other outside of school, they should have an opportunity to learn this skill within school.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: It is not the school's responsibility to worry about the extracurricular relationships and behaviours of students.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: School is the primary social environment for middle and high school students.
1.1.4. Pro: Many [school policies](https://www.emmustangs.org/handbook-conduct/)(School is NOT the place for students to display public affection for their romantic interests. School is a place for students to learn, concentrate, and should be as free from distraction as possible. Students holding hands, hugging, kissing, etc. are the most common behaviors staff address. Expression of affection is generally considered a personal behavior and has no place in school. Students are expected to show good taste and conduct themselves respectfully at times. Staff are to correct behaviors they believe are inappropriate in the school learning environment. Consequences vary based on age and behavior of students. Parents should also be contacted.) support the position that displays of affection have no place in school.
1.1.4.1. Con: Many school policies, such as the popular [zero-tolerance](https://www.verywellfamily.com/does-zero-tolerance-work-in-schools-620855) approach to bullying, have been recognised as being short-sighted and unreasonable.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Evidence shows that zero-tolerance policies are [not associated with improved behavioural and academic outcomes](https://supportiveschooldiscipline.org/zero-tolerance-policy) in schools.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Certain student behaviours cannot be accepted under any circumstances whatsoever.
1.1.4.2. Pro: If a school board determines that PDA between students are not appropriate, then allowing exceptions to the rule will undermine the authority of the board and the staff.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Making exceptions to established rules can create [uncertainty, jealousy and discontent](https://www.gone2korea.com/organize-your-classroom-and-reap-the-benefits-in-your-career/) amongst students.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Treating all students and situations equally is not always fair. Failing to address students and situations individually does not support student equity.
1.1.5. Con: This is not a black and white issue. There are types of PDA that would be appropriate in school and types that would not.
1.1.5.1. Con: Having a loose, blanket ban on PDA would allow for teachers and administrative staff to use their discretion in handling instances of PDA.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Loose rules about PDA will create a greater margin for human error and the potential for favouritism and discrimination.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Just as what is or is not acceptable can vary from culture to culture, it can also vary from individual to individual. This may lead to disagreement and conflict within the faculty.
1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: If some staff members are more lenient regarding PDA than others, it may be construed as creepy.
1.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: If situations arise in which a faculty member's judgement is called into question, this can help to clarify the correct interpretation and application of the rules and unify the faculty position.
1.1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Such an evolution and iterative approach to student management supposes that faculty would be open to change and aware of their misjudgements. This is not a given.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: A lack of clear guidelines would make it possible for a teacher with a strict interpretation to punish students for behaviours that other teachers previously identified as acceptable, or to judge individual students differently for the same behaviours .
1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: To be effective, rules should be clear and consistently applied.
1.1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: Looser guidelines would equally make it possible to use a less strict interpretation when appropriate.
1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: These problems can easily exist under any scenario; they are not more likely to occur because of loose guidelines.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Teachers and administrative staff could make situation-specific decisions that would be more contextually sensitive.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: This would require additional time and involvement from teachers and staff who have more important priorities, such as educational instruction.
1.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Individual decisions can be addressed in a way that takes the differences between students, situations, and contexts into account.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Specific types of PDA that are unacceptable should be enumerated, and everything else should be allowed.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Setting clear rules makes it easy for students to remember and understand what is expected.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The establishment of clear rules also allows for discussion and compromise if the student body finds a rule problematic.
1.1.5.2.1.2. Con: If the rules are not reasonable or are unenforceable then clarity does not matter, as they are unlikely to be followed.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Forcing real-life situations to conform to abstract rules can result in students being disciplined for otherwise innocuous behaviour.
1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Creating increasingly abstract rules could also lead to seemingly arbitrary punishment, as staff could appropriate rules to punish certain students for minor unconscious behaviour.
1.1.5.2.2.2. Con: Rules surrounding decency and PDA are rarely abstract, but rather based on social and cultural norms.
1.1.6. Con: The notion that there are "appropriate places for PDA" is a moralistic artifact of outdated puritanical values. Just as animals freely engage in PDA, regardless of where they are, so too should humans be able to express affection toward others.
1.2. Con: PDA in schools can distract students from their studies.
1.2.1. Pro: Students can be distracted by PDA between other students.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Overt PDA, such as hugging or kissing, is likely to attract attention from other students. In an educational setting, this diverts attention that would be better focused on studies.
1.2.1.2. Con: Learning to avoid or ignore distractions is a key life skill. Exposing students to distracting PDA could help them hone this skill.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: There are already [enough distractions](https://www.dyknow.com/blog/6-of-the-most-common-classroom-distractions/) in school that students must learn to avoid.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Research on the optimal learning conditions for students indicates that the majority of students are able to successfully adapt to common distractions \([p. 4-5](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1152622.pdf)(Optimal learning conditions research points toward students remaining fully absorbed in the material and to\navoiding distractions to achieve deeper level understanding. Although most students are able to ignore the\nnegative conditions in the classroom, there are some types of students for whom this could become problematic, such as nontraditional students, underprepared students, and\nstudents with learning disabilities.)\)
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: As discussed in the source above, distractions in the classroom are problematic for some types of students.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: The ability for students to adapt and cope with distractions does not absolve school authorities of their duty to minimize distraction in a learning environment.
1.2.2. Con: It is possible for students to publicly display affection in ways that do not disrupt the class.
1.2.2.1. Con: There are plenty of other spaces and opportunities to show affection outside the classroom.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Affection can be communicated through various non-physical means, for example, through eye contact.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Just because non-physical PDAs can occur does not mean that they are preferable over physical contact. Students will likely still partake in physical PDAs.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Although couples may prefer physical means of showing affection, other bystanders may prefer that they refrain from it, and rely on non-physical PDA.
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: As long as the action is not disruptive there is no reason to prefer one over the other.
1.2.3. Con: Although it is possible for students to be distracted by PDA in school, PDA often go unnoticed by others.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Many PDA are small, harmless signs of affection that only hold interest for those involved.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Hand-holding, for example, is a small and harmless action which could fall under the definition of PDA.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Adolescents are very [curious about sexual topics](https://www.mentalhelp.net/adolescent-development/sexuality/), and are likely to be distracted by even small, insignificant PDA.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Many students are too involved with their own affairs to pay attention to PDA between other students.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: School is a busy and highly engaging place. Students must balance their social lives, studies and co-curricular activities together. Therefore, it is unlikely that students can pay attention to the PDA of others.
1.2.3.3. Con: The instances of PDA that go unnoticed do not matter, as they are for all intents and purposes not public, as they are not observed by others.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: A PDA in school could be observed by another student and thus be a [public](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/public)(1: exposed to general view) act, yet fail to qualify as [noticeable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/noticeable)(1: worthy of notice\n\n2: likely to be noticed) if it is not interesting or unusual to them.
1.2.4. Pro: Allowing PDA in school can lead to students paying attention to their significant others rather than to their lessons.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Schools ought to foster an environment that is as conducive to learning as possible by removing potential distractions.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Just as [phone usage](https://theconversation.com/banning-mobile-phones-in-schools-can-improve-students-academic-performance-this-is-how-we-know-153792)(We found banning mobile phones at school leads to an increase in student performance. Our results suggest that after schools banned mobile phones, test scores of students aged 16 increased by 6.4% of a standard deviation. This is equivalent to adding five days to the school year or an additional hour a week.\n\nThe effects were twice as large for low-achieving students, and we found no impact on high achieving students.\n\nOur results suggest low-performing students are more likely to be distracted by the presence of mobile phones, while high performing students can focus with or without mobile phones.\n\nThe results of our paper suggest banning mobile phones has considerable benefits including a reduction in the gap between high- and low- achieving students. This is substantial improvement for a low-cost education policy.) is not allowed in many schools because it distracts from learning, PDA should also be prohibited.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Many teachers have found cell phones to be a [valuable educational tool](https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/using-smartphones-classroom).
1.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: There is a difference between staff utilizing cell phones as learning tools and students' personal cell phone use, which can distract from school work.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: It is impossible to remove some natural distractions. Just as schools cannot effectively ban students from daydreaming, they cannot effectively ban students from displaying affection to one another.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: Some schools in China have [installed webcams in classrooms and schools with live public streaming](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/asia/in-china-daydreaming-students-are-caught-on-camera.html) of the footage to discourage students from misbehaving and daydreaming during class. The same approach could be employed for PDA.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Live-streaming images of children in school comes with a number of privacy and child-safety concerns.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Giving the public access to images of children and young adults in school could make them vulnerable to targeting for exploitation and pedophilia.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is highly unlikely that individuals would watch a live-stream of a class full of children for the purposes of innocent entertainment.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Giving parents access to a live stream of their child at school helps them protect their child's interests.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is an example of overbearing helicopter parenting, which can lead to [increased childhood anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism.](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/72823)
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Instead of relying upon word of mouth evidence in bullying or teaching issues, parents could use the live stream data to better navigate such problems.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Opening the private lives of students, teachers and other school staff to the general public is a violation of their right to privacy.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Schools are [public](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/access-public-property)(However, some public property, even though it is open only for limited purposes, can take on the attributes of a public forum discussed above. A classic example of this type of property is public schools and universities.), not private, environments.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Although many schools are publically funded, they are not open to the public. If a random member of the public could not enter a school during the school day, then they should not be allowed to anonymously watch schoolchildren via livestream.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Under US law, the use of security cameras in classrooms is [not a violation of privacy](https://www.rhombussystems.com/blog/are-security-cameras-allowed-in-school-classrooms-and-are-they-legal/)(General video surveillance laws in the U.S. allow monitoring and recording in areas where there is no “reasonable expectation of privacy”. This is the most important thing to keep in mind when installing cameras and is a useful rule of thumb to follow.).
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Despite laws to the contrary, students and teachers should be able to expect reasonable privacy in the classroom. Security cameras in the classroom invade this privacy as they constitute an [unreasonable search](https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology)(Technological innovation has outpaced our privacy protections. As a result, our digital footprint can be tracked by the government and corporations in ways that were once unthinkable.\n\nThis digital footprint is constantly growing, containing more and more data about the most intimate aspects of our lives. This includes our communications, whereabouts, online searches, purchases, and even our bodies. When the government has easy access to this information, we lose more than just privacy and control over our information. Free speech, security, and equality suffer as well.\n...\nAmericans should not have to choose between using new technologies and protecting their civil liberties. We work to ensure a future in which the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches extends to digital property and your data is your own.).
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Live stream data could be anonymized, so that children and staff are protected.
1.2.4.1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Anonymizing the streams would remove much of the incentive for behaving appropriately by reducing the social pressure from viewers.
1.2.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: The positive effects of monitoring students for undesirable behaviour are more important than the associated ethical concerns.
1.2.4.1.3.2. Pro: Because PDA are a normal part of children's lives, it would be impossible to eliminate them completely by any means.
1.2.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: In many societies, children are regularly exposed to PDA [between their parents](https://www.smartparenting.com.ph/parenting/toddler/public-display-of-affection-in-front-of-kids-a00286-20190408)(You don't give hugging and kissing your child a second thought, but engaging in public displays of affection \(PDA\) with his dad shouldn't make you think twice either. Although your lambing with your significant other — maybe you hold hands, compliment each other openly, or even hug and kiss — becomes embarrassing for your kids as they become a tween or teen, ignore them. Experts say engaging in PDA in front of your kids might actually be helpful for them.) and on [television](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17482791003629628?journalCode=rchm20)(Television serves as a primary socialization factor for young children who can model many viewed behaviors. Results show that physical affection among family members is common in such programming and free of gender differences in terms of initiating affection.).
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Social and romantic relationships have been identified as a significant source of [classroom distractions](https://www.learningliftoff.com/5-school-stressors-that-interfere-with-learning/)(Some students become unusually preoccupied and stressed about relationship dramas—especially if the object of their affection is in their class—and that takes a toll on learning.).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Students are more likely to be distracted by those with whom they have physically intimate relationships.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: The nature of monogamous relationships will lead to students fixating their attention on a single partner. This can lead to said partner becoming a distraction for them in school.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Students in relationships will likely spend a large amount of time together already. This will make it easier for them to direct attention to a short lesson as opposed to their significant other.
1.2.4.3. Con: Banning PDA won't make students stop thinking about them. In fact, it may have the opposite effect, since PDA would thereby become a forbidden fruit.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Banning PDA would add an extra element of risk and excitement to the act, therefore making it more attractive to rebellious teens.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Under the same logic it would be unwise to enforce any rules in school, as doing so may make breaking the rules more attractive. Banning cell phone usage generally works, as would banning PDA.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: Many schools have had greater success with [setting clear boundaries and guidelines](https://www.edweek.org/technology/schools-say-no-to-cellphones-in-class-but-is-it-a-smart-move/2019/09)(Kline emphasized that by absolutely prohibiting cellphones, districts could miss out on an opportunity to teach their students how to use the devices responsibly and in moderation.\n\n“There are moments at school or at home that should be device-free moments,” Kline said. “Letting kids go wild with no norms or rules is not the right thing to do. Both extremes are missing the point.”) for cell phone usage in school than with total bans. The same approach may work well with PDA.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Con: Rather than supporting the complete absence of rules, an understanding of taboo and transgression supports the use of total bans sparingly, since transgressive acts are empowered in proportion to the extent they are forbidden \([p. 8-9](https://tud.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A35316/attachment/ATT-0/)(Summarising, taboos can be conceptualised as what is unsayable, unspeakable and undoable – most often connected to acts of violence, sexuality or consumption. While some taboos are perceptible on a linguistic surface level \(e.g. swear words, cf. Jay 2009, or the explicit reference to death, cf. Hänggi/Diederich 2017, or euphemism in general, cf. Hägi-Mead 2018\), others are located at deeper levels of social structure. They can be either regarded as a protective social device or as an exclusionary mechanism. Similarly, the transgression of taboos can be experienced as liberating or, contrarily, as damaging, depending on the aim or motivation underlying the act of\ntransgression.)\).
1.2.4.3.2.3. Pro: Schools have already become too heavily regulated, and this has led a [decline in student respect](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/23/respect-schools-teachers-parents-students/4789283/) for school authorities.
1.2.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: School administrations should pursue holistic, [relationship-based management](https://www.relationshipbasedschools.com/pagepd) techniques as opposed to heavy-handed regulation.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: Humans are often inherently [attracted to forbidden things](https://www.siefhome.org/congresses/sief2021/theme)(“We always long for the forbidden things, and desire what is denied us.” – François Rabelais), as transgressing rules is frequently associated with a feeling of personal power.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: PDA between students may represent a [healthy navigation](https://www.tarshi.net/inplainspeak/pda-slippery-slope-from-law-to-moral-policing/) between socially prescribed behaviour and body autonomy.
1.2.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Perceptions of public affection vary widely between societies. [Some cultures](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/9-places-where-you-dont-want-to-be-caught-kissing/) forbid affection in ways that some people may consider restrictive or unreasonable.
1.2.4.3.3.2. Con: The benefits created by banning PDA in school are more important than the psychological effects on the students of doing so.
1.2.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: Maintaining the focus on academic study and context-appropriate behaviour should be the primary goal of rules about PDA.
1.2.4.3.3.2.2. Con: It is essential that schools contribute to the psychological and emotional development of students, so reasonable forms of PDA should be allowed.
1.2.4.3.3.3. Con: If breaking rules can be empowering, then it may be useful to ban PDA for the purposes of allowing students to break a harmless rule. This can safely allow them to channel feelings of rebellion and feel personally empowered.
1.2.4.3.3.3.1. Con: Making harmless rules in order to let students feel empowered by breaking them encourages students to explore rulebreaking and hold less respect for rules in general. It would be better to set reasonable rules that students would not be tempted to break.
1.3. Con: PDA in school can make people uncomfortable.
1.3.1. Con: As long as the behaviour falls within the range of what is considered acceptable, the comfort level of others is irrelevant.
1.3.1.1. Pro: There are everyday situations that fall within the bounds of socially acceptable behaviour that some people find offensive.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Some people are also offended by displays of affection on [television or film](https://inallthings.org/we-dont-have-a-tv/)(The big problems with sex and the media are: \n\n1. Our medium is inherently communicating instant, convenient, and customizable sex \(an impossibility\). \n\n2. Something designed to be known through intimate, trusting relationships is treated like a commodity and put on public display. \n\n3. Sex is portrayed and associated with concrete images \(in film and photos\) that naturally necessitate comparison and contrast but are kept separate from true relationship.).
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Any behaviour that is offensive should be disallowed.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This is at odds with the values of a modern society, as individuals do not have a [right to not be offended](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/02/the-right-not-to-be-offended/)(Are you sure it’s healthy to live in a world where tyrannical oppression is assumed to exist within all social disagreements, careless verbal slights, and thoughtless cracks? This worldview seems like a prison so impenetrable, no legal right or government can spring you from it.).
1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: In order to create a caring civil society, it should not be permitted for one person to offend another.
1.3.1.2. Con: There are many behaviours that are allowable that would still be completely inappropriate in public. Students should be sensitive to the comfort of others.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Understanding and accommodating the viewpoints of others is an important exercise in empathy and compassion, and ought to be part of educational thinking.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Students are obligated to obey the established rules; beyond this, they are not obligated to conform to others' conceptions of politeness or appropriateness.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: It is wrong to expect young adults who are still developing a sense of identity to conform to the nebulous and undefinable standard of what may or may not make others comfortable.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: The idea that students should only participate in behaviours that will not offend anyone is unsupportable.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: Adolescents can, and often do, challenge social norms in ways that may be constructive despite being offensive to some.
1.3.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In 2018, thousands of students participated in a nationwide school walkout to [protest against gun violence in US schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/school-walkout.html), despite offending some gun rights activists.
1.3.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Research supports the idea that oppositional student behaviour is associated with resistance to increasingly authoritarian school culture \([p. 36](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344327757_DISCOURSES_OF_OPPOSITION_AND_RESISTANCE_IN_EDUCATION_Alternative_Spaces_for_a_Militant_Pedagogy)\).
1.3.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Adolescents were key in the creation and popularization of the punk movement, which had a lasting impact on [film, fashion, music and visual arts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture)
1.3.1.2.3.1.4. Con: The acceptance and popularisation of being edgy by challenging certain norms has encouraged many young men to become involved in the [alt-right](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/do-you-have-white-teenage-sons-listen-up-how-white-supremacists-are-recruiting-boys-online/2019/09/17/f081e806-d3d5-11e9-9343-40db57cf6abd_story.html)(Schroeder described the onslaught of racist, sexist and homophobic memes that had inundated her kids’ social media accounts unbidden, and the way those memes — packaged as irreverent, “edgy” humor — can indoctrinate children into the world of alt-right extremism and white supremacy.).
1.3.2. Pro: PDA can make other students uncomfortable.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Adolescents of the same age may have drastically [different levels of maturity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28482854/).
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Physically, girls begin puberty [earlier than boys](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/stages-of-puberty-what-happens-to-boys-and-girls/)(The average age for girls to begin puberty is 11, while for boys the average age is 12.).
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Individuals also undergo puberty at different rates, beginning between the [ages of 8-14](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/stages-of-puberty-what-happens-to-boys-and-girls/)(It's completely normal for puberty to begin at any point from the ages of 8 to 14. The process can take up to 4 years.).
1.3.2.1.3. Con: The immaturity of classmates is not a valid reason to restrict student social behaviour.
1.3.2.2. Pro: It is unethical to allow behaviours in school that make children uncomfortable.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Children are not given a choice whether to attend school or not.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Certain academic topics might make [some children uncomfortable](https://bruinvoice.net/2449/opinion/procon-should-students-be-excused-from-lessons-that-make-them-uncomfortable/), yet such subjects remain part of the curriculum. For example, some students may be uncomfortable learning about human reproduction, sensitive political issues, or domestic violence, particularly if the lessons contradict what they have learned at home.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: There is a difference between confronting children with uncomfortable realities in an educational setting and allowing children to be made uncomfortable by the socio-sexual behaviour of their peers.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Learning to handle discomfort is an important life skill. Just because something makes an individual uncomfortable does not mean that it is harming them.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Children should be able to feel completely comfortable in school.
1.3.2.3. Con: Individuals' degree of comfort with PDA can vary wildly, even amongst adults. A student's lack of comfort is not an accurate indicator of what is appropriate.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: Schools should meet students where they are. As long as it is within a reasonable range, schools should protect the least comfortable within the system.
1.3.3. Con: Regulating PDA can arouse biases against women and the LGBTQ+ community.
1.3.3.1. Con: Studies have shown that predominantly heterosexual study groups are least comfortable when viewing PDA involving transgender and gay/lesbian people \([p. 44-45](https://journalofpositivesexuality.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reactions-to-Homosexual-Transgender-Heterosexual-Public-Displays-of-Affection-Buck-Lange-Sackett-Edlund.pdf)(Across three studies, we also demonstrated that lesbian and gay PDA is indeed seen less positively than heterosexual displays of PDA. In our third study, we demonstrated that participants perceive transgender PDA with the least amount of comfort. The finding that transgender PDA is rated\nlowest in comfort among participants is especially noteworthy given that the content of the videos did not change, just information pertaining to the actors in the video \(suggesting that it is the participants’ personal views towards sexuality that matter\).\n\nHomophobia was associated with negativity in response to these displays of PDA amongst sexual minorities, which is in line with previous researchers’ findings when examining attitudes toward displays of homosexual relationships and sex.)\)
1.3.3.1.1. Con: It is demeaning and discriminatory to bar PDA because it may make some prejudiced people uncomfortable.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Allowing PDA may inflame transphobic or homophobic sentiment and endanger such individuals in school.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Barring PDA creates the possibility of discrimination against LGBTQ+ students by teachers and classmates.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: If PDA is universally banned, then there can be no discrimination.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Discrimination can also exist in the enforcement and outcomes of a rule. Even if PDA is universally banned, the rules and consequences can still be applied in discriminatory ways.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: In a heteronormative environment, such as the average middle or high school, banning PDA can [disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ students and reinforce harmful heteronorms.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2013.819221)(This article concludes that the lack of discursive resistance denies the possibility of re-signification and subversion even in LGBQ discourses. This clearly indicates the pervasiveness of discourses reiterating heteronorms, even those issued by those most oppressed by such norms.)
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Religiosity and conservatism are the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards same-sex relationships \([p. 35](https://journalofpositivesexuality.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reactions-to-Homosexual-Transgender-Heterosexual-Public-Displays-of-Affection-Buck-Lange-Sackett-Edlund.pdf)(A prevalent misbelief in the United States is that negative views of homosexuality are tied to age, with the younger generations holding more accepting views than older groups. Olson and DeSouza \(2017\) found that religiosity and identifying as a political conservative remain the strongest influence on feelings toward sexual minorities, as opposed to age. Many religions condemn same-sex pairings, which influences the attitudes of a religion’s followers \(Hubbard,\n2001\).)\). LGBTQ+ students in conservative or religious schools may face further discrimination or ostracisation under restrictive PDA rules.
1.3.3.3. Pro: In India, [protests about PDA](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/the-politics-of-pda-in-india-kiss-protest/382877/)(Moral policing is mostly about defending traditional control over women and not so much about public decency, whose limits change over time.” Kissing could be both a blessing and a curse for India’s women: Some have used the Kiss of Love protests to demand gender equality, but the demonstrations have also reportedly elicited online rape threats.) have been associated with online rape threats.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: India has a pervasive issue with [rape and rape threats](https://america.cgtn.com/2021/08/30/how-india-can-stop-its-rape-crisis)(Four men ranging in age from 48-63 were arrested, including a priest, for rape, murder, and destroying evidence as well as committing crimes against a child and a caste-based crime.\n\nAfter the public outcry, the case was fast tracked, politicians visited with the parents, top lawyers are now representing them, and the family as given compensation.\n\nAnd then, just 10 days later, a 6-year-old girl – also in Delhi – was allegedly raped by her neighbor and another man.\n\n“Every morning, I open the newspaper online and the first thing I’m looking at is rape stories,” said women’s rights activist Shruti Kapoor.). It is not representative of the majority of the world.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: This issue is not confined to India. Violence against women who fail to comply with norms about PDA has been documented in many countries, including [Turkey](https://books.google.com/books?id=9sMpEAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA188&ots=HaTiRFqwa6&dq=%22public%20displays%20of%20affection%22%20%22against%20women%22&pg=PA188#v=onepage&q=%22public%20displays%20of%20affection%22%20%22against%20women%22&f=false)(Indeed, women have been violently assaulted over the last few years for no other reason than wearing shorts, walking in the supermarket, smoking cigarettes, sitting cross-legged in public, engaging in public displays of affection and exercising in parks.), [Indonesia](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3028148/three-couples-whipped-over-public-displays-affection)(On Thursday, a masked sharia officer rained down between 20 and 22 strokes from a rattan cane each on three men and three women caught behaving amorously.\nThey had all served several months in prison.\n\nOne woman winced and fell over from the painful punishment, which was carried out in front of a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.), and [Morocco](https://www.growthinktank.org/en/womens-condition-in-the-maghreb/)(Nadia Naïr, a teacher at the University of Tetouan, explains that this frustration is mainly linked to the fact that in these countries “relations outside marriage, adultery and homosexuality are punished with imprisonment.”\n...\nWe no longer dare to speak of love, public displays of affection are not encouraged, all this has gradually become aib, taboo, and all these phenomena promote this frustration.), to name a few.
1.3.4. Pro: Some parents may not be comfortable with their child participating in PDA in school.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Since many middle school- and high school-aged children are [not legally capable of consent](https://www.ageofconsent.net/states), parents may be concerned that PDA between children can easily cross the line into [illegal behaviour](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/criminal-defense/is-sex-between-minors-a-crime/)(Statutory rape does not require any evidence of force or coercion; a person is guilty simply by performing a sexual act with a minor below the age of consent. Depending on the state, the age of consent can be as low as 16 years of age, while others set the limit at 17 \(e.g., Texas\) or 18 \(e.g., California\).\n\nIn general, when two minors under the age of consent engage in "consensual" sex with one another, they are both open to statutory rape charges.).
1.3.4.2. Con: Such parents would equally object to PDA outside of school. Banning PDA in school does not solve the problem.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Even if PDAs are occurring outside of school, this does not absolve the school of the responsibility for maintaining the in-school environment.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: A parent could be opposed to their child participating in PDA in school on the grounds that the context is inappropriate, yet still be comfortable with PDA in more appropriate locations.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: If a parent objects to their child participating in PDA on the grounds that the the physical contact itself is unacceptable, then the location is irrelevant.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Parents from certain religions, such as Islam, may not be comfortable with many PDAs.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Muslim parents may not be comfortable with their child [touching the opposite sex](https://medium.com/\@hana.jafar09/why-you-should-ask-before-hugging-someone-7825f503ac06)(As a Muslim woman, part of practicing my faith means that I wear a hijab, and don’t shake hands with, or hug anyone of the opposite sex.).
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Conservative Christian or Muslim parents may not be comfortable with their children participating in or witnessing same-sex PDA.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: The religious schooling and compliance of a child is the responsibility of their parents. If they do not want their child to participate in PDA then that is their concern.
1.3.4.4. Con: Parental comfort is not, nor should it be, the end-all, be-all of school policy.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: Parental comfort is a primary determiner of policy when dealing with children who are below the age of legal consent.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: The vast majority of middle and high school students are still minors. Therefore parental input in their educational environment is highly relevant.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: The decisions of the school and of the children themselves are as important as the comfort level of the parents.
1.3.4.4.3. Con: Parents have the right to raise their children how they like, and have the duty to speak for their child. If a parent is uncomfortable with situations that affect their child then this should be respected.
1.3.4.5. Con: I think it is the child's choice to decide if he want to show his affection with another kid while being at school.Parents should not have their words on the relationships of their kids.Surely they can give them advices on what to do and what not to do but they can't force them to act how they want.
1.3.4.6. Con: PDA should remain optional. If a parent feels uncomfortable with their child physically showing affection, then they can discourage it.
1.3.4.6.1. Con: Although a parent may discourage their child from engaging in PDA during school, this does not prevent the child from going against the parent's wishes. The school bears the ultimate responsibility for controlling the educational environment.
1.3.4.6.2. Pro: This would allow parents with different attitudes towards PDA to encourage their children to behave in ways they find appropriate.
1.3.5. Pro: Many adults are [uncomfortable with public displays of affection](https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/psychological-reasons-behind-pda/1603821).
1.3.5.1. Con: Many adults have grown up in restrictive, conservative environments where children were not allowed to show affection publicly. Allowing PDA would break this chain.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: What is restrictive to one person may be religiously or morally correct to another. Allowing PDA undermines some traditional values and conservative parenting methods.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Children are incredibly important in molding future societal values. If a more open and affectionate society is desirable, then we should start with allowing children to show PDA in their school environment.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Teachers may be uncomfortable with witnessing and adjudicating PDA between students.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: It is inappropriate to expect teachers to work in an environment where they may witness PDA amongst underage teens.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: Dealing with the social behaviour of students is a normal part of teaching.
1.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: Teachers dealing with younger students or students with intellectual and physical disabilities are often forced to deal with the physical and emotional needs of the children. Compared to this, occasionally witnessing PDA is not a big deal.
1.3.5.2.2.2. Con: Considering the potential for allegations of abuse or sexual impropriety, it is unreasonable to expect teachers to witness and adjudicate potentially sexual interactions between students.
1.4. Pro: PDA can have positive psychosocial effects on students.
1.4.1. Pro: PDA in school provide significant opportunities for healthy adolescent [social development](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-3588.2005.00365.x)(Peer interaction provides children and adolescents with an opportunity to evaluate themselves, develop an understanding of themselves and others, while also providing a space in which to explore behaviours, beliefs and values.).
1.4.1.1. Pro: Banning PDA would deprive students of the opportunity to gain social experience and become aware of what is or is not appropriate.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Middle and high school are important venues for [social learning](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/middle-and-high-school-students-need-social-emotional-learning-too-are-they-getting-it/2021/10)(Even in normal times, the journey through grades 6-12 can be fraught for students, but the pandemic has made it especially complicated as many are struggling with more anxiety, depression, grief, uncertainty, and loneliness. These emotions get in the way of students being able to process and learn new information—just as schools are pushing to make up for lost learning time.\n\nThat’s why experts in social-emotional learning and child development say the secondary school years are a crucial time to focus on teaching skills, such as responsible decisionmaking, emotional management, and nurturing relationships.), as well as academic study.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Following [social learning theory](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/guide-social-learning-theory-education2005.html#close)(Simply put, social learning theory is the idea that children learn from observing others. This learning can be acted on, a child sees a sibling politely ask for a treat and get one, or not acted on, a teenager hears a friend talking picking a lock and they learn something new, but don’t try it themselves. Especially when it comes to aggressive behavior, social learning theory plays a big role in how all people and especially children learn. \n\n...\n\nTeachers have found that social modeling and examples are a very powerful tool in education. If children see positive consequences from an action, they are likely to do that action themselves. And if they see negative consequences, they are likely to avoid that behavior. Unique, novel, and different situations often catch a student’s attention and can stand out to them.), allowing PDA might encourage other students to engage in it, as children learn from one another.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Students are already made aware of the effects and dangers of [peer pressure](https://www.accreditedschoolsonline.org/resources/peer-pressure/)(Young people especially may struggle to cope with varying forms and degrees of peer pressure—whether it's keeping up with middle school fashion trends or being subjected to hazing in a fraternity house. Peer pressure can be a powerful force, but fortunately, increased awareness has led to numerous resources to help students, parents and educators manage it effectively.) in relation to social issues such as bullying or drugs. There is no reason why PDA cannot be included in this education.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Allowing for PDA could create a more open, affectionate and emotionally healthy environment.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Affection and friendship have a place in the educational system. PDA can also be based on [friendship and camaraderie](https://sexinfoonline.com/pda-public-displays-of-affection/#Different_Forms_of_PDA)(PDA can also exist between platonic friends and family members. Kissing \(either on the lips or on the cheek\), hugging, hand holding, and cuddling are common public displays of affection within these relationships as well. As with romantic and sexual relationships, PDA amongst friends and family acts as a way to bond and show affection towards one another.).
1.4.1.2.2. Con: The primary purpose of school is [to study and learn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2021/04/15/begin-with-the-end-whats-the-purpose-of-schooling/), not to become more affectionate and open.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The academic world does not have a monopoly on study and learning. Schools ought to encourage students to study [health and wellness](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2021/04/15/begin-with-the-end-whats-the-purpose-of-schooling/)(As schools come back from a challenging time thanks to the pandemic, students will have a variety of differing challenges around their social and emotional wellbeing as well as their more basic health and wellness. Although there’s an argument around whether schools should be involved in these areas, for students to learn effectively, if they aren’t in a sound state in their wellbeing or health, learning will be challenging at best—which means it will land in the domain of schools.), and to become physically and [emotionally healthy adults](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2021/04/15/begin-with-the-end-whats-the-purpose-of-schooling/)(If the goal of school is not just to ensure students are prepared academically but also that they have access to good life opportunities and careers, then relationships will also be critical. As Julia Freeland Fisher argues in her book, “Who You Know,” in today’s world, schools need to be part engage in this activity. After building a baseline of academic knowledge and skills, who you know often trumps what you know in life.).
1.4.1.2.2.2. Pro: It is the responsibility of parents to teach their children about personal matters such as affection and emotion.
1.4.1.3. Pro: PDA signals to other students that a student is in a romantic relationship, thus avoiding confusion and awkwardness about the relationship status.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: PDA act as [nonverbal cues](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/interpersonal-relationships/nonverbal-cues/) and serve a valuable social function by identifying students in a relationship as taken and thereby avoiding conflict.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The usage of subtle, non-verbal cues can remove the need for verbal confrontation, which may lead to awkwardness or conflict.
1.4.1.3.1.2. Con: Nonverbal cues are [easily misinterpreted](https://www.ehow.co.uk/info_8372689_verbal-communication-can-sometimes-misinterpreted.html).
1.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: What one student considers to be a nonverbal cue indicating that a student is taken could be interpreted as an assertion of dominance or gloating by another.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: PDA can also be a [sign of jealousy and insecurity](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/what-constant-pda-reveals-about-your-relationship-according-to-experts-9227462)(“Some people show PDA because they’re feeling insecure in their relationship,” says Cobb. And when that happens, you will see an imbalance of PDA as one partner tries to use is it as a way to kickstart the connection. “When one partner is feeling jealous or insecure then they might show more PDA to silently convince their partner of their feelings. To let their partner know that they love, want, desire them.") between partners.
1.4.1.4. Con: Beliefs about what constitutes healthy development of physical intimacy in adolescents are heavily [influenced by gender and ethnicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694320/)(Whereas the review findings suggest that monitoring is protective against sexual risk behavior for most adolescents \(but slightly more protective for ethnic minority boys’ sexual risk behavior\), the amount of parental warmth and emotional connection experienced within the parent–child context appears to be an especially salient protective factor for adolescent girls. The results of this review maintain that gender is an important moderator of the association between parenting and adolescent sexual risk behavior.).
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Parents and administrators may hold biased views about what constitutes acceptable behaviour for children across different genders and ethnicities.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: Research has shown that [attitudes towards PDA can vary](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12822051_Public_Displays_of_Affection_among_Asian_and_Latino_Heterosexual_Couples)(Some support was found for the notion that interactants from "contact" cultures, e.g., Latin America, are more contact-prone than those from "noncontact" cultures, e.g., Asia. Specifically, Latino male-female dyads were more likely to embrace while walking in public than Asian male-female dyads.) dramatically between ethnicities.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: Holding specific genders or ethnicities to different rules about PDA is inherently discriminatory.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: There are significant [disparities in teen pregnancy](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/social-determinants-disparities-teen-pregnancy.htm#disparities) rates across different ethnic and geographic groups. Addressing this issue and the [associated social inequality](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/teen-pregnancy-prevention.aspx)(Only about half of teen mothers earn a high school diploma by age 22, compared to 90 percent of women without a teen birth. Teenage mothers are also more likely to live in poverty and depend on public assistance. Children born to teen parents are more likely to have lower school achievement, enter the child welfare and correctional systems, drop out of high school and become teen parents themselves, compared to children born to older parents. \n\nTeen births also create significant costs to taxpayers and states. The average cost nationally to provide medical and economic support during pregnancy and the first year of infancy is $16,000 per teen birth) may necessitate targeted interventions.
1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Interventions to reduce HIV infection have identified [stigma about PDA between homosexual men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6884342/)(We explicitly address macro-level issues in the group sessions when participants engage in discussions of personal experiences of minority stress and its impact on their relationships \(Frost & Meyer, 2009; Rostosky et al., 2007\). Common examples include concerns about coming out as a couple \(e.g., bringing a same-gender partner to family events makes one’s sexual-minority orientation more visible\), or discrimination experienced by one or both partners that impact the relationship. \n...\nThis example illustrates how societal stigma and family acceptance can impact sexual-minority couples, and how micro-level interventions such as encouraging the use of effective communication, problem solving, and acceptance skills can help couples identify ways to cope with macro-level factors that they may be unable to control.) as a source of minority stress contributing to unsafe sexual practices.
1.4.2. Con: Allowing PDA could further alienate lonely or depressed students.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Students dealing with loneliness could face reminders of their troubles through witnessing PDA amongst their peers.
1.4.2.2. Con: Students should not be obligated to refrain from otherwise acceptable PDA based on an uninvolved student's emotional status.
1.4.3. Con: Overt gestures of affection may inspire jealousy or envy in other students, causing disruption in the school community.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Religious schools may have an even greater interest in avoiding jealousy and envy, as [many religions view these as sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jealousy_in_religion).
1.4.3.2. Con: Students will see PDA and more generally experience jealousy outside of school, so they must learn to tolerate and deal with it. This can be done through exposure in school.
1.4.4. Pro: There are many [positive psychological benefits](https://www.heysigmund.com/the-remarkable-power-of-touch/) of affectionate human touch.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Human touch has been demonstrated to reduce depression and cortisol levels while elevating serotonin levels in adolescents, thereby [reducing self-destructive behaviour and ideation](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-07671-006).
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: [Depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3488279/)(Unipolar depressive disorder is a common mental health problem in adolescents worldwide, with an estimated 1 year prevalence of 4–5% in mid to late adolescence. Depression in adolescents is a major risk factor for suicide, the second-to-third leading cause of death in this age group, with more than half of adolescent suicide victims reported to have a depressive disorder at time of death. Depression also leads to serious social and educational impairments, and an increased rate of smoking, substance misuse, and obesity. Thus, to recognise and treat this disorder is important.) is a common mental health issue in adolescents.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: As discussed in the study above, these benefits can easily be achieved outside the school in ways that are less problematic, such as via massage therapy.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: If the benefits can be achieved through regular social behaviour, then they should be obtained in this manner as opposed to artificially.
1.4.4.1.2.2. Con: Massage therapy can be [prohibitively expensive](https://jsterlings.com/massage-spa-services-expensive/), and is often not covered under US insurance plans.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Banning PDA in school is not banning human touch in general; it is a matter of educational administration. Teenagers can still engage in physical touch and PDA on their own time.
1.4.4.2. Con: Even though affectionate touch may offer psychological benefits to students, this does not mean that it is appropriate in school.
1.4.5. Pro: Many LGBTQ+ students may come from [unaccepting or unsafe home conditions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-lgbt-trfn-idUSKBN22O2S6)(According to research conducted by the U.S.-based gay social network Hornet for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, 30% of almost 3,500 respondents, which included transgender men, said they felt physically or emotionally unsafe in their own homes.\n\n“Think of how it feels to be 21 years old and living with a family that is unsupportive and constantly haranguing you about marrying a woman,” said Alex Garner, senior health innovation strategist at Hornet.\n\n“We have to challenge ourselves to think of how to support people in environments where they feel unsafe.”), and are only able to express themselves and be who they are in the safety of the school environment.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Banning PDA in school may be removing the only element of sexual and emotional freedom that young LGBTQ+ individuals have in their lives.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: The sexual and emotional freedom of middle and high school students is the responsibility of their parents, not the school.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: There has been an increase in awareness of the need for school-based interventions that support [gender equality](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/internationaldevelopment/2019/02/12/promoting-gender-equality-in-through-schools-examples-to-learn-from/)(To stop the perpetuation of gender inequality through schools as well as to address its existence in the society at large, initiatives to promote gender equality in and through schools are imperative. Schools have enormous potential to effect change in gender relations, views and practices vis-a-vis gender, and create a gender-sensitive and gender-equal generation of men and women.).
1.4.5.2. Con: In order to avoid discrimination, decisions about the acceptability of PDA in school should be irrespective of student gender or sexual orientation.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: Discrimination can, and often does, occur regardless of what the rules suggest. It is essential to consider how PDA policy will affect different genders to avoid discriminatory practices.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Creating a unilateral, consistent set of rules would reinforce equality in schools and make it difficult or impossible to favour different genders.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Con: A unilateral set of rules would harmfully ignore the physical, emotional and societal differences between the genders.
1.4.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Research has shown a strong correlation between gender and the frequency and type of touching behaviour \([p. 21](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246292651_Gender_Patterns_in_Touching_Behavior)(In summary, gender differences in touching patterns occur soon after birth and continue throughout adulthood. Same-sex touching is more frequent among school-aged children, while cross-sex touching is more prevalent among adults. Data from both self-report studies and observational studies of children's and adults' touch interactions consistently demonstrate that women and girls are touched more than men or boys. Data on which gender is more likely to initiate touch, however, are less clear-cut. It appears that in same-sex encounters, females are somewhat more likely to initiate touch than are males. That is, female-female touch is slightly more frequent than male-male touch. In contrast, in cross-sex encounters, men are overwhelmingly more likely to touch women than women are to touch men.)\). A unilateral set of rules about PDA would not take into account the different ways that touch functions in interactions across genders \([p. 21-22](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246292651_Gender_Patterns_in_Touching_Behavior)(Heslin \(1974\) identified five meanings that can be ascribed to touch, depending on the nature of the relationship in which it occurs: \(1\) functional/professional. where a person is touched in order for the toucher to do something to the receiver \(e.g., a physician's touch to a patient or a hairdresser's touch to a customer\); \(2\) social/polite, where touch is exchanged in a carefully prescribed way \(e.g., the ritual handshake upon meeting for the first time\); \(3\) friendship/warmth; \(4\) love/intimacy; \(5\) sexual arousal. All of these dimensions, with the exception of functional/professional, describe touch in positive warm terms.)\).
1.4.5.2.2.2. Pro: Creating different rules for males and females may lead to the creation of systemic discrimination if the rules for one sex are more strict than another \([p. 5](https://rm.coe.int/policy-study-identifying-and-preventing-systemic-discrimination-at-the/1680a00ef4)(The UN Committee on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights notes unchallenged, pervasive, and persistent discrimination that is often found “entrenched in social behaviour and organisation”.\n\nIt has defined what it refers to as “systemic discrimination” as the “legal rules, policies, practices or predominant cultural attitudes in either the public or private sector which create relative disadvantages for some groups, and privileges for other groups.)\).
1.5. Pro: PDA are not significant enough to warrant regulation.
1.5.1. Pro: Displaying affection is a normal and positive action, and these actions are not significant or disruptive enough to warrant regulation.
1.5.1.1. Con: There are [many situations](https://legalbeagle.com/12333582-can-arrested-public-display-affection.html) in which displaying physical affection can be considered significant and require regulation.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: It is important to draw a line regarding PDA and [indecent exposure/lewdness](https://www.dpp-law.com/services/sexual-offences/indecent-exposure/). Such a line would likely be agreed upon by relevant school bodies, and fall outside the realm of general PDA.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The establishment of nuanced boundaries regarding what is and is not acceptable would be an important learning experience for young adults.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Lewdness is defined very differently in different areas, often in ways that [problematically intersect](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lewd)(Behavior that is deemed morally impure or unacceptable in a sexual sense; open and public indecency tending to corrupt the morals of the community; gross or wanton indecency in sexual relations.\n\nAn important element of lewdness is openness. Lewdness is sometimes used interchangeably with licentiousness or lasciviousness, which both relate to debauchery and moral turpitude. It is a specific offense in certain state statutes and is included in general provisions in others.) with PDA.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In California, the [definition of lewd behaviour](https://legalbeagle.com/13720470-california-law-what-is-lewd-behavior.html)(To be found guilty of engaging in lewd conduct in California, the offending act must meet a number of requirements, including:\n\n-The act must have been willful.\n\n-It must have been performed with the intent to arouse, gratify, annoy or offend.\n\n-The action must have taken place in a location open to the public or within public view.\n\n-It must have been witnessed by a person who may have been offended.\n\n-The lewd actor must have had reasonable knowledge that the actions may have been offensive to another person.) can easily include common forms of PDA.
1.5.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: This can give law enforcement means by which to harass or spuriously detain people, as they may have unintentionally and innocently strayed into the realm of problematic PDA.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: One important factor in determining if an act is lewd is whether the action will be offensive to those who witness it.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Behaviours that could otherwise be considered as acceptable can become lewd if they are performed [in the presence of others](https://legalbeagle.com/13720423-what-is-considered-a-lewd-act-in-california.html) who might be offended by the act.
1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: The subjectivity of what causes offense can be particularly problematic: one cannot know what will cause another person offense. Even if someone particularly conservative is offended by seeing an unmarried couple holding hands, this does not make it into a lewd act.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: What is lewd depends on a number of contextual factors. Public nudity is not considered lewd in nudist communities, whereas hugging or hand holding may be considered unacceptable in religious communities.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Demonizing affection harms the human psyche, causing [repression](https://www.psychologistworld.com/freud/defence-mechanisms-list)(Repression is perhaps the most significant of defense mechanisms in that repressed feelings and impulses can lead to the use of many other mechanisms. According to Sigmund Freud’s psychodynamic theory, the impulsive desires of the psyche’s id are prevented by being fulfilled by the ego, which observes the Reality Principle - that our actions are restricted by our environment, including social etiquette. Moreover, the superego acts as our moral compass, inducing feelings of guilt at having experienced the irrational desires that the id creates.) and [displacement](https://www.psychologistworld.com/freud/defence-mechanisms-list)(Displacement occurs when a person represses affection, fear or impulses that they feel towards another person. Accepting that it is irrational or socially unacceptable to demonstrate such feelings, the psyche prevents them from being converted into actions. However, the feelings are instead displaced towards a person or animal whom it is acceptable to express such sentiments for.).
1.5.2. Con: The fact that people do something or want to do something is inadequate to demonstrate that that thing should be permissible.
1.5.2.1. Pro: It is important that children learn that some things are not permissible, regardless of how much they may want to do said thing.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: This is an important lesson for children to learn, but it doesn't necessarily apply to PDA, since many forms of PDA are insignificant or permissible.
1.5.2.2. Con: Personal freedom should only be limited where it produces harmful effects on others or society. PDAs do not harm anyone, so the desire of the participants to engage in it should be sufficient justification.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Personal freedoms are often limited in order to protect people from themselves. PDA should be limited in order to stop individuals from distracting themselves from their study and education.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Following this rationale, video games, television viewing, and many common extracurricular activities should be banned since they can also distract students from their studies and education.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Video games, television viewing and such activities are extra-curricular as they occur outside of the classroom and outside of school time. PDA in this case would only be banned within school.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Adolescence is a time of incredible personal freedom. Teenagers do not have family or career responsibilities, and are free to experiment with their lives. It is unfair to restrict this by banning PDA.
1.5.3. Con: PDA refers to a wide range of behaviours. Although some may not be significant, some would be considered significant in any setting.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Allowing PDA will force schools to arbitrarily determine which forms of PDA are significant enough to warrant regulation.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: This decision need not be arbitrary, the development of such rules would be guided by legality, common sense, and convention.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Leaving the establishment of such regulations to individual schools will only confuse the issue further, since schools could develop widely divergent policies.
1.5.3.2. Con: Common sense and social convention already dictate what forms of PDA are acceptable.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Common sense and social convention are relative concepts, and they can vary dramatically between individuals and cultures.
1.5.4. Pro: A PDA is a decision between the involved people. Everyone else should [mind their own business](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/judging-different-relationships/7-too-much-pda)(You may not like it, but it's not your relationship.).
1.5.4.1. Pro: Adolescents are entitled to the same degree of autonomy as adults.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Adolescence is the period between the [ages of 10-19](https://www.who.int/health-topics/adolescent-health#tab=tab_1)(Adolescence is the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19.). Many places restrict certain rights, such as voting or driving, for those who are under 18. This is a restriction of autonomy.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Denying adolescents the ability to participate in consensual intimacy is a [form of ageism](https://prismreports.org/2020/09/24/what-is-sex-positivity/)(When we discuss body autonomy, this includes children and teenagers under 18 years old in the U.S. This is a hard one for many folks to recognize. Often people resist recognizing that children and youth can say “no” or “yes” to touch, closeness, intimacy, or friendships. People often know what they do and do not want in various contexts. To believe that only those of a certain age are able to consent to touch, love, care, sex, is to limit the body autonomy that is our human right.), and limits their human right to bodily autonomy.
1.5.4.2. Con: Other people, who do not have a choice in the matter, will likely witness and be affected by the PDA.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: People do not have the right to limit the behaviour of others simply because they don't want to see things with which they disagree.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Individuals have the right to inhabit an environment that is free from behaviour they find offensive or immoral.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Con: It is practically impossible to live in an environment totally devoid of behavior that people may subjectively find immoral or offensive. With this in mind, it is better to err on the side of greater freedom, and not prohibit PDA.
1.6. Pro: Middle and high school students are disciplined enough to know when it's acceptable to participate in PDA.
1.6.1. Pro: The majority of students in middle school and high school express [willingness to accept conventions](https://books.google.com/books?id=a7lLEAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA74&ots=iopwb-eL4S&dq=%22majority%20of%20students%22%20%22displays%20of%20affection%22&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=%22majority%20of%20students%22%20%22displays%20of%20affection%22&f=false) about what behaviours are acceptable in public and what should be kept private \(p. 74\).
1.6.1.1. Con: Rebellion against social norms and conventions is a [notable characteristic of adolescence](https://www.medicinenet.com/why_does_teenage_rebellion_happen/article.htm)(Teenage rebellion is common in young adults, and it's one of the leading causes of conflicts between parents and their adolescent children. Rebellion refers to the expression of defiant behavior and disregard for the existing parenting rules. Teenage rebellion can be a normal part of growth and development.\n\nThis developmental phase signals the teenager's need for independence and a separate identity.). Conventions regarding PDA are no exception.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Research has shown that adolescents frequently have numerous misperceptions about normative behaviour, and that they are [receptive and responsive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871927/)(Overall, our meta-analytic findings provide empirical support for the conceptual distinction of three types of peer norms, including both indirect \(descriptive and injunctive\) and direct \(peer pressure\) norms. Together with similar findings from studies on adolescent smoking behavior and alcohol use, the present meta-analysis on adolescent sexual behavior shows that this threefold conceptualization of peer norms is a valuable approach for enhancing our knowledge about the role of peer norms in various domains of adolescent behavior. A better understanding of how adolescents’ behavioral intentions and decisions are related to different types of peer norms, and how both socialization as well as selection processes operate with respect to those norms, is crucial for the effective promotion of healthy adolescent development.) when provided with accurate information about the prevalence of certain attitudes and social behaviours.
1.6.2. Con: If PDA are allowed, students can get carried away and escalate a PDA beyond what is appropriate.
1.6.2.1. Pro: A PDA that goes too far can easily cross the line into [criminal fondling](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=3112f914903fb64936d08c8c15e2ea59&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:34:Subtitle:B:Chapter:VI:Part:668:Subpart:D:668.46)(Fondling - The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity.), particularly if a student is of insufficient age to give consent.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: The rules for consent between minors are different from those between a minor and an adult. Many jurisdictions have [Romeo and Juliet laws](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/blog/is-it-illegal-for-2-minors-to-have-sex/)(A Romeo and Juliet law is an exemption to a statutory rape charge. Also known as a “close-in-age” exemption, these consent laws apply when the two people who had consensual sexual activity were close in age to each other. Many states have Romeo and Juliet laws, though not all do.\n\nTexas is one of the states where lawmakers have added a Romeo and Juliet law to their criminal laws. In Texas, consensual sex is generally legal if:\n\n the actor was not more than three years older than the alleged victim, and\n the alleged victim was 14 years old, or older.), which include close-in-age exemptions.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: [Only half of the US states](https://www.ageofconsent.net/states) have a close-in-age exemption.
1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Many of the states which do not have a close-in-age exemption already have an age of consent [lower than 18](https://www.ageofconsent.net/states). This greatly lessens the requirements for such exemptions.
1.6.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: If only half of US states differentiate between rules of consent for minors and adults in this matter, then it is unlikely that a consensus could be reached by schools on what sort of PDA is acceptable or consensual.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: The minimum age of consent in the US is 16, thus there are still many cases in which sexual intimacy between middle and high school students is [illegal](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/criminal-defense/is-sex-between-minors-a-crime/)(Statutory rape does not require any evidence of force or coercion; a person is guilty simply by performing a sexual act with a minor below the age of consent. Depending on the state, the age of consent can be as low as 16 years of age, while others set the limit at 17 \(e.g., Texas\) or 18 \(e.g., California\).\n\nIn general, when two minors under the age of consent engage in "consensual" sex with one another, they are both open to statutory rape charges.).
1.6.2.2. Pro: Students in middle and high school are not experienced with many social norms or limits. They may not be aware of what is or is not appropriate.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Middle school students generally range from [age 11-13](https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/worklife/children-family/school-age-resources)(middle school is grades 6-8 \(ages 11-13\)). Children at this age can have issues with [reading social cues](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/misreading-social-cues-and-your-childs-behavior/)(Misreading social cues can include not understanding other people’s words, expressions, or body language. These kids are often prone to thinking they’re being disapproved of or disliked when they’re not. Or they agitate or annoy others and they don’t realize it.\n\nUnderstand that reading social situations is a skill many kids with behavioral problems lack. Most kids acquire this skill as they grow: they learn to be more careful in situations where they might get in trouble or be hurt.) and exhibit [problematic behaviour](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/problemstudent.html).
1.6.2.2.2. Con: PDA in school can help students learn about acceptable social norms.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Students in middle and high school are going through puberty, and cannot be expected to have the same self-control as adults have.
1.6.2.4. Con: If physical contact between students is becoming morally improper, it is better for this to occur in an environment where such behaviour can be swiftly corrected by others.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: Even if acceptable forms of PDA are allowed in schools, students can still take things too far in other environments.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: Schools have a responsibility to participate in the [moral education](https://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2246/Moral-Education.html)(Moral education, then, refers to helping children acquire those virtues or moral habits that will help them individually live good lives and at the same time become productive, contributing members of their communities. In this view, moral education should contribute not only to the students as individuals, but also to the social cohesion of a community. The word moral comes from a Latin root \(mos, moris\) and means the code or customs of a people, the social glue that defines how individuals should live together.) of students.
1.6.2.5. Con: Students who escalate physical affection beyond what is appropriate in public have likely already participated in the same behaviours in private, so no additional harm is occurring.
1.6.2.5.1. Con: The occurrence of a behaviour outside school is not a valid reason for accepting a behaviour within school.
1.6.2.6. Pro: If a PDA goes beyond what is appropriate it can become a form of [sexual harassment](https://www.kimberly.edu/policy-3148-public-display-affection)(Unacceptable public displays of affection include, but are not limited to, any prolonged embracing and/or kissing, inappropriate touching, and touching of a sexual nature. Unacceptable public displays of affection at school are in poor taste, disruptive to the educational environment, and may violate sexual harassment laws.) to those who witness it.
1.6.2.6.1. Pro: Consensual PDA between students can constitute [indirect sexual harassment](https://www.vjamesdesimonelaw.com/7-ways-sexual-harassment-can-occur-indirectly-in-workplaces/) of a third party who is offended by their verbal or visual sexual misconduct, or if their behaviour is sufficiently pervasive and offensive.
1.6.3. Con: Research has demonstrated that adolescents experience difficulties with impulse control in emotional situations \([p. 5-6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4182916/pdf/nihms-627927.pdf)(Our findings suggest that adolescence can show remarkable restraint in controlling habitual responses, but tend to fail when controlling habitual responses to salient positive cues in the environment. Specifically, we showed that adolescents have comparable or even better impulse control than some adults \(Figure 1\) in neutral contexts. However, in emotional contexts, adolescents’ impulse control ability is severely taxed relative to children and adults \(Figure 3\).)\).
1.6.3.1. Pro: Studies have shown that adolescents are more likely to [react impulsively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4276317/)(Thus, adolescents' exaggerated response to positively-valenced social cues is shown here to directly undermine their capacity to inhibit approach behavior. Translated to the peer context, this finding suggests that adolescents may not only be particularly sensitive to the reward-sensitizing effects of social stimuli, but that this sensitization may further undermine their capacity to “put the brakes on” impulsive responding.) when they are in the presence of their peers.
1.6.3.2. Con: Learning to participate in PDA appropriately can help adolescents [learn impulse control](https://www.understood.org/articles/en/helping-your-high-school-child-gain-self-control)(You can help your teen gain self-control by laying out clear expectations and talking about moods and feelings.).
1.6.3.2.1. Con: Setting clear boundaries by prohibiting impulsive behaviour like PDA is a far better means of teaching adolescents impulse control than allowing them to act how they like.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Giving students the freedom to exercise their own judgement by deciding what is or isn't appropriate in social settings will teach them impulse control, even if it allows them to fail at times.
