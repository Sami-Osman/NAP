Discussion Name: Should there be automatic voter registration in the US?

1. There should be automatic voter registration.
1.1. Pro: It would streamline the process and could reduce bureaucracy.
1.1.1. Con: There could be an increased amount of bureaucracy as people would have to be employed to help track individuals and register them.
1.1.1.1. Con: With automatic registration, [fewer](https://www.gothamgazette.com/opinion-pieces/130-opinion/8582-automatic-voter-registration-is-good-for-service-members-veterans-and-all-new-yorkers) people will be involved in the registering process, as the user's data would be centralized.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: States would not need to employ as many individuals to receive people's registration forms.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Given there are more people going to be registered, then more people will be needed to track them.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: More [poll workers](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/18/924182086/early-voting-analysis-historic-turnout-drives-long-lines-administrative-errors) will also be needed to accommodate the potential increased turnout.
1.1.2. Pro: [In Arizona](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/03/arizona-primary-long-lines-voting-restrictions/), poor administration was the reason for many struggling to cast their vote in the US Elections.
1.1.2.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that AVR would fix the problems seen in Arizona, as the problems related to [unaffiliated](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/03/arizona-primary-long-lines-voting-restrictions/) voters trying to vote in a primary election.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Some of the examples of [Arizona](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/03/arizona-primary-long-lines-voting-restrictions/)'s poor election administration could be solved by AVR. Under AVR, people who were registered in the wrong county would have their address automatically updated.
1.1.3. Con: Voters would still have to [update](https://vote.sos.ri.gov/Voter/UpdateYourVoterRecord) their registration whenever they move to have access to the correct local ballot.
1.1.3.1. Con: As you are required to update [drivers license](https://www.mymove.com/moving/guides/dmv-change-of-address/) and vehicle registration as well when moving to a new state for an extended period of time, tying registration to one or both of these would resolve that problem.
1.1.3.2. Con: Voters have to do that in the current system. This is not an argument against automatic registration.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Voters would also need to [update](https://vote.sos.ri.gov/Voter/UpdateYourVoterRecord) additional information, such as changing their name or party affiliation.
1.1.3.4. Con: In the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_Netherlands#System), updating registration details is not necessary ever since the municipality of the citizen automatically does this. Re-registration would not necessary if a government body of the USA handles this.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: A system like this would require a complete overhaul of the way voting is managed in the US, as under status-quo it is individual [states](https://www.brookings.edu/research/voting-by-mail-in-a-pandemic-a-state-by-state-scorecard/) who set the rules for and manage voting.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: This is unlikely to happen, as states are very proud of their voting traditions. For example, [Iowa](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iowa-caucus-history-of-the-first-in-the-nation-presidential-contest/) is very attached to its position as the state which hosts its primaries first.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: The US Constitution ultimately sets the parameters for the election of [federal officials](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/elections-voting/).
1.1.4. Pro: Reduced bureaucracy is likely to be more [cost-effective](https://www.commoncause.org/massachusetts/resource/automatic-voter-registration-cost-report/#), saving tax-payers' money.
1.1.4.1. Pro: AVR would make elections cheaper as it would cost less [government resources](https://medium.com/equal-citizens/stop-the-madness-its-time-to-pass-automatic-voter-registration-435503841666).
1.1.4.2. Con: The cost of democracy should not be at issue. If the most expensive option is the one that allows people to access their rights most easily, then that should be the chosen system.
1.1.5. Pro: AVR will reduce errors in voter records- including different spellings of names \(Jim, James, etc\) and missing or incorrect birthdates.
1.1.5.1. Con: AVR has its own [issues](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-illinois-automatic-voter-registration-16-year-olds-20200130-wqooin23vff23cqrldgp2rrcbe-story.html) and glitches in the system will keep occurring.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: When AVR is implemented, glitches and bugs will be worked out, as the technology will be perfected over time.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: If it is more widespread, companies and government experts will likely work on the best possible version of the technology.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Issues in AVR would be detrimental to some people's ability to vote, as polls could close before the issues are fixed.
1.1.5.2. Con: Automatic voter registration, when implemented somewhere that did have traditional registration, has led to [duplicates](https://www.govtech.com/civic/As-Automatic-Voter-Registration-Gains-Momentum-States-Grapple-with-Question-of-Duplicates.html) on many voter rolls.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: There would be less [duplicates](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/7/18071980/automatic-voter-registration-us-election) under a system of automatic voter registration, as people would not have to remember to remove themselves from old rolls.
1.1.5.3. Pro: AVR keeps voter rolls more [accurate](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/automatic-voter-registration-summary) by creating a constant stream of updates between registration agencies and election officials and by reducing the odds of mistakes caused by processing paper registration forms by hand.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: AVR leads to cleaner rolls which in turn reduce errors that cause delays on Election Day and prevent eligible voters from casting regular ballots.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The longer it takes to find someone's name in the voter rolls extends the time it takes to vote, and leads to [longer queue times](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2016-why-long-lines-polling-stations-discrimination-minority-areas-waiting-vote-undemocratic-inaccessible-a7405816.html).
1.1.6. Pro: It would help with census issues for the nation.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Data from the Automatic Voting Registry could be shared with the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html) to [simplify](https://www.amacad.org/news/2020-census-challenges-implications) census processes.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The United States Census Bureau already [collaborates](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/data-sharing-agreements.html) with agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Office of Immigration Statistics to this effect.
1.1.6.2. Con: A collaboration between the census and voter registration would likely lead to the insertion of a question about [citizenship](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/potential-citizenship-question-in-2020-census-could-shift-power-to-rural-america/2018/01/23/c4e6d2c6-f57c-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html) into the census.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: This would lead to those who are not citizens to not fill out the census, fearing persecution from government agencies like ICE. The [impact](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/08/31/the-2020-census-may-be-wildly-inaccurate-and-it-matters-more-than-you-think/) of this is that more federal and state funding, resources, and political power, would transfer to areas where there are less non-citizens, namely rural America.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: The insertion of a question about citizenship would help to ensure that citizens across the country are given more [equal weighted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/14/real-reason-census-should-include-citizenship-question/) votes.
1.1.6.3. Pro: If AVR were to help the census, it would help more [accurately](https://abc7news.com/census-2020-faq-what-is-the-used-for/5718714/) divide out representatives and federal funding.
1.2. Con: Automatic registration, to be kept current, would require tracking individuals closely through their lives, which would be a violation of our rights to privacy and to be left alone.
1.2.1. Pro: A truly automatic system would need to be consistently aware of where people are located and their age.
1.2.1.1. Con: This can be achieved through non-invasive means, such as updating voter registration when one updates their vehicle registration.
1.2.1.2. Con: The current system still needs to be aware of where registered voters are located. AVR simply makes this process easier.
1.2.1.3. Pro: This would require the pulling of data from so many sources that a person could not be expected to consent to their data being used in every setting.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: In most cases, this information is readily available to the government anyway, for example via census information or because it was collected when a person registered for a state-issued identification card or driver license.
1.2.2. Con: The issues associated with tracking could be solved in simple ways.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Since vehicle registration and driver's license renewal have to be completed every few years, this could be a way to streamline and maintain voter registration.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Because a fee is required for vehicle registration and for a driver's license renewal, it would constitute a poll tax, which is in violation of [constitutional law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-24).
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: By the same logic, the need to pay for a [stamp](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-two-stamps-ballots-idUSKCN2571X3) to post one's mail-in ballot could be classed as a poll tax.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It has been ruled that [stamps](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-lawsuits-elections-election-2020-atlanta-e44bf5301bce5d0001dd696f82c373e0) do not amount to a poll tax.
1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: For those who are underprivileged, even the cost of a [stamp](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/16/politics/poll-taxes-voting-2020-election/index.html) can be prohibitive in getting involved in the electoral process.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: This will negatively impact those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are [less likely to have cars](https://theconversation.com/factcheck-do-poor-people-drive-less-30509) due to the cost.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: People who go to the DMV to have their driver's license renewed simply have their details shared with the centralized voter registration system.
1.2.2.2. Pro: A voter registration issued at birth, like a social security number, and updated with a current address throughout life would be minimally invasive.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Voter registration issued at birth would be more invasive as they would have to be informed about the location of children.
1.2.2.3. Con: Even insofar as tracking people is easily solvable, this raises further privacy concerns, as more of a citizen's data is shared between government agencies.
1.2.2.4. Pro: There could be a free, voluntary opt-out, which automatically makes it less privacy-invasive than taxes.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Taxes are [mandatory](https://www.history.com/news/why-we-pay-taxes) and so the privacy intensive nature of it is irrelevant. Given voting is not mandatory however, the smallest infringement on one's privacy as possible should be sought.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: We would also have to criminalize offering/taking compensation for opting out and make opting out unverifiable, just like voting.
1.2.3. Pro: There is a considerable amount of personal and private [information](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/personal-voter-data-study/) that is made public because of voter registration. This is now being done without the consent of those involved.
1.2.3.1. Con: An [opt-out](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-when-2-2-million-people-were-automatically-registered-to-vote/) system still allows people at point of registration to to choose to prevent their data transferring from one government system, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, into a registration database.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Given how straightforward voter registration will be with AVR, people may not be fully aware of the privacy implications of registering, whereas they would be if they made a conscious and informed choice to register.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Many people would not read the terms and conditions, or disclaimers, on what it means to opt in to be registered to vote through other government agencies, like the Department of Motor Vehicles, and so they would not be aware of the implications for their data.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Very few people actually [read](https://www.linklaters.com/en/insights/blogs/digilinks/does-anyone-read-privacy-notices-the-facts) privacy policies. It is unlikely they will take the time to read their implications to not opt-out of AVR.
1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: It is the individual's responsibility to read any term or [contract](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/duty-to-read-a-contract.html) they sign, so they should never sign or accept what they are not aware of in the first place.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: When people are going out of their way to vote, they are more likely to have done the research on the implications of registering.
1.2.4. Con: Registering to vote [already requires](https://www.ssa.gov/open/havv/) submitting sensitive personal information such as a driver's license number or the last 4 digits of your social security number in order to prove your identity. AVR would therefore not constitute an additional invasion of privacy, but would leverage information you've already submitted to acquire a license.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Automatic Voter Registration is merely [digitizing](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx) the same registration data that is collected with the current, paper-based forms.
1.2.4.2. Con: AVR would require this information of everyone however, and therefore could infringe on the privacy of those who would have chosen not to register to vote.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: With AVR, people are [registered](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx) to vote without their explicit consent. If they want to refuse, they must take action to undo their registration. This infringes their privacy in a way that current registration procedures do not.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: People still have to consent with AVR.
1.3. Pro: The current voting registration processes are an obstacle for people to exercise their right to vote.
1.3.1. Con: Many rights require acting through a process to effectively obtain, such as [abortion](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/roe-v-wade).
1.3.1.1. Pro: Just because something is a right does not mean it should be handed to people.
1.3.1.2. Con: Abortion is a right which inherently requires a process. Voting has no such inherent attachment to a process beyond the act of voting itself. Therefore voter registration should be made as easy as possible.
1.3.2. Pro: Anyone who is 18 years old and a US citizen is [automatically eligible](https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote) to vote anyway.
1.3.2.1. Pro: At the age of 18, if the US recognises that someone should be allowed to vote, then the government should make it as easy as possible.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Younger voters have particularly [low turnout rates](https://theconversation.com/why-so-few-young-americans-vote-132649) in the US. AVR can be an [effective](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2019/02/21/466450/pro-voter-reforms-key-young-americans-voting-2018-elections/) measure to get young people voting.
1.3.2.2. Con: Being eligible is a necessary but insufficient condition; it is also important to confirm where their [permanent residence](https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/voting-residence)(Your voting residence is within your state of legal residence or domicile. It is the address that you consider your permanent home and where you had a physical presence. Your state of legal residence is used for state income tax purposes, and determines eligibility to vote for federal and state elections and qualification for in-state tuition rates.) is because of how votes are counted in US elections.
1.3.3. Con: Many politicians consider voting to be a [privilege](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/), as opposed to a right.
1.3.3.1. Con: The US Constitution mentions "[the right to vote](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/voting-right-or-privilege/262511/)" five times.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: The US Constitution is also silent on whether citizens should actually get a vote in [presidential](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/podcasts/the-daily/electoral-college-trump-clinton-gore-bush.html?showTranscript=1) races. It mentions only the electoral college.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: If the framers of the Constitution thought something so important that it should be mentioned in the Constitution, then access to that should be as easy as possible.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: The framers of the Constitution did not mention ease of access to voting, and so they it is unlikely they believed that voting should be as easy as possible.
1.3.3.1.2.2. Con: The framers of the Constitution [excluded](https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/history-of-voting-in-america-timeline.pdf) the right to vote for many who now are allowed to vote, such as women and African-Americans, and so their word on the right to vote is clearly outdated.
1.3.3.1.2.3. Pro: The framers of the Constitution engaged in many debates during the [Constitutional Convention](https://www.britannica.com/event/Constitutional-Convention), and what ended up in the final document was the outcome of much deliberation.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Voting is a privilege, which is why it comes with certain [responsibilities](https://www.civics-online.org/voting-rights/four-important-responsibilities-of-voters/): registering to vote is one of them.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: If it was true that voting was a responsibility in and of itself, then it would be made [mandatory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321020221_VOTING_A_CITIZEN%27S_RIGHT_OR_DUTY_THE_CASE_OF_COMPULSORY_VOTING_1).
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: The responsibilities associated with voting are not legal in nature, but are incredibly important and each individual should strive to adhere to them, without the government helping them bypass any steps.
1.3.4. Pro: Through measures like AVR, governments eliminate barriers that prevent elegible adults to vote, as is their [democratic responsibility](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/).
1.3.4.1. Pro: It is important for governments to endeavour to increase turnout, so they have the greatest [mandate](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-there-a-chance-the-winner-in-2020-will-be-able-to-credibly-claim-a-mandate/) possible.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: A mandate from more of the population allows the government to act more freely, as they have the implicit or explicit support of more people.
1.4. Pro: Automatic registration would increase voter turnout and encourage additional participation.
1.4.1. Con: [Tens of millions](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/case-automatic-voter-registration#Introduction) of eligible and registered voters in the US donâ€™t go to the polls, so registration does not solve the problem.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Many people do not vote for reasons unrelated to voter registration. For example, many people do not vote because elections are held on [Tuesdays](https://www.usa.gov/voting-political-party).
1.4.1.2. Con: Even if some people still do not vote, more likely will, and that is a net benefit and it means whoever is chosen in the election is the choice of more people.
1.4.1.3. Con: They might be more likely to go to the polls if they are automatically registered. States which have modernized registration see [many benefits](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voter-registration-modernization-states) such as this.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Once people are registered they are more likely to feel an obligation to look into politics.
1.4.1.4. Pro: If the objective is increasing voter turnout, there are more effective measures that the government could take as compared to AVR.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: [Belgium](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/these-countries-have-some-of-the-highest-voter-turnout-in-the-world/) has the highest turnout rate because voting is [mandatory](https://qz.com/1605690/european-election-belgiums-voter-turnout-rate-is-an-outlier/) there. If the objective is to raise turnout rates, then AVR is not the best solution.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Making sure people don't have to work on Election day is essential. Countries like [Spain](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/05/24/inenglish/1558708576_117836.html) have election days on Sundays, or make Election day a holiday, like [South Korea](http://keia.org/why-do-koreans-vote-higher-rate-elections-americans).
1.4.1.4.3. Con: It is unclear what would have the largest effect on voter turnout, and so as many measures to take steps in the right direction should be taken.
1.4.2. Con: [Most people](https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p20-562.pdf#page=14) who do not register to vote are not interested in voting. Just 6% could not vote due to registration complications.
1.4.2.1. Pro: According to this same source, 46% of people did not register because they were "not involved in the election or in politics". It is unlikely that any of them would vote, even if automatically registered.
1.4.2.2. Con: According to the same [source](https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p20-562.pdf#page=14), people who did not register because they missed the deadline or had problems in the process adds up to 18.9%, which can be a significant number of votes.
1.4.2.3. Con: [Some people](https://theconversation.com/i-asked-people-why-they-dont-vote-and-this-is-what-they-told-me-129421) who do not register to vote believe that the registration is too cumbersome and discriminatory. An automated system would negate this and reveal how many of those actually aren't interested in voting.
1.4.2.4. Con: Considering how close many important US elections are, even a tiny share of citizens who is deterred or prevented from casting a vote can make a difference.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: In the 1960 presidential election, John F. Kennedy won [less than 0.2%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_United_States_presidential_election) more of the popular vote than his opponent, Richard Nixon.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election against Al Gore by [less than 500,000 votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election) \(or 0.5% of the popular vote\).
1.4.3. Pro: [Evidence](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) shows that opt-out framing is far more effective than opt-in at getting people to consent to something.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Framing something as opt-out creates the notion that it is something everyone else does and [endorses](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0272989X14529624).
1.4.3.2. Con: Opt-out framing might be more effective, but it should not be used, as it is a less [democratic](https://www.wired.com/story/hey-apple-opt-out-is-useless/) option.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Opt-out systems are crafted to influence the choice of a person in what should be a free system. Therefore they undermine the democratic principle of freedom of choice.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Opt out framing is not undemocratic, if it serves the aim of getting more people to vote in a democratic system.
1.4.3.3. Con: The current system of opt-in framing also has its benefits, as people may see voting as an opportunity and so may be inclined to register.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: The current opt-in framing is not working, as recently voter registration in the US has seen a drastic [reduction](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voter-registration-has-plummeted-2020).
1.4.3.4. Pro: The benefits of opt-out framing are seen most prominently with regards to organ donation, as highlighted by this [study](http://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/JohnsonGoldstein_Defaults_Transplantation2004.pdf).
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Some of the evidence for the increase in organ donation on account of an [opt-out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3914429/) system has been called into question. Therefore it is unclear how it would play out with regards to AVR.
1.4.4. Pro: Requiring voters to register is an additional step that can deter some people from participating.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Given there are a number of large barriers to voting aside from registration, such as [disrupted polling sites and attacks on voting by mail](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/barriers-to-voting-in-the-us/), adding another hurdle could be too much for some people.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Many people are too [busy](https://www.vice.com/en/article/zm9j85/i-couldnt-vote-because-i-had-to-work) to vote or register. To encourage participation, every barrier to registering or voting should be removed.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: It would be easier to stop politicians attacking voting and undermining its legitimacy, than to overhaul the entire system of voting.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Many people feel their vote [doesn't matter](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/the-myth-my-vote-doesnt-matter/2403988/). A process of registration adds to this, as the government is sending a message that they do not want you to vote.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: If the government makes it more difficult to vote, they are more likely to engender apathy and a feeling of hopelessness in people who would otherwise want to vote.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Registration is a task that particularly [impacts](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2019/7/11/automatic-voter-registration-boosts-turnout-among-young-and-low-income-people) the young, and those who are low-income, as they are less able to take time off work, or time away from their studies, to register.
1.4.4.4. Con: If going through the relatively simple process of registering \(which only needs to be done once\) is enough to deter someone, they do not care about voting at all, and therefore there is no reason to register them, nor should they participate in a system they care so little about.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: In a [democratic](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/one-person_one-vote_rule) state, a person who is apathetic has the same right to vote as a person who is not. To be democratic, a state must strive to encourage turnout.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: There are different [ways](https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote) to register to vote, and none of them require considerable effort.
1.4.4.4.3. Pro: People who don't want to make the effort of registering are unlikely to make the effort of being informed, which is arguably [difficult](https://matadornetwork.com/life/balance-staying-informed-staying-sane/). People who are not minimally informed should [not](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048400802587309) vote.
1.4.5. Pro: Automatic registration [increases turnout](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2019/7/11/automatic-voter-registration-boosts-turnout-among-young-and-low-income-people) in young people and those from a less privileged socio-economic background.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Increasing turnout for less privileged people is so important that it would be a sufficient reason to approve AVR.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: If underprivileged people don't have a voice, politicians are more likely to [ignore](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-are-the-poor-and-minorities-less-likely-to-vote/282896/) their needs.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: People from less privileged socio-economic background experience more [barriers](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-are-the-poor-and-minorities-less-likely-to-vote/282896/) to vote. This is not acceptable in a democratic state.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: If turnout from less privileged people is so important, then the best strategy would be to make voting [mandatory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2952255?seq=1).
1.4.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.
1.4.5.1.3.2. Con: Mandatory voting would infringe on people's freedom of choice in a way that automatically registering them would not.
1.4.5.1.4. Pro: Young people have to live with the consequences of the decisions made by politicians for the longest time, and so enfranchising them through AVR is important.
1.4.5.1.4.1. Pro: Many young people have cited [registration](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/voter-registration-young-people-apathy.html) as being the reason they do not vote, as they have found it too difficult or convoluted.
1.4.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Many young people move around more, as they move between rental properties and locations far more, and so it is difficult to [keep track](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/voter-registration-young-people-apathy.html) of their registration.
1.4.5.1.4.2. Con: To achieve long term change, energy would be better directed at better [civics education](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html) across the US.
1.4.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: It is more interesting to have younger generations vote because they understand the importance of voting than it is to increase participation by making it easier.
1.4.6. Con: Automatic registration may encourage turnout by voters who are less informed or apathetic, which would be detrimental.
1.4.6.1. Con: It is unlikely that apathetic turnout would increase. People who are apathetic, by definition, don't care.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: If someone has decided that they do not care about the election, or politics in general, it will not matter whether they are automatically registered or not.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: Removing one barrier to voting - the need to register beforehand - may still lower the threshold at which some apathetic voters consider voting not sufficiently inconvenient anymore.
1.4.6.2. Pro: If it is right to encourage votes from those who are not informed we should also extend voting rights to young children, yet this would be considered by most as an absurd porposition.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Voting is a [responsibility](https://www.civics-online.org/voting-rights/four-important-responsibilities-of-voters/) that should be upheld by citizens. People who choose not to vote because they don't want to spend time registrating are likely to not be responsible enough to be encouraged to vote.
1.4.6.4. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.
1.4.6.5. Con: Increased education on the issues and parties involved could help resolve this issue.
1.4.6.5.1. Pro: There exist [organisations](https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-06-08/facts-matter-nonpartisan-data-is-key-to-informing-votes-in-2020) whose work involves educating voters and presenting them with the facts that would help them more informed voting decisions.
1.4.6.5.2. Pro: As humans, we cannot connect with what we don't understand. More people would engage [politically](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/11/ignorance-does-not-lead-to-election-bliss/506894/) if they had a higher-quality civics education.
1.4.6.5.3. Con: It could, but since both parties tend to be focused on misinforming uninformed voters and/or currying favor with them rather than educating them, this is unlikely to happen.
1.4.6.6. Pro: There would be negative consequences if someone were to vote simply because they were automatically registered, and not because they were informed on the issues.
1.4.6.6.1. Con: Even the most informed voters, who would likely have gone out of their way to register themselves, are prone to bias and blinkering so that they do not make the best [political decisions.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/1/15515820/donald-trump-democracy-brexit-2016-election-europe)
1.4.6.6.1.1. Pro: If even the most informed voters do not make good decisions, then it does not matter that people who are uninformed vote, as both have the capacity to make good or bad decisions.
1.4.6.6.2. Pro: People who are uniformed on the issues are more inclined to side with their social group and could potentially [vote against their own interests.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201712/why-do-people-vote-against-their-best-interests)
1.4.6.6.2.1. Pro: When people vote against their own interests they may harm themselves economically. For example, someone on social security may vote for a [politician](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/06/05/why-people-vote-against-their-economic-interests) who would take away their benefits.
1.4.6.6.3. Con: If being informed was a consideration relevant to whether someone should be allowed vote or not, then a test would be part of the voting or registration process.
1.4.6.6.3.1. Pro: People are allowed to vote based on feelings and impressions.
1.4.6.6.3.2. Con: Society already recognises the fact that someone is not sufficiently informed to vote until they are [18](https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-age-requirements). Therefore, while there is not voting test, there are minimum requirements to voting.
1.4.6.6.4. Pro: Uninformed voters are more likely to vote for objectively [worse](https://fssfalcon.org/2431/opinion/should-uninformed-voters-vote/) candidates.
1.4.6.6.5. Pro: If a large number of previously uninformed or apathetic people became enfranchised at once, politicians would likely pursue populist policies and engage in [sensationalist advertising](https://fssfalcon.org/2431/opinion/should-uninformed-voters-vote/) to try and get them to vote for them.
1.4.7. Pro: Automatic voter registration [has proven](https://www.ivotecef.org/avr_fact_sheet) to be successful in other countries with a higher voter turnout.
1.4.7.1. Con: AVR is not the reason why other countries have high turnout rates.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: South Korea combines a series of [measures](http://keia.org/why-do-koreans-vote-higher-rate-elections-americans) to ensure high turnout rates, such as making the election day a holiday, mock election days, celebrity endorsements, and ads in the media.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: In Estonia, the most efficient measure to improve voter turnout has been to allow citizens to vote [online](http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/303475214).
1.4.7.1.3. Con: All of the top countries that make the [top of the list](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/these-countries-have-some-of-the-highest-voter-turnout-in-the-world/) in voter turnout have AVR, including Belgium, Sweden, South Korea, and Israel.
1.4.7.1.3.1. Con: The fact that the countries that have higher turnout rates have AVR does not [imply](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jan/06/correlation-causation) that AVR is the reason why they have higher turnout rates.
1.4.7.1.3.2. Con: [Chile](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) is a country that has AVR but sees a lower turnout than the US, so it is clear that there are multiple factors at play in producing a high turnout.
1.4.7.1.3.2.1. Con: To assess the role of AVR, it makes more sense to compare the same country with AVR and without AVR, rather than two different countries.
1.4.7.1.3.3. Pro: Even if AVR is not the sole cause of the increased turnout in these countries, it is likely that it has had some impact on positively increasing turnout.
1.4.7.2. Pro: [Sweden](https://www.ivotecef.org/avr_fact_sheet), which has automatic voter registration, saw an 82% voter turnout rate in their last election -- almost three times what the US had in 2014.
1.4.7.3. Pro: [Iraq](https://www.ivotecef.org/avr_fact_sheet) began implementing AVR in 2014 and in that election saw 76.81% of the voting age population turn out to vote.
1.4.7.4. Pro: [The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2017), who have implemented an automatic voter registration, had a turnout of 81,9% for the last national parliamentary elections - compared to 55.5% in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections).
1.5. Con: The system for registering people could be vulnerable to fraud.
1.5.1. Con: Any system can be vulnerable to fraud. Since there are legal provisions that can be used to [prevent](http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/vr/vra/vra16) it from happening, it should not be a reason to discard AVR.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Given that the current system is [vulnerable](https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/ei/eif/eif06/eif06b) to fraud, then there is no risk to changing the system.
1.5.1.2. Con: Fraud is inherently illegal, yet it still occurs. If legal provisions were sufficient, we would not have fraud under the status quo.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: The rates of voter fraud are so incredibly [low](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/truth-about-voter-fraud), which suggests the current [legal provisions](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/what-is-voter-fraud-and-how-is-it-committed-46791) do in fact work.
1.5.2. Pro: The process of registering people automatically may be vulnerable to fraud as it is unclear how the process adequately filters out non-citizens, who cannot vote but have legally obtained [state identification cards.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx)
1.5.2.1. Con: It would not be difficult for government officials to simply check whether someone who was obtaining a state identification card was also a citizen.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: If government officials had to double check all of the work of AVR, this would lead to more work than the current system.
1.5.3. Con: AVR would contribute to protecting the integrity of the registration process.
1.5.3.1. Pro: AVR would make election fraud less likely, as government officials would not have to enter voter registration information [manually](https://medium.com/equal-citizens/stop-the-madness-its-time-to-pass-automatic-voter-registration-435503841666).
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: When registration is done manually, there is an opportunity for government officials to make mistakes, be misled, or potentially bribed.
1.5.3.2. Con: The corruption at best might be redirected; an automated system is still subject to abuse \(as evidenced by electronic voting machines\).
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Keeping the potential points of attack and abuse to the fewest possible number is the best way to combat abuse, fraud and corruption.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: Other forms of digitisation in voter processes have been subject to abuse and corruption.
1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: Electronic voting machines do not allow for the voting process to be witnessed by external observers and election administrators, meaning trust and transparency are jeopardised.
1.5.3.2.2.2. Pro: [A pilot](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/dcvoting-fc12.pdf) for an internet voting project saw the system hacked into and taken over within 48 hours.
1.5.3.2.2.3. Con: The registration process is already managed online, so any potential abuses of the system already exist in the status quo.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: In the last US Presidential election, Russia allegedly [targeted voter registration databases](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/DEF%20CON%2025%20voting%20village%20report.pdf) in at least 21 states. Automatic registration would make the impact of their attack even greater. \(p6\)
1.5.3.3. Con: Given recent allegations of [Russian intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections) in the US Presidential election, much of which was based on online activity, digitising the registration process may make it even more vulnerable to illicit hacking.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: This is supported by a lot of [well-supported](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/dcvoting-fc12.pdf) [hacking theory](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/DEF%20CON%2025%20voting%20village%20report.pdf) and [demonstration](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/hackavote2004.pdf), and creates a reality where alteration of the vote is not only possible, but likely.
1.5.3.3.2. Con: All currently existing voter databases are already stored digitally, therefore this point is moot.
1.5.4. Pro: The AVR system has been used by some states to [purge](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-rights/-use-it-or-lose-it---the-problem-of-purges-from-the-registration/) eligible voters.
1.5.4.1. Con: Voter roll [purges](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/20/790319853/are-states-purging-or-cleaning-voter-registration-rolls) occur under status quo. List maintenance often sees people taken off the rolls incorrectly. AVR will help stop this as active voters are more frequently updated.
1.5.5. Con: Voter fraud is already [incredibly rare](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/voter-fraud) with the system we already have.
1.5.5.1. Con: According to the source, voter fraud is rare precisely because the current system is safe. Therefore, changing to a new system might not be as safe, so it should be discouraged.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: The current system of voter registration has [multiple steps](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/Report_Truth-About-Voter-Fraud.pdf), and investigations into suspected fraud are common, which help to ensure that voter fraud is rare and low impact. Removing these in favour of an automatic system opens the process up to more fraud.
1.5.5.1.2. Con: Most fraud in the status quo does not occur at the point of [registration](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/Report_Truth-About-Voter-Fraud.pdf). Changing the system does not increase or reduce the likelihood of fraud such as vote-buying, or fraud by election officials.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The fact that voter fraud is so [rare](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud) shows that the US has the means to implement voting in a way that is fair. Moving to AVR seems unlikely to undermine this when the current system is so strong.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Voter fraud is rare because few people set out to commit voter fraud. Changing the system will therefore have little impact.
1.5.6. Pro: If everything became digitised, there could be more opportunities for foreign infiltration into the electoral system in the US.
1.5.6.1. Con: Many voters already use technology to vote. 28% of US voters live in districts that us only [direct-recording electronic \(DRE\) devices, such as touch screens, that record votes in computer memory.](http://direct-recording electronic \(DRE\) devices, such as touch screens, that record votes in computer memory.)
1.5.6.1.1. Con: DRE voting systems are especially vulnerable to tampering. [Vulnerabilities of our Voting Machines](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-vulnerabilities-of-our-voting-machines/)
1.5.6.2. Pro: It is easy to hack into [voting technology](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/22/us-elections-hacking-voting-machines-def-con) to a level that would be sufficient to bring an election into disrepute and sow chaos.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: If it is, in fact, easy to hack into election technology, then automatic voter registration would not worsen the problem, as there is already [technology](https://ballotpedia.org/Voting_methods_and_equipment_by_state) at every point in the voting system.
1.5.6.2.2. Con: Extra [encryption](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/cryptography-secure-electronic-voting-systems/) measures can be used to help ensure electoral cyber safety.
1.5.6.2.2.1. Con: The best way to guarantee election safety is by eliminating technology, and using [paper ballots](https://www.businessinsider.com/paper-ballots-election-voting-machines-2020-2?r=US&IR=T).
1.5.6.2.2.1.1. Con: The use of paper ballots is not mutually exclusive with the implementation of AVR.
1.5.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: [Paper](https://www.businessinsider.com/paper-ballots-election-voting-machines-2020-2?r=US&IR=T) is immune from hacking or digital manipulation.
1.5.6.2.3. Pro: AVR would make it even easier for foreign nations to alter voter data, as AVR requires [connection](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx) between the voter database and other government databases which may be less well-protected.
1.5.6.3. Pro: When California began rolling out automatic voter registration in 2019, machines were [hacked](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-motor-voter-problems-investigation-20190409-story.html) and found to be attempting to connect with foreign nations.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: This was California's first attempt at AVR, and the security issues will be worked out over time.
1.6. Con: Automatic registration could potentially benefit one party more than another.
1.6.1. Con: This could be remedied by registering all new voters as "Independents", and allowing them to vote for either party, as they so choose to do, based on their personal beliefs. Should they wish to identify with a specific party, they can update their registration before the election.
1.6.1.1. Con: Registering with a certain [party](https://www.usa.gov/voting-political-party) does not mean that you have to vote for them.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: If individuals had to vote for the party they registered with, that would make the act of voting redundant.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Registering everyone as an independent would at least not disproportionately increase the number of voters in either major party's primary elections.
1.6.2. Con: This is only the case if voter suppression is occurring, as this likely favours one party more than another.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Voter suppression in the US tends to benefit [Republicans](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/reference/united-states-history/voter-suppression-haunted-united-states-since-founded/). AVR is a mechanism therefore to combat the voter suppression.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: It would be easier to combat the voter suppression that is already occurring, by fixing [gerrymandering](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/what-is-gerrymandering.html), for example.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: It is highly [unlikely](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/gerrymandering-ruling-could-have-been-worse/592879/) that the problems with gerrymandering will be solved in the near future. Implementing AVR is more [attainable](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx), thus it should be prioritized.
1.6.2.1.1.2. Pro: In the 2020 [US Presidential election](https://electoralvotemap.com/gerrymander-presidential-elections/), Republicans are likely to benefit unfairly from [gerrymandering](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-gerrymandering-became-one-of-the-biggest-issues-in-politics/).
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Obstructing or blocking measures to achieve wider participation, such as AVR, is considered a form of [voter suppression](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/reference/united-states-history/voter-suppression-haunted-united-states-since-founded/).
1.6.2.2. Con: It does not require ill intent for this to occur. The method of automatic registration would have to rely on some mechanism. And different populations will be more or less likely to be registered, depending on the mechanism.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: If voters are registered when citizenship is conferred \(at the assignment of a social security number and birth certificate\), there would be no citizens who were not registered to vote. The bias would only be against non-citizens, who are not allowed to vote anyway.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: As a case in point, consider the [telephone polls](http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/251) that convinced the papers that Dewey would win in 1948 -- those without telephones voted differently.
1.6.3. Con: [Demographic indicators](https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-automatic-voter-registration-illinois-states.html) suggest no one party will gain a disproportionate advantage from automatic voter registration.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Those who automatic voter registration most often enfranchises tend to be y[ounger, likelier to live in low- and middle-income areas, more likely to live in lower-education areas and more likely to live in racially diverse areas.](http://ow- and middle-income areas, more likely to live in lower-education areas and more likely to live in racially diverse areas.) This is a diverse range of people, with some more likely to vote for Democrats and some for Republicans.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: A high turnout could [benefit](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/increased-voter-turnout-could-benefit-republicans-or-democrats-in-2020/) either Republicans or Democrats in 2020.
1.6.3.2. Con: Demographic indicators change over time and so it is impossible to use what demographics look like now to determine how a policy will affect the future.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Predicting how either party would be favoured \(or not\) by AVR involves many different variables, so it would be extremely complex to succeed.
1.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: Many of the factors that influence the elections are [external](https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/), uncontrolable, or unpredictable.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: For this reason, the possibility that AVR might influence one party in particular should not be of concern.
1.6.3.3. Pro: AVR will benefit different parties depending on the year, jurisdiction, and candidate. It is impossible to project how the policy might have a net benefit to a specific party.
1.6.4. Pro: A larger pool of voters, brought about by automatic voter registration, will benefit [Democrats](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/873878423/voting-and-elections-divide-republicans-and-democrats-like-little-else-heres-why).
1.6.4.1. Pro: It is [Republicans](http://senategop.state.il.us/News/8563/Republican-lawmakers-push-for-suspension-of-automatic-voter-registration/news-detail/) who try suppress and undermine automatic voter registration systems. They would not do so if it was of benefit to them.
1.6.4.2. Con: Attaining a larger pool of voters would speak in favour of AVR, not against.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Higher voter turnout is a [desirable](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/07/11/453319/increasing-voter-participation-america/) outcome in a democratic election, regardless of which party benefits.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: Increasing the pool of voters is not a good in and of itself, and it cannot be divorced from the consequences.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Many young people, Hispanics, Asians and African-Americans are not currently [registered](https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/WhyAre51MillionEligibleAmericans-v1-1.pdf) to vote. These are also the people most likely to vote [Democrat](https://www.pewresearch.org/2020/09/23/the-changing-racial-and-ethnic-composition-of-the-u-s-electorate/).
1.6.4.3.1. Con: AVR, and a higher, broader turnout, would force Republicans to engage with issues they would previously have [ignored](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-republicans-given-up-on-winning-black-voters/), to try and appeal to more types of people.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: If Republicans were forced to engage with issues they would have previously ignored, then the electorate has a better choice and so in this way, AVR helps to improve democracy.
1.6.5. Pro: The US two-party system is dependent on not giving one party [too much power](https://atlanticsentinel.com/2020/01/americas-rigid-two-party-system-is-what-its-founders-feared/), as they could govern unchecked. Anything which would alter this state should not be introduced.
1.6.5.1. Pro: A balance of power is important so that one branch of government can [investigate and audit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/11/its-time-congress-take-power-back-presidency/) other branches of government. If automatic voter registration propelled one party into power for perpetuity, then this would be impossible.
1.6.5.2. Con: The failures of the US two-party political system should not be compensated for by seeking to deny people their vote.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: If there is an issue with the [two-party system](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/two-party-system-broke-constitution/604213/), it should be fixed such that it does not collapse when more people can vote.
1.6.6. Con: This is true, but irrelevant if your goal is to have the government more accurately reflect the wishes of the governed.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Any change in the balance of power due to removing barriers for citizens to exercise their right to vote is morally just.
1.6.6.2. Con: An action, such as changing the entire voter registration process, cannot be divorced from its consequences.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: The outcome of voting and any measures linked to it, have a wide impact, such as choosing the president for the a four year term, as well as countless other local outcomes. As a result, the question of who will benefit from any proposed changes must be considered.
1.6.6.2.1.1. Con: The government derives its power from the consent of the governed. If it is discovered through automatic voter registration that consent was being artificially suppressed, it is the duty of the government to change to accommodate this.
1.6.6.2.2. Con: The direct consequence of the change to automatic voter registration is that more people are registered to vote. What happens after that is a product of people voting alone.
