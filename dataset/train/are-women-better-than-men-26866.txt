Discussion Name: Are women better than men?

1. Women are better than men.
1.1. Pro: Women make better decisions than men.
1.1.1. Con: Men are often [stronger chess players](https://theconversation.com/whats-behind-the-gender-imbalance-in-top-level-chess-150637)(Unlike the wildly popular Netflix chess-themed series The Queen’s Gambit, female players have struggled to climb to the top of the real-life chess world. Just 37 of the more than 1,600 international chess grandmasters are women. The current top-rated female, Hou Yifan, is ranked 89th in the world, while the reigning women’s world champion Ju Wenjun is 404th.\n\nWhy? There are certainly fewer female chess players to begin with, but it appears unlikely participation can explain the whole story.) than women, indicating a capacity for long term strategic thinking.
1.1.1.1. Con: Enforcing gender diversity quotas on French chess teams has resulted in a [narrowed gap](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/en/content/positive-effects-affirmative-action-case-study-france.html)(In 1990, France introduced a gender quota in its chess club competitions. We use this institutional change to assess the overall effects of a quota on gender vertical segregation. This change is unique because we have a clear idea of how well chess players perform. Moreover, sufficient time has elapsed since the introduction of the quota to evaluate its longterm effects. Exploiting this institutional change, we find that more women have entered the chess market over time but their participation in club competitions has never exceeded the mandatory quota rate. However, we find that the quality of women has improved considerably in absolute and also relative terms when compared to men and Belgium, where no gender quotas have been introduced.) in rankings between genders. This indicates that the lower rankings of women in chess may not be innate.
1.1.1.2. Con: Chess does not accurately represent day to day decisions.
1.1.2. Pro: Women's decisions are better for their communities.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Women tend to be more attuned to the [welfare of all parties involved](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130326101616.htm)(A survey of more than 600 board directors showed that women are more likely to consider the rights of others and to take a cooperative approach to decision-making. This approach translates into better performance for their companies.) when making decisions.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Under [stressful circumstances](https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/the-big-question-are-women-better-decisionmakers-than-men-20160825-gr0zy9.html)(She also found that during times of stress, men and women make different choices - and the outcomes are often better when women are involved \(a recent Fortune magazine article on the financial crash of 2007 was entitled "How more women on Wall Street could have prevented the financial crisis"\). Or as Huston puts it, "Neuroscientists know about the differences between the way men and women make decisions, but investments bankers probably don't." Study after study backs this view up.), women are more likely to make decisions that lead to positive outcomes, whereas men tend to make risky decisions.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Women are less risk tolerant when stressed, but it's incorrect to assume the safest choice is the best choice. For example, the FDA has been [criticized](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/fda-delays-carry-death-toll/619871/) for [being overly cautious](https://www.vox.com/22893078/fda-covid-19-too-cautious-tests-vaccines) in delaying approval for vaccines, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths. [Evidence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2641547) suggests that the FDA's inability to tolerate risk is pervasive and deadly.
1.1.2.3. Pro: On average, companies with a higher representation of women with [decision-making power](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/894433)(Boards with high female representation experience a 53% higher return on equity, a 66% higher return on invested capital and a 42% higher return on sales \(Joy et al., 2007\).\n\nHaving just one female director on the board cuts the risk of bankruptcy by 20% \(Wilson, 2009\).) perform better than those with more men.
1.1.2.4. Con: Men are more likely to risk their own lives for the sake of others. For example, [98.6% of helicopter search and rescue swimmers are male as well as 85.2% of firefighters/paramedics.](https://www.zippia.com/helicopter-search-and-rescue-aircrew-swimmer-jobs/demographics/)
1.1.3. Con: Men make better leaders than women.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Men are [more competitive](https://hbr.org/2019/11/research-how-men-and-women-view-competition-differently) than women.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Competitiveness is not inherently a virtue, even if it has useful applications.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: [Competition](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239043) has led to many of humankind's greatest accomplishments.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Apollo 11 Moon landing was [a result of competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11#Background) fueled by the Cold War.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Competition has led to centuries of violence.
1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: War is often the result of a [competition for resources](https://www.sharing.org/why-nations-need-to-share/conflict-over-resources) that could be solved by resource sharing or redistribution.
1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Economic competition [reduces](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1nk180m7)(We find that higher competition between villages reduces conflict but only up to moderate levels of competition. The conflict-reducing effects of competition are largest in the most ethnically fractionalized and segregated villages and exist regardless of the eventual outcome of the competition. Our results are consistent with external competition favouring coordination within otherwise divided communities and boosting village identity relative to ethnic identity. We find no evidence that competition increases inter-group violence. Our results suggest that economic incentives to compete with out-groups can be beneficial policy mechanisms to favour cooperation and reduce violence within communities.) violent conflict.
1.1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Five wars since 1941 have been fought for [oil](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/5-oil-wars-ended-disaster-14885) resources.
1.1.3.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Wars are fought for [reasons other than resources](https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/The-Main-Reasons-For-War) too.
1.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Violent competition is [not virtuous](https://fee.org/articles/the-virtues-of-competition/). However, non-violent and peaceful competition is virtuous since it is inevitable.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Men are [not more competitive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9639863) than women, but rather what they feel competitive about differs, and thus cannot be compared.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Men are more [interested](https://time.com/4322947/men-women-sports-evolution/) in competitive sports than women.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: More men reach the highest levels of intellectual sports such as [chess](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/nigel-short-uk-grandmaster-men-hardwired-better-chess-players-women), [scrabble](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-017-0905-3), and [go](http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1207/man%E2%80%99s-world-female-go-players-make-strategic-moves).
1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: This is likely due to intelligence, not competitiveness
1.1.3.2. Pro: Men take leadership roles more often than women; this demonstrates the vital trait of proactivity.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Leadership does not equate to being better. There are supportive roles necessary to help the leader do their job.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Many hospitals would not function without nurses, of which women make up the [majority.](https://minoritynurse.com/nursing-statistics/)
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Men often take leadership roles by being [ruthless and aggressive](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160103-do-ruthless-people-really-get-ahead), which are not virtuous qualities.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: A reasonable amount of aggression is a virtuous quality in many leadership contexts, from business to the military.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Women, more than men, [question](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackzenger/2018/04/08/the-confidence-gap-in-men-and-women-why-it-matters-and-how-to-overcome-it/#e1b339f3bfa1) if they truly deserve and can excel in leadership roles. This may indicate that they lead with less confidence which could cause issues.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: In many industries, men still outnumber women in high-ranking leadership positions by [large margins](https://www.jpmorgan.com/commercial-banking/insights/gender-leadership-gap-infographic).
1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: Men are granted [more opportunities](https://hbr.org/2010/09/why-men-still-get-more-promotions-than-women) to take leadership roles than women.
1.1.3.2.4.2. Con: Many women are [overlooked](https://www.womenonbusiness.com/prove-yourself-again-why-women-get-overlooked-for-management-positions/) for leadership positions.
1.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: Of the CEOs who led the Fortune 500 companies in 2018, [only 24 were female](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/2018s-fortune-500-companies-have-just-24-female-ceos.html).
1.1.3.3. Con: During the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, the countries with the best responses were [those with female leaders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2020/04/13/what-do-countries-with-the-best-coronavirus-reponses-have-in-common-women-leaders/).
1.1.3.3.1. Con: This does not mean women are better leaders as a whole, but that they have done well in leading in this particular circumstance.
1.1.3.4. Con: According to research, women score higher than men in most [leadership skills](https://hbr.org/2019/06/research-women-score-higher-than-men-in-most-leadership-skills).
1.1.4. Pro: Women [live longer](https://www.who.int/gho/women_and_health/mortality/life_expectancy_text/en/) than men.
1.1.4.1. Con: Living longer doesn't mean that women are better than men, just that they are fitter, or live safer lives.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Living longer may lead women to consume more resources which could be worse for the planet.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: On average, women have a [smaller carbon footprint](https://climate.org/can-improving-womens-representation-in-environmental-governance-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions/) on their planet. This is possibly because they are more attuned to their impact on the environment, and are willing to modify their behaviors to live more sustainably.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Women live longer because they [take fewer risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-men-often-die-earlier-than-women-201602199137), which render them less vulnerable to dangers and accidents.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Women take fewer risks when it comes to their [physical health](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151001-why-women-live-longer-than-men)(Factors such as smoking, drinking, and overeating may partly explain why size of the gender gap varies so widely between countries. Russian men are likely to die 13 years earlier than Russian women, for instance, partly because they drink and smoke more heavily.) \(e.g., lower rates of drinking and smoking\), compared to men.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Men are [expected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/modern-masculinity-men-fighting-scott-atkinson) to do things that women are not - fight, confront, defend, protect, etc. This may decrease life expectancy.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Men are more likely to fight as part of [ritual bonding](https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/who-men-fight-and-tease-for-fun-bonding/) than women are. This prosocial behaviour is created and maintained by men, and therefore they are responsible for the harms they accrue in this process.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: There is [no evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-men-often-die-earlier-than-women-201602199137) to suggest that, in most countries today, men's life expectancies are lower because of fighting or general violence.
1.1.4.2. Pro: A longer life expectancy may indicate a more responsible lifestyle.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: In the US, the life expectancy gender gap is [6.7](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-life-expectancy-lo/) years, indicating that women are much more responsible than men.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Men appear to have [weaker immune systems](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2013/12/in-men-high-testosterone-can-mean-weakened-immune-response-study-finds.html) which makes them more vulnerable to early death. This undermines the idea that they are being particularly irresponsible.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: [Gender expectations](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10085-male-female-dominated-jobs.html) often force men to take on more dangerous jobs. This means that their actions may be seen as responsible for the good of their community.
1.1.4.3. Con: Men are historically [more likely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/12/19/fatal-employment-men-10-times-more-likely-than-women-to-be-killed-at-work/#5992289c52e8) to take jobs that put their lives at risk than women.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: In 2019, the [Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm) listed 4,761 male deaths in comparison to 386 female deaths related to occupation.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Women are [healthier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3213237) than men.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Women eat [healthier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC128421/).
1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: Women are [more likely](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/statistics-research-eating-disorders) to develop eating disorders.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Not all women eat healthier than men, and not all men eat unhealthy. It is more about the person rather than the gender.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Con: Women are more likely to be [anemic](https://www.medscape.com/answers/198475-155034/how-does-the-prevalence-of-anemia-vary-between-males-and-females), indicating that they are not eating in a healthy manner for their bodies.
1.1.4.4.1.4. Pro: Women tend to make [healthier](https://www.zliving.com/news/science-says-women-healthier-food-choices-men-27543/) food choices than men.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: It is not clear that health and morality are linked, and it can be [harmful](https://www.thetemper.com/the-link-between-food-and-morality-was-a-huge-part-of-my-eating-disorder/) to believe that they are.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: Women's fertility and ability to produce healthy offspring start declining at a much earlier age.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Male sperm quality does not begin to significantly decline [until their 50s](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/sperm-fertility-declines-significantly-after-age-50#Possible-reasons-for-sperm-decline).
1.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Women go through [menopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause) in their 40s and 50s, which among other things lowers and in the end, eliminates ends their fertility.
1.1.4.4.3.2.1. Con: Women [might not be able to conceive naturally after menopause](https://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/menopause-pregnancy), but they can still have kids via [in vitro fertilization](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/in-vitro-fertilization).
1.1.4.4.3.3. Pro: The risk of having a miscarriage dramatically [increases](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l869) for women in their 30s.
1.1.4.4.3.4. Con: Technological progression has introduced options for women to [preserve their fertility](https://www.livestrong.org/we-can-help/fertility-services/fertility-preservation-options-women).
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: Research shows that [women have stronger immune systems than men](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Does-the-Immune-System-Differ-between-Men-and-Women.aspx).
1.1.4.4.4.1. Pro: On average, women develop heart diseases [7 to 10 years later than men](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lifestyle-and-wellness/men-vs-women-whos-healthier).
1.1.4.4.4.1.1. Con: Studies show that the rate of heart attacks is [rising](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20091026/heart-attacks-on-the-rise-in-women) among middle-aged women.
1.1.4.4.4.2. Con: Women are [three times more likely to have autoimmune disorders](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lifestyle-and-wellness/men-vs-women-whos-healthier) compared to men.
1.2. Con: Men have achieved more than women in history.
1.2.1. Pro: Most laws on which legal systems are based have been drafted by men.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The founding fathers of the US Constitution were [men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States).
1.2.1.2. Con: Even if laws were drafted by men, [women](https://www.odi.org/blogs/17443-memory-ruth-bader-ginsburg-using-law-champion-equality-and-non-discrimination) have reinterpreted them to advance equality and fairness.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: It has [by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.) [no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln) [means](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/07/02/day-history-president-lyndon-b-johnson-signed-civil-rights-act-1964) [been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections#Special_elections) [exclusively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela), or even mostly, women that have been advancing a legal legacy of equality and fairness.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Men have shown a stronger conviction for advancing equality than women because men are [more likely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassinated_human_rights_activists) to lose their lives for their beliefs but are not deterred by death.
1.2.1.3. Con: Laws have permitted [gross atrocities](https://theconversation.com/slavery-is-not-a-crime-in-almost-half-the-countries-of-the-world-new-research-115596); influence of legal systems is nothing to be proud of.
1.2.2. Con: Women have the greatest achievement of all - giving birth to every person on Earth.
1.2.2.1. Con: Not all [people](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/the-dad-who-gave-birth-pregnant-trans-freddy-mcconnell) who give birth are women.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Some species reproduce [asexually](https://theconversation.com/virgin-births-from-parthenogenesis-how-females-from-some-species-can-reproduce-without-males-150496)(Parthenogenesis is a Greek word meaning “virgin creation,” but specifically refers to female asexual reproduction. While many people may assume this behavior is the domain of science fiction or religious texts, parthenogenesis is surprisingly common throughout the tree of life and is found in a variety of organisms, including plants, insects, fish, reptiles and even birds.) and therefore do not have a need for men, this may one day be [feasible](https://www.businessinsider.com/could-virginal-birth-be-possible-in-the-future-2013-11?r=US&IR=T) for humans too.
1.2.2.3. Con: Many medical advancements like [vaccinations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/) were developed by men; these advancements extend lives, making men responsible for the continued existence of humanity.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Many women have made [incredible medical achievements](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/celebrating-10-women-medical-pioneers), extending the lives of both men and women.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: A woman discovered that x and y chromosomes are what [determine](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/inventions-and-discoveries-women-in-medicine-national-women-s-hall-of-fame/NgISe0fhWpaELQ?hl=en) the sex of a baby at birth.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Women were completely shut out of the medical field until the mid-19th century.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: The first woman to [earn a medical degree](https://cfmedicine.nlm.nih.gov/physicians/biography_35.html) in the United States did so in 1849.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: In 1866, the [first woman was admitted](https://nyamcenterforhistory.org/2019/05/15/nyams-first-female-fellow-mary-putnam-jacobi/) to Paris' famed École de Médecine.
1.2.2.3.2.3. Con: Medicine was [not professionalised](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book-excerpts/health-article/history-of-midwifery/) until the latter half of the 1800s, prior to this women were often involved as [midwives](https://www.registerednursing.org/articles/history-midwifery/) or [nurses](https://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Nursing.aspx).
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Men [discovered](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22583009/) anesthesia, greatly improving health care outcomes, and the quality of care patients received.
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Ignzas Semmelweis discovered that [bacteria](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/23/ignaz-semmelweis-handwashing-coronavirus/) caused infections so he encouraged doctors to wash their hands prior to assisting in labor to limit risk. This intervention saved the lives of millions of women and ushered in a new era of hygiene.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Compared to men, women are forced to make [more sacrifices](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/06/cost-of-motherhood-on-womens-employment-and-earnings.html) in their personal and professional lives to bear and rear children.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Motherhood is not a defining feature of womanhood and cannot be used as a valid justification for why women are better than men.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: The decision to have children is often motivated by selfish reasons, such as wanting to have a [caretaker](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/12/childless-old-social-care-population-family) when one is old. Thus, childbirth is not essentially evidence of a "better" ethic.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Regardless of their level of employment, women often [bare the brunt](https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article-abstract/7/1/17/596596?redirectedFrom=PDF) of housework and childcare.
1.2.2.5. Con: Not every person alive was born because a woman intended for them to be born. Sexual assault, a lack of reproductive rights, and coerced pregnancy are just some factors that force women into bearing a child.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Historically, women worked as [midwives](https://www.registerednursing.org/articles/history-midwifery/) and were responsible for helping other women give birth.
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: In modern times, the birthing process is often supported and guided by other women in the community, like [doulas](https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-doula-and-how-do-they-help-women-giving-birth-113562).
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: Men doctors lacked knowledge of the birthing process so women had to take the lead until [middle class families began to use doctors](https://www.registerednursing.org/articles/history-midwifery/) in the early 1800s.
1.2.3. Con: The historical achievements of men are likely due to factors that have little to do with inherent talent or moral qualities.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Men, in many societies, have directly [prevented](https://shewillsurvive.com/2020/01/26/overcoming-patriarchal-cultural-norms-and-traditions/)(Degrees of patriarchal behaviour vary from complete control of a woman’s actions and behaviours to unconscious biases in relatively equal societies where outdated traditions can unknowingly favour men and/or be degrading towards women. In some of the strictest cultures men rule and women are limited in their behaviours and are under guardianship \(control\) by an appointed male; women can’t do much without the permission \(sometimes official written permission!\) of said male. This is common in a few parts of the world, but even in the most ‘gender-equal’ countries, there is still an imbalance, and no single country in the world has yet to achieve true gender equality.) women from achieving ambitions beyond the home.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: While men had access to education for millenia, women only got broad access in the [modern age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_education#Modern_period).
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Not all men supported restrictions on women's political involvement; many in history, like [Fredrick Douglass](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/a-short-history-of-male-feminism/372673/), fought for the rights of women.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: [John Stuart Mill](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/1866-suffrage-petition/john-stuart-mill/) published 'The Subjection of Women' in 1866 in regards to equality of the sexes.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: [Roles for women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Crusades)(Women who were of the common people were also present throughout the venture, performing tasks such as removing lice from soldiers' heads and/or washing clothes. In fact, the washerwoman was the only role for a woman approved by the Catholic Church and permitted during the First Crusade, as long as they were unattractive, for fear that the troops would engage with them in sexual relations.) during the Crusades were reduced to removing lice from men's heads or washing clothes - provided the woman was unattractive, out of fear that soldiers would want to engage in adulterous behaviors with her.
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Women did not have the right to vote until quite [recently](https://www.statista.com/chart/23184/year-nations-allowed-women-to-vote-in-national-elections/).
1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: In many places in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage#Europe), women were only granted the right to vote in the late 19th through to early 20th century.
1.2.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appenzell_Innerrhoden#Women's_right_to_vote,_1991) was forced by a court judgement in [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Appenzell_Innerrhoden#Women's_right_to_vote,_1991) to grant women the right to vote.
1.2.3.1.4.2. Con: Suffrage was often [denied](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm)(The three parliamentary reform Acts introduced in 19th-century Britain \(in 1832, 1867 and 1884 respectively\) satisfied moderate reformers rather than radicals. The Prime Minister, Lord Grey, supported reform to 'prevent the necessity of revolution' and was responsible for the first \(or 'Great'\) Reform Act of 1832. However, the Act gave the vote in towns only to men who occupied property with an annual value of £10, which excluded six adult males out of seven from the voting process.) to all but the men in moneyed majority groups - it is reductive to view only women as impeded by voting restrictions.
1.2.3.1.4.3. Pro: In the USA, women's voting began to be recognized in 1848 with the [Seneca Falls Convention](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-rights/seneca-falls-convention).
1.2.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: Women in the US were granted the right to vote in [1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_States).
1.2.3.2. Pro: Conquests and other acts of violence should not be considered virtuous "achievements" by men.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Crusades](https://www.livescience.com/what-were-the-crusades#section-the-first-second-and-third-crusades), led by men, caused huge amounts of violence and destabilised regions which likely decreased quality of life. Though espoused as religiously righteous, these were unlikely to be moral.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Men spend more of their time engaging in pointless [one-upsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-upmanship), which accounts for many things that men consider achievements.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Frequently, [international arms races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race) and other pointless comparative contests result from one-upsmanship.
1.2.3.3. Pro: History is a practice driven by men, as such women were left out of many accounts of the past.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Some have argued that the construction of genius throughout history has been so [exclusionary](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/retrospective/why-have-there-been-no-great-women-artists-4201/) that no woman has yet fit the definition.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: That men have been more assertive than women in recording their achievements is not a reason to believe women are better than men.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Men [routinely plagiarized](http://ecosalon.com/5-women-scientists-discoveries-stolen-by-a-man/) women's achievements in scientific discovery.
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Historical accounts have often [purposely ignored](http://kjonnsforskning.no/en/2019/09/womens-historical-contributions-are-still-ignored) the role women have played in important events.
1.2.3.4. Con: There are many historical achievements made by men that rely on inherent talents and moral qualities.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: [Many](https://analyticsindiamag.com/party-loving-genius-john-von-neumann-changed-how-we-see-the-world-through-game-theory/) of the [geniuses](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/) who have revolutionised maths and science are [men](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/a-math-genius-like-no-other-comes-to-the-big-screen/).
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Many [African-American men](https://theundefeated.com/features/the-undefeated-44-most-influential-black-americans-in-history/#barack-obama) are noted for historical achievements that required talent or a moral compass.
1.2.4. Con: Women were heavily oppressed for most of history casting doubt on if this is do to the superiority of men or the suppression of women.
1.2.4.1. Pro: This is a result of women being excluded from public life, and being written out of history by men.
1.2.5. Pro: More men than women contributed to building the world.
1.2.5.1. Con: The world built by men is not a desirable one.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Rampant exploitation of natural resources has led to [climate change](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58138714) which will harm many.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Only [1 woman](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article234922662.html) is on the Forbes 100 Innovators list.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Only one woman was recognized by Forbes. This does not mean only one has contributed.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Only [8%](https://brandongaille.com/fortune-100-ceo-statistics-and-demographics/) of women are in the top 100 Fortune companies.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Women have [historically](https://www.aauw.org/research/barriers-and-bias/) been discriminated against in corporate fields. Their lack of contribution is plausibly due to the lack of equal opportunity to do so.
1.2.5.4. Con: Men have been given [greater opportunities](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831740-400-the-origins-of-sexism-how-men-came-to-rule-12000-years-ago/) to achieve more in patriarchal societies.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Effectively, on average, societies in the past centuries have been given more relevancy and voice to men, due to diverse reasons but mainly focused on their distinctive roles stigma.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Women did not have a voice until the last two centuries, which led to worldwide progress.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: It was not until the emergence of ideologies like [Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) and the [World Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) that women's empowerment was boosted by letting them have different, unusual roles.
1.2.5.4.2.1. Pro: Under these situations, feminism was [formed](https://www.pacificu.edu/magazine/four-waves-feminism) and [gained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism) widespread recognition.
1.2.5.5. Con: Regardless of their roles, almost everyone does contribute on their own no matter if it's something massively important or just simple.
1.2.5.6. Pro: Most noted conquerors have been men.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: Most conquerors and explorers have been [exceptionally violent](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/columbus-pizarro-and-other-world-explorers-ranked-by-how-many-they-killed) which facilitated their ventures.
1.2.5.6.2. Pro: [Christopher Columbus](https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus), the Italian explorer who stumbled upon the Americas, was a man.
1.2.5.6.2.1. Con: Christopher Columbus was known to slaughter and [rape](https://www.history.com/news/sexual-assault-rome-slavery-columbus-jim-crow) the Native Americans in order to conquer their land.
1.2.5.6.2.2. Con: The apparent successes of Columbus was predicated on exploitation of women and others.
1.2.6. Con: Men, by virtue of their heavier participation in political life, have done more evil than women.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Most wars have been started by men.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: There appears to be a [reduction](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders)(That gain is significant: Caprioli’s data shows that, as the number of women in parliament increases by 5 per cent, a state is five times less likely to use violence when confronted with an international crisis \(perhaps because women are more likely to use a ‘collective or consensual approach’ to conflict resolution\).) in the use of state violence with an increased percentage of female politicians.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Throughout history, [queens were more likely](https://qz.com/967895/throughout-history-women-rulers-were-more-likely-to-wage-war-than-men/)(\[...\]we don’t often think of queens as warmongers.\n\nBut apparently, they were. In fact, between 1480 and 1913, Europe’s queens were 27% more likely than its kings to wage war, according to a National Bureau of Economics working paper.) to [wage war](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23337)(We find that polities led by queens were more likely to engage in war than polities led by kings.) than kings.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: There is [not enough data](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders)(Throughout history, women leaders have been extremely rare. Between 1950 and 2004, according to data compiled by Katherine W Phillips, professor of leadership and ethics at Columbia Business School, just 48 national leaders across 188 countries – fewer than 4 per cent of all leaders – have been female. They included 18 presidents and 30 prime ministers. Two countries, Ecuador and Madagascar, had a woman leader, each of whom served for a mere two days before being replaced by a man.) available to say that women, if given the chance, would not follow this pattern.
1.2.6.1.4. Con: Of all European sovereigns, [married queens](https://qz.com/967895/throughout-history-women-rulers-were-more-likely-to-wage-war-than-men/) launched more wars than unmarried queens and kings.
1.2.6.1.5. Pro: [Male competition over mates and resources](https://theconversation.com/why-war-evolved-to-be-a-mans-game-and-why-thats-only-now-changing-101473) is likely to have caused them to start and be more involved in warfare.
1.2.6.2. Con: Women were [not permitted](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-ushistory/chapter/the-role-of-women-in-the-colonies/) to hold positions of influence when most evils took place. This does not mean they would not commit evil.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Women have committed [war crimes](https://theconversation.com/why-its-important-to-see-women-as-capable-of-terrible-atrocities-149877) and other historical atrocities, these are likely ommitted though due to sexist stereotypes of harm.
1.2.6.3. Pro: More [genocides have been committed by men](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/genocide-timeline) than by women.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: Women have had fewer opportunities but [show the same moral capability while using their gender to avoid the normal legal repercussions and infamy.](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=32736)(Women as War Criminals argues that women are just as capable as men of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. In addition to unsettling assumptions about women as agents of peace and reconciliation, the book highlights the gendered dynamics of law, and demonstrates that women are adept at using gender instrumentally to fight for better conditions and reduced sentences when war ends.\n\nThe book presents the legal cases of four women: the President \(Biljana Plavšić\), the Minister \(Pauline Nyiramasuhuko\), the Soldier \(Lynndie England\), and the Student \(Hoda Muthana\). Each woman's complex identity influenced her treatment by legal systems and her ability to mount a gendered defense before the court. Justice, as Steflja and Trisko Darden show, is not blind to gender.)
1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: Women [committed atrocities](https://theconversation.com/why-its-important-to-see-women-as-capable-of-terrible-atrocities-149877)(Decades later, the United Nations international tribunals that investigated atrocities committed in Rwanda and Yugoslavia in the 1990s brought, in each instance, only one woman to justice.\n\nWomen were overlooked by international tribunals despite their involvement in perpetrating violence because they were rarely in positions to command others. Nonetheless, Rwandan women participated in murders of adults and children, revealed hiding spots to killing squads and refused to feed refugees. Some of the thousands of women who served in military units across the former Yugoslavia participated in ethnic cleansing by committing extrajudicial killings and acts of torture.) during the Rwandan and Yugoslavian civil wars in the 1990s, but international courts held only two women accountable for their actions.
1.2.6.3.1.2. Pro: Simone Gbagbo [avoided being held accountable](https://theconversation.com/why-its-important-to-see-women-as-capable-of-terrible-atrocities-149877)(The same double standard prevails in the 21st century. The only woman indicted in the 20-year history of the International Criminal Court is Simone Gbagbo, the former first lady of Cote d’Ivoire.\n\nGbagbo was indicted in 2012 on four counts of crimes against humanity, sexual violence and persecution for her role in the violence that followed her husband’s loss in the 2011 elections. In 2015, she was convicted of undermining the security of the state and sentenced to 20 years in prison by an Ivorian court. She was later acquitted of crimes against humanity and in 2018 received a presidential pardon. She was ultimately never brought before the International Criminal Court.) for four counts of crimes against humanity, sexual violence, persecution, and undermining the security of the state.
1.2.6.4. Pro: [Almost all dictators](https://www.ranker.com/list/list-of-famous-dictators/reference) have been men.
1.3. Con: Both of these genders are equal.
1.3.1. Pro: Any apparent differences among genders are a result of [culture and society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_essentialism#Social_construction_of_gender), and not due to essential characteristics.
1.3.2. Pro: There are too many substantial [within-group differences](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-606581.pdf) among women and men for us to be able to meaningfully examine between-group differences.
1.3.2.1. Con: Women are very similar to one another, whilst men have [greater variation](https://qz.com/1218680/the-science-of-sex-differences-is-nothing-for-feminists-to-be-afraid-of/)(This history has translated into a curious phenomenon observed in modern human populations—greater male variability. Women and men are—on average—pretty much equivalent in intelligence and ability, but if you look at the far ends of the spectrum, you are more likely to find men than women. It’s not as though variability grants men some unqualified evolutionary bounty; variability goes both ways, landing men disproportionately in both the ranks of virtuosity and in jail. To quote the social psychologist Roy Baumeister, “Super-genius and severely retarded are both mostly boys’ clubs, though a few exceptional girls do show up too. Something in the biology of maleness produces more cases at both extremes.”) in their gene expression and talent pool.
1.3.3. Pro: Research suggests that people associate more positive attributes with women compared to men. This psychological bias is known as the [Women-are-wonderful effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women-are-wonderful_effect). We have no evidence to suggest that women are better, just that our views are prejudiced.
1.3.4. Pro: One's gender identity does not make them better. It is their personality that determines if they are good or not.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Gender is a [social construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender) that has [changed](https://time.com/magazine/us/4703292/march-27th-2017-vol-189-no-11-u-s/) throughout history.
1.3.4.2. Con: If a gender identity encourages one set of actions over another, then on aggregate people in that group may be more likely to take those actions, indicating a tendency towards moral or immoral behaviour.
1.3.4.3. Pro: A person's choices make up what kind of person they are, not their gender.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: A generalized statement about a gender will never be accurate, as individuals will always have more variation and difference than similarities to the group.
1.3.4.4. Con: It depends on the objective. One might consider somebody better because they are more morally correct, while others may not.
1.3.4.5. Pro: There exist between [8-16 types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences) of personalities physiologically, all of them performing and behaving differently. They might be better or worse in certain aspects, but definitely, that doesn't make them worse overall.
1.3.5. Con: The two genders are complementary, not equal.
1.3.5.1. Con: While it may be the case that men and women are complementary in some facets of life, it does not follow that they are entirely complementary.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: The area where these two genders are most complementary is in [reproductive matters](https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=100943), which are not reflective of a broader equivalence between them in other matters.
1.3.5.2. Con: Individuals can be equal, while not the same. If men and women are equally complementary to each other, then it must be accepted that they are equal.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Men and women are comparatively different, but [complement each other](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/youth/learn/yw/marriage-and-family/roles?lang=eng). Thus comparing them will always result in inaccuracies.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Men and women are like yin and yang, according to traditional [Chinese principles](https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/). Both have beneficial qualities that complement each other, but cannot be compared.
1.3.6. Pro: There is no objective scale of goodness.
1.3.6.1. Con: There are objective scales in a lot of different factors, which can contribute to the understanding of whether one gender is better than another.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Men and women benefit from rich cooperation between the sexes, thus the factors that would make one better than another can't be isolated.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: Bill Gates would clearly dominate many of these objective scales, yet without his mother, he would not exist.
1.3.6.1.1.2. Pro: Many men were able to achieve remarkable success because they had [supportive spouses](https://brightside.me/inspiration-relationships/its-official-now-a-mans-success-depends-on-the-woman-he-marries-and-vice-versa-795191/).
1.3.6.1.2. Con: The relevance of factors does not stay the same and are likely to chance.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Pro: The [factors that were relevant during WW2](https://www.lcps.org/cms/lib/VA01000195/Centricity/Domain/10599/Causes%20of%20WWII.pdf) are not the same as those that would be relevant during prolonged peace.
1.3.6.2. Pro: The perception and definition of "good" depends on the social, religious, and ethnic context.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: This makes it harder to decide whether or not to act kind.
1.3.6.3. Con: The different characteristics and experiences that men and women have create different outcomes in the lives of both. Even if a comparison is intrinsically impossible, we can contrast the effects of their differences.
1.3.6.4. Pro: There is no generally accepted way to determine whether or not men or women are better than each other.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: Comparing genders without defining a specific role that one gender should be better at, is very hard.
1.3.7. Con: The persistence of two sexes in evolution suggests that we are complementary.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Evolution benefits from being able to relegate certain tasks such as physical confrontation or warfare to the sex that is more muscular and bigger \(which is metabolically costly\).
1.3.7.2. Pro: The ability to specialize - as evidenced by our modern economy - enhances efficiency.
1.3.7.3. Pro: If one sex was superior, it seems strange that evolution has seen it fit to have a 50-50 distribution.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: On average, there are [105 males born for every 100 females](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/global-0)(The World Health Organization says the natural sex ratio at birth is about 105 boys to every 100 girls and its best to have equal numbers of men and women in a society. You need a few extra boys for balance, because men die earlier.), which is not a 50-50 distribution.
1.3.7.3.1.1. Pro: In specific regions of [India and Indonesia](https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio#the-sex-ratio-varies-with-birth-order), the sex ratio at birth reaches as high as 182 boys per 100 girls.
1.3.7.3.1.2. Con: The marginally higher male birth rate compensates for their [increased](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23151996/) infant mortality rate.
1.3.7.4. Con: Being complimentary is not relevant to being better or worse. One can be complimentary and better, and vice versa.
1.3.8. Pro: [Research suggests](https://www.apa.org/research/action/difference) that the sexes are far more similar than dissimilar.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Today, women are more likely to display [masculine characteristics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-human-beast/200908/why-modern-women-behave-more-men); this breaks down binaristic views of personality and gender.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: If women display masculine characteristics, i.e. characteristics men historically have claimed as exclusive to them, then those characteristics are not exclusive to men.
1.3.8.1.2. Con: The fact that more women display masculine characteristics might be explained by the status associated with [gender performativity](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_performativity).
1.3.8.2. Pro: A [2005 analysis](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050919082317.htm) suggests that men and women are alike "[in terms of personality, cognitive ability, and leadership \[skills\].](https://www.apa.org/research/action/difference)"
1.3.8.3. Pro: Males and females share similar "[brain anatomy, brain function, cognition, and behavior.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6013760/)"
1.3.9. Con: Men and women have been [socialized in different ways](https://www.sparknotes.com/sociology/socialization/section4/). It is possible to compare and evaluate the expectations and behaviors that men and women often conform to.
1.3.9.1. Pro: At a very young age, children learn what it means to be a [boy or girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender#Infancy_and_young_childhood) in society.
1.3.9.2. Pro: [Life history mechanisms](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01709/full) explain how gender norms have evolved across time and established themselves as stereotypes in modern society.
1.4. Con: Men have better physical appearance and abilities than women.
1.4.1. Pro: Men are able to do more demanding physical activities.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Men have the ability to [run faster than women](https://www.livescience.com/59289-why-men-run-faster-than-women.html).
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: A man's leg is about [80% muscle, compared with about 60% muscle in a woman's leg](https://www.livescience.com/59289-why-men-run-faster-than-women.html). This extra muscle helps them run faster.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Men can lift more absolute weight than women.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: In the Olympics weight category, the [male record is higher for weightlifting \(169KG\) compared to females \(123KG\)](https://www.wsmv.com/news/weightlifting-recap-records-fall-in-mens-56kg-and-womens-53kg/article_a7621f67-9329-534e-a8f1-870b5f2e2950.html).
1.4.1.3. Con: This is inverse when considering the [flexibility of the body](https://www.yogauonline.com/yogau-wellness-blog/yoga-practice-tips-are-men-really-less-flexible-women).
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Men are [more likely than women](https://www.yogauonline.com/yogau-wellness-blog/yoga-practice-tips-are-men-really-less-flexible-women) to sustain major injuries from yoga.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: Flexibility is [impacted by age](https://arapc.com/maintaining-flexibility-with-aging/), not physical capabilities.
1.4.1.3.3. Pro: Women are more flexible than men because of the "[makeup of their connective tissue](https://alexanderorthopaedics.com/blog/why-are-some-individuals-more-flexible-than-others/)."
1.4.1.4. Pro: On average, men are [stronger than women](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171027-what-if-women-were-physically-stronger-than-men).
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The [larger testosterone levels found in men](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323085) enable them to naturally reach peak levels of strength much faster than women.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Due to puberty, men tend to develop [greater bone density and muscle mass](https://unsplash.com/photos/Ga6z9QD8yvw). This helps them in many tasks requiring strength and/or endurance.
1.4.1.4.3. Con: The differences in strength between men and women are [narrowing](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171027-what-if-women-were-physically-stronger-than-men).
1.4.1.4.4. Pro: Men have [40% more upper-body strength and 33% more lower body strength](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jappl.2000.89.1.81) compared to women.
1.4.1.4.5. Con: Women are [biologically stronger](https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a14852324/women-stronger-than-men/) than men.
1.4.1.4.5.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/4/E832.full) indicate that under extreme conditions such as famines and epidemics, women are able to survive longer than men.
1.4.1.4.5.2. Pro: Studies indicate that women [have a higher threshold for pain](https://www.you.co.uk/women-have-a-higher-pain-threshold-than-men/).
1.4.1.4.5.2.1. Con: This is not unanimously agreed on by scientists. Many [human studies also show](https://news.psu.edu/story/141291/2008/11/10/research/probing-question-do-women-have-higher-pain-threshold-men) that men have higher pain thresholds than women.
1.4.1.5. Con: Women have tackled the hardest physical achievements, just like men.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Women's [weightlifting records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_records_in_weightlifting) are substantially inferior to men's.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: Even if it is the case that women have accomplished the same feats as men, in many cases, men were able to achieve them first.
1.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: The first person to reach the [summit of Everest was a man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary).
1.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: The first handheld cellular mobile phone was invented by a [man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Cooper_\(inventor\)).
1.4.1.5.2.3. Con: It is likely that women assisted them to achieve these accomplishments, but they were not given due credit.
1.4.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: [Female codebreakers](https://time.com/5928583/elizebeth-friedman-codebreaker/) who helped win WWII are not credited or celebrated as much as their [male counterparts](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/our-story/bletchley-park-people/who-were-the-codebreakers).
1.4.1.5.3. Pro: Women sometimes [beat](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/49248126) men in extreme endurance races.
1.4.1.5.3.1. Con: There have been [6 races held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcontinental_Race) and only one woman won. This is only an anomaly.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1. Con: With only [15% of competitors being females](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/49248126), one female winner for 6 races is expected if sex isn't a factor; her win is not an anomaly.
1.4.1.5.4. Con: If both genders tackled the hardest physical achievements, that would thus mean women are equal to men, and not better.
1.4.1.5.5. Pro: Women have conquered these achievements despite being physically [less strong](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477683) than men. To do so shows a level of determination and will above men.
1.4.1.5.6. Pro: Women have been to [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride), [Mount Everest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junko_Tabei), the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Bancroft) and [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Antarctica) Pole and complete the [hardest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_World_Championship#Women_2) sport events.
1.4.1.5.6.1. Con: They have yet to become as successful as men in doing so.
1.4.2. Con: Physical attraction is subjective. Each person is attracted to different aspects of a person which can largely differ from another individual.
1.4.3. Con: Higher physical capability also means that men are more [violent](https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/violence-against-women-1959171-Feb2015/) than women.
1.4.3.1. Con: Greater physical ability does not imply more violence. Giant Pandas are both larger and stronger but are not aggressive unless threatened.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Men, in all societies, commit the great majority of violent crime.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Men, in all societies, commit the [overwhelming majority of sexual violence](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/guidelines_chap2.pdf). \(p. 6\)
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: [Sexual violence](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/) committed by women is severely under-reported and under-studied.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Men often [under-report violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_men#Female_violence_against_men) experienced from women, due to societal expectations of masculinity.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: A woman winning a fight with a man is empowering. The man winning the same fight would be called cruel.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Male victims of sexual violence are [discouraged](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault-men-and-boys) from reporting the offences against them, both by societal and legal systems.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [Duluth Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model) of domestic violence places that in a domestic altercation, the man is always at fault even if he is the victim of violence.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: In the [UK](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-49057533), a woman cannot commit rape, and even a man being forced to have sex with a woman at knifepoint can only hope for significantly lesser charges.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: According to a 2010 survey in the US, [90%](https://www.dividedstatesofwomen.com/2017/11/2/16597768/sexual-assault-men-himthough) of perpetrators of sexual violence against women are men.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: This is [due to](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/boys-country-are-hurting-we-can-help-ncna851901) societal upbringing and expectations which means it can change.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: There is [more pressure on men than on women for bringing in money](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/). Such pressure can, at least in part, explain why men commit more crimes than women.
1.4.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: When faced with family financial struggles, men are more likely to try riskier ways to bring in money than women, which may lead to crimes being committed.
1.4.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: In the US, around [71% of adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/20/americans-see-men-as-the-financial-providers-even-as-womens-contributions-grow/) hold the view that good husbands should support their family financially.
1.4.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Such pressure is likely to exist due to the [gender wage gap](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/does-society-still-put-pressure-on-husbands-to-earn-more-than-their-wives-2018-08-21).
1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: [About 55%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842006/#!po=36.6667) of one's probability to commit a violent crime is due to genetics, not upbringing.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: In the US, [men more than double](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/42tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_42_arrests_by_sex_2012.xls) the amount of women in murder, manslaughter, and rape.
1.4.3.2.4. Pro: Women commit dramatically less [serious crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime).
1.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: Statistically, men are reported to commit more [criminal acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime) than women.
1.4.3.2.4.2. Con: Many women support criminal and antisocial behavior in men, which makes them equally as bad.
1.4.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: Women often [do not report violence](https://jech.bmj.com/content/58/7/536) committed by their male partners.
1.4.3.2.4.2.2. Con: Even if this is the case, if it is ultimately the man committing the immoral act, they are more responsible as it is their action.
1.4.3.2.4.3. Con: Women do score [higher on agreeableness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/) and [lower on aggression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5942158/), yet those traits are a big disadvantage during invasions, war, or competition.
1.4.3.2.4.3.1. Con: If women are more agreeable, and more women were in positions of power, the disadvantage would be unlikely to manifest because there would be less war.
1.4.3.2.4.3.2. Con: In the current day, traits that are advantageous during war and invasion are of little use.
1.4.3.2.4.3.3. Con: Despite the fact that women score higher on agreeableness than men, they fall within a [similar range of agreeableness scores](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/). \(Figure 10\)
1.4.3.2.4.3.4. Con: Women score lower on aggression because [relatively little is known about women’s aggression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5942158/).
1.4.3.3. Con: Women may be less physically violent but they use more emotional and mental abuse instead.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Women bully others in a more subtle way than men by [using social aggression and/or alienation](https://psychbc.com/blog/bullying-boys-and-girls-are-different).
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Women face [greater amounts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3876290/) of non-physical abuse, most often in the form of social isolation and property damage.
1.4.3.4. Con: Many women are [violent](https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article-pdf/167/6/445/24217129/milmed-167-6-445.pdf) in their relationships. However, this fact has not gotten a lot of attention historically. \(p. 445\)
1.4.3.5. Pro: The greater physical capabilities of men is a large contributing factor as to the [degree of male on female crime](https://www.tutor2u.net/sociology/reference/statistics-on-gender-and-crime).
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: The greater physical abilities have led to greater levels of seriousness of injury when men act violently.
1.4.3.6. Pro: As women gain equality, [societies become more peaceful](https://www.inclusivesecurity.org/publication/why-women-inclusive-security-and-peaceful-societies/).
1.4.3.6.1. Con: The [source admits](https://www.inclusivesecurity.org/publication/why-women-inclusive-security-and-peaceful-societies/)(Statistical analysis of the largest dataset on the status of women in the world today shows that where women are more empowered in multiple spheres of life, countries are less likely to go to war with their neighbors, to be in bad standing with the international community, or to be rife with crime and violence within their society. The causal direction is not yet clear...) it is unclear whether women gaining equality causes societies to become more peaceful or societies becoming more peaceful causes women to gain equality.
1.4.3.6.2. Pro: Men, in all societies, initiate the majority of the violence that is legitimized by the body public or by the state.
1.4.3.6.2.1. Con: This claim assumes that, in the absence of men, women would not participate in violence. The socio-political forces that reward warlike behavior do not vanish with men.
1.4.3.6.2.2. Con: Between 1480 and 1913, European queens were [27% more likely](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23337/w23337.pdf) to start wars than kings. \(p. 2\)
1.4.3.6.3. Pro: [Bonobo](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/bonobos-join-chimps-closest-human-relatives#) society is matriarchial and is far more peaceful, cooperative and playful than Chimps.
1.4.3.6.3.1. Pro: Humans have somewhere between [97-99.6% genetic](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/bonobos-join-chimps-closest-human-relatives#) similarity with Bonobos.
1.4.3.6.4. Con: More peaceful societies have the luxury of revising their policies to be more inclusive.
1.4.3.6.5. Con: The creation of "peace" usually has more to do with [increasing technology](https://www.usip.org/publications/2018/05/how-peace-tech-changing-global-conflict), not women's rights.
1.4.3.6.5.1. Con: Peace is bred through the general expectations that exist within a society. Where more people have adverse feelings towards violence, it will decrease.
1.4.3.7. Con: Being non-violent does not imply being better. Violence can be a great quality and necessary for survival.
1.4.3.7.1. Pro: The capability of violence is a deterrent that leads to peace.
1.4.3.7.2. Pro: Violence can be the [determining factor](https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-violence-works/) between nations that exist and those that do not survive.
1.4.3.7.3. Con: Masculinity has often [glamorized violence](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/newsletter/2018/09/harmful-masculinity), leading to its being used in inappropriate situations where it causes more harm.
1.4.4. Con: Women are more beautiful than men.
1.4.4.1. Con: Beauty is subjective and not a good indication of whether men or women are better.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: [Moral-beauty](http://xhttps://aeon.co/essays/how-virtue-morphs-into-beauty-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder)(Here’s what I think: beauty and morality, and ugliness and immorality, are intrinsically linked. Specifically, the moral virtues – honesty, kindness, fairness, empathy, etc – are beautiful character traits, and the moral vices – their contraries – are ugly. I mean this quite literally. Of course, the kind of beauty or ugliness in question is independent of physical appearances – it belongs to characters and actions. Drawing on the 18th-century British philosophical tradition, and the work of the contemporary philosopher Berys Gaut at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, I label this the moral-beauty view.) theories argue that people interpret others as increasingly more beautiful when they are good people.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: By this logic, anyone collectively seen as being not beautiful is inferior. This perspective is harmful to society.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: Such a belief would justify the bullying and discrimination of others on the basis of their physical appearance.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: [Beauty standards](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/beauty-standards/) have changed through time, therefore, they can not be considered as a tool for comparison.
1.4.4.1.4. Con: Most communities throughout history have thought of physical beauty as [very important](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/dating-and-mating/201701/why-physical-attraction-matters-and-when-it-might-not).
1.4.4.2. Pro: Women in a few countries are often seen as more [beautiful](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201101/women-are-more-beautiful-men) than men when it comes to physical attractiveness.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Women are cultured into focusing on their beauty and their appearance more than men. Thus this apparent superiority is the result of greater care, attention and focus placed on appearance.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: The use of products and procedures to enhance appearance are more normalised for women.
1.4.4.3. Con: Beauty is an intraspecies evolutionary heuristic. A fruitfly would consider Angelina Jolie to be ugly, and vice versa.
1.4.5. Pro: Men have [bigger brains](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00185/full).
1.4.5.1. Con: Even though men have bigger brains, their brain [shrinks faster than the female brain as they age](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/13/us/men-s-brains-shrink-faster-than-women-s-researchers-say.html).
1.4.5.2. Con: There is no link between brain size and actual intelligence.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Whales have the [biggest brains in the world](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/extreme-mammals/extreme-bodies/brains), but it doesn't make them the smartest creatures.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Male brains tend to have [slightly higher total brain volume](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/study-finds-some-significant-differences-brains-men-and-women) than female ones.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: This is likely because on average, males have a [larger body size](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15746999/).
1.4.5.3.1.1. Con: Even when clinical results are adjusted for males' larger body size, the [results still favor men](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/study-finds-some-significant-differences-brains-men-and-women).
1.5. Pro: Women empathize better than men.
1.5.1. Pro: Women are [more likely](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/social-and-lifestyle/the-eco-gender-gap-71-of-women-try-to-live-more-ethically-compared-to-59-of-men) than men to attempt to live ethically.
1.5.1.1. Con: The [vast majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassinated_human_rights_activists) of human rights activists who have died risking their lives fighting for humane treatment have been men.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Women hurt and kill fewer animals, by [eating less meat](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200214-the-mystery-of-why-there-are-more-women-vegans).
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Men often hold onto meat eating as a way of [protecting](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119831801)(An internet-based experiment shows that experiencing a masculinity threat leads men to express more attachment to meat consumption. In study 3, lab experiment data with a different experimental manipulation and study population again indicate that threats to masculinity influence men’s meat preferences. These results support the claim that men’s masculinity maintenance may be one factor contributing to gender differences in meat consumption and health disparities related to overconsumption of meat.) their masculinity.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: Killing an animal is not a bad quality per se, by that rule every carnivore would be a bad animal.
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: A survey conducted in the US indicated that [just 24% of vegans are men](https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Faunalytics_Current-Former-Vegetarians_Full-Report.pdf). \(p. 5\)
1.5.2. Con: Empathy does not necessarily imply superiority.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Strong feelings of empathy can sometimes be a [deterrent](https://theconversation.com/understanding-others-feelings-what-is-empathy-and-why-do-we-need-it-68494)(However, this is not always the case. Empathy can also inhibit social actions, or even lead to amoral behaviour. For example, someone who sees a car accident and is overwhelmed by emotions witnessing the victim in severe pain might be less likely to help that person.) to moral action.
1.5.2.2. Con: Empathy is one of the [most important](https://theconversation.com/understanding-others-feelings-what-is-empathy-and-why-do-we-need-it-68494)(Empathy is important because it helps us understand how others are feeling so we can respond appropriately to the situation. It is typically associated with social behaviour and there is lots of research showing that greater empathy leads to more helping behaviour.) abilities a human being can develop; as [understanding and sympathizing](https://theconversation.com/understanding-others-feelings-what-is-empathy-and-why-do-we-need-it-68494) with the feelings of others is a necessary part of communicating and operating within societies.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Being more empathetic can make individuals more [willing to justify cruelty](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/19/think-empathy-makes-world-better-place-think-again) against those they do not empathize with.
1.5.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19476221) suggests that female adolescents display more cognitive and emotional empathy than male adolescents.
1.5.3.1. Con: The sample size of the study is too limited to make a definitive conclusion, only 505 adolescents aged between 13 and 16 years participated in the study.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Whilst the sample size could be higher, it is [large enough](https://www.tools4dev.org/resources/how-to-choose-a-sample-size/) to give information that is statistically significant.
1.5.4. Con: It is not that men are less empathetic, society just puts [pressure](https://theconversation.com/act-tough-and-hide-weakness-research-reveals-pressure-young-men-are-under-74898) on them not to reveal emotion. This makes them seem less empathetic.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Some think that men are less empathetic as they are [less likely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/03/11/do-boys-lack-empathy-if-so-perhaps-its-because-they-give-what-they-get/?sh=2a3e5e7a7079) to experience it.
1.5.5. Pro: Men take less responsibility for their sexual activity than women.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Women live with the [consequences of pregnancy](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/24/686790727/fourth-trimester-problems-can-have-long-term-effects-on-a-moms-health) longer than men do, so they take more responsibility for their actions.
1.5.5.2. Con: Women take more responsibility than men in sex, not because they are better, but because they assume more consequences when something goes wrong.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: [AMAB](https://genderkit.org.uk/identity/amab/) people [cannot get pregnant](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-men-become-pregnant), this may make them more laissez-faire about sexual interactions.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: It is [riskier for a woman](https://medium.com/\@lincolnblake/the-importance-of-not-inviting-strangers-over-to-your-house-33efe82dfdf9) to invite a stranger into their bed.
1.5.5.3. Pro: There are more single mothers [than](https://www.verywellfamily.com/single-parent-census-data-2997668) single fathers.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: The socialised role of the mother as [default](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-default-parent_b_6031128) primary parent may contribute to there being more single mothers than fathers. Parents may assume when they split that a mother should have custody.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: The responsibility of pregnancy is primarily the woman's to bear since they carry the child.
1.5.5.3.3. Con: Without knowing why there are more single mothers than fathers, it cannot be said that women are better than men in this case.
1.5.5.3.3.1. Pro: [More men serve](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military) and die in the military than women. This is a contributing factor in there being more single mothers than fathers.
1.5.5.3.3.2. Pro: Some women [choose](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/parenting/single-moms-by-choice-photos.html) to raise children on their own. This does not make them better than men.
1.5.5.3.4. Pro: According to the US Census data, approximately [80.4% of custodial parents are mothers](https://www.verywellfamily.com/single-parent-census-data-2997668).
1.6. Pro: Women are smarter than men.
1.6.1. Con: Men are more rational than women.
1.6.1.1. Con: This has been [shown to be false](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2016/02/03/ovulating-women-are-more-economically-rational-than-men/#.XH9ZsigzbIU); even ovulating women are as rational as men.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Men are better at chess. So much so that they had to [recalibrate the rating system so it would be easier for women to earn the same titles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system)
1.6.1.2.1. Con: Men being better at chess is [due to](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/mens-chess-superiority-explained-08-12-29/) population size rather than ability to rationalize.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Even if population size could explain the variance for 100%, men would still be drawn much more to rational games than women.
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: As of 2015, there were only [two women](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-only-two-of-the-world-s-top-100-chess-players-women) in the top 100 chess players in the world.
1.6.1.2.3. Pro: Out of 1479 grandmasters in chess, only [31 are women](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-only-two-of-the-world-s-top-100-chess-players-women).
1.6.1.2.4. Con: Chess was [not always male-dominated](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-only-two-of-the-world-s-top-100-chess-players-women). In the past, more women were involved in the game.
1.6.1.2.4.1. Pro: In [medieval Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_in_the_Middle_Ages), women played chess [while recovering from childbirth](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-only-two-of-the-world-s-top-100-chess-players-women).
1.6.1.3. Pro: Men are [better](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/08/resolving-conflict-men-vs-women/) at resolving conflicts than women who may hold grudges.
1.6.1.4. Con: Men are more reckless and foolhardy than women.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: Risk taking is often [encouraged](https://watermark.silverchair.com/23-1-33.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqEwggKdBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKOMIICigIBADCCAoMGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMfcVdKzEEx1aRFmJUAgEQgIICVEd9ozR91H4XNrfOnlX9EvNIyTo7a6UsLrvZHW9ZWK0yjkwC_h-gSmZbO9vTPH9y4etIgQHfft8Zi8Pdtv_C-svrb6ngphAkrdPz7Nlj0KopTGuMKnc5iFfAMzuJva4bTu0j4JJXCud8xJsAwYyq7yTkqcXo-yMRJh8M7_oSuF00RrmUOIY9BZ7fZFoJkf-kMH01eviIyj318r1-khwZIwBix9vHlriUkLw3MQgLRC8fvZ10Wt-lHQblBsfnp3DcGzbbkNKhUAkGr8IVdtmwMz9lh6YPyMy1P2gpR9TK3NICabNgsKYTZ49efdODQMBi7uMVH_vO2ms2L1SRqRKJqVi29Wr0XOpuDVx8MjrcyRswafn2rwR33cpQMkBDO6alprezJCQGv0Stf6eGSy9-HSX7t17gpvJJ_Jwa9E4jRTn1ZUmg1zI_pyKmiUWshyMfOZq7VE7TcUJqAIRluS6lndTpJaVIZMtc7yDnSuqI-8EZzNURgG5d6kZh9VH3kieGocrbDaRpoZcVrtEzNu-a4wu9rtT_MjqoSbpnS7w-ml7atgZjthyzFjPNp2Vtr1QfjHjIbknOF8MIP2nqjPf_yK7XWhPsEXzUPSw_8lkjwmj1N7wtPmcamOecvImfYIgPxoPipWVrZoak1UHNh7Efo9JVKuSQ-Zrf7obDHSq4T8P4qgp3N0Tf3ItcTy5DfinTCKscqJwMPViG7OeHi-BB5LOpAKBKCn25TAEzyX4kAW0KixYgp5YhbvRNEf117GpY_d2IJ6MkGmhi44N9pHpkYjMxu_JP)(Boys have higher activity levels \(Eaton, 1989\) and sometimes behave more impulsively \(Man-heimer & Mellinger, 1967\) than girls, which are factors that have been related to injury rates \(Matheny,1988, 1991\). In addition, there is speculation in the literature that differential socialization of sons and \[d\]aughters may play a role in boys being injured more often than girls. For example, parents are less likely to restrain the exploratory behavior of boys than girls, even if the boy's behavior is judged to pose an injury risk \(Block, 1983\). Similarly, boys are allowed to roam further from home than same-age girls \(Saegert & Hart, 1976\) and are given more opportunities to play alone \(Fagot, 1978\), which would result in boys receiving less direct supervision than girls. \(pg.34\)) in boys, it's not an objectively bad behaviour.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Men are likely to [be homeless and do drugs](https://www.culturalweekly.com/homeless-men-women/) than women.
1.6.1.4.3. Con: When men and women took the same action, men were rated as being more risky, indicating a [bias](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/science-oops-we-actually-totally-underestimated-womens-appetite-for-risk.html) in thinking.
1.6.1.4.4. Con: Taking risks in itself should not be seen as a negative, only risk without thought. If appropriate risk-management is achieved, prospective gains can heavily outweigh cost.
1.6.1.4.5. Pro: Men often are [more risky](https://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/gender) with driving than women.
1.6.1.4.5.1. Pro: A study found that women are [better](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/driving-men-women-better-study-uk-a8512706.html) drivers than men.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Women are [more religious](https://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/22/the-gender-gap-in-religion-around-the-world/) than men, and by consequence more superstitious.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: Making decisions based on superstition rather than fact is illogical.
1.6.1.5.2. Con: It is reductive to suggest that religion is simply superstition and, therefore, that religious followers are less intelligent.
1.6.1.5.2.1. Pro: Most famous [historical figures](https://www.premierchristianity.com/Blog/5-historical-figures-you-probably-didn-t-know-were-Christians) were all deeply religious.
1.6.1.5.3. Pro: There is [no scientific evidence](https://www.livescience.com/63854-stephen-hawking-says-no-god.html) of the existence of a God.
1.6.1.6. Con: Studies prove that women are more rational than men.
1.6.1.6.1. Pro: Evaluations of rationality indicate that women are more rational than men. \([p. 15](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/18049/PSY4090LinaAlsvik.pdf?sequence=2)\)
1.6.1.7. Con: The superiority of male rationality is a [result of subtle forms of gender stereotypes](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/5/1/54/113043/Rationality-is-Gendered).
1.6.2. Con: Cognitive studies suggest little to no difference in intelligence between these genders.
1.6.2.1. Con: Even if gender differences are not ingrained or biological, if social expectations and norms lead to divergent behaviors, those differences are still relevant.
1.6.2.2. Pro: [James Flynn](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beautiful-minds/201207/men-women-and-iq-setting-the-record-straight) compared the G-factor \(general intelligence\) tested by [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices), between men and women, and the difference was minimal.
1.6.2.3. Pro: There are [8 different types of intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#Additional_intelligences) among humans. Both genders have different performances in each of these categories, depending on various factors.
1.6.3. Pro: Women can multi-task [better](https://theconversation.com/scientists-may-have-proven-women-are-better-at-multitasking-than-men-71877) than men.
1.6.3.1. Con: There's no connection between multi-tasking and greater intelligence.
1.6.4. Pro: Women have greater academic skills than men.
1.6.4.1. Con: The most [influential philosophers](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/major-philosopher-ideas/) throughout history have been men.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Historically, women have been [viewed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12680306) by men as inferior. Therefore, their philosophies went unheard or were dismissed by society.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: Aristotle was [misogynistic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/)(There is no doubt that Aristotle's texts are misogynist; he thought that women were inferior to men, and he said so explicitly. For example, to cite Cynthia Freeland's catalogue: “Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a woman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever”\(Freeland 1994: 145–46\).) and attempted to justify his belief that women were inferior in his work.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Pro: According to [Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel), women's "[minds \[were\] not adapted to the higher sciences, philosophy, or certain of the arts](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/06/17/192523112/name-ten-women-in-philosophy-bet-you-can-t)."
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Prominent philosophy textbooks often [contain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/04/28/philosophys-gender-bias-for-too-long-scholars-say-women-have-been-ignored/) writings from solely male philosophers before the mid-20th century.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Con: That more men have been influential philosophers historically gives little indication of the rationality of men or women; you could be [irrational](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/22/expert-philosophers-are-just-as-irrational-as-the-rest-of-us/) and still considered an influential philosopher.
1.6.4.1.3. Con: Many philosophical works by women are incredibly influential and have dictated the course of modern thought.
1.6.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Philippa Foot](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philippa-foot/) created the famous [trolley problem](https://theconversation.com/the-trolley-dilemma-would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-57111) thought experiment.
1.6.4.1.3.2. Con: Insofar are there are [more male philosophers](https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/09/philosophy-has-a-woman-problem-lets-try-to-figure-out-why.html)(Fewer women are earning doctorates in Plato’s \(and Mary Wollstonecraft’s\) discipline than in the notoriously male fields of math, economics, and chemistry. According to one estimate, only 21.9 percent of the tenure-track faculty in 51 philosophy graduate programs were women in 2011 \(and the percentage of black woman professors was vanishingly small\).) than female ones, it is not possible to outweigh the former's achievements with a few successes in the latter group.
1.6.4.1.3.3. Con: The top 5 most influential philosophers are [male](https://www.britannica.com/list/philosophers-to-know-part-i).
1.6.4.1.3.4. Pro: [Simone de Beauvoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir)'s work was some of the [most significant](https://www.thoughtco.com/simone-de-beauvoir-and-second-wave-feminism-3530400) in the 20th century and influenced many philosophers and activists alike.
1.6.4.1.3.5. Pro: [Mary Wollstonecraft](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-Wollstonecraft) wrote seminal feminist texts, at a time when female philosophers were uncommon.
1.6.4.2. Con: Men are better equipped to work in STEM fields than women.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: Computer programming was traditionally a [women-dominated field](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/computer-programming-used-to-be-womens-work-718061/), as software skills were associated with women, and hardware with men. The association of computer skills with masculinity is a recent development.
1.6.4.2.2. Pro: Men [perform better](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7724690) in spatial visualization than women, which is an essential skill in STEM fields. \([p. 1](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Similarity1.pdf)\)
1.6.4.2.2.1. Con: Gender differences in spatial skills are not only [not innate](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01261/full) but also exacerbated by stereotype threat. Perpetuating the stereotype that men have better spatial skills contributes to the under-performance of women on tests of these abilities and their participation in STEM.
1.6.4.2.3. Con: There are proportionally more men in STEM fields because they have traditionally occupied these roles. As the number of prominent [female scientists and mentors](https://www.computersciencedegreehub.com/faq/why-are-there-more-men-than-women-in-stem-fields/) increases, so does the number of female students.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Significantly more women than men are graduating from high schools and universities.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Of the graduation year 2020-21, [53.6%](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_310.asp) of those receiving a doctorate in the US will be female.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: Of the graduation year 2020-21, [61.9%](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_310.asp) of those receiving a Masters in the US will be female.
1.6.4.3.3. Pro: In 2016, [57.0%](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Number_of_tertiary_education_students_by_level_and_sex,_2016_\(thousands\).png) of all graduates in the European Union of a Master \(or equivalent\) degree, were women.
1.6.4.3.4. Pro: In 2016, [61%](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Secondary_education_statistics#Graduates) of all graduates in the EU of post-secondary non-tertiary programs were female.
1.6.4.3.5. Con: The gender education gap may be caused by societal issues rather than differences in academic potential.
1.6.4.3.5.1. Pro: Research suggests childhood disadvantage is [more harmful](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/images/gender_paper.pdf) to boys than girls. \(p. 3\)
1.6.4.3.5.2. Pro: A [2015 paper](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/publications/docs/workingpapers/2015/IPR-WP-15-16.pdf) found boys are more sensitive to negative environments, such as poverty and stress, than girls.
1.6.4.3.6. Con: [Decades of public policy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/?single_page=true)(Categorizing girls as an "under-served population" on a par with other discriminated-against minorities, Congress passed the Gender Equity in Education Act in 1994. Millions of dollars in grants were awarded to study the plight of girls and to learn how to counter bias against them. At the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing in 1995, members of the U.S. delegation presented the educational and psychological deficits of American girls as a human-rights issue.) has [advantaged females over males](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/?single_page=true)(During a three-month period in 1997 various questions about gender equity were asked of 1,306 students and 1,035 teachers in grades seven through twelve. The MetLife study had no doctrinal ax to grind. What it found contradicted most of the findings of the AAUW, the Sadkers, and the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women: "Contrary to the commonly held view that boys are at an advantage over girls in school, girls appear to have an advantage over boys in terms of their future plans, teachers' expectations, everyday experiences at school and interactions in the classroom."\n\nSome other conclusions from the MetLife study: Girls are more likely than boys to see themselves as college-bound and more likely to want a good education. Furthermore, more boys \(31 percent\) than girls \(19 percent\) feel that teachers do not listen to what they have to say.) in the educational system in ways that are specifically non-intelligence or cognitive ability related factors.
1.6.4.3.6.1. Pro: The Obama administration created the [Council on Women and Girls](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/09/how-to-make-school-better-for-boys/279635/)(The reluctance to face up to the boy gap is evident at every level of government. In Washington, President Obama established a White House Council on Women and Girls shortly after taking office in 2009\[...\]On the other hand, the proposal for a Council for Boys and Men from a bi-partisan group of academics and political leaders has now been languishing in Secretary of Education Arne Duncan’s office for two years.) while no council for men and boys was created.
1.6.4.3.6.2. Pro: The [Gender Equity in Education Act of 1993](https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1793?s=1&r=13) establishes an Office of Women's Equity in the Department of Education to aid women and girls.
1.6.4.3.6.3. Pro: The [Women's Education Equity Act of 1993](https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1743?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=85)(Amends the Women's Educational Equity Act \(part A of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965\) to reauthorize and revise grant programs to encourage gender equity throughout the educational system, including grants for model equity programs, local implementation, and research and development. Gives the Director of the Office of Women's Equity specified responsibilities under such Act. Authorizes appropriations.) provides special funding for women and girls by revising grant programs.
1.6.4.3.7. Con: Even though more women graduate from high school and university, the job market is still dominated by men.
1.6.4.3.7.1. Pro: As of 2018, only [13% of women held engineering jobs](https://alltogether.swe.org/2018/09/swe-research-update-women-in-engineering-by-the-numbers/).
1.6.4.3.7.2. Con: The percentage of women in male-dominated fields is on a [rise](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/upshot/as-labor-market-tightens-women-are-moving-into-male-dominated-jobs.html).
1.6.4.3.7.3. Con: Women are more likely to be laid off due to [discrimination in the workplace](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/15/business/pregnancy-discrimination.html) which leads to an over-representation of men within the workforce.
1.6.4.3.7.4. Pro: As of 2020, only [9.9%](https://www.insider.com/male-jobs-women-underrepresented-numbers-2019-8) of workers in the US construction industry are female.
1.6.4.3.7.5. Pro: In the United States, even though [half of architecture students are female](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/opinion/sunday/women-architects.html), they only take up [25.5%](https://www.insider.com/male-jobs-women-underrepresented-numbers-2019-8#about-half-of-architecture-students-are-women-but-they-are-underrepresented-in-the-field-itself-which-is-only-255-female-8) of the jobs in the industry.
1.6.5. Pro: Men tend to [over-estimate their IQ](https://neurosciencenews.com/male-female-iq-20228/) whilst women under estimate theirs.
1.6.5.1. Con: This is an argument about their perception of their IQ, not about their IQ \(or true intelligence\) itself. It's entirely possible for women not to be smarter even if they underestimate and men overestimate their respective IQs.
1.6.6. Con: The science is unclear but overall there is either [no difference in IQ or men have slightly higher](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04966) IQs.
1.6.6.1. Pro: There are [more males than females at the top and bottom of the IQ distribution](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240323443_Sex_Differences_in_Variability_in_General_Intelligence_A_New_Look_at_the_Old_Question). The variability is higher.
1.6.7. Con: Women do not override incorrect ["gut" responses](https://www.psypost.org/2020/06/higher-trust-in-intuition-helps-account-for-why-women-are-more-likely-to-believe-in-magical-phenomena-57075)(In four studies with 2,545 participants in total, the researchers found that women were more likely than men to endorse magical beliefs. Women tended to report relying more on intuition and scored lower on a cognitive reflection test \(an assessment of a person’s tendency to override an incorrect “gut” response\), which were both associated with heightened magical beliefs.) and have more of a tendency for magical thinking and belief compared to men.
1.6.8. Con: On [tests of cognitive ability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963451/)(\[...\]we found that SAT scores correlated up to 0.8 with measures of fluid reasoning ability and g, and as highly with traditional intelligence test scores as scores on those tests did with each other. Frey and Detterman established that the SAT \(and, with Koenig, the ACT\) was g-loaded, could be used as a proxy measure for intelligence, and could be converted to an IQ scale with a simple equation.), men perform [better on average and also make up increasingly larger proportions of the top scores the further up you go.](https://msmagazine.com/2018/02/15/highest-performing-women-still-scoring-lower-men-sat/)(According to an in-depth analysis by Art Sawyer—one of the most knowledgeable leaders in test preparation—the proportion of female students in top-scoring ranges has declined in comparison to the older SAT. Average SAT score differences between all males and females on the new SAT fell to 20 points, which is better than the 24 points of the previous SAT, but this gender gap increases to 40 points when comparing male and female students with the highest scores. According to Sawyer, 45 percent more men than women are in the top score range of 1400-1600.)
1.6.9. Pro: Women remain [mentally sharper](https://patch.com/us/across-america/why-women-are-smarter-men) than men of the same age in their older years.
1.6.9.1. Pro: Research [found](https://patch.com/us/across-america/why-women-are-smarter-men) that women's brains are 4 years younger than the brains of men.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: Graceful aging does not entail greater intelligence. It means slightly better retention of intelligence in old age.
1.6.9.2. Con: The intelligence difference between women and men is less related to gender and more due to other contributing factors \(like genes or parenting environment\).
1.6.10. Con: Men and women score better on different tasks, which makes sense since male-female are complimentary in evolution.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Women are considered to be better [creatively,](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/research-proves-female-artists-are-more-creative-than-men-962899/) while men tend to [score better](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/NV.JEP.pdf) on math tests.
