Discussion Name: US 2020 Presidential Election: Who should the Democratic nominee be?

1. Who should the Democratic nominee for President in 2020 be?
1.1. [Jay Inslee](https://jayinslee.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.1.1. Pro: Inslee is the best candidate with regards to the environment.
1.1.1.1. Con: Inslee's all-or-nothing mentality toward his environmental goals are both unrealistic time-wise and economically devastating.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Inslee is one of the first Democratic presidential candidates to sign a pledge to [refuse any financial contributions from fossil-fuel interests](https://www.jayinslee.com/nofossilfuels).
1.1.1.3. Pro: Inslee issued a plan that aims to [eliminate planet-warming emissions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/us/politics/jay-inslee-climate-change.html) from power plants, vehicles and buildings over 10 years.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Inslee aims to put the United States on track to [cut its planet-warming pollution 50 percent by 2030](https://www.kuow.org/stories/inslee-unveils-aggressive-plan-to-cut-the-nation-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-half-by-2030) and reach net-zero emissions by 2045.
1.1.1.5. Pro: As governor of Washington, Inslee has already passed [major climate legislation](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052019/100-percent-clean-energy-map-inslee-washington-california-puerto-rico).
1.1.1.6. Con: Jay Inslee supported putting a [giant coal burning smelter](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/nov/01/inslees-smelter-contradiction/) in the Newport area of Washington.
1.1.2. Con: Inslee was the chief proponent of the [biggest corporate giveaway in history](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/if-jay-inslee-runs-for-president-his-biggest-accomplishment-may-be-his-undoing/) \(to Boeing\) which still resulted in jobs loses occurring and workers losing their pensions. He cannot be counted on to hold corporate power to account.
1.2. [Marianne Williamson](https://www.marianne2020.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.2.1. Con: Marianne has no prior government, military, legal, leadership, management, or financial experience. It may be difficult for voters to have confidence in her as a candidate.
1.2.1.1. Con: Williamson's outsider status in politics can be seen as a positive; she's not beholden to "the establishment."
1.2.1.2. Pro: Democratic voters are more likely to want their candidates to have prior experience.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: 73% percent of Democratic voters said they would be [‘more excited’](https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/poll-democrats-want-experienced-politician-president-not-outsider) to vote for a politically experienced candidate.
1.2.2. Pro: Marianne Williamson [supports](https://www.marianne2020.com/issues/healthcare) Medicare for All, which [70% of Americans](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/) are in favour of.
1.2.2.1. Con: 6 other candidates have also [expressed support](https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-candidates-medicare-for-all-7d958bab-de34-4d8c-921d-b561f201c4c2.html) for Medicare for All, so this does not set Williamson apart.
1.2.3. Pro: Marianne Williamson wants to establish a [Department of Peace](https://www.marianne2020.com/peace), which would help build healthy global relationships.
1.2.4. Pro: Marianne Williamson is one of few candidates to discuss gun control as a [mental health issue](https://www.marianne2020.com/issues/gun-control).
1.2.5. Pro: Marianne Williamson [will implement Andrew Yang's $1000/m freedom dividend program](https://www.marianne2020.com/issues/the-economy). In the context of a Williamson presidency, $1000/m is merely a small part of a holistic solution.
1.2.6. Con: Marianne Williamson is [not](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-marianne-williamson-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3) as well known as her democratic running mates, despite her unsuccessful campaign in 2014.
1.3. [Kirsten Gillibrand](https://kirstengillibrand.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.3.1. Pro: Kirsten recognizes [Donald Trump's diversion of funds to for-profit prisons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVgbJapwM4w) which [lock up asylum seekers](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-asylum-seekers-louisiana-splc-lawsuit-parole-20190530-story.html) and seeks to do something about it.
1.3.2. Pro: Kirsten Gillibrand will fight for clean and fair elections and has a comprehensive plan [to transform campaign finance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_hpzH4lxW0).
1.4. [Julián Castro](https://www.julianforthefuture.com/?source=join-us) \(dropped out\).
1.4.1. Pro: Castro polls strongly amongst Latino and Hispanic voters, whose turnout is important to winning the Presidency.
1.4.1.1. Pro: [45%](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/when-more-latinos-are-polled-juli-n-castro-s-2020-n995976) of Latino voters had a favorable view of Castro. This makes him the third most favored candidate for Latino voters - behind only Biden and Sanders.
1.4.1.2. Pro: In 2020, Hispanics will represent the largest racial minority group in the election, accounting for [over 13%](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/) of all eligible voters.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Voter turnout amongst Hispanics in the 2018 mid-terms increased by [174%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/14/latino-turnout-up-174-in-2018-midterms-elections-democrats-say) in comparison to 2014.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Democrats believe that Hispanic voter turnout [influenced several key mid-term races](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latino-voters-can-really-have-influence-democrats-over-two-dozen-n919326).
1.4.2. Con: Castro does not have the financial backing to successfully run for President.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Castro only [raised $1.1 million](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/04/14/julian-castro-raises-11-million-first-quarter-presidential-bid/) in the first quarter of his Presidential bid. In comparison, O'Rourke and Warren, who announced at similar times, have raised $9.4 million and $6 million respectively.
1.4.3. Con: So far, Castro has [struggled to get media attention](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/julian-castro-talks-about-the-long-game), which hurts his name recognition and fundraising abilities.
1.4.4. Pro: Castro has a [detailed policy and strong narrative](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Castro-is-wise-to-offer-detailed-immigration-and-13863633.php) on immigration which is important to many voters.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Immigration is likely to be a [key issue in 2020](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2019/05/22/334112/why-is-julian-castro-the-only-democratic-presidential-candidate-with-an-immigration-plan/) yet most Democratic candidates have yet to release comprehensive immigration policies.
1.4.4.2. Pro: As the [son of a Mexican immigrant](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/julian-castro-son-of-mexican-immigrant-to-take-on-trump-in-2020-1.3756342), Castro has an authentic perspective on immigration which may speak to many voters.
1.4.4.3. Con: Castro's immigration policy is [unlikely to appeal](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Castro-is-wise-to-offer-detailed-immigration-and-13863633.php) to the left because he does not support abolishing ICE and is unlikely to appeal to the right as it ends immigration agreements between federal and local law enforcement agenices.
1.5. [Amy Klobuchar](https://amyklobuchar.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.5.1. Pro: Winning back the Midwest will be very important for Democrats in 2020. Klobuchar [winning a midwest state](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/results/minnesota) with more than 60% of the vote in 2018 shows she knows how to do it.
1.5.2. Con: Klobuchar has a [reported history of mistreating her staff](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/amy-klobuchar-abuse-staff-2020_n_5c5a1cb1e4b0871047588649?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maXZldGhpcnR5ZWlnaHQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2FteS1rbG9idWNoYXItMjAyMC1kZW1vY3JhdGljLW5vbWluYXRpb24ta2lja29mZi8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAmyAEcVADkXfEo4zXJed5-FcTi7UWzWVjVPQUTr7o5dRbICi5m2jEtbrbga8pgoSgIBKExsVC-sYNEOaS5JJrjFXM7NkrHjqPYElKJQPhmuw7VBGNZIFzTO_Z7_3QbMxhqO7fH-3kpTcZaNxUxOCfPYv5Am5ESH-Wf9DUSoZ0fV), which may turn off voters and make it difficult for her to find a team to manage her campaign.
1.5.3. Con: Given her background and policy stances, Klobuchar is [unlikely to perform well with black voters, Hispanic voters and the left wing of the Democratic party](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/amy-klobuchar-2020-democratic-nomination-kickoff/) meaning she may struggle to find support in the Presidential election.
1.5.4. Pro: Klobuchar is very popular and is the most likely candidate to win the general election.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Klobuchar is [one of the most popular Senators](https://morningconsult.com/2019/01/10/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators-q4-2018/) in the U.S.
1.5.4.2. Pro: In the single instance that she's been polled against Trump in a hypothetical match-up, she beats him by a larger margin than any other candidate in any other hypothetical swing state match-up to date. [realclearpolitics.com](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mn/minnesota_trump_vs_klobuchar-6969.html)
1.5.5. Pro: She was ranked first in the Senate in terms of[most bills led or cosponsored enacted into law during the 114th Congress.](http://amyklobuchar.com/amys-story)
1.5.6. Pro: As Senator of Minnesota in the 114th Congress, [she was ranked first in the Senate in terms of bills that were led or consponsored into law by her office](http://amyklobuchar.com/amys-story/), indicating that she would be an effective executive who could work with Congress \(in a bipartisan manner\) to pass legislation that would benefit the working class, even in her first 100 days.
1.5.7. Pro: Amy has a strong focus on how to implement policy that won't harm the working class. Her family's background with Unions and her [strong work with Unions and the working class](https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/amy-klobuchar) to pass bills that support them is evidence of this.
1.5.8. Con: Klobuchar is a [more centrist voice](https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-political-spectrum-ranking-2019-5?r=US&IR=T#california-rep-eric-swalwell-3) running in the primary. An election between a centrist Democrat and a conservative Republican will [likely cause many liberal voters to just stay home](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/02/there-is-hard-data-that-shows-that-a-centrist-democrat-would-be-a-losing-candidate/).
1.6. [Stephen Bullock](https://stevebullock.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.6.1. Pro: Bullock has shown that he can garner support from Republicans and swing voters.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Bullock has shown that he can [convince Republican voters to support liberal policies like expanding Medicaid](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/steve-bullock-2020.html).
1.6.1.2. Con: Bullock does not have the financial backing to swing voters in key states.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: In the first 24 hours after announcing his campaign Bullock raised [US $1 million](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/steve-bullock-first-day-fundraising/index.html) in donations.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: The amount raised by Bullock is significantly less than other Democratic candidates such as [Biden \($6.3m\), O'Rourke \($6.1m\) and Sanders \($5.9m\)](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/steve-bullock-first-day-fundraising/index.html).
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: [Bullock does not have any fundraising base](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/steve-bullock-2020.html) - either from private donors or from the grass-roots base.
1.6.1.3. Pro: [Bullock has been elected as Governor of Montana twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bullock_\(American_politician\)), even though [Montana has traditionally been a Republican state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states).
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: In [2016](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/steve-bullock-2020-montana-governor-presidential-democratic-race) Bullock was re-elected Governor of Montana by 4 percentage points, even though Trump won the presidential vote in Montana by 21 percentage points.
1.6.2. Con: Bullock has been criticized over his [treatment of his former aide who had been accused of sexually harassing several women](https://freebeacon.com/politics/dem-gov-bullock-apologizes-for-hiding-aides-harassment/).
1.6.2.1. Con: Bullcok has since [apologised](https://medium.com/\@stevebullock/im-committed-to-doing-better-bb556ba7f41a) for his actions and admitted that he did not do enough to hold O'Brien accountable for his sexual harassment.
1.6.3. Pro: Bullock has [promised to address the issue of campaign finance](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-steve-bullock-believe-where-the-candidate-stands-on-9-issues), which is an [important issue](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/08/most-americans-want-to-limit-campaign-spending-say-big-donors-have-greater-political-influence/) for many Americans.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Bullock has already [introduced legislation in Montana](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/steve-bullock-2020.html) which imposes transparency requirements on non-profits in state elections.
1.6.4. Con: In 2019 Bullock [vetoed](https://www.thefire.org/montana-gov-vetoes-bipartisan-bill-to-eliminate-campus-free-speech-zones/) a bill which aimed to provide free speech protections at Montana's public colleges and universities.
1.6.5. Con: [Recent polling](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-steve-bullock-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/) showed that 54% of potential Democratic primary voters nationwide had never heard of Bullock. Given this, he would be unlikely to be successful in the Presidential election.
1.6.5.1. Con: Name recognition would surely be a non-issue after winning the Democratic nomination.
1.7. [Mike Gravel](https://www.mikegravel.org/) \(dropped out\).
1.7.1. Pro: Mike Gravel has [consistently and strongly](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/05/mike-gravel-democratic-primary-anti-imperialism) opposed US interventionism. His views on this issue are in line with those of the American people.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Over [86% of Americans](https://www.thenation.com/article/new-poll-shows-public-overwhelmingly-opposed-to-endless-us-military-interventions/) think military intervention should only be used as a last resort.
1.7.2. Con: Mike Gravel does not actually [want to be](https://truthout.org/articles/mike-gravel-is-running-for-president-but-he-doesnt-want-to-win/) president. The nominee should not be someone who does not intend to be president.
1.7.3. Pro: Mike Gravel isn't a career politician who has been trying to seize power his whole life- he was encouraged into this race [by a group of high schoolers who reached out to encourage him to run.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/27/18638687/mike-gravel-2020-democratic-presidential-candidates)
1.8. [Seth Moulton](https://sethmoulton.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.8.1. Pro: In 2017, Moulton was [ranked in the top 10%](https://moulton.house.gov/news-stories/press-releases/report-ranks-moulton-top-10-bipartisan-members-congress/) of the most bipartisan members of Congress. At a time when America is [bitterly divided](https://moulton.house.gov/news-stories/press-releases/report-ranks-moulton-top-10-bipartisan-members-congress/), Moulton may be able to unite politicians across the political spectrum.
1.8.2. Pro: Moulton has a strong policy platform on climate change which in an important issue for many Americans.
1.8.2.1. Pro: [72% of Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/climate/americans-global-warming-poll.html) say that global warming is personally important to them.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Moulton is a [co-sponsor](https://moulton.house.gov/news-stories/press-releases/moulton-announces-support-of-green-new-deal/) of the [Green New Deal Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal) which aims to transition the US to 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources.
1.8.2.3. Pro: Moulton has [stated](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/democrat-seth-moulton-running-for-president-pushes-green-jobs-public-option.html) that green jobs and investment in nuclear energy are key issues for America.
1.8.3. Con: Moulton is a white man with moderate views. As the Democratic party [moves further left](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/opinion/democratic-party-progressive-left-midterm-elections.html), these factors become less desirable.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Moulton is a [member of the New Democrat Coalition](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democratic-massachusetts-congressman-seth-moulton_n_5b36554fe4b007aa2f7f8062). This group is on the right of the democratic party, and has supported centrist and moderate policy ideas.
1.8.4. Con: Moulton may [struggle to gain party support](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/seth-moulton-2020-potential-run) because of his part in the [failed attempt to block Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/nancy-pelosi-speaker-democrat-opponents-strategy-1017270)
1.9. [Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.9.1. Con: Bernie Sanders is [not a Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders).
1.9.1.1. Con: Bernie Sanders is where the energy is at in the Democratic Party today. As seen by the [enormous attendance](https://heavy.com/news/2019/03/bernie-sanders-chicago-rally-crowd-size-how-many-attended/) at his events, his presence has given a massive boost to a party that has been otherwise in [decline for years](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/265387-poll-self-identified-dems-republicans-near-record-lows).
1.9.1.2. Pro: Bernie Sanders ran as a candidate in the Democratic primary to be a senator for Vermont, but after winning decided to ["respectfully decline"](https://www.politico.eu/article/bernie-sanders-to-run-as-a-democrat-but-not-accept-nomination/) the nomination and ultimately continue to be an independent Senator.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: By running as an independent Sanders is able to critique the Democratic Party which many believe is [in need of change.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/the-democratic-party-is-in-a-murky-mess)
1.9.1.3. Pro: Sanders is not a registered Democrat and has often [publicly stated](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/23/bernie-sanders-democrat/) that he is not part of the Democratic Party.
1.9.1.4. Con: Sanders' home state of [Vermont does not require party registration](https://www.sec.state.vt.us/elections/frequently-asked-questions/voter-registration.aspx).
1.9.1.5. Con: It should not matter if Sanders is officially a part of the Democratic party if he has the support of Democratic voters.
1.9.1.5.1. Con: It matters because the deciding voters in swing states will possibly vote for a Democrat, but [not a Democratic Socialist](https://www.nbcnews.com/card/poll-voters-turned-idea-america-moving-toward-socialism-n976266).
1.9.1.5.1.1. Con: This conflates party affiliation with political policy beliefs.
1.9.1.5.2. Pro: It does not matter if Sanders is a committed Democrat because ideally we would not be effectively limited to having to only choose between candidates from the two main parties anyway. A candidate's voting record should be the focus when ones decides who to vote for.
1.9.1.5.2.1. Con: It matters because the deciding voters in swing states will possibly vote for a Democrat, but not a Democratic Socialist.
1.9.1.6. Pro: Establishment Democrats are unlikely to vote for individuals who have been disloyal to the party.
1.9.1.6.1. Con: Even if Sanders doesn't get the establishment democrats to support him, he will likely tap into the edge voters who voted for Trump because he wasn't in bed with big business.
1.9.1.6.2. Con: 78% of [Democrats](https://news.gallup.com/poll/243539/americans-maintain-positive-view-bernie-sanders.aspx) view Bernie Sanders favourably.
1.9.1.6.2.1. Con: Sanders has difficulty [connecting with Black voters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-struggled-win-black-voters-it-could-be-even-more-difficult/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.dd57dc4ea0c2), a key constituency of the Democratic party.
1.9.1.6.2.1.1. Con: Bernie Sanders is actually [the second most popular candidate among black voters, behind only Biden](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/06/bernie-sanders-black-voters-2020/).
1.9.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Sanders' past [characterization of his child daycare policy](https://newsone.com/playlist/twitter-bernie-sanders-niggardly/) has come under question by Black voters.
1.9.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: The [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_word_%22niggardly%22) of the word Sanders used to describe his day care policy is different than the etymology of the derogatory racial slur that sounds the same.
1.9.1.6.2.1.2.2. Con: Sanders has been [a long standing champion for Black civil rights](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-bernie-sanders-1963-chicago-arrest-20160219-story.html), which should subside Black voters' worries over his alleged word misuse.
1.9.1.6.2.1.2.3. Pro: As a rising political figure in 1986, and a long standing champion of Black civil rights in the United States, Sanders should have known better than to use a word that is so easily mirrored for a racial slur.
1.9.1.6.2.1.3. Pro: Sanders has fallen behind in South Carolina [polls](https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article230531019.html), a state where a [majority](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/party-affiliation/by/racial-and-ethnic-composition/among/state/south-carolina/) of Democratic voters are Black.
1.9.1.6.2.2. Con: Sen. Sanders [has seen his support drop sharply](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/443547-poll-sanders-support-among-young-voters-drops-sharply) among the young voters that have powered his rise in Democratic politics, according to a new poll.
1.9.1.7. Con: Sanders ran as a candidate in the [Democratic presidential primary elections in 2016.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_history_of_Bernie_Sanders#United_States_presidential_election_\(2016\))
1.9.1.8. Con: Party allegiance is less important when selecting a candidate for president than the policy ideas proposed by candidates.
1.9.1.9. Con: Bernie Sanders [signed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/03/05/sen-bernie-sanders-signs-pledge-declaring-democrat-2020/3074461002/) a document pledging himself as a Democrat.
1.9.1.10. Con: Sanders not officially being a Democrat is a strong positive in the eyes of many independents who do not feel that the Democratic Party represents them, but do generally lean towards the values espoused by the Democrats. This can be a major advantage in the general election, since registered Democrats are likely to vote Democrat regardless, and it is Independent votes that will make the difference.
1.9.1.11. Con: Bernie Sanders is part of the [Senate Democratic Caucus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Democratic_Caucus).
1.9.1.11.1. Con: [A caucus is not a party affiliation](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/caucus.htm). Belonging to a caucus only means that a given legislator shares issue concerns with the other members of the caucus.
1.9.1.12. Con: Allegiance to party over policy is a recipe for disaster, which can lead to blind faith, lack of critical self examination, and cult of personalities which lead party members [astray](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/432881-bernie-sanders-biggest-appeal-hes-not-a-democrat).
1.9.2. Pro: Sanders is the only candidate who can win over anti-establishment and radical swing voters from Trump. No other frontrunner claims to have socialist ideals, which is [seen as radical by Americans](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/24/bernie-sanders-reveals-his-radical-inclinations-ov/) and therefore can win over the rebellion votes.
1.9.2.1. Con: Bernie Sanders is too left-leaning to optimally contest Trump. [A centrist would receive almost all of the vote from the left](https://news.gallup.com/poll/245462/democrats-favor-moderate-party-gop-conservative.aspx) \(if pitted against Trump\) while better competing for libertarian, centrist, and disaffected republican voters.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders, [while not an actual socialist by definition](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/democratic-candidate-bernie-sanders-socialist), will face a label as such, and [at least half of the country](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/opinion/sanders-2020-trump.html) will refuse to vote for him because they think he is.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: Polling indicates that the majority of Americans [don't view](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-03/u-s-voters-don-t-want-socialist-or-very-old-president-poll) socialism as a desirable trait in a President. Sanders often describes himself as a [socialist](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/12/18663217/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism-speech-transcript).
1.9.2.1.2. Con: This is an oversimplification which neglects the impact of voter turnout.
1.9.2.1.2.1. Pro: Candidates which appeal to their bases [receive higher voter turn out generally](https://www.raconteur.net/current-affairs/why-people-dont-vote). Bernie would thus be predicted to recieve a higher voter turnout from democrats than a more centrist candidate.
1.9.2.1.3. Pro: A Trump vs Bernie matchup would likely see zero cross-party voting, and would be [the ideal situation for a Trump re-election](https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-hope-bernie-sanders-is-2020-democratic-nominee-2019-5).
1.9.2.1.4. Con: [There are many disadvantages centrists face on the campaign trail which don't affect more polarised candidates.](https://medium.com/s/story/is-there-any-middle-left-d1dcd9df484f)
1.9.2.1.5. Con: When Clinton won the nomination she was leading Trump by 2 points. Sanders was leading Trump [by 10.4 point](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/60352372_10218513870294783_961973524983971840_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=160e84e231520f89c81f528d3ae6080f&oe=5D5E9040). Anti-establishment voters who lean right support Sanders. Trump was their anti-establishment vote against Clinton.
1.9.2.1.6. Con: Bernie is not too left-learning to optimally contest Trump. Bernie's policies are popular with right-wing voters. For example, [a majority of republicans support medicare for all.](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/412552-majority-of-republicans-say-the-support-medicare-for-all-poll)
1.9.2.2. Pro: The last 20 years of presidential elections seem to indicate a strong tendency in favor of presidential candidates running [under the banner of being outsiders](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/09/political-outsiders-old-campaign-ploy) to the DC political establishment. Trump's election ought to reinforce the notion that Sanders' position as an apparent radical is the central asset that won the election both for Trump and Obama.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: Sanders may [not be viewed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/09/bernie-sanders-2020-outsider-campaign) by some as an outsider, after serving in Congress [since 1991](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bernie-Sanders).
1.9.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.9.
1.9.2.3. Con: Independent and center-leaning voters who find socialist policies unpalatable may be more inclined to vote for Trump.
1.9.3. Pro: Bernie Sanders is more likely to represent and fight for the interests of the US people as a whole, rather than be beholden to corporate interests.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders has a very strong track record for voting against bills and the appointment of cabinet officers unfavourable to the interests of the American people.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Bernie voted against [NAFTA](https://votesmart.org/bill/5471/15620/27110/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta-implementation-act), and [voted](https://votesmart.org/bill/2847/8020/27110/disapproval-of-normal-trade-relations-status-with-china) in favor of Disapproval of 'Normal Trade Relations' Status with China.
1.9.3.1.2. Pro: Sanders [voted against](https://votesmart.org/bill/22559/58637/27110/nomination-of-scott-pruitt-to-be-administrator-of-the-environmental-protection-agency) appointing Scott Pruitt, [a climate change denier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pruitt#Pruitt's_environmental_views), to head the EPA.
1.9.3.1.2.1. Con: Booker, Harris, Bennet, Warren, and Gillibrand [also voted against](https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/58637) Pruitt's appointment.
1.9.3.1.3. Pro: Bernie [voted against](http://educate-yourself.org/cn/patriotact20012006senatevote.shtml) the [Patriot Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act), and also against its extension in 2006.
1.9.3.1.4. Pro: Bernie Sanders [voted against](https://www.thoughtco.com/2002-iraq-war-vote-3325446) the war in Iraq.
1.9.3.1.5. Con: Sanders [voted against](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/) the Brady Act, which gave law-enforcement time to run background checks on gun purchases.
1.9.3.1.6. Con: Sanders [voted against](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=2&vote=00223) the Magnitsky Act, a law which allows the US to freeze the assets of Human Rights violators.
1.9.3.1.7. Con: Sanders [voted for](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/26/11116412/bernie-sanders-mass-incarceration) the 1994 Crime Bill, which was not popular with Democratic voters, and many blame for the [excessive incarceration of people of color](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/bill-clinton-crime-bill-hillary-black-lives-thomas-frank).
1.9.3.2. Pro: Bernie Sanders has fought for civil rights for over 40 years, and his agenda has not changed throughout his political career.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: In 1962 Sanders was [arrested for protesting segregation](https://www.alternet.org/2015/07/20-examples-bernie-sanders-powerful-record-civil-and-human-rights-1950s/amp/) in Chicago public schools.
1.9.3.2.2. Pro: Sanders began his political career in the early 1970s by launching the Liberty Union Party which supported [abolishing all laws relating to discrimination of homosexuality](https://www.alternet.org/2015/06/bernie-sanders-was-full-gay-equality-40-years-ago/).
1.9.3.3. Con: Corporate interests aren't narrow interests because employees and the families of employees often benefit when the company does.
1.9.3.3.1. Con: “The people” refers to the whole of the American people. A corporate interest is in interest of people - but specifically the people in the corporation.
1.9.3.3.1.1. Pro: More specifically, the shareholders of the corporation. Corporate interests do not necessarily even coincide with the interests of individual contributors within the organization.
1.9.3.3.2. Con: "Corporate interests" as a term is understood to mean the interests of the few, powerful, and wealthy people at the top rungs of a corporation. The economic interests of those people in most cases directly oppose the interests of average people \(e.g. workers and the middle class\).
1.9.3.3.3. Pro: Corporations employ workers, serve consumers, and pay dividends to shareholders. Benefits to corporations therefore benefit the wider public.
1.9.3.4. Con: Working with corporate interests would have improved the economic misery of Vermont, one of the [most difficult](http://truenorthreports.com/forbes-ranks-vermont-48th-for-business-climate) places to start a successful business.
1.9.3.4.1. Con: There is no link between liberal/progressive/social democratic policy and economic misery in Vermont and there is no link between working with corporate interests and the improvement of peoples' lives and the success of businesses.
1.9.3.4.1.1. Pro: Vermont suffers from economic problems because it has very economically profitable and populous neighbours, meaning it's not an attractive place for businesses to situate in.
1.9.3.5. Pro: Bernie represents a return to the New Deal days of [FDR](https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/12/bernie-sanders-2020-vision-fdr-democratic-socialism). He is the only candidate genuinely representing the interests of the many.
1.9.3.6. Pro: [Polls](https://dailycaller.com/2018/04/26/poll-drain-the-swamp-mueller-investigation/) show that a majority of Americans have concerns over the DC "swamp" - the effect of lobbyists and corporate interests in Washington.
1.9.3.7. Pro: The vast majority of Bernie Sanders' past campaign fundraising has come from [small dollar donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00000528&cycle=2018&type=I) \(\<$200\). He is therefore indebted to regular people rather than corporate interests.
1.9.3.7.1. Con: Unlike 2016, [other candidates](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/small-dollar-donors-2020-democrats-president-money) are also focusing on small dollar donations in this election cycle.
1.9.4. Con: In a general election, Sanders might struggle to rally the support of several demographic groups who are typically key advocates and voters for the Democratic Party.
1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.6.2.1.
1.9.4.2. Pro: Sanders may struggle to inspire female voters to rally for him during a General Election.
1.9.4.2.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders has come under scrutiny for [endorsing](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/20/524962482/sanders-defends-campaigning-for-anti-abortion-rights-democrat) an anti-abortion candidate in 2017, in a time where the [majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/04/a-majority-of-americans-think-abortion-will-still-be-legal-in-30-years-but-with-some-restrictions/) of Democrats are pro-choice. This may harm his ability to gain and rally the support of support of women and those who are passionate about women's reproductive rights during the General Election.
1.9.4.2.1.1. Con: Bernie Sanders has been a long and consistent defender of a women's reproductive rights since [before he first took public office](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/06/06/abortion-conscience-not-government-declared-bernie-sanders-1972) more than four decades ago.
1.9.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Sanders had [committed](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/17/18627693/2020-democrats-alabama-abortion-ban-hyde-amendment) to appointing judges who would preserve Roe v. Wade.
1.9.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood has given Sanders [a 100% rating](https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/27110/bernie-sanders) for his lifetime voting record on reproductive rights.
1.9.4.2.2. Pro: The Sanders campaign has come under scrutiny for the way that they managed [sexual harassment claims](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/03/681815362/bernie-sanders-responds-to-allegations-of-sexism-and-harassment-on-2016-campaign) in their 2016 campaign. Bernie stated that he was "a little busy" which is why he was not aware of the harassment allegations. He may lose female voters due to this.
1.9.4.2.2.1. Con: Many would consider presidential elections to supersede most other happenings, at least when one is participating in one. This would explain why Sanders and his assembly were unable to deal with the situation properly.
1.9.4.3. Con: It simply isn't true that Sanders has difficulty with black voters. In fact, [polling shows Bernie Sanders beating Kamala Harris 2-to-1 among black democratic primary voters.](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/06/bernie-sanders-black-voters-2020/)
1.9.4.4. Con: Bernie's 2020 presidential campaign is more diverse than its 2016 predecessor. In fact, polls show [young women actually make up more of Bernie's base than men do.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzjmb/bernie-bros-women-under-45-make-up-a-larger-share-of-bernie-sanders-base-than-men)
1.9.4.5. Con: Sanders [won decisively](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/bernie-sanders-scores-an-impressive-victory-in-nevada) with every demographic in Nevada save for the very oldest voters.
1.9.5. Pro: Bernie Sanders has a [strong grassroots movement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) [behind him](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/05/02/bernie-sanders-running-unprecedented-campaign). This will help him in the general election and to effect political change if he were to become president.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders' campaign has used its organizing capabilities to conduct politics in new ways, such as [coordinating](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-campaign-strike-picket-lines_n_5cdecf96e4b09e057802f44c) with striking unions to bolster their support and [warning](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/25/18715627/bernie-sanders-email-list-warn-immigrants-ice-raids-2020) residents of ICE raids in their area. Sanders' grassroots movement could reinvigorate and reimagine public institutions and their function in order to reform the political process most effectively with the backing of the executive office.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Bernie Sanders has an [army of volunteers](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-the-sanders-campaign-is-reinventing-the-use-of-tech-in-politics/) and has inspired a [grassroots movement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network). This grassroots movement would help get out the Democratic vote in a general election, which could swing an election in favour of the Democrats given that over 40% of the voting-age population did not vote in the [2016 election](https://guides.libraries.psu.edu/post-election-2016/voter-turnout).
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: 1,000,000 people have [signed up as volunteers](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/02/25/bernie-sanders-says-1000000-people-have-signed-campaign-volunteers) for Sanders' Campaign.
1.9.5.2.1.1. Pro: In a single month, the campaign has made over [5 million calls](https://berniesanders.com/call/).
1.9.5.2.2. Con: Sanders is [sometimes blamed](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/05/opinions/hillary-clinton-book-bernie-sanders-filipovic/index.html?) for the failure of Hillary Clinton, due to a perceived disloyalty of his voters. Some democrats may dislike him for this reason, and thus there could be a loss of core democrat turnout.
1.9.6. Con: Sanders has had to halt his campaign [due to heart issues](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/02/bernie-sanders-undergoes-surgery-for-artery-blockage-cancels-events-until-further-notice.html) which suggests frailty.
1.9.6.1. Con: Sanders' doctors have [since said](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/30/792436711/3-months-after-heart-attack-sanders-doctors-say-he-s-fit-to-be-president) that there's no indication that he is unfit to serve as president.
1.9.7. Con: This candidate is missing a section on research and development \(R&D\) in science that used to exist during the [space age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age). Without this research, then the US will not advance forward technologically like it used to.
1.9.7.1. Pro: The R&D developments [led to](https://spinoff.nasa.gov/pdf/CH_web.pdf) scientific and technological achievements that improved living conditions and scientific/technological progress and interest still felt today.
1.9.8. Con: Bernie does [not agree](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/458951-sanders-yangs-universal-basic-income-proposal-not-a-solution-to-impact-of-automation) with implementing a UBI, although it has shown to be an [easy](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/458972-yang-fires-back-at-sanders-over-universal-basic-income) and [effective](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/) way to lift people out of poverty.
1.9.8.1. Pro: As support for a UBI continues to [grow](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/463055-more-voters-support-universal-basic-income), Bernie will likely lose favor from American voters.
1.9.8.2. Con: UBI is only valuable as a means to an end. If Bernie achieves the same ends by different means, then whether he uses UBI or another policy prescription is irrelevant.
1.9.8.2.1. Pro: Bernie supports the following policies in place of a UBI: 1\) [Affordable housing bill](https://berniesanders.com/issues/housing-all/) 2\) [federal jobs guarantee](https://berniesanders.com/issues/jobs-for-all/) \(including a living wage law\) 3\) [tuition and debt-free public colleges](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/) 4\) [High-Speed Internet for All](https://berniesanders.com/issues/high-speed-internet-all/). These policies, if implemented, would meet or exceed $1000 a month offered by popular UBI proposals.
1.9.8.2.1.1. Con: The Federal Jobs Guarantee doesn’t account for the fact of the [Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0) will end [more jobs](https://m.phys.org/news/2018-09-machines-tasks-humans-wef.html) than what [Sanders’ option](http://Sanders’ option) will bring in.
1.9.8.3. Con: There is much debate as to whether a UBI or a [Federal Jobs Guarantee](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/federal-job-guarantee-universal-basic-income-investment-jobs-unemployment/) \(FJG\) is a better plan for fixing poverty and unemployment. The FJG is part of Bernie's platform.
1.9.8.4. Con: A UBI does not benefit everyone equally and may make poverty worse for some [demographics](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/30/15712160/basic-income-oecd-aei-replace-welfare-state) if it is used as an excuse to erode other social safety nets.
1.9.9. Pro: Bernie Sanders fights to support and protect multi-generational family farms. He has a plan to revitalize rural America and ensure that farmers are paid fairly. [Plan for Rural America](https://berniesanders.com/issues/revitalizing-rural-america/)
1.9.9.1. Con: Only [1 in 5 Americans](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/rural-america.html) are in rural America. The interests of the majority are likely not the same as those from multi-generational family farms.
1.9.10. Pro: For 40 years, Bernie Sanders has [stuck](https://www.npr.org/2015/12/11/459231940/bernie-sanders-has-stuck-to-the-same-message-for-40-years?) with his original message, and fought for it to be in the national conversation. He continues to lead the democratic party with his unwavering platform.
1.9.10.1. Con: The consistency of "sticking to his original message \[for 40 years\]" is a red herring; not changing your position with the times for 4 decades is incredibly worrying and shows lack of adaptability, which is especially concerning in the 21st century with the pace of change only increasing.
1.9.11. Pro: Bernie would gain voters by increasing voter turnout. This is a better policy than that of other Democratic Party candidates, who seek to [gain](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/politics/joe-biden-running-mate-republican/index.html) the support of centrist and right wing voters and risk alienating the left wing base of the party.
1.9.12. Pro: Bernie overwhelmingly has the [vote of minorities](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/12/bernie-sanders-has-more-diverse-support-you-think), a group where the Democrats [always struggle](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/12/07/democrats_you_must_engage_and_persuade_minority_voters_141909.html).
1.9.13. Pro: Bernie Sanders wants to attack the issue of [economic inequality](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-inequality-tax-plan/) in America. This is different from other candidates and is a more aggressive approach than [Warren’s plan](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/wealth-tax-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-difference-explained-chart-2019-10%3famp).
1.9.13.1. Pro: With an [increasing divide](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/764654623/u-s-income-inequality-worsens-widening-to-a-new-gap) between the ultra-wealthy and the working class in this country, we need the most direct approach to distribute wealth back to the working class.
1.9.14. Pro: Bernie is the most charismatic and best speaker among the remaining candidates and is therefore best positioned to win over voters in the general election.
1.9.15. Con: Sanders would have trouble governing due to his inability to create broad political coalitions.
1.9.15.1. Con: Data shows the so called "liberal leftist Bernie Bros" that led the #NeverHillary movement in 2015/16 [were actually conservative](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-was-helped-by-the-neverhillary-vote-what-does-that-mean-for-his-chances-now/?fbclid=IwAR3YOZq97w8HHVOnY5i3t_5TsD84CDNJEr5UeWnqhSnlCbCkEuU3XUL9MII). Bernie's appeal reaches across the political spectrum.
1.9.15.2. Con: While his first years in office as Mayor of Burlington were difficult, over time Sanders was able to win over support from a [broad coalition](https://www.thenation.com/article/bernies-burlington-city-sustainable-future/) while governing. This shows his success while holding a seat of governance.
1.9.15.2.1. Con: The population of Burlington, VT isn't a [diverse population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/burlingtoncityvermont), nor is the Population of [Vermont](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/VT). Sanders hasn't shown an ability to unite a diverse coalition.
1.9.15.3. Con: Bernie Sanders has the most diverse supporter demographic of any candidate running in 2020. Many [sources](https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-bro-myth-sanders-base-more-diverse-2019-3) [show](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/7/18216899/bernie-sanders-bro-base-polling-2020-president) [that](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/08/bernie-sanders-white-bernie-bro-race-2020-democratic-primary-pew-poll) [Bernie](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/demographics?id=N00000528)'s coalition is broad.
1.9.15.3.1. Pro: Only [49%](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/08/bernie-sanders-white-bernie-bro-race-2020-democratic-primary-pew-poll) of Sanders supporters are white, compared with 56% of Biden voters, 59% of Harris voters and 71% of Warren voters.
1.9.15.3.2. Pro: Sanders has roughly equal support between male \([32%](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bernie-bro-myth-sanders-base-more-diverse-2019-3?r=US&IR=T)\) and female \(31%\) voters.
1.9.15.3.3. Pro: Sanders has support across different racial groups - [31%](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bernie-bro-myth-sanders-base-more-diverse-2019-3?r=US&IR=T) of white voters, 32% of African American voters, 37% of Hispanic and 33% of 'other' voters say they would support Sanders.
1.9.15.4. Con: Sanders has a long history of forming coalitions and working with Republicans. He was able to pass [the most comprehensive veterans bill](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-sanders-mccain-veterans-bill) in modern history with Republican Senator John McCain with a near unanimous vote. He also passed the first ever [War Powers Resolution Act](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/04/congress-yemen-war-powers-bernie-sanders-mike-lee-column/3363199002/) to end the war in Yemen with Republican Senator Mike Lee.
1.9.15.5. Con: Many had the same fears about Trump, yet he got elected anyways. So this fact won't affect the probability that Sanders will be elected.
1.9.15.6. Pro: Sanders has made [many enemies](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-upshot-on-sanders-warren-harris-and-biden/) in the Democratic establishment due to his history of criticising the party. Broad support within one's own party is essential for any kind of successful legislative agenda.
1.9.15.6.1. Pro: Sanders also has been [criticised](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/252354-bernie-sanders-and-his-enemies-to-the-left%3famp) by those to the left of him politically, which exacerbates this problem further.
1.9.15.6.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.6.2.
1.9.15.6.3. Con: Distinction should be made here between voters and the party establishment. High levels of [public support](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/26/democratic-party-centrism-aoc-sanders-warren/) for Sander's policies [can](http://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-74) \(and should\) override establishment bias against him.
1.9.15.7. Pro: Sanders has had [little success](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/bernies-record-220508) passing actual legislation on Capitol Hill.
1.9.15.7.1. Con: Passing measurable legislation is a poor indicator of political impact. Sanders has been [continuously elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_history_of_Bernie_Sanders) for near 30 years; clearly he effectively represents and reflects his constituent body.
1.9.15.7.2. Con: The role of the President is not to [pass legislation](https://www.thoughtco.com/legislative-powers-of-the-president-3322195).
1.9.15.7.3. Pro: Because big business is so effective at pushing for legislation and Bernie refuses \(for the most part\) to pander to their wants, he does not have the same influence as other senators.
1.9.15.7.4. Con: Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress \(1995-2007\) [than any other](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/) member of Congress. In fact, during this period he was labelled the ["Amendment King"](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-177955/).
1.9.15.7.5. Con: During Sanders time as a Member of Congress \(1991-2007\), the Centre for Effective Lawmaking rated him as [meeting or exceeding expectation](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-was-roll-call-amendment-king-1995-2/) in regard to his legislative effectiveness.
1.9.15.7.6. Con: When the rest of the Senate is [bought by corporate interests](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/how-corporate-lobbyists-conquered-american-democracy/390822/), it's difficult to actually get any legislation through that would actually help the citizens.
1.9.15.7.6.1. Pro: The US political system can be characterised as an "oligarchy", in part due to the influence of corporate interests through money in politics [\(Winters and Page, pp. 742-743\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231898807_Oligarchy_in_the_United_States).
1.9.15.7.6.2. Pro: Average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little to no influence on government policy [\(Gilens and Page, p. 564\)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf).
1.9.15.7.6.2.1. Con: When average Americans and elites disagree, both groups are equally likely to get their preferred policy outcome [\(Bashir, p. 1\)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015608896).
1.9.15.7.6.2.2. Con: Even if average citizens have little influence compared to \(supposedly influential\) wealthy citizens, Gilens and Page's dataset shows that the views of wealthy citizens highly correlate with those of the average citizens [\(Bashir, 1\)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015608896).
1.9.15.7.6.2.2.1. Con: The top 1% of US wealth-holders are "much more conservative" than the wider American public regarding policies concerning taxation, economic regulation, and social welfare programs [\(Page et al, p. 51\)](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf). Within this group, the top one-tenth of the 1% tend to hold even more conservative views on these issues.
1.9.15.7.6.2.3. Pro: Polling shows that the majority of Americans, [support greater government activism](https://prospect.org/article/most-americans-are-liberal-even-if-they-don%E2%80%99t-know-it) to address widening inequality, the political influence of big business, declining living standards, climate change and health care. Yet government policy in recent times has not reflected this.
1.9.15.7.6.2.4. Pro: Congress has a very faulty understanding of what policies Americans support. The senior staffers who are critical in helping members of Congress decide what policies support have ["wildly inaccurate"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/congress-midterms-public-opinion.html#click=https://t.co/qWBRu7C5hw) perceptions of their constituents’ opinions and preferences.
1.9.15.7.6.2.4.1. Pro: [92%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/congress-midterms-public-opinion.html#click=https://t.co/qWBRu7C5hw) of Congressional staffers surveyed underestimate the support in their district or state for background checks.
1.9.15.7.6.3. Pro: Economic elites and corporate interest groups have a substantial influence in US government policy [\(Gilens and Page, p. 1\)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf).
1.9.15.7.6.3.1. Pro: Tax rates have changed in favour of the wealthy since money started to have a bigger influence on politics. In 1960, the top marginal tax rate was [91%](https://taxfoundation.org/some-historical-tax-stats/), while today it is [39.6%](https://www.irs.com/articles/2017-federal-tax-rates-personal-exemptions-and-standard-deductions).
1.9.15.7.6.3.2. Pro: Economic distributions have changed to benefit the wealthy since money started to have greater influence in politics. Since 1980, the wealthiest 1% of households have seen their [incomes rise](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/inequality/winner-take-all-politics-public-policy-political-organization-top-incomes/) 2.3 times, the top 0.1% of household a rise of more than 4 times, and the top 0.01% of households a rise of more than 6 times.
1.9.15.7.6.3.3. Pro: Between 1998 and 2017, the amount of money spent on lobbying has [more than doubled](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/). The [majority](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/how-corporate-lobbyists-conquered-american-democracy/390822/) of that lobbying money comes from corporations: for every dollar spent on lobbying by labor unions and public-interest groups, large corporations spend $34. Corporations would not continue to drastically increase the amount they spend lobbying if it was not an effective method to get the policy outcomes they want.
1.9.15.7.6.3.4. Con: Even in a country like the UK, which has [far less](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11377593/Graphic-UK-v-US-election-spending.html) political spending, elites are thought to have a [strong influence](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-wealth-political-power/) over government policy.
1.9.15.7.6.3.4.1. Con: The UK campaign finance system has also been [criticised](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/58501-2/) and reform has been frequently considered in recent years.
1.9.15.8. Con: The Almanac of American Politics has called Sanders a ["practical and successful"](https://alumniandfriends.uchicago.edu/alumni-association/awardee/2014/bernard-bernie-sanders) legislator.
1.9.15.9. Con: Sanders's policies are [very popular](https://www.salon.com/2017/01/14/americans-overwhelmingly-support-bernie-sanders-economic-policies-so-howd-we-end-up-here/), so democratic principles demand that we try to implement them, regardless of whether we are likely to succeed.
1.9.15.9.1. Con: You can't just choose to *ignore* the viability of pushing policy through congress. The people can want it all they want and a stacked congress is going to block it until the cows come home.
1.9.16. Pro: Bernie Sanders has a strong policy platform on issues which matter to American voters.
1.9.16.1. Con: Sanders has a long list of very expensive programs he wants to implement: Medicare for all, "free" college tuition, supports the green new deal, etc. These, if implemented, would add untold billions to the US's already overburdened debt. His policy proposals are [financially reckless](http://www.crfb.org/papers/adding-senator-sanderss-campaign-proposals-so-far).
1.9.16.1.1. Con: Sanders plans to cover the cost of single payer medicare for all through [new income taxes](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18304448/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all) on both employees and employers.
1.9.16.1.2. Con: In 2018, America spent US $[649 billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2019/world-military-expenditure-grows-18-trillion-2018) on its defense budget whereas countries like China only spent $250 billion and Russia only $61.4 billion. Climate change is a bigger problem than any military threat, and the funds Sanders [would cut](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/2/18525580/bernie-sanders-plan-cut-military-spending) from the military budget could be diverted to tackle this real issue.
1.9.16.1.2.1. Pro: The green new deal is not only needed but will also [create new jobs](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/green-new-deal-would-boost-restoration-economy-what-does-mean) that matter.
1.9.16.1.2.1.1. Con: The green new deal would "[destroy massive amounts of wealth and technology](https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/07/ten-most-insane-requirements-green-new-deal/)"; meaning many more jobs would cease to exist.
1.9.16.1.2.2. Con: The idea that climate change is a more immediate threat than foreign invasion is unfounded and unrealistic. If interstate conflict were to happen it would be much more deadly than climate change in that same amount of time.
1.9.16.1.2.2.1. Con: A military conflict could cause more death and more costly damage than climate change. However climate change is [almost certainly](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) going to happen whether there is military conflict or not. It will likely have long term and wide spread effects [comparable](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health) to a military conflict. That makes it worth considering using defense spending to defend people from climate change.
1.9.16.1.3. Con: [The Debt](https://modernmoneybasics.com/) will never be a burden to future generations in a sovereign currency free-floating exchange rate regime such as the U.S.[Evidence in this thread](https://www.kialo.com/modern-monetary-theory-mmt-5854).
1.9.16.1.4. Con: Medicare for all [costs less](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3232864) than the current system in America today.
1.9.16.1.5. Con: Sanders plans to cover the cost of free tuition at public colleges and universities and student debt cancellation with a [less than 1 percent tax](https://www.npr.org/2016/02/12/466465333/sanders-favors-a-speculation-tax-on-big-wall-street-firms-what-is-that) on securities trading on wall street.
1.9.16.1.6. Pro: The programs Bernie Sanders intends to implement will cost upwards of [$97 trillion](https://www.city-journal.org/bernie-sanders-expensive-spending-proposals) over the next decade. The US government cannot afford this.
1.9.16.1.6.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders proposes spending [$16.3 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/28/bernie-sanders-climate-plan-sets-tone-on-crucial-issue-in-democratic-primary.html) on renewable energy to combat climate change.
1.9.16.1.6.2. Pro: Bernie Sanders proposal to pay minimum wage earners a '[living wage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/23/bernie-sanders-to-unveil-plan-to-guarantee-every-american-a-job/)' is estimated to cost $30.1 billion.
1.9.16.1.6.3. Pro: Sanders' plan to raise the annual salaries of public school teachers to [$60,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-unveils-plan-to-overhaul-public-education-2019-5) is estimated to cost $640 billion.
1.9.16.2. Con: If Sanders were to implement his policy platform, it could have harmful effects on the economy.
1.9.16.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.16.1.
1.9.16.2.2. Pro: His proposal to increase the minimum wage to $15 may actually have adverse effects.
1.9.16.2.2.1. Pro: [Automation threatens to take millions of jobs.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/these-workers-face-the-highest-risk-of-losing-their-jobs-to-automation.html) Forcing the minimum wage up financially incentivizes automating your workforce.
1.9.16.2.2.1.1. Con: Automation will fundamentally transform the workforce whether we increase the minimum wage or not. Increasing the minimum wage is the first step toward guaranteeing that workers have economic agency in the technologically-mediated future
1.9.16.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Raising the minimum wage, while facing automation in manufacturing, retail, transportation, and clerical work, trusts corporations to not cut the workforce for the far cheaper automated work. The $15 minimum wage will be of little help to those that are laid off when the industry in which they have experience is undergoing massive displacement.
1.9.16.2.2.1.2. Con: Automation is a good thing. It will free humanity of jobs which don't need us to waste our time and life in. Therefore, we can explore more meaningful paths which add real value to the world. After enough automation, an automation tax could also fund a better universal basic income.
1.9.16.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Even if younger generations could be trained with automation in mind, those who are already working will be in a difficult situation.
1.9.16.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Automation equals increased efficiency which means the economy requires less labor to produce the same amount of goods and services. This is a good thing because economic efficiency results in more abundance, cheaper prices, and more free time for American consumers.
1.9.16.2.2.1.3. Pro: [Many \(Walmart\) jobs](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/bernie-sanders-socialist-policies-would-crush-the-walmart-workers-he-says-hes-fighting-for) are already on the path toward automation, and nothing will get them there faster than a sudden 50% or 75% increase in labor costs for all low-skill workers.
1.9.16.2.2.2. Con: Increasing the minimum wage will grant people more cash on hand which they can spend to stimulate the economy or pay off private debt.
1.9.16.2.2.2.1. Pro: Paying off private debt enables people to take greater risks which can lead to more capital ventures and innovation.
1.9.16.2.2.2.2. Con: Increasing the minimum wage could force small businesses with small profit margins to either eliminate staff, cut benefits, or close their doors.
1.9.16.2.2.2.2.1. Con: The short-run impact is a small reduction in hiring because of higher cost. But because low wage earners tend to spend all their income in necessities, this wage increase is immediately recycled back into the economy, creating multiplier effect. In the long-run it actually contributes to higher GDP. [Lemos \(2004\)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=524803) and [Dube, Reich, et Michael \(2010\)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/86w5m90m) both found no adverse employment effects from raising minimum wage.
1.9.16.2.2.2.3. Con: [Raising the minimum wage will only hurt small businesses, as larger corporations will simply automate labor, cut back on hours and benefits, and hire less workers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V5rvfJ_am0)
1.9.16.2.2.3. Con: Empirical studies have determined that there [have not been negative effects on employment level or middle incomes](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25434) thanks to raises in minimum wages in the period 1975 - today. Additionally, raises in minimum wage seems to raise middle class income too.
1.9.16.2.2.3.1. Con: There may not have been negative affects in the past, that's true. However this is irrelevant when our society is on the cusp of the next industrial revolution due to automation. We need to develop policies that look to the future, not the past.
1.9.16.2.2.4. Con: [A Congressional Budget Office annalists](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55681) of the Raise the Wage Act \(as passed by the House of Representatives on July 18, 2019\) concluded that raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2026 would reduce the number of people in poverty by 1.1 million and increase Real Annual Income by 11.6 billion dollars for families making an average of $55,700. Although projections vary by income group, the CBO analysis clearly shows that real income will increase for families making less than $95,000 per year.
1.9.16.2.3. Con: If Sanders were to implement his policy platform, it could have positive effects on the economy.
1.9.16.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.16.2.2.2.
1.9.16.2.3.2. Pro: Too much inequality is actually slowing economic growth in the US [right now.](https://www.epi.org/publication/secular-stagnation/) Sanders platform would adress this.
1.9.16.2.4. Con: Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts professor, projects [serious gains](https://money.cnn.com/2016/02/08/news/economy/sanders-income-jobs/index.html) for economic metrics if Sanders' plans are implemented.
1.9.16.2.5. Con: Sanders's top policy issue is Medicare for all, and according to [a study by the University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1127-economic-analysis-of-medicare-for-all), Medicare for all will save 5 trillion dollars over 10 years and will result in better health outcomes.
1.9.16.2.6. Con: If there was serious economic risk to Sanders policy plans we would be able to see the negative outcomes in other developed countries where most of his plans are already implemented and have been for some time.
1.9.16.2.6.1. Pro: One [study](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-2017-international-comparison-reflects-flaws-and) proves a single-payer healthcare system, like Bernie proposes, is superior to the current US system.
1.9.16.2.6.1.1. Pro: The eleven developed countries studied [found](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-2017-international-comparison-reflects-flaws-and) "the U.S. ranked last on performance overall, and ranked last or near last on the Access, Administrative Efficiency, Equity, and Health Care Outcomes domains." The US is the only country studied that does not have a universal healthcare system.
1.9.16.3. Pro: Sanders has a strong economic platform established as part of the 2016 democratic primary race. Income inequality was described as a "[cornerstone](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110915/review-bernie-sanders-economic-policies.asp)" issue for Sanders.
1.9.16.3.1. Pro: Economic populism is a [key reason](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/05/23/how_hillary_clintons_party_produced_bernie_sanders_133963.html) that Bernie Sanders was able to close a [60 point deficit](https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/poll-who-is-winning-democrats-2016-222088) in the 2016 Democratic Primary with little name recognition and nearly surpass Hillary Clinton \(another centrist\).
1.9.16.3.2. Con: In a general election, many of Sanders' policy proposals to address economic inequality are widely perceived as "socialist", which has significant political baggage in its connotations.
1.9.16.3.3. Pro: Bernie Sanders \(I-Vt.\) proudly announced this year that his presidential campaign would be the first in history to have a [unionized workforce](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/15/bernie-campaign-2020-staff-union-1223914).
1.9.16.3.3.1. Con: Sanders is insincere on this promise because his own campaign workers union, UF & C Workers Local 400, has field staffers “making poverty wages” and that “many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially.” well below the $15 per hr, minimum wage Sanders has called for.[washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/23/bernie-sanders-runs-into-socialist-reality/?utm_term=.1b846e8c37de)
1.9.16.3.3.2. Con: Sanders is insincere on this promise because his own campaign workers union, UF&C Workers Local 400 has Field Organizers working 60 hours a week, making an annual salary of $36,000 \($13 hourly\) — well below the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage [Sanders has called for.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/23/bernie-sanders-runs-into-socialist-reality/?utm_term=.1b846e8c37de)
1.9.16.3.4. Pro: The [economy](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244367/top-issues-voters-healthcare-economy-immigration.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=TOPIC&g_campaign=item_&g_content=Top%2520Issues%2520for%2520Voters%3a%2520Healthcare%2c%2520Economy%2c%2520Immigration) is an important issue for American voters.
1.9.16.3.4.1. Pro: It is important for the Democratic nominee to have a strong economic policy platform as this is an area where Trump has strong views.
1.9.16.3.4.1.1. Pro: President Trump has been claiming that the US economy is [the best it has ever been.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45827430)
1.9.16.3.5. Pro: Sanders [supports](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/) increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2020.
1.9.16.3.5.1. Pro: Inflation has steadily declined the dollars buying power. Meanwhile, the working class has not seen much of an increase in their wages. $15 an hour is the minimum needed to pay bills and put food on the table.
1.9.16.3.6. Pro: Sanders [supports](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/) reversing trade policies such as [NAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement), [CAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic%E2%80%93Central_America_Free_Trade_Agreement) and permanent normal trade relations [\(PNTR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_normal_trade_relations) with China.
1.9.16.3.7. Pro: Sanders [supports](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/) investing $5.5 billion in youth job programs.
1.9.16.3.8. Pro: Sanders [supports](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/) a progressive estate tax on the top 0.3% of Americans.
1.9.16.4. Pro: Bernie Sanders actually [wrote the bills](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/bernie-sanders-debate.html) for many of the ideas that he is proposing, and some other Democratic candidates are even using those bills and ideas in their own campaigns.
1.9.16.5. Pro: Bernie Sanders has a [strong view on climate change](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/green-new-deal/) and will develop new jobs in the renewable energy sector.
1.9.16.5.1. Con: There are stronger candidates on this issue; Andrew Yang has proposed and supports a [Constitutional Amendment](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/climate-change/) on climate -- [The Green Amendment](https://www.good.is/test/presidential-candidate-green-new-deal).
1.9.16.5.2. Con: [Bernie Sanders does not support nuclear energy](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/cnn-climate-town-hall-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-nuclear-power.html), nor research into future nuclear energy like thorium reactors that can potentially be a great asset in the fight against climate change, and be a far safer alternative that won't produce much nuclear waste and prevent future Chernobyls and Fukushimas.
1.9.16.6. Pro: Sanders is the only candidate with an unwavering support for an actual universal, single-payer healthcare system \(not merely so-called 'access'\) to give everyone in America healthcare free at the point of use and [a plan to pay for it](https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/).
1.9.16.7. Pro: Healthcare is currently one of the most [important issues](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244367/top-issues-voters-healthcare-economy-immigration.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=TOPIC&g_campaign=item_&g_content=Top%2520Issues%2520for%2520Voters%3a%2520Healthcare%2c%2520Economy%2c%2520Immigration) for American voters, and Bernie is [strongly in favor](https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-healthcare/) of expanding access to healthcare.
1.9.16.7.1. Pro: In 2017, Sanders was the driving force behind the [Single-Payer Health Care Bill](https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/) which has given Sanders a strong public platform.
1.9.17. Pro: Bernie Sanders is one of the most popular politicians in the United States. Therefore, he would be a good candidate in the general election.
1.9.17.1. Pro: Early polling suggests that the American people would far [prefer](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/trump-2020-democrats-matchup-790890) to elect Bernie Sanders as the president \(44%\) rather than reelect Trump \(32%\).
1.9.17.2. Pro: Bernie has demonstrated that he can appeal to a large base, as diagnosed from his [performance](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/bernie-sanders-fox-news-winning-performance/) on a Fox-hosted town hall in Pennsylvania.
1.9.17.2.1. Con: Those were likely Sanders supporters in the audience who approved of his message. Receiving applause from his base is not a significant predictor of his success in a general election.
1.9.17.2.2. Pro: Bernie's values and policy proposals garnered support from Conservatives in 2015/16 as demonstrated by this [data](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-was-helped-by-the-neverhillary-vote-what-does-that-mean-for-his-chances-now/?fbclid=IwAR3YOZq97w8HHVOnY5i3t_5TsD84CDNJEr5UeWnqhSnlCbCkEuU3XUL9MII) - his message of unity and leveling the playing field resonates across the political spectrum.
1.9.17.3. Con: Bernie Sanders [lacks the support of prominent figures](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1117021#blogHeader\]) in the Latino community. For example, Julian Castro has recently endorsed Elizabeth Warren.
1.9.17.4. Con: [Research](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/polls-as-accurate-as-they-have-ever-been-study-says) shows that early Presidential polling may not be very accurate. At this stage many candidates lack [name recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_recognition), and voters are still getting information and learning about the candidates and their policies.
1.9.17.4.1. Pro: In December 2006, Obama was the favorite Democrat nominee of [only 12%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries) of the public. This demonstrates that the results of early polling are largely inconsequential.
1.9.17.4.1.1. Pro: At this point \(July the year prior to the election\) in the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump was polling at [only 6%](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html) in the Republican primary race.
1.9.17.4.2. Con: Democratic voters are already very familiar with some of the candidates and their platforms. For example, [91% of voters](https://news.gallup.com/poll/243539/americans-maintain-positive-view-bernie-sanders.aspx) know Bernie Sanders, and he has been [extremely consistent](https://www.npr.org/2015/12/11/459231940/bernie-sanders-has-stuck-to-the-same-message-for-40-years) in his political positions for the last 40 years.
1.9.17.4.3. Pro: Notable pollsters believe that the results of democratic nominee polls at this point are largely just [reflective of name recognition](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/415765-2020-polls-are-about-name-id-at-this-point-say-pollsters).
1.9.17.5. Pro: Sanders is a well established candidate with a [high level](https://news.gallup.com/poll/243539/americans-maintain-positive-view-bernie-sanders.aspx) of name recognition.
1.9.17.6. Pro: Bernie Sanders is the [most popular senator](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/10/senator-approval-ratings-morning-consult/1590329002/) in the US. 63% of his constituents approve of him.
1.9.17.6.1. Con: There is a difference between having high levels of approval within a state vs nationally.
1.9.17.6.1.1. Con: Some polling has shown that Bernie Sanders is the [most popular](https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/27/mike-crute/despite-losing-nomination-hillary-clinton-bernie-s/) politician in the US. In polls when he is listed alongside other well-known US politicians, he tends to have the highest favorability rating.
1.9.17.6.1.1.1. Pro: [Recent polling](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/12/14/rel12e.-.2020.and.economy.pdf) done by CNN shows that Bernie Sanders has the highest favourability with [non-white voters](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/12/here-are-the-leaders-in-the-2020-polls.html) among all potential Democratic primary challengers in 2020.
1.9.17.6.2. Con: Popularity is not indicative of capabilities or fitness to be a quality candidate.
1.9.17.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.17.6.1.1.
1.9.17.7. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.6.2.
1.9.17.8. Con: 69% of Republicans view Bernie Sanders [unfavorably](https://news.gallup.com/poll/243539/americans-maintain-positive-view-bernie-sanders.aspx).
1.9.17.8.1. Con: 62% of Republicans believe corporations hold too much power - an issue Sanders consistently rails against, and which [swayed some conservatives to switch parties](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/the-lifelong-conservatives-who-love-bernie-sanders/417441/) to vote for him in 2015.
1.9.17.8.2. Con: If that statistic is about registered Republicans it means 69% of the 23% of the electorate who are registered as Republicans, or 16% of the total electorate.
1.9.17.8.3. Con: That is much lower than the Republicans who viewed [Barack Obama unfavourably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_and_conservative_support_for_Barack_Obama_in_2008#Commentary_and_events). Keep in mind, a large portion of the electorate didn't vote because they didn't think either candidate was authentic.
1.9.17.8.3.1. Pro: Given those numbers, Sanders is viewed at least 2.5x more favorably by Republicans than Obama given Sanders is viewed somewhat favorably by 31% of Republicans and [Obama's approval with the Republicans rested at 13%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203006/obama-job-approval-ratings-politically-polarized-far.aspx).
1.9.17.8.4. Pro: Political scientists [predict](https://www.verdict.co.uk/negative-partisanship-democrat-2020/) that "[negative partisanship](https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2018/08/exploring-concept-negative-partisanship-and-how-it-might-affect-novembers-res/)" \(where voters are motivated more by opposition to another party than their own parties' policies\) will play a major role in the 2020 presidential election. Therefore it is important for the Democrats to stand a candidate who is not viewed too negatively by Republicans.
1.9.17.9. Pro: 39% of [independents](https://news.gallup.com/poll/243539/americans-maintain-positive-view-bernie-sanders.aspx) view Bernie Sanders favorably.
1.9.17.9.1. Con: 39% of independents isn't a significant amount. Bernie lacks a sizeable majority, and therefore a candidate appealing to more independents should be found.
1.9.17.9.2. Pro: There are many voters that feel both disenfranchised by the Democrat and and Republican Party. Bernie poses the best option.
1.9.18. Con: Bernie Sanders is too old. If he were to win a general election, he would become president at [age 79](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-progressives-presidential-election-2020.html).
1.9.18.1. Pro: Many younger voters want a younger Presidential nominee who would potentially be more in tune with their worldview.
1.9.18.1.1. Con: Many younger voters are able to recognize that policy, and not age, is the most important factor when selecting a candidate that will represent their interest.
1.9.18.1.2. Con: This claim is patently false. Bernie Sanders, [garnered more youth votes than Trump and Clinton combined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/more-young-people-voted-for-bernie-sanders-than-trump-and-clinton-combined-by-a-lot/). His base also remains solid, [with strong support from diverse and young Americans](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/7/18216899/bernie-sanders-bro-base-polling-2020-president).
1.9.18.1.3. Pro: [43 out of 76](https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-iowa-candidates-young-9c594528-634c-49dd-b19a-a91b7e273404.html) of Iowa's Democratic county party leaders say they want a young candidate to be their nominee for president in 2020.
1.9.18.1.4. Pro: More than [three quarters of young Americans](http://fortune.com/2018/07/30/young-voters-poll/) think that leaders from their own generation would do a better job than current politicians.
1.9.18.1.5. Pro: A younger nominee would experience what the majority of people experience, and therefore would be able to relate to the society better.
1.9.18.2. Con: Trump, the current oldest president in office in history will be 74, and Bernie 79. That's not much of a difference. Both claim to be in good health, however Trump could very well be at higher risk of death than Bernie due his known obesity. Doctors have confirmed he has [high cholesterol and has already been diagnosed with heart disease.](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20190215/physical-shows-trump-is-obese-but-in-good-health)
1.9.18.3. Con: This argument is blatantly [ageist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2019/03/23/age-discrimination-and-the-presidential-election/#30e355be5d31).
1.9.18.3.1. Pro: A candidate must be 35 years of age at minimum to run for office, but there is no legislation in place that prevents someone from being too old to serve.
1.9.18.4. Con: Other candidates besides Bernie are older individuals. With age comes wisdom and a proven track record. We can easily see where these candidates stand on important issues. We can also see whether they've flip flopped, and pandered to gain support from citizens. It also reveals whether they've kept their promises or regressed to their original stances.
1.9.18.5. Pro: It is unethical and dangerous [to encourage a senior citizen to endure the demanding task](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/news/abrams_presidency_too_demanding_to_not_have_upper_age_limit_for_candidates_20080324) of presidency.
1.9.18.5.1. Con: South Africans would disagree with this claim, given that they voted in [Nelson Mandela for President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) who was close in age to Bernie Sanders. Malaysians would disagree as well, after just electing a [93-year old Presiden](https://qz.com/1404653/malaysian-prime-minister-mahathir-mohamad-age-93-tells-the-simple-secret-to-his-long-life/)t to fight against corruption.
1.9.18.6. Pro: Sanders' presidential campaign would be plagued by questions about whether his age makes him incapable of dealing with the stress of being president.
1.9.18.6.1. Con: His opponent will likely be similarly aged, so the issue will wash in the general.
1.9.18.6.2. Pro: Questions about Sanders' age would distract from the important issues in the presidential elections.
1.9.18.6.3. Con: It has become [standard practice](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/12/health/us-presidents-physicals-documents/index.html) for presidential candidates and sitting presidents to release details about their personal health.
1.9.18.6.4. Con: In 2016, Bernie Sander's doctor found that Sanders was overall in ["very good health"](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/bernie-sanders-medical-records/index.html).
1.9.18.7. Pro: The public may not feel confident voting for a candidate who is so old.
1.9.18.7.1. Con: Polls indicate otherwise, 3 front-runners who are old men \([Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election), [Sanders, Biden](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html)\)
1.9.18.7.2. Pro: Donald Trump was [70 years old](http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/america/unitedstates/presidents/byage.htm) when he became president. Questions about his age and physical health were a [substantial issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_of_Donald_Trump#Physical_health) for him during the 2016 election.
1.9.18.7.2.1. Con: Despite the questions around Donald Trump's health he was still [able to win the presidency.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump)
1.9.18.7.3. Pro: An older candidate may die in office if elected.
1.9.18.7.3.1. Con: All presidents have the possibility of dying in office.[Of the 8 presidents who have died in office, only 4 died of natural causes](http://australianpolitics.com/usa/president/us-presidents-who-have-died-in-office). 2 of those deaths were from environmental factors\([pneumonia](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/what-really-killed-william-henry-harrison.html)/[eating too many cherries and milk](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-zachary-taylor-dies-unexpectedly)\) and 2 were from age related factors\([heart-attack](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/strange-death-warren-harding)/[stroke](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-dies)\). While in office, a president is actually probably most likely to die from assassination which can happen at any age.
1.9.18.7.4. Pro: A [Reuters / Ipsos poll](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-stonewall-poll/age-matters-more-than-sexual-orientation-to-us-presidential-voters-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1TB145) on June 10, 2019 found that "48% of adults in the United States said they were 'much' or 'somewhat' less likely to support someone for the White House if the person was older than 70".
1.9.18.7.5. Con: An appropriate younger Vice President running mate could balance the ticket and alleviate concerns about age.
1.9.18.7.5.1. Pro: Pete Buttigieg would be a VP candidate who could help address these concerns.
1.9.18.7.5.1.1. Pro: At 37, he is younger than most other candidates which might make him [more attuned](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/young-people-are-looking-for-younger-leaders-poll-finds) to the unique challenges of leadership in a changing world. Whereas his older opponents might be more likely to get stuck in paradigms of the past.
1.9.18.7.5.1.1.1. Con: The same can also be said of other candidates such as [Andrew Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang) \(Age 44\), and [Tulsi Gabbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) \(Age 38\). Therefore his age is not a distinct advantage.
1.9.18.7.5.2. Con: Bernie is leaning towards [70 year old](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/7/bernie-sanders-suggests-elizabeth-warren-possible-/) Elizabeth Warren as a potential running mate if he is the Democratic choice. Age does not seem to be a balancing factor for him.
1.9.18.7.6. Pro: These candidates mental/physical health may deteriorate before or within their term, unless the treatments and/or therapies of the future are able to remedy this.
1.9.18.7.7. Pro: Most democratic voters [prefer](https://www.people-press.org/2019/05/23/nearly-half-of-democrats-say-the-best-age-for-a-president-is-in-their-50s/) a president between the ages of 40 and 60 years of age. Sanders is past this point.
1.9.18.7.8. Con: The public votes for [older political candidates](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_senators_by_age.html) all the time.
1.9.18.8. Con: Democrats should run their best candidate and not worry about issues that don't matter such as age.
1.9.18.8.1. Con: -> See 1.9.18.7.3.
1.9.18.8.2. Con: The older someone is the [higher the chance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683339/) that they'll face cognitive decline.
1.9.18.8.3. Con: The Democrats should run a candidate who can be a leader for the Democratic party past the 2020 election. It is likely that an older candidate would only be able to serve as President for one term.
1.9.18.9. Con: If he picks a Vice President whom he feels aligns with correct values, then the health of the President shouldn't matter as the ideas live on in the Vice Presidential candidate.
1.9.18.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.18.7.5.
1.9.18.10. Con: According to his doctors, Bernie Sanders is [physically and mentally fit](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-12-30/bernie-sanders-health-doctors) to serve as president despite his age. Therefore, age is not a relevant factor in Bernie's case.
1.9.18.11. Con: [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2010/022.pdf), the life expectancy \(mean remaining years\) of a white male in the United States who has reached the age of 75 was 10.6 years in 2007 and climbing approximately 0.1 year every year. Bernie Sanders reached age 75 in 2016, by which time the life expectancy for his demographic was likely 11.5 years \(86.5 years old\), which means he is extremely likely to live for one full term as president if elected in 2020 and has about a 50% chance of living through two full terms.
1.9.18.12. Con: Sanders appears to be as sharp as ever and continues to hold his own in debates and on the world stage. He shows no signs of mental deterioration unlike some other candidates.
1.9.18.13. Pro: Based upon the [actuarial life table](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#fn2) Bernie Sanders would have a 23% chance of dying during his term as president. This is not including the odds that he would become unwell.
1.9.18.13.1. Con: -> See 1.9.18.6.4.
1.10. [John Hickenlooper](https://www.hickenlooper.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.10.1. Pro: Hickenlooper's main campaign goals include addressing[climate change and gun control](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/04/ex-colorado-gov-john-hickenlooper-launches-2020-presidential-campaign.html) which align with popular Democratic beliefs.
1.11. [Joe Biden](https://joebiden.com/)
1.11.1. Con: Much of the right's criticism of Clinton during the 2016 election was criticism of the Obama administration that she had been a part of. Biden will likely struggle with the same issue and it could hurt him in a general election.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Biden was [Vice President](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48219941) during President Obama's terms in office.
1.11.2. Pro: Biden has not publicly supported most of the "progressive" policies that other nominees are currently promoting, which may help win him many votes in the general election.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Not all Americans are in favor of "progressive" policies. Progressive activists only make up [only about 8% of the population](https://hiddentribes.us/#americas-hidden-tribes).
1.11.2.1.1. Con: The study cited uses "hierarchical clustering" to identify groups, a machine learning technique with very subjective results [\(p. 28\)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_fall2012/slides/clustering.pdf).
1.11.2.1.1.1. Pro: Hierarchical clustering returns a dendrogram, each level of which corresponds to a different number of clusters. The researchers in the cited study chose to split the dendrogram at 7 clusters, without explaining why. The language in the article misleads the reader to believe the algorithm gave them 7 clusters instead of choosing that number. The number of clusters would greatly effect the cited proportion of "progressive activists".
1.11.2.1.1.2. Pro: Attaching semantic labels to data clusters found with machine learning ultimately requires a [judgement call](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spector/s133/Clus.html) made by the authors based on example cases. This is subjective in nature and it's unclear how well the assigned labels generalize to the whole cluster.
1.11.2.2. Con: Many progressive policies such as Medicare for All and Free College Tuition are [very popular among the general public](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/), so not supporting them puts him at a disadvantage.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: Slightly more than half of American voters self-identify as “[moderate](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/03/25/the_democratic_party_is_the_party_of_moderates_139846.html).”
1.11.2.3. Pro: Biden may be able to win over [previous Obama voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama-Trump_voters) who supported Trump last time.
1.11.3. Con: Joe Biden has a [history](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/biden-in-74-women-dont-have-sole-right-to-say-what-should-happen-to-their-bodies_n_5c78409ae4b0de0c3fbf2b70) of [wavering](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/us/politics/biden-abortion-rights.html) when it comes to women’s reproductive rights due to his religious beliefs. With the current stare of affairs we need a strong advocate to be pro-choice, and Biden [may not be that person](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/joe-biden-abortion-stance-may-sink-democratic-primary-hopes/).
1.11.3.1. Pro: Biden [supports](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-supports-hyde-amendment-splits-2020-dems/story?id=63506190) the Hyde Amendment, in a time where a [majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/04/a-majority-of-americans-think-abortion-will-still-be-legal-in-30-years-but-with-some-restrictions/) of Democrats are Pro-Choice.
1.11.4. Con: Biden would be 78 in 2020. This might make it [difficult](https://www.newsweek.com/rick-santorum-says-if-democrats-pick-someone-old-bernie-sanders-or-elizabeth-1251394) for him to appeal to an increasingly younger Democratic voter base.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Biden may come across as less able to relate to young voters and therefore they may not trust him.
1.11.4.1.1. Pro: Biden showed [no empathy for millennials](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbpxx8/biden-trashes-millennials-in-his-quest-to-become-even-less-likable) having a hard time affording to live.
1.11.4.2. Con: Early polling suggests that Biden is [performing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/05/polls-say-joe-bidens-age-isnt-necessarily-hurting-him-with-young-democrats/?utm_term=.597701007a2c) well with younger voters.
1.11.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.9.18.1.3.
1.11.4.2.2. Con: We are 1 year away from the [first primary in Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#2020). At this same point in leading up to the 2016 primary, [polls showed Hillary at 60% and Sanders at 4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries). There is an [obvious corporate media agenda](https://benjamindavidsteele.wordpress.com/2017/02/19/corporate-bias-of-mainstream-media/) in rolling out these [unbelievable polls](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/423023-a-majority-of-americans-are-skeptical-that-public-opinion-polls).
1.11.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.18.7.
1.11.4.4. Con: -> See 1.9.18.8.
1.11.5. Con: Biden is beholden to corporate interests and therefore won't be responsive to the interests of the average American.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Biden backed bills that made it harder for Americans to [reduce their student debt](https://www.consumerbankers.com/cba-media-center/cba-news/joe-biden-backed-bills-make-it-harder-americans-reduce-their-student-debt). This benefitted the financial industry based in Delaware where he was a senator.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Biden has a [very strong](https://www.propublica.org/article/bidens-cozy-relations-with-bank-industry-825#) relationship with the banking industry.
1.11.5.2.1. Pro: As a senator for Delaware, Biden got so close to the local banking giant MBNA that he was [jokingly referred to](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/10/18173132/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-2020) as “the senator from MBNA”.
1.11.5.2.1.1. Pro: One of Joe Biden's sons was paid an undisclosed amount of money as a consultant by MBNA during the years Joe Biden was a senator and [supported legislation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mbna-paid-bidens-son-as-biden-backed-bill/) that was promoted by the credit card industry and opposed by consumer groups.
1.11.5.2.1.2. Pro: Biden was [a champion](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/10/18173132/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-2020) of legislation in 2005 \(mostly supported by Republicans\) whose aim was to make it more difficult for hard-pressed families to discharge their credit card debt in bankruptcy. MBNA were [major backers](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/bankruptcy_bill2.html) of this bankruptcy reform.
1.11.5.2.1.3. Pro: Over the past 20 years MBNA has been Biden's [single biggest campaign financier](https://www.propublica.org/article/bidens-cozy-relations-with-bank-industry-825#).
1.11.5.2.2. Con: Biden has [supported legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/politics/banking-ties-could-hurt-joe-biden-in-race-with-populist-overtone.html) such as the [Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-accountability-responsibility-and-disclosure-act-of-2009.asp) and the [Dodd-Franks Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) which protect consumers against the banking industry.
1.11.6. Con: Biden is a white man with [moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden) views: as the Democrat party [moves further left](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/opinion/democratic-party-progressive-left-midterm-elections.html), these factors become less desirable.
1.11.6.1. Con: If America is as racist and sexist [as many democrats claim](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/04/09/race-in-america-2019/), it would be in their interests to nominate a white male as they are less likely to be declined due to their sex and race.
1.11.6.2. Con: Allowing the color of someone's skin to influence a voting decision is one of the paramounts of racism. Biden's skin tone should not be a factor in the election.
1.11.6.2.1. Con: Whether it should be a factor is irrelevant to the question of whether it is a factor. Democrats can't affect policy if not in office, and thus it may be in their best interests to pander to their racist voters.
1.11.6.3. Con: The top 2 [in recent polls](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) for the 2020 Democratic nominee are white men.
1.11.6.4. Con: The idea that Democrats are anti-white/anti-male is [a tactic](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nomenmidterms-letwomendecide) used by the right to hurt the party.
1.11.6.5. Con: [60%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/160373/democrats-racially-diverse-republicans-mostly-white.aspx) of Democrats are white. Only white women are a larger demographic among Democrats than white men.
1.11.6.6. Pro: Joe Biden is not the leader America needs. It is essential that America addresses almost scandalous income and wealth inequality. Being a [centrist](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/16/joe-biden-2020-front-runner-problem-217995) make it so that Biden will not pursue economic reform as adamantly as other Democratic presidential candidates will.
1.11.6.6.1. Con: Being a centrist makes Biden more appealing to undecided voters. If he doesn't win the election, it's irrelevant what his policy prescriptions are.
1.11.6.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.2.
1.11.6.6.2. Pro: Biden has pushed for legislation which benefits big corporations.
1.11.6.6.2.1. Pro: Joe Biden co-sponsored the [Bankruptcy Reform Act \(1999\)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/833/all-info), which was opposed by consumer groups on the basis that it would make declaring bankruptcy [more costly and complex](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/30/joe-biden-senate-record-2016-campaign/73045484/). He also helped defeat amendments to this bill which would have protected people forced into bankruptcy by medical debts.
1.11.7. Con: Biden has been criticised over [his behaviour towards women](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-left-turns-on-bill-clinton-biden-over-behavior-toward-women).
1.11.7.1. Pro: Biden has frequently [commented](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-allegations-women-2020-campaign-2019-6) on the physical appearance of women he campaigns with.
1.11.7.2. Pro: [Eight women](https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html) have accused Biden of invading their personal space in a way that made them feel uncomfortable and touching them inappropriately.
1.11.8. Con: Biden [has a reputation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/9847946/Joe-Bidens-top-10-gaffes.html) for political gaffes.
1.11.8.1. Pro: Biden received [negative headlines](https://www.kusi.com/joe-biden-has-series-of-gaffes-during-live-interviews-on-cnn-and-msnbc/) for gaffes made while discussing the Coronavirus pandemic.
1.11.9. Pro: Biden provides a legacy of policy achievements that have appealed across the United States compared to a maverick and divisive candidate in Trump.
1.11.9.1. Con: [Biden advocated continued school segregation](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/joe-biden-embraced-segregation-in-1975-claiming-it-was-a-matter-of-black-pride) in the United States. In 1975 he opposed the federally mandated busing policy designed to end segregation in schools.
1.11.9.2. Con: Biden has a record of wanting to impose austerity by eliminating [Social Security and Medicare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j2k7tDK1gM). [\(and here at ~1:30\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=XBHlGFZCwu8)
1.11.9.3. Pro: Biden was former Vice President to [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) for two terms.
1.11.9.3.1. Pro: [In 2018](http://www.people-press.org/2018/07/11/obama-tops-publics-list-of-best-president-in-their-lifetime-followed-by-clinton-reagan/), Obama was voted by Americans as the best President in their lifetime. This likely means the public also holds a favorable view of Biden.
1.11.9.4. Pro: Joe Biden was one of the most [influential and effective](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/18/why-joe-biden-was-a-most-unusual-and-effective-vice-president/?utm_term=.a932776976c1) vice presidents in US history.
1.11.9.4.1. Pro: Joe Biden oversaw the [implementation](https://www.history.com/topics/us-politics/joe-biden#section_3) of a $787 billion economic stimulus package after the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008).
1.11.9.4.2. Pro: Joe Biden was Chairman of the [Middle Class Working Families Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Class_Working_Families_Task_Force), a government initiative which introduced solutions to solve problems faced by working families.
1.11.9.4.3. Pro: Joe Biden successfully fought to have [$6.3 billion allocated](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/joe-biden-cancer-moonshot-bill-232342) to research aiming to [find a cure for cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Breakthroughs_2020).
1.11.9.5. Con: As a [senator for the state of Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden#U.S._Senate_years_\(1973-2009\)), Biden crafted and voted for bills that have had negative consequences.
1.11.9.5.1. Pro: Joe Biden helped craft and pass an [anti-crime bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act) that led states to have [financial incentives](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/30/joe-biden-senate-record-2016-campaign/73045484/) to imprison people, which particularly affected many black and Latino youths.
1.11.9.5.1.1. Con: This same bill [also provided](https://www.history.com/topics/us-politics/joe-biden#section_2) for 100,000 more cops nationwide and banned assault weapons.
1.11.9.5.2. Pro: Joe Biden [voted in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden#Iraq) of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has historically been an issue for any democratic nominee because the war is [widely considered](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/democrats-foreign-policy-2020_us_5aa959dbe4b0f4aaa112ef0f) one of the US's biggest mistakes.
1.11.9.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.6.2.1.
1.11.9.6. Con: Joe Biden has a history of being in favour of a ["hawkish" foreign policy](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk). This type of foreign policy is [unpopular](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/397010-will-democrats-realize-that-americans-are-tired-of-war) with the American people, and in particular those in the midwest.
1.11.9.6.1. Pro: He has a reputation for bad foreign affairs decisions. Bob Gates was quoted as saying "[I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/bob-gates-memoir-slams-joe-biden-for-being-wrong-on-foreign-policy/)"
1.11.9.6.2. Pro: A study has shown that 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton may have been cost the general election because of the [level of battlefield casualties](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989040) amongst those from midwestern states.
1.11.10. Con: Generally speaking, the American electorate are not fans of Vice Presidents becoming President though election. Out of the 14 Presidents who have served as VP, only 5 gained the White House through election. Of which only 2 of those 5, gained a second term.
1.11.11. Con: Joe Biden has [repeatedly dismissed people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/29/joe-biden-go-vote-for-someone-else) in town hall settings, telling them to vote for someone else.
1.11.12. Pro: [Most](https://www.businessinsider.com/harris-endorsed-biden-heres-who-the-other-candidates-have-picked-2020-3#many-other-candidates-in-the-historical-2020-presidential-field-havent-endorsed-15) of the Democratic nominees that have dropped out of the presidential race are endorsing Joe Biden.
1.11.12.1. Pro: Marianne Williamson and Bill de Blasio are the [only](https://www.businessinsider.com/harris-endorsed-biden-heres-who-the-other-candidates-have-picked-2020-3#many-other-candidates-in-the-historical-2020-presidential-field-havent-endorsed-15) former nominees to support Bernie Sanders.
1.11.13. Pro: Joe Biden is extremely popular with the electorate. Therefore he is likely to be competitive in the general election.
1.11.13.1. Pro: Polling in July 2019 suggests that the American people would far [prefer](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html) to elect Joe Biden as president \(average of 49.4%\) rather than reelect Trump \(40.5%\).
1.11.13.1.1. Pro: ABC News & NYT has [obtained the polling data for June](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/14/trumps-internal-poll-numbers-are-out-both-they-his-teams-response-paint-bleak-picture/?utm_term=.7b00032ccd99), which show a brighter picture for Biden than any other candidate over all. "Trump trails Joe Biden by 16 points in Pennsylvania, 10 points in Wisconsin and seven points in Florida, and the president leads by just two points in red Texas."
1.11.13.1.2. Con: Polling in July 2019 also indicates that Bernie Sanders \(average of 49.7%\) is preferred to Trump \(average of 43.2%\). Biden is therefore nothing special in terms of his popularity and electability compared to Trump and is not uniquely positioned to win.
1.11.13.2. Pro: Biden's nearly [50 years of service in Congress and as Vice President](https://www.biography.com/political-figure/joe-biden) and his [reputation as a nice person](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/03/21/joe-biden-compassion-threatens-donald-trump-president-2020-column/3221879002/) grant him unparalleled [name recognition](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/11/18302119/joe-biden-name-recognition-polling-lead) and reputational quality amongst the public.
1.11.13.3. Pro: The RealClearPolitics average of [polls in July 2019](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) shows that Biden is the public's preferred candidate to be the Democratic nominee, leading with 27%.
1.11.13.3.1. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.1.
1.11.13.4. Con: Biden has run for the Democratic presidential nomination [twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden), in 1988 and 2008, and dropped out both times.
1.11.13.5. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.
1.11.13.6. Pro: Joe Biden is [popular](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/12/biden-donnelly-indiana-898519) in Midwestern states which are key for a Democratic electoral college win.
1.11.13.6.1. Pro: If Hillary Clinton had won [Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania](https://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-what-happened-2017-9) she would have beaten Donald Trump.
1.11.13.6.2. Con: -> See 1.11.9.6.
1.11.14. Pro: Trump's aides are rumored [to be nervous](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-2020-presidential-election-biden-warren-b3373114-970e-4b41-ac28-2a24c5905356.html) about Biden receiving the 2020 nomination.
1.11.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.13.1.
1.11.14.2. Con: Campaign aides have a bad track record of knowing which opposing candidates will succeed. [Hillary Clinton's team believed running against Trump would be a slam dunk.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428)
1.11.14.3. Pro: Many of Trump's signature political campaign tactics would not work with Biden as his opponent.
1.11.14.3.1. Pro: Trump often uses [white supremacist or misogynistic "dog whistle" remarks](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/) to undermine his opponents but Biden is a white male and so these concepts wouldn't directly apply to Biden.
1.11.14.3.2. Pro: Trump often insults his opponents using nicknames like "[Lying Ted](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/vbj93m/trump-lyin-ted-cruz-texas-midterms-billboard)" and "[Crooked Hillary](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/931877599034388480?lang=en)" but the best Trump seems to be able to come up with for Biden is "Sleepy Joe" which is at least [not a moral indictment](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/451691-biden-shrugs-off-heckler-calling-him-by-trump-nickname-sleepy-joe).
1.11.14.3.3. Pro: Trump often uses the concept of communism or socialism as a [derogatory epithet](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-socialists-republicans_n_5c706ea1e4b03cfdaa553c17) against his opponents but the former Vice President's reputation is that of [a political moderate](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/joe-biden-last-hurrah-moderate-democrats.html) with a record of [cooperating with conservatives](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-republicans-watergate-2020-election-1443414).
1.11.14.4. Con: Trump himself [genuinely](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-2020-presidential-election-biden-warren-b3373114-970e-4b41-ac28-2a24c5905356.html) doesn’t appear to his aides to be worried about Biden. Trump says Biden is a joke and claims that once the spotlight is on him, "bad stuff" will come out.
1.11.14.5. Pro: Joe Biden has been likened to a "[compassionate conservative](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/opinion/joe-biden-bush.html)." He poses a legitimate challenge to the reactionary conservatism that tries to win by dividing the electorate.
1.11.14.6. Con: It wouldn't be wise to consider the opinion of Trump aides when selecting a Democratic nominee.
1.11.14.6.1. Con: Trump's campaign soundly [beat](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2016/election-results.html) the Democrats in the 2016 Electoral College lending creedence to their perspectives on a candidate's electability.
1.11.15. Con: Biden has been [publicly accused of sexual assault](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/joe-biden-faces-sexual-assault-181441242.html) by a former employee.
1.11.16. Con: Biden is a [corporate-friendly](https://theintercept.com/2019/05/06/joe-biden-pac-coporate-special-interest-money-pledge/) [centrist](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/joe-biden-2020-democrats-choice), which is antithetical to the wishes of voters on the left and right who are attracted to economic populism. This makes Biden a [harder sell](https://prospect.org/article/why-democrats-need-win-economic-populists) across the aisle during the general election, which may lead to a loss of votes.
1.11.16.1. Pro: Economic populism was a [major driver](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) of the Trump win in 2016.
1.11.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.16.3.1.
1.12. [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.tulsi2020.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.12.1. Pro: Gabbard is the most qualified candidate to deal with military and foreign policy issues.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Gabbard is strongly [against the US's costly military efforts to overthrow foreign governments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zesYILUUQdw).
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: More than [86%](https://www.thenation.com/article/new-poll-shows-public-overwhelmingly-opposed-to-endless-us-military-interventions/) of Americans believe military intervention should be used only as a last resort.
1.12.1.2. Pro: Tulsi Gabbard is the strongest voice in the field articulating the problems and unintended consequences of foreign military intervention. This is an immensely important topic for a presidential race, and Gabbard's service record both in the military \([Major with 2 tours in Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard#Military_service_\(2003-present\))\) and in Congress \([Armed Services Committee](https://armedservices.house.gov/)\) make her the most qualified to drive this debate.
1.12.1.2.1. Pro: Gabbard is an [Iraq war veteran](https://gabbard.house.gov/about).
1.12.1.2.1.1. Con: Being a war veteran has [not helped](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/08/amy-mcgrath-randy-bryce-democrats-military-candidates-215471) Democratic politicians get elected.
1.12.1.2.1.2. Pro: Having served in Iraq has helped [shape](http://time.com/collection-post/3501808/veterans-tulsi/) her anti-interventionist world view.
1.12.1.3. Con: Gabbard has some morally-concerning foreign policy views.
1.12.1.3.1. Con: There is currently no verifiable absolute morality nor an [identifiable, unifying standard of morality held by democratic voters.](https://townhall.com/columnists/jonschweppe/2019/01/17/the-democrats-want-to-talk-about-morality-heres-why-they-cant-n2539210)
1.12.1.3.2. Con: Major Gabbard is the only candidate in sight with any moral foundation for her foreign policy views. She has spoken about these views at great length on long-format programs like [Joe Rogan](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/tulsi-gabbard-2) [multiple times](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/tulsi-gabbard). She objects to the high human cost of war in personal terms. This is morality on display.
1.12.1.3.3. Pro: Gabbard has been dubbed an "[Assad apologist](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/assad-apologist-tulsi-gabbard-is-not-the-best-person-to-lecture-on-foreign-policy-morality)" by the media.
1.12.1.3.3.1. Con: When asked about Gabbard’s meeting with Assad, the group dubbed Gabbard [“a passionate advocate for peace and diplomacy, which often requires meeting with people whose actions we do not agree with”.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/tulsi-gabbard-how-a-progressive-rising-star-is-a-paradox-for-the-left)
1.12.1.3.3.2. Con: Being "dubbed" something or other by "the media" is hardly a reason to either support or oppose a candidate. This is literally the "bandwagon fallacy," meaning that because some other people think so, it must be true.
1.12.1.3.3.3. Con: Gabbard brought a politician from the Syrian Democratic Council \(in opposition to Assad\) as a guest to the State of the Union and has been a vocal supporter of Rojava. [She believes](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/rep-gabbard-assad-is-not-an-enemy-of-the-us-1438093891865) meeting with 'adversaries' is important to achieve peace, and does not believe Assad is a good person - she says he used chemical weapons on his own people.
1.12.1.3.3.4. Con: The phrase "Assad apologist" is pure propaganda. Any media who use such a deliberate smear are showing their pro-war bias openly. Opposing US military intervention is not apologizing for anything.
1.12.1.3.3.5. Pro: Gabbard [received criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/26/tulsi-gabbard-bashar-al-assad-syria-democrats) in 2017 for meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad and not informing top Democrats.
1.12.1.3.3.5.1. Pro: This [potentially violated](https://www.lawfareblog.com/legal-analysis-rep-tulsi-gabbards-trip-syria) the [Logan act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act).
1.12.1.3.3.5.2. Con: Her interest in meeting with Assad was an attempt to save hundreds of thousands of civilian lives in a nation that has been destabilized and bombed by the United States, Russia, and others. Dialogue is always preferable to war. To have dialogue is not to be an apologist, ally, or friend. This is nothing but an unfair smear on a candidate who scares the war profiteering establishment. [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/04/world/middleeast/04cnd-pelosi.html) has also met with Assad.
1.12.1.3.3.5.3. Con: Gabbard's meeting with Assad was for a [fact-finding mission](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/26/tulsi-gabbard-bashar-al-assad-syria-democrats) to determine if there was enough evidence to support intervention. This approach should be considered a good thing since [America has a history of intervention based on faulty intelligence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq)
1.12.1.3.3.6. Pro: Gabbard [does not believe](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/20/politics/tulsi-gabbard-syria-paris-keep-assad/) Assad should be removed from power.
1.12.1.3.3.6.1. Con: Gabbard's position is that removing Assad *by US military action* is bad policy. In no way is this apologizing for anything. [Major Gabbard has said clearly and repeatedly that regime-change wars are simply bad policy.](http://\<script type="text/javascript" src="https://video.foxnews.com/v/embed.js?id=6008672150001&w=466&h=263"\>\</script\>\<noscript\>Watch the latest video at \<a href="https://www.foxnews.com"\>foxnews.com\</a\>\</noscript\>)
1.12.1.3.3.6.2. Con: Gabbard does not advocate removing Assad from power due to her long standing belief that [American-backed regime changes are bad in the long run](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/426899-tulsi-gabbard-invokes-military-service-in-ad-going-after-regime-change-wars), as opposed to specifically favoring Assad.
1.12.1.3.4. Pro: Gabbard has indicated an “[understanding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard)” of the use of torture.
1.12.1.3.4.1. Con: Major Gabbard's supposed "support" for torture is a misunderstanding at best, and a dirty smear at worst. Her [clearly stated policy, and her action in Congress](https://www.tulsigabbard.org/tulsi-gabbard-on-regime-change-war) show her strong opposition to torture. She answers [this way directly](https://youtu.be/GBE9J-Tw5xE?t=139) when asked. The single interview question on which this objection is raised concludes with "I'll do what is in my power to keep America safe." This does not contradict her belief that torture is wrong.
1.12.1.3.4.2. Pro: In a 2014 interview, Gabbard [said](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) \(in reference to torture\) that: "I can also understand that any of us, if we were in a situation where our family, our community, our state, or our country is in a place where, let's say, in an hour, a nuclear bomb or an attack will go off unless this information was found, I believe that if I were the president of the United States that I would do everything in my power to keep the American people safe."
1.12.1.3.4.2.1. Con: While a strong refutation of torture would have been a better response in that interview, it can not be concluded that Gabbard's foreign policy is "worrisome" because she once hedged a bit on an interview question about torture. She certainly hasn't made campaign promises to authorize torture.
1.12.1.3.4.3. Con: The American public is [divided](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/americans-divided-in-views-of-use-of-torture-in-u-s-anti-terror-efforts/) on whether torture is permissible in some circumstances. Therefore, Gabbard's views are not entirely out of line with the public.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1. Con: Torture is ineffective and morally reprehensible regardless of the views of the public.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: Torture is [dehumanizing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_1.shtml) to the individual.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: Supporting torture as an American leader [damages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_1.shtml) the US’s moral authority.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: US support of torture can be used as a powerful recruitment tool for enemies of the United States.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Instances of human rights abuses carried out by the US, such as Guantanamo Bay, have [directly](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjZw_Ol5f7fAhVMC-wKHUiKBr0QzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2013%2F04%2Fhow-guantanamo-bays-existence-helps-al-qaeda-recruit-more-terrorists%2F274956%2F&psig=AOvVaw3OmH95nq-6k2GNbpWacjPa&ust=1548157243908714) aided Al-Qaeda recruitment efforts.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.3. Pro: Information gained under duress is unreliable because people will say anything to make the pain stop.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: The Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program [concluded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_CIA_torture) that torturing prisoners did not help acquire actionable intelligence or gain cooperation from detainees and that such programs damaged the United States' international standing.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.4. Con: In [ticking time bomb scenarios](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/torture/ethics/tickingbomb_1.shtml), many people have the intuition that torture is permissible. Gabbard's support for torture seemed to be [limited to such scenarios](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/torture/ethics/tickingbomb_1.shtml).
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.4.1. Con: These scenarios are [extremely unrealistic](https://prospect.org/article/defusing-ticking-time-bomb-excuse), and are most often raised by torture apologists in order to try and justify immoral torture programmes.
1.12.1.3.4.3.1.4.2. Con: In a 2006 worldwide poll, [59%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/torture/ethics/tickingbomb_1.shtml) of people said torture is never permissible.
1.12.1.3.5. Pro: Gabbard has close ties with [nationalist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/tulsi-gabbard-how-a-progressive-rising-star-is-a-paradox-for-the-left) Indian leader Modi.
1.12.1.3.5.1. Pro: [Her support for Modi](https://theintercept.com/2019/01/05/tulsi-gabbard-2020-hindu-nationalist-modi/) legitimizes a leader with a record of enabling anti-Muslim brutality.
1.12.1.3.5.2. Con: Modi is the prime minister of India, the largest democracy in the world. There is good and bad history with the guy, just like there is with any world leader, including US presidents. [Obama was tight with Modi as well.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/world/asia/india-narendra-modi-obama.html)
1.12.2. Pro: Gabbard is popular and will do well in a general election.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Tulsi Gabbard appeals to conservatives, and has appeared on [Fox news](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/dem-2020-candidate-tulsi-gabbard-touts-praise-from-fox-news-host-tucker-carlson/) and won over the audience with her anti-war stance. She could win over independents.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: This is a very important attribute in the current extreme polarization of the political debate. Finding common ground across the aisle is a very rare trait these days. This is splitting the conversation into two separate polar opposites.
1.12.2.1.2. Pro: Gabbard is someone who is against the DNC establishment and also has a record of moderate views on certain issues. This [unique political positioning](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-tulsi-gabbard-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/) could attract some conservative and independent voters.
1.12.2.2. Pro: Tulsi is a veteran, which she often cites in debates. This country [loves its veterans](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/09/666345074/why-its-notable-that-a-slew-of-new-members-elected-to-congress-are-military-vete), as it should.
1.12.2.3. Pro: Gabbard was the [youngest woman](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc226/pdf/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc226-3-5.pdf) to ever be elected to a US state legislature, demonstrating an early start to political success and favourability among voters.
1.12.2.3.1. Con: This also makes her look like a [career politician](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/08/24/collapse_of_the_career_politicians_137882.amp.html) who is out of touch with most people.
1.12.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.12.2.4. Pro: Gabbard has a growing social media presence. She was the [most Googled candidate](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/08/21/gabbard_victimized_by_dncs_dubious_debate_criteria_141055.html) following both debates that she was able to participate in and netted the second most Twitter followers after the second debate.
1.12.2.5. Con: Gabbard [voted 'present'](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/475282-gabbard-defends-present-vote-on-impeachment-voters-should-decide?) for President Trump's impeachment after stating she would vote in its favor. This shows that she may renege on other issues important to the American people.
1.12.3. Con: Tulsi Gabbard has a history of [failing to support](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/tulsi-gabbard-president-sanders-democratic-party) minority and oppressed groups. This history raises concerns about whether she will fight for these types of groups if she were to become president.
1.12.3.1. Con: Tulsi is a [vocal advocate of equality](https://activatenow.us/tulsi-gabbard-a-strong-record-of-fighting-for-lgbt-rights-and-equality/) for the LGBTQ+ community.
1.12.3.2. Con: Gabbard herself is an ethnic minority candidate.
1.12.3.2.1. Pro: Gabbard was the first Samoan American and Hindu member [of the US Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard).
1.12.3.2.2. Pro: Gabbard would be the first major practicing [Hindu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) candidate in the US.
1.12.3.3. Pro: Breaking with most Democrats, Gabbard has embraced the use of the phrase “[radical Islam](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/tulsi-gabbard-how-a-progressive-rising-star-is-a-paradox-for-the-left)” – which many Muslims object to as an indictment of the entire Islamic faith.
1.12.3.3.1. Con: Fundamentalism in all religions should be denounced.
1.12.3.3.2. Con: The linked article clarifies, in the very next sentence, that "Gabbard has said she is mindful that most Muslims are not extremists".
1.12.3.4. Pro: Gabbard has a history of anti-LGBTQIA+ positions. It would be offensive to the LGBT community to nominate someone who had been so vocally involved in fighting against their cause.
1.12.3.4.1. Con: Tulsi [has consistently campaigned for LGBT rights](https://www.votetulsi.com/node/25012) as part of her campaign.
1.12.3.4.2. Con: Gabbard's comments were a result of [parental misguiding](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/17/tulsi-gabbard-apology-lgbt-comments-1109541). Anyone can be indoctrinated into an incorrect set of beliefs from a parental figure. It takes courage to denounce one's parental figures' wrongdoings.
1.12.3.4.2.1. Pro: Someone who changes the views they were born into due to moral reasoning actually deserves more merit than someone who was lucky enough to be born in a household that already holds those moral views. No one chooses the ideas espoused by the family one is born into and it's disingenuous to judge people that way.
1.12.3.4.3. Con: Tulsi [has been endorsed by](https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1256/rating/10918#.XSmaYpNKgb0) the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT lobby organization in the country.
1.12.3.4.4. Pro: Gabbard was a [vocal](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10946849/honolulu_starbulletin/) [opponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard#LGBT_rights) of same sex marriage.
1.12.3.4.4.1. Con: Older Democrats openly and vehemently declared opposition to gay marriage during the same period. Gabbard has come out and fully [apologized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLb3KVBErig) for her stance while these others have not.
1.12.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: As the voting [records](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll316.xml) for the [Defense of Marriage Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/104-1996/s280) show, the majority of democrats including Joe Biden and Harry Reid opposed gay marriage.
1.12.3.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Al Gore said he [supported](https://shadowproof.com/2006/04/23/al-gores-evolution-on-same-sex-marriage/) DOMA at the time.
1.12.3.4.4.1.2. Pro: Hillary Clinton used to [oppose](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) same sex marriage.
1.12.3.4.4.2. Pro: In 2004 she [stated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) that “As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists."
1.12.3.4.5. Pro: Gabbard used to work for her father’s [controversial](https://apple.news/A8KEuAvm1Tiizu5PATRPt_g) anti-gay group, The Alliance for Traditional Marriage.
1.12.3.4.5.1. Con: The key operative phrase here is "used to"; claiming moral purity and casting evolution of thought as irredeemable is not only ignorant but harmful and counterproductive.
1.12.3.4.5.2. Con: Gabbard has [personally apologized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLb3KVBErig) and [publicly apologized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUMiS6e-1qk) for this and in the most recent six years she has a 100% LGBTQ friendly voting record as well as co-sponsoring numerous bills that are beneficial for LGBTQ people.
1.12.3.4.5.2.1. Pro: Tulsi Gabbard co-sponsored [the Equality Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5/text), which protects LGBT people from discrimination.
1.12.3.4.5.2.2. Pro: Tulsi Gabbard co-sponsored the amending [H.R.1244 – Equal Dignity for Married Taxpayers Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1244/text) which makes sure all taxpayer provisions apply to same-sex couples.
1.12.3.4.5.2.3. Pro: Gabbard co-sponsored [HR 197, the Respect for Marriage Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/197/text) that repealed the anti-LGBT rights Defense of Marriage Act \(DOMA\).
1.12.3.4.5.2.4. Pro: Gabbard also co-sponsored [HR 1755, the Employment non-discrimination Act of 2013](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1755), which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.
1.12.3.4.5.3. Pro: The Alliance for traditional marriage [actively](https://apple.news/A8KEuAvm1Tiizu5PATRPt_g) campaigned against pro-gay politicians.
1.12.3.4.5.4. Pro: The Alliance [organized](https://apple.news/A8KEuAvm1Tiizu5PATRPt_g) and spent more than $100,000 to pass an amendment in 1998 that gave the Hawaii state legislature power to "reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples."
1.12.3.4.5.5. Pro: The Alliance for Traditional Marriage [called](http://web.archive.org/web/20010502055000/http:/www.atmv.org:80/news/interview.html) homosexuality "unhealthy, abnormal behavior that should not be promoted or accepted in society."
1.12.3.4.5.6. Pro: The Alliance [vocally](http://web.archive.org/web/20010502055000/http:/www.atmv.org:80/news/interview.html) opposed the representation of gays in the media.
1.12.3.4.5.7. Pro: The Alliance [supported extremely harmful](https://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/01/13/politics/kfile-tulsi-gabbard-lgbt/index.html) gay conversion therapy.
1.12.3.4.6. Con: Gabbard has [apologised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLb3KVBErig) [for her past comments](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/17/politics/tulsi-gabbard-lgbtq-apology-2020-democrat/index.html) on LGBTQ+ issues.
1.12.3.4.6.1. Pro: At a 2012 meeting of Hawai’i Democratic Party LGBT caucus, Tulsi addressed her opposition to same sex marriage in her youth and her complete evolution on this important issue. She [openly and wholeheartedly apologized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJOX4yqqwQE) for her wrongdoing and the harm she had caused the LGBT community, asking for but not expecting their forgiveness.
1.12.3.4.7. Con: Gabbard says her views on LGBTQ issues have ["evolved"](https://www.bustle.com/p/tulsi-gabbard-says-her-lgbtq-views-have-evolved-as-she-prepares-to-run-for-president-15862416), and her recent history as legislator proves this.
1.12.3.4.7.1. Pro: Tulsi Gabbard is a [member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus](https://lgbt-cicilline.house.gov/members) in the House of Representatives.
1.12.3.4.7.2. Pro: Gabbard signed a 2013 [amicus brief](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=f4a6eb02-edf8-4385-9de1-94227d15a57e) supporting Edith Windsor's challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act.
1.12.3.4.7.3. Pro: Gabbard co-sponsored [The Equality Act](https://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/01/13/politics/kfile-tulsi-gabbard-lgbt/index.html), a bill to amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect LGBT individuals.
1.12.3.4.7.4. Pro: Gabbard received a perfect 100 rating for her support for LGBTQ+ Equality during her time in the 115th congress [\(Human Rights Campaign, p. 20\)](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/115thCongressionalScorecard-Report.pdf?_ga=2.218547993.1068580171.1548017661-1961365656.1518249091).
1.12.4. Pro: 2020 is a good time for a woman to run for president, especially a younger one who is not a part of the old establishment.
1.12.4.1. Pro: According to a survey, [69%](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/across-all-parties-ages-and-races-trump-is-less-popular-with-women-than-with-men/) of all voters said they thought the country would be better off with more women in office, up 17 points from last year.
1.12.4.2. Pro: According to a [poll](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/opinion/sunday/feminism-lost-now-what.html), the majority of female voters identify as feminists. Therefore, having a woman as the democratic nominee for President in 2020 may appeal to female voters that identify as feminists.
1.12.4.2.1. Con: This somewhat conflates feminism and sexism. Feminists would not support a candidate just because of their sex. The definition of feminism implies that feminists would support a candidate who advocates for women having equal rights.
1.12.4.2.2. Pro: The poll found that women voters overall identify as feminists. Therefore, a female candidate may help foster bipartisan support at a time when the country is bitterly [divided](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/).
1.12.5. Pro: Gabbard has [received backing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/tulsi-gabbard-how-a-progressive-rising-star-is-a-paradox-for-the-left) from Bernie Sanders.
1.12.5.1. Pro: If Bernie is not successful in his bid to become the nominee and drops out, he might back Gabbard's candidacy and his endorsement would mean a lot for increasing turnout from the left-wing base.
1.12.5.2. Con: Bernie Sanders [is running](https://berniesanders.com/) for President in 2020. As a result, it makes most sense for the most progressive faction of the democratic to support him.
1.12.5.2.1. Con: The more progressive voices in the conversation the better. When voting starts in [February 2020 in Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Iowa_caucuses), then progressives can narrow their support down to the best candidate.
1.12.6. Con: Gabbard has repeatedly [clashed](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html) with establishment Democrats, so the party would be unlikely to unify behind her if she became the nominee.
1.12.7. Con: In 2015, Gabbard was among a minority of Democrats who [voted](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/tulsi-gabbard-how-a-progressive-rising-star-is-a-paradox-for-the-left) for additional restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq.
1.12.7.1. Con: This claim is false. The bill referred to here proposed demanding a check on whether or not the usual vetting process has been taken place.
1.12.7.2. Con: She has [explained her position](https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/open-letter-rep-tulsi-gabbard-regarding-safe-act?fbclid=IwAR3CQTJDMtoXCy2naOSXliqah1gTwSNrJQYZVqM-1frRkW4iPZFKeMNboQQ), and she voted in favor of HR 4038 because the government itself claimed that the problem was the lack of resources to implement a proper system. In addition the refugee ceiling is defined by the Department of State. The reduction in refugees was not due to the bill, but the admission ceiling put in place during the [Trump administration](https://www.facebook.com/CentristsForTulsiGabbard/photos/a.606050879578756/1030720083778498).
1.12.8. Pro: Gabbard has strong environmentalist credentials.
1.12.8.1. Pro: She has been previously [endorsed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/tulsi-gabbard-how-a-progressive-rising-star-is-a-paradox-for-the-left) by the environmentalist group the [Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/home).
1.12.8.2. Pro: Gabbard introduced the[Off Fossil Fuels for A Better Future Act](https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-tulsi-gabbard-s-act-pathway-100-clean-energy-economy-gains-national-momentum) which would replace American use of fossil fuels with clean energy by 2035.
1.12.9. Con: Gabbard repeatedly represents herself and not her constituency. For example, she has [missed the most votes](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/G000571/votes-missed/116) this year, making her the most absent member of Congress.
1.12.10. Pro: Gabbard supports many policies which are popular with young Democrats.
1.12.10.1. Pro: Gabbard [supports](https://www.votetulsi.com/node/32958) Medicare for All.
1.12.10.1.1. Con: 6 other candidates have also [expressed support](https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-candidates-medicare-for-all-7d958bab-de34-4d8c-921d-b561f201c4c2.html) for Medicare for All, so this does not set Gabbard apart.
1.12.10.1.1.1. Con: There are 23 candidates. If there are only 7 who support Medicare for All then this does set a candidate apart.
1.12.10.2. Pro: In 2013 Gabbard and Republican Aaron Schock [established](https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2013/12/schock-gabbard-talk-congressional-future-caucus-180103) the Congressional Future Caucus which brings together members of Congress who are under 40 to seek to address issues for millennials.
1.12.10.3. Pro: Gabbard has supported the restoration of the [Glass-Steagall Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation) which regulates the separation of commercial and investment banking.
1.12.10.4. Pro: Gabbard has been a significant part of the movement for criminal justice reform.
1.12.10.4.1. Pro: Gabbard [supports](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/congresswoman-tulsi-gabbard-talks-marijuana-and-psychedelics-with-joe-rogan/) decriminalising marijuana and co-sponsored the [Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act in 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1227/cosponsors).
1.12.10.4.2. Pro: As a Congresswoman for Hawaii, Gabbard has played a significant role in the [Ho'opono Mamo Civil Citation Intiative](https://gabbard.house.gov/cjreform) which aims to replace juvenile court involvement with community initiatives.
1.12.10.4.3. Pro: Gabbard was a [co-sponsor](https://www.congress.gov/member/tulsi-gabbard/G000571) of the [Formerly Incarcerated Re-enter Society Transformed, Safely Transitioning Every Person Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act) \(the "First Step Act"\) which was passed into law in 2018. The Act provides $75 million per year for 5 years to establish programs to assist prisoner re-integration into society after release.
1.12.10.4.4. Pro: It is important for any Democratic candidate to have a strong record on criminal justice reform as this is one area that both Democratic and Republican voters [agree](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/prison-reform-bill-republicans-democrats.html) needs reform.
1.13. [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.13.1. Con: Warren would be 71 in 2020. This might make it [difficult](https://savejersey.com/2018/05/2020-poll-cory-booker-donald-trump-president/) for her to appeal to an increasingly younger Democratic voter base.
1.13.1.1. Con: At 71, she would still be [younger](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-age/most-democrats-say-age-is-not-just-a-number-for-white-house-candidates-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1S73HJ) than Donald Trump, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders.
1.13.1.1.1. Pro: Bernie Sanders is 78, and [24%](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-would-vote-socialist-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-debt-2019-10) of millennials favoring socialism would vote for him over Elizabeth Warren. Age does not seem to be a contributing factor in this case.
1.13.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.18.7.
1.13.1.3. Con: -> See 1.9.18.8.
1.13.1.4. Con: -> See 1.9.18.7.5.
1.13.1.5. Pro: Only [18%](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-would-vote-socialist-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-debt-2019-10) of millennials who favor socialism say they would vote for Elizabeth Warren.
1.13.2. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has the expertise needed to be a good president.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Elizabeth Warren is considered by far [the wonkiest](https://www.apnews.com/22b9a27cc5be4de49f48e67b700f2379) contender yet. She will know what to do when it comes to crafting policy and making legal decisions.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: It is questionable whether Warren’s wonky nature will be a boon in the primaries or general election, as policy genius does not translate to popularity and votes.
1.13.2.1.1.1. Pro: [People don't vote or act on the specifics of policy proposals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/people-dont-vote-for-want-they-want-they-vote-for-who-they-are/2018/08/30/fb5b7e44-abd7-11e8-8a0c-70b618c98d3c_story.html?utm_term=.4b620410a765); they vote on values and broad statements of direction. Campaigns are about making competing value statements and uniting behind the best-articulated ones. Policies then follow.
1.13.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Warren's policies express her values. She continually links her specific policies to broad principles and statements of direction, flowing from anti-corruption in politics and anti-control-by-the-1%, and encompassing government action that supports everyday people.
1.13.2.1.1.2. Con: Warren's wonky nature -- her deep policy skills -- gives people looking for student debt relief, universal childcare, free public college, affordable housing, opiate crisis intervention, abortion rights protection, public lands protection, and other specific policy benefits, reason to believe she can get them done.
1.13.2.1.1.3. Con: Warren's "she has a plan" image has proven popular so far.
1.13.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Twitter was [flooded](https://mashable.com/article/elizabeth-warren-plan-for-that-rhyme-memes/) with "Warren has a plan for that" rhyming memes.
1.13.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Variations on "she has a plan for that" appear as a signature Warren phrase in [numerous headlines](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22warren+has+a+plan+for+that%22&t=ffab&ia=web).
1.13.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: Various versions of "she has a plan for that" are available on T-shirts from Warren's official merchandise shop and [many other T-shirt sellers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=warren+plan+for+that+merchandise&t=ffab&ia=web).
1.13.2.2. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has been a [tenured law professor at Harvard since 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren). She is one of the all-time most cited legal experts in bankruptcy and commercial law.
1.13.2.3. Pro: Elizabeth Warren [proposed and created an executive branch federal agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau#History) \(the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\), which gives her first-hand insight into the workings of, and presidential authority over, federal agencies.
1.13.2.4. Pro: Elizabeth Warren is skillful and adroit at [attracting and retaining supporters](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-warrens-rise-in-the-polls/) to build a movement for her methods and ideas.
1.13.2.5. Con: Expertise isn't a requirement necessary to be president. More and more people are wising up to the fact that established career politicians are blinded/have narrow thinking and solutions when it comes to how to deal with technology and 21st century problems.
1.13.3. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has a comprehensive, plausible, public, and easily understood [plan for her presidency](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies), starting from Day 1.
1.13.3.1. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has [policies covering the major issues](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies) such as climate change, healthcare, the opioid crisis, and student debt.
1.13.3.1.1. Pro: Warren has [declared her support](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/07/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-single-payer) for Medicare for All.
1.13.3.2. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has [a way to fund her key policies](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies) \(a 2% wealth tax on assets over $50 million\).
1.13.3.2.1. Pro: Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax is projected to bring in [$2.75 trillion in revenue](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/) over a ten-year period.
1.13.3.2.1.1. Con: Many of the wealthy may be able to use [accounting techniques](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/03/15/warrens-2-wealth-tax-would-cause-a-wealth-of-problems-for-the-economy/#15b6e3f83655) to avoid a wealth tax and hence limit the revenue it will create.
1.13.3.2.1.1.1. Con: A high estimate of the amount that households subject to the wealth tax would be able to reduce their reported net worth is 15% [\(Saez and Zucman, p. 2\)](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/saez-zucman-wealthtax-warren.pdf). Therefore the revenue generated by the wealth tax would still be extremely large.
1.13.3.2.1.2. Con: [Some experts doubt](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/facts-on-warrens-wealth-tax-plan/) that this tax will be as effective as this.
1.13.3.2.1.3. Pro: -> See discussion #26938: The US Should Implement a Wealth Tax for the Super Rich
1.13.3.2.1.4. Con: The wealth tax has an [extensive track record](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/02/26/698057356/if-a-wealth-tax-is-such-a-good-idea-why-did-europe-kill-theirs) of being ineffective when applied in other developed nations.
1.13.3.2.2. Con: Critics of Warren's wealth tax proposal claim that the logistics of assessment and collection could make it extremely difficult to implement, and that it might be found to be illegal.\[[1](https://reason.com/2019/02/01/warren-wealth-tax-unconstitutional-2020)\]
1.13.3.2.3. Con: Many billionaires would weigh up their options and look to other countries to immigrate to if it's not worth it for them to stay in the US \(many others in European countries have done the same\).
1.13.3.3. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has a [grassroots strategy for obtaining political support for her policies](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies) \(regardless of who controls Congress\).
1.13.3.3.1. Pro: At her biggest rally to date, 20,000 in NYC, Warren detailed an [inside/outside strategy for accomplishing deep structural change](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/elizabeth-warren-new-york-speech), invoking the legacy of [Frances Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Perkins), a grassroots activist who rose to become Secretary of Labor and a key executor of the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal).
1.13.3.4. Pro: Elizabeth Warren is open [to ending the filibuster,](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/elizabeth-warren-against-the-filibuster) increasing the possibility of passing progressive policies despite Republican obstruction.
1.13.3.5. Con: Detailed policy proposals have not been election-winners, historically. That's just not [how people vote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/people-dont-vote-for-want-they-want-they-vote-for-who-they-are/2018/08/30/fb5b7e44-abd7-11e8-8a0c-70b618c98d3c_story.html?utm_term=.4b620410a765) -- people tend to vote on the basis of values, ideology, or personal circumstances more than specific policy plans.
1.13.4. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has the personal qualities needed to do well in a General Election and become a successful president.
1.13.4.1. Pro: Warren has a strong understanding of the views of the electorate.
1.13.4.1.1. Pro: Warren [supports capitalism](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/elizabeth-warrens-theory-of-capitalism/568573/), rather than seeking to tear it down as Bernie wants. This will help her [win over people who would be alienated by the radical left](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/398580-poll-majority-of-americans-say-the-would-not-vote-for-a).
1.13.4.2. Pro: Warren has a compelling and relatable humble-beginnings life story that illustrates the value of social policies that aid the poor and struggling.
1.13.4.2.1. Pro: [Warren earned her undergrad degree from a $50-a-semester university.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/elizabeth-warren-paid-for-college-with-a-part-time-waitressing-job.html)
1.13.4.2.2. Pro: Warren's mother was able to [save the family home on a minimum wage job](https://www.salon.com/2015/01/09/labor%E2%80%99s_new_crusade_bending_the_arc_of_the_moral_universe_toward_higher_wages/) when her father became too ill to work. \[[Fact check](https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20190111/fact-check-elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-minimum-wage-supported-her-family-in-the-1960s)\]
1.13.4.3. Pro: 2020 is a good time for a woman to be the Democratic nominee for President. Elizabeth Warren is the best woman to take that role.
1.13.4.3.1. Con: Another woman would make a better candidate than Elizabeth Warren.
1.13.4.3.2. Con: Women face more challenges to win an election than men.
1.13.4.3.2.1. Pro: The media does not give as [much coverage](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/55/2/180/1810869) to women as men, and the coverage it does give may lead them to be seen as non-competitive and less worth voting for.
1.13.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: The appearance of a women candidates is discussed by the media [far more](https://theconversation.com/why-you-should-vote-for-a-woman-in-2018-91969) than for male candidates. Such coverage is shown to have damaging effects on a women's candidacy [\(Name it, Change it, p. 7\)](http://www.nameitchangeit.org/page/-/Name-It-Change-It-Appearance-Research.pdf).
1.13.4.3.2.2. Pro: Analysis shows that a proportion of voters [prefer male candidates](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-014-9274-4), even when evidence clearly indicates the female candidate is more qualified.
1.13.4.3.2.3. Con: Just because gender bias and sexism make it harder for a female candidate to win, does not mean that female candidates should be considered less seriously for the nomination. If anything a female candidate winning is necessary to combat these biases and stereotypes.
1.13.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: Seeing a women candidate beat the odds by winning the democratic nomination and then \(potentially\) beat Trump would inspire women in the US to overcome the [obstacles](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/20/tackling-women-s-underrepresentation-in-u.s.-politics-comparative-perspectives-from-europe-pub-75315) to enter politics that they face.
1.13.4.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Keeping the source in the parent claim in mind, it is reasonable to assume that the reason why the EU has more female representation in politics is not due to women beating the odds but because the EU has taken more measures for equality. For example, the EU has introduced gender quotas.
1.13.4.3.2.4. Pro: Research indicates that biases and stereotypes based on gender suggests that America is not ready for a female President.
1.13.4.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.13.4.3.2.3.
1.13.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: [Hostile sexism](http://news.rice.edu/2018/03/20/psychologists-explain-why-america-isnt-ready-for-female-president/) \(a subgroup of ambivalent sexism\) reflects the idea that women are incompetent and inferior to men, and is usually directed toward women who challenge men's power and traditional gender roles. Given that all of the potential female democratic nominees have nontraditional career roles, they will be likely subject to ambivalent sexism, rendering their election to the presidency unlikely.
1.13.4.3.2.4.3. Pro: [Social role theory](http://news.rice.edu/2018/03/20/psychologists-explain-why-america-isnt-ready-for-female-president/) is the principle that men and women behave differently in social situations and take different roles, due to the expectations that society puts upon them. Female candidates that may run for the Presidential election may face a backlash due to displaying agentic \(independent, assertive\) behaviors \(typically associated with males\), serving as a deviation from what is commonly expected of a woman.
1.13.4.3.2.4.4. Pro: [The stereotype content model](http://news.rice.edu/2018/03/20/psychologists-explain-why-america-isnt-ready-for-female-president/) theory suggests that a female candidate running for Presidency will be judged by voters as either lacking warmth or competency. These stereotypes may create a backlash to female candidates.
1.13.4.3.2.4.5. Pro: [System justification theory](http://news.rice.edu/2018/03/20/psychologists-explain-why-america-isnt-ready-for-female-president/) proposes that people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual, that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when it may be disadvantageous to certain people. Having a woman as POTUS is a deviation from the perception that men are more likely than women to be perceived as [leaders](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180809144524.htm), which may serve as a backlash to female candidates.
1.13.4.3.2.5. Pro: Research suggests that Hillary lost the Presidential election to Trump due to ['systemic gender discrimination.'](http://news.rice.edu/2018/03/20/psychologists-explain-why-america-isnt-ready-for-female-president/) Given that gender discrimination exists, chances of Hillary, as a woman, winning the Presidential election are less than likely.
1.13.4.3.3. Pro: It is time for there to be a female president. Since Trump is [\(almost certain to be\)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/will-a-republican-candidate-stand-up-against-trump-in-2020/2018/11/15/3a444f2e-e912-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html?utm_term=.a5c33dfdbca3) the Republican nominee, the only chance of there being a women president in 2020 is if the Democratic nominee is a woman.
1.13.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.3.2.3.1.
1.13.4.3.3.2. Pro: There has never been a female US president.
1.13.4.3.3.2.1. Con: Sex should not be considered an important factor in deciding a president.
1.13.4.3.3.3. Pro: A female president - like female politicians generally - is [more](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/women-actually-do-govern-differently.html) [likely](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15544770903501384) to push for policies that support women, children, social welfare and executive positions.
1.13.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: In 2016, 13 male senators were tasked with creating a healthcare plan that could have the most impact on women, yet [no women were present.](https://blavity.com/its-time-we-give-kamala-harris-more-respect)
1.13.4.3.3.3.2. Con: A female president may not be able to garner enough support to materialize policies that support women in executive positions due to the perception that men are more likely than women to be perceived as [leaders](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180809144524.htm). Given that this perception exists, the [social justification theory](http://news.rice.edu/2018/03/20/psychologists-explain-why-america-isnt-ready-for-female-president/) suggests that advocating for more women in leadership roles may not sit well with voters, who out of defense of the status quo, may reject such a policy.
1.13.4.3.3.4. Con: Globally, female leaders of countries are more ["hawkish"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hawkish) in their use of military force.
1.13.4.3.3.4.1. Pro: Historically, female leaders have been[27% more likely](https://aeon.co/ideas/would-the-world-be-more-peaceful-if-there-were-more-women-leaders) to start wars.
1.13.4.3.3.4.2. Pro: Recent research shows that female leadership of a country is correlated with an increase in conflict behavior and defense spending [\(Koch and Fulton, p. 1\)](http://people.tamu.edu/~mtkoch/Koch%20Fulton%20JoP.pdf).
1.13.4.3.3.5. Pro: Female leaders are better at building consensus and coalitions [\(Eagly and Johnson. p. 233\)](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1010&context=chip_docs). Therefore, having a female president could be beneficial given [how divided](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) US politics currently is.
1.13.4.3.3.5.1. Con: This may be true outside of politics, however there is no evidence to suggest that female politicians are better at making bipartisan compromises than men, according to a [study.](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/10/636258585/electing-more-women-would-change-congress-but-not-make-it-more-bipartisan)
1.13.4.3.3.6. Con: -> See 1.13.4.3.3.2.1.
1.13.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.4.1.
1.13.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.4.2.
1.13.4.4. Pro: Warren has demonstrated she is able to [defend herself effectively](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/elizabeth-warren-john-kelly-impolite-arrogant-woman/index.html) against political attacks.
1.13.4.4.1. Con: Warren has [failed to defend herself](https://www.politico.eu/article/which-us-2020-candidates-won-2018-beto-orourke-amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-joe-biden/) from Trump's constant attacks on her, which are the most significant.
1.13.4.4.1.1. Pro: As Warren took the DNA test after [being goaded](http://fortune.com/2018/07/06/trump-warren-pocahontas-ancestry-test/) by Trump, she was further criticised for "[taking Trump's bait](https://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/milbank-warren-took-trumps-bait-led-into-culture-war-trap/)".
1.13.4.4.1.1.1. Con: The list of people who have been goaded and vigorously queried by Trump is so long, Warren's DNA kerfuffle is almost surely now lost in the noise. [For](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html) [example](https://www.axios.com/a-list-of-trumps-attacks-on-prominent-women-1513303964-8ef61562-4dcc-4cf0-aea6-0ec89457fbc1.html).
1.13.4.5. Pro: On the campaign trail, Warren has demonstrated her [charisma](https://gen.medium.com/the-media-gaslighting-of-2020s-most-likable-candidate-4c42baab641e), [humour](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elizabeth-warren-gay-marriage-cnn-lgbt-town-hall-democrats-2020-a9151626.html), and rhetorical abilities.
1.13.5. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has been supportive of progressive policy ideas.
1.13.5.1. Pro: Warren's stances of [anti-corruption](http://time.com/5399147/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-ethics/) and [large corporation reform](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/15/elizabeth-warren-accountable-capitalism-act-richest-companies) are a good fit for the Democrat party which is [moving further left](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/opinion/democrat-electorate-left-turn.html).
1.13.5.1.1. Pro: Since 2013, Elizabeth Warren is [one of the few](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/27/pacs-democrats-campaign-finance-reform-pacs-big-money/) senators who has gotten the [majority](https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-campaign-donors-are-gift-that-keeps-giving-1542556800) of their campaign funding from small individual contributors \(\<$200 at a time\).
1.13.5.1.2. Pro: In 2018, Warren introduced the [Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3357) which introduces measures to limit corruption broadly but also has specific policies that appear aimed to expose weaknesses in Trump's personal practices.
1.13.5.1.2.1. Pro: The Anti-Corruption Act [would](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17760916/elizabeth-warren-anti-corruption-act-bill-lobbying-ban-president-trump) place a lifetime ban on lobbying from former Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Cabinet Secretaries, members of Congress and federal judges.
1.13.5.1.2.2. Pro: The Anti-Corruption Act would [require](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/elizabeth-warren-owns-two-policy-issues-in-the-2020-presidential-race.html) that all Presidents place certain personal assets into blind trusts. In addition all presidential candidates would be required to release 8 years of tax returns as part of the election process.
1.13.5.1.3. Pro: In 2018, Warren introduced the [Accountable Capitalism Act](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-shouldnt-be-accountable-only-to-shareholders-1534287687). The Act would require large corporations to grant employees seats on their Board of Directors.
1.13.5.1.4. Pro: In 2007, Warren proposed the idea of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau) to protect consumers from risky practices of financial institutions. The Agency was formed in 2010 under Warren's leadership.
1.13.5.1.4.1. Pro: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is [responsible](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/elizabeth-warren-economic-policy-democrats.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FConsumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau) for consumer protection in relation to the financial industry including banks, credit unions, securities firms and debt collectors. In the wake of the financial crisis the Bureau administers various laws and restrictions to limit risk taking in the financial sector.
1.13.5.1.5. Pro: Warren even [opposed](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/elizabeth-warren-antonio-weiss-treasury-undersecretary-112889) an Obama treasury nominee due to his Wall Street background.
1.13.5.2. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has a history of campaigning for women's rights.
1.13.5.2.1. Pro: Warren lent her name to a joint resolution effort to pass the [Equal Rights Amendment](https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/in-advance-of-mothers-day-cardin-and-menendez-put-forward-two-track-approach-to-ratification-of-an-equal-rights-amendment-for-all-women), which would have ensured that sex and gender are acknowledged and equally protected in the U.S. Constitution.
1.13.5.2.2. Pro: Warren has been outspoken in her defense of [Planned Parenthood.](https://www.texastribune.org/2015/09/13/austin-warren-eggs-cruz-over-planned-parenthood-fi/)
1.13.5.2.3. Pro: Elizabeth Warren is [pro-choice](https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/elizabeth-warren/stances/social/abortion) regarding the matter of abortion.
1.13.5.2.3.1. Pro: Warren spoke out against a proposed ban that would [restrict abortions](https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/news/elizabeth-warren-passionately-defends-womens-abortion-rights/vi-AAeCbq7) performed at 20 weeks
1.13.5.2.3.2. Pro: Warren has been vocal in confronting Conservative Brett Kavanaugh on the issue of [abortion](https://www.lifenews.com/2018/07/24/pro-abortion-sen-elizabeth-warren-quotes-bible-to-slam-brett-kavanaugh-were-on-the-moral-side/). This demonstrates that she is not afraid of debating prominent Conservatives on controversial issues, rendering her as an ideal candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
1.13.5.2.3.3. Pro: Warren's creative use of the [Bible](https://www.lifenews.com/2018/07/24/pro-abortion-sen-elizabeth-warren-quotes-bible-to-slam-brett-kavanaugh-were-on-the-moral-side/) to advocate for her pro-choice stance on abortion could potentially convert many religious conservatives to adopt a progressive view regarding this matter, and win over voters from the right wing of the political spectrum.
1.13.5.2.3.4. Pro: Warren supports [public abortion funding](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm).
1.13.5.2.3.5. Pro: Warren supports access to safe, legal abortions [without restrictions](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm).
1.13.5.2.3.6. Pro: Warren supports churches providing [birth control.](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm)
1.13.5.3. Pro: Warren helped introduce a [bill](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-delauro-murray-scott-murphy-introduce-schedules-that-work-act-to-end-unstable-scheduling-practices) that would seek to provide stability for low-income workers who currently have jobs where their hours can be cut or added to at a moment's notice.
1.13.5.3.1. Con: Warren is stuck focusing on addressing symptoms of the underlying issues while candidates like [Andrew Yang](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/) seek to get ahead of the core issue of job loss due to automation and shifting economic models.
1.13.6. Pro: Elizabeth Warren's [rapidly rising rally numbers](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/elizabeth-warrens-massive-crowd-size-seattle-only-getting-bigger) and [the-people-vs-the-corrupt-elite message](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/dont-underestimate-elizabeth-warren-and-her-populist-message) position her as a potential populist challenger to Donald Trump.
1.13.6.1. Pro: Warren's [anti-corruption message](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49642461) -- "Corruption in Washington has allowed the rich and the powerful to tilt the rules and grow richer and more powerful ... We have the power to fix that," -- is central to her campaign.
1.13.6.2. Pro: Warren's [rapidly rising rally attendance](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/elizabeth-warrens-massive-crowd-size-seattle-only-getting-bigger) -- 12,000 in Minnesota, 15,000 in Seattle, [20,000 in New York](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/17/elizabeth-warren-new-york-city-rally/2350032001/) -- now rivals Trump's.
1.13.6.3. Con: So far, Warren's rapidly rising popularity is [largely among Democrats](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/28/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-popularity/index.html) -- whether her populist message can cross over to swing voters who voted for Trump, is debatable.
1.13.6.4. Pro: A candidate who is a strong economic populist [may be required](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/386775-a-winning-strategy-for-democrats-in-2020-populism-not-trump-bashing) to [beat Trump](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-09/democrats-strategy-race-warren-biden-populism-pocketbook-issues), by directly challenging his own populist message of representing the American worker against the elites.
1.13.7. Con: Warren's "DNA test announcement" was [received negatively](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/16/17983250/elizabeth-warren-dna-test-cherokee-nation-trump) by the media.
1.13.7.1. Con: This is the only major "scandal" Warren has experienced in her career. In the discussion of electoral performance, her relatively unscathed reputation will make her more likeable and turn fewer voters away.
1.13.7.2. Pro: Although out of the headlines now, the DNA episode could come back to hurt Warren if Trump or his campaign revive it -- the impact that may have is not easy to estimate.
1.13.7.2.1. Pro: Warren seems to have satisfied progressives and be on her way to fully making amends with Native Americans, but [swing voters could still be persuaded that the DNA episode indicates her dishonesty and opportunism](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/27/pocahontas-elizabeth-warrens-biggest-vulnerability-227912).
1.13.7.2.2. Con: Should the DNA issue be revived, it would remain tied to Trump's original, widely-covered attacks, "Pocahontas" name-calling, and million-dollar DNA test challenge, coloring it as yet another Trump-initiated, partisan issue, thus, easier for anti-Trump voters to dismiss.
1.13.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.4.1.1.
1.13.7.4. Con: -> See 1.13.7.2.2.
1.13.7.5. Pro: This foreshadows what future interactions with Trump will be like if she's the nominee. She will be baited into publicly embarrassing herself by Trump's mudslinging.
1.13.7.6. Con: This is a sideshow issue which doesn’t interfere with her core messaging.
1.13.7.6.1. Con: This issue does interfere with her messaging because it shows that Trump controls the narrative with her, and that would make her a weak general election candidate.
1.13.8. Con: Elizabeth Warren's sweeping progressive policies and unequivocal populist message are too extreme for centrist voters.
1.13.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.6.3.
1.13.8.2. Pro: [One media narrative](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/12/18220482/elizabeth-warren-wall-street-trump-big-banks) holds that [Wall Street fears and hates Warren's policies, and Democrats there may back Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/wall-street-democratic-donors-may-back-trump-if-warren-is-nominated.html) in order to avoid them.
1.13.8.3. Pro: Some of Warren's policies are too expensive \(like the over [$20 trillion Medicare-For-All](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775339519/heres-how-warren-finds-20-5-trillion-to-pay-for-medicare-for-all) plan\), when the US really should be decreasing its [national debt](https://usdebtclock.org/) \(as the Medicare-For-All plan could double it\).
1.13.9. Con: Elizabeth Warren, despite [claiming to](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/buzzfeedpolitics/elizabeth-warren-says-shes-not-in-the-1) relate to the masses, doesn't seem to actually do so.
1.13.9.1. Pro: Elizabeth Warren has built her grassroots credibility on financing her campaign exclusively from small-dollar donations, yet [she kickstarted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html?module=inline) her run with millions of dollars raised from the type of big-dollar fundraising she is now vocally opposing.
1.13.9.1.1. Con: It's not unusual to kickstart campaigns with existing funds.[Elizabeth Warren and six other Democratic candidates, including Bernie Sanders, transferred leftover funds, ranging from one to $10 million, from previous federal races, and one candidate began with a self-contributed $16 million.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/campaign-finance-2020-fundraising.html)
1.13.9.2. Pro: She's difficult to reach for the average person, as none of the [reasons](https://elizabethwarren.com/contact-us) to contact her are for talking to her about personal concerns. So her viewpoints will be isolated from theirs, even though she tries to appear like she relates to them.
1.13.9.3. Pro: A person who amassed [$18 million net worth](https://thenetworthportal.com/wiki-2018-2019-2020-2021/politician/elizabeth-warren-net-worth/) would not relate to the [average $50,000 salary individual](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/average-salary-information-for-us-workers-2060808).
1.13.9.3.1. Pro: Just because Warren had humble beginnings doesn't always mean she'll be relatable now, as she's no longer in that position in 2019. Since she doesn't have the same living conditions as a $50,000 income individual as 2019, she can't relate/understand completely to their current conditions/needs.
1.13.10. Con: Her proposed wealth tax had many implementation issues when attempted in [Europe](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/02/26/698057356/if-a-wealth-tax-is-such-a-good-idea-why-did-europe-kill-theirs).
1.13.11. Con: Many progressive voters do not trust Warren because of her unwillingness to back anyone in the 2016 primaries.[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/elizabeth-warren-not-progressive)
1.13.12. Pro: Elizabeth Warren is popular with the American public. Therefore she is likely to be competitive in the general election.
1.13.12.1. Pro: Early polling suggests that the American people would slightly [prefer](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/trump-2020-democrats-matchup-790890) to elect Elizabeth Warren as president \(34%\) rather than reelect Trump \(30%\).
1.13.12.1.1. Con: The poll's margin of error is 2 percentage points, which means a 32%-32% tie between Warren and Trump is not outside of statistical significance.
1.13.12.2. Pro: Warren "[cruised to reelection](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/6/elizabeth-warren-defeats-geoff-diehl-to-easily-win/)" for the 2018 Massachusetts Senator seat, which she has held since 2013.
1.13.12.2.1. Con: Massachusetts is [not the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Massachusetts) [political environment](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2014/07/31/massachusetts-even-more-liberal-than-you-thought/HCk5j2MZ7b64zmi3SZiKzH/story.html) as the United States at large.
1.13.12.3. Con: In September 2018, [a Massachusetts poll](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/20/elizabeth-warren-for-president-new-survey-shows-mass-voters-don-love-that-idea/eRMzdOVBxe2Bc0Jxk1v9nK/story.html) showed that the majority of Warren's own constituents do not want her to run.
1.13.12.3.1. Con: If Elizabeth Warren is the best candidate to be Democratic nominee, then she should be even if this is against the wishes of those she currently represents as a senator.
1.13.12.4. Pro: National polling averages show that [15%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/democratic-polls.html) of the public see Warren as their preferred option for the Democratic nominee \(tied with Sanders\). Biden is the only candidate with more support than this.
1.13.12.4.1. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.1.
1.13.12.5. Con: Despite Massachusetts being a blue state Elizabeth Warren [only won by 24 points](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/elizabeth-warren-and-democrats-2020-electability-dilemma.html), which suggests her popularity is below-par.
1.13.12.6. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.
1.13.13. Pro: Elizabeth Warren's foreign policy views make her an ideal candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
1.13.13.1. Pro: Warren has linked the issue of foreign policy to the domestic issue of [income inequality](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/19/677826517/democrats-move-to-beef-up-foreign-policy-credentials-ahead-of-2020-runs). Her recognition that both should be given equal value offers a refreshing approach to this matter which will potentially strengthen working class families, thereby strengthening America's position in the world globally.
1.13.13.2. Pro: Warren called for a full [withdrawal](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/19/677826517/democrats-move-to-beef-up-foreign-policy-credentials-ahead-of-2020-runs) of American troops from Afghanistan, a policy of never using nuclear weapons first, and slashing the military's budget. Such measures if acted upon will strengthen the national security of the country.
1.13.13.2.1. Pro: A [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/10/08/most-americans-would-support-withdrawal-afghanista) survey found that the majority of Americans would support drawing US involvement to a close and bringing the troops back home.
1.13.13.3. Con: Warren's call for a full withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan has huge consequences for both America and the Middle East.
1.13.13.3.1. Pro: The full withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan will contribute to the perception that American power and influence are on the [decline](http://www.mepc.org/commentary/implications-america-withdrawing-iraq-and-afghanistan) in the greater Middle East. This perception will mean that countries across the globe will view America less willing to intervene militarily, which means that those countries who are at risk of military threats from their adversaries will no longer be able to look to America for help and protection.
1.13.13.3.1.1. Pro: This perception may serve to convince America's adversaries to drive the US out of other countries where terrorist groups reside. This means that America’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan may embolden other countries to increase their [involvement](http://www.mepc.org/commentary/implications-america-withdrawing-iraq-and-afghanistan) in them which could further contribute to the destabilization of the Middle East.
1.13.13.3.2. Pro: US withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan will do nothing to ease the region’s many [other problems](http://www.mepc.org/commentary/implications-america-withdrawing-iraq-and-afghanistan) which includes the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, Indo-Pakistani hostility, or the rise of Islamic radicalism in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia. At the very least, the presence of American troops in the region will offer some semblance of security and stability, as opposed to none at all if the US withdraws all of their troops.
1.13.13.3.3. Con: The full withdrawal of US troops will contribute to decreasing the effects of ['blowback](https://ips-dc.org/blowback_from_iraq_war_is_global_and_growing/)', thereby strengthening the national security of countries worldwide.
1.13.13.3.4. Con: -> See discussion #10098: US and NATO should completely withdraw from all combat and peacekeeping roles in Afghanistan.
1.13.13.3.5. Con: Withdrawing American soldiers from Afghanistan will prevent any more American military deaths in the region.
1.13.13.3.5.1. Pro: Three US military members were [killed in November 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/politics/afghanistan-service-members-us/index.html) in Afghanistan by the detonation of an explosive device.
1.13.13.3.6. Con: Despite there being an American military presence in Afghanistan for 17 years, the war is currently at a ["stalemate"](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/politics/us-afghan-war-stalemate/index.html). Endlessly staying in Afghanistan is unlikely to lead to the defeat of the Taliban.
1.13.13.4. Pro: Warren's less interventionist foreign policy views means she supports decreasing the size of America's ["bloated defense budget"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html). This budget is [enormous](https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison) and money saved by being in fewer wars could be spent at home to improve the country.
1.13.13.4.1. Con: Warren's calls for shrinking the military budget seem disingenuous given her legislative record.
1.13.13.4.1.1. Pro: In 2017, Warren voted for [a defense budget increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2019) that was [even greater](http://www.leftvoice.org/Elizabeth-Warren-Votes-for-Massive-Increase-of-War-Budget) than the one requested by Republican President Donald Trump.
1.13.13.4.1.1.1. Con: According to one of Warren's staffers, her vote for this bill may have been [more complex](https://www.airforcetimes.com/congress/2018/10/05/on-the-campaign-trail-defense-spending-fights-and-confusion/) than it seemed. This is because the military increase was also packaged with other non-defense funding.
1.13.13.5. Con: Warren's anti-interventionist rhetoric is not backed up by her legislative record.
1.13.13.5.1. Con: In 2018, Warren [voted against](https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/141272/elizabeth-warren/?p=2) a defense budget increase, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.
1.13.13.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.13.4.1.1.
1.13.13.5.3. Pro: Warren voted in favour of giving [$225 million in funding](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/clinton-s-surprising-israel-hawk-elizabeth-warren-1.5402609) to Israel to fund an [anti-rocket defense system](https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-gaza-irondome-usa-idUSL2N0Q800M20140802).
1.13.13.5.4. Pro: Warren "[defies categorization as a hawk or dove](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/07/04/elizabeth-warren-finding-her-voice-foreign-policy-and-she-slamming-trump-approach/FiNiLh90P4cmXpU36bWBrN/story.html)", but her mentors include individuals who support strengthening the military.
1.14. [Michael Bloomberg](https://www.mikebloomberg.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.14.1. Pro: Bloomberg, who is[one of the 10 richest people in the world, worth around $50 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World's_Billionaires#2019), and is [self-financing his run](https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-will-refuse-presidential-salary-campaign-donations-2019-11), will have a virtually unlimited campaign funding.
1.14.1.1. Pro: This prevents worries about having to fulfill promises to donors and to pay then back somehow after getting elected. This will allow more money to go directly to what the president wants.
1.14.1.1.1. Pro: Candidates often have to fulfill donors' wishes when elected by giving them expensive [governmental positions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/10/obama-donors-top-embassy-jobs-rewards) or [projects](https://dailycaller.com/2011/09/01/bankrupt-solar-company-with-fed-backing-has-cozy-ties-to-obama-admin/), of which are both expensive and costly to taxpayers, which just takes away from making a difference with tackling the issues that the president wants to \(like making the promises less credible\).
1.14.1.1.2. Con: Bloomberg's wealth comes from international investments, which he might not [divest from](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/483526-bloomberg-campaign-adviser-candidate-will-release-tax-returns-and-sell) or make public \(in the form of [tax returns](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/01/bloomberg-intends-to-release-his-tax-returns-upping-the-pressure-on-trump/)\) until/if he gets the nomination.
1.14.1.2. Pro: This prevents him from risking taking money from those with other agendas that will sway away from what the president is trying to do.
1.14.1.3. Con: This institutes a dangerous precedent in which the presidency goes to whoever has the larger checkbook.
1.14.2. Con: Bloomberg has switched parties several times, endorsed Elizabeth Warren's incumbent Republican opponent in her 2012 Senate run, donated to over a dozen current and former Republican Congress members, endorsed George W. Bush in 2004, and held a fundraiser for a House Republican as recently as last year, [all of which and more](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/26/bloomberg-republican-endorsement-2020-073807) put his Democratic credentials in question.
1.14.3. Pro: With his centrist positioning, and an established record as a highly successful businessman, and an effective three-term mayor of New York City, Bloomberg may have the credentials needed to attract independent and moderate Republican voters in sufficient numbers to beat Trump.
1.14.4. Con: Bloomberg had stated early in 2019 that legalizing marijuana is "perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done", only to step in line with the rest of the candidates who support strong legalization policies. It shows where his interests are and [how he'll use any issue to get him elected.](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/michael-bloomberg-backs-decriminalization-as-marijuana-views-evolve-amid-presidential-run/)
1.14.5. Con: He runs the media with [Bloomberg L.P.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.), and could possibly use it a negative manner to distort the truth, making himself look good, much more easily than presidents in the past.
1.14.5.1. Con: There are many other news media agencies that can counteract this if it happens.
1.14.5.2. Pro: It will be harder to call him out for distorting the news since he doesn't have to put in the effort to convince the media to present their way and risk getting caught in the process.
1.14.6. Pro: He has a [track record](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-bloomberg-to-put-500m-into-closing-all-remaining-coal-plants-by-2030/) of shutting down coal plants and the capability \(i.e. enough money and political power\) to fund shutting down more until they're all gone.
1.14.7. Pro: Michael Bloomberg has done well and a lot in [improving NYC](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/books/review/the-many-lives-of-michael-bloomberg-eleanor-randolph.html), so he has a good chance of doing well for the entire US if he continues his efforts.
1.14.7.1. Con: Bloomberg's policy of [stop-and-frisk](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/nyregion/scott-stringer-manhattan-leader-criticizes-stop-and-frisk.html) while mayor of New York will alienate black voters. The policy resulted in police disproportionately targeting black and Hispanic people.
1.14.7.1.1. Pro: The [NYPD was found liable](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-practice-violated-rights-judge-rules.html) for racial profiling and unconstitutional stops by a federal judge in August 2013.
1.14.8. Pro: Bloomberg is like Trump in that he is business-minded while also running on a [democratic platform](https://www.mikebloomberg.com/getting-it-done). It's this combination that makes him appeal to both voting groups \(Democrats and Republicans\).
1.14.9. Con: -> See 1.14.7.1.
1.14.10. Con: Bloomberg increasingly faces [sexual harassment](https://www.axios.com/2020-democratic-debate-bloomberg-warren-non-disclosure-sexual-harassment-633e1aad-ca84-472b-831c-bcdfb5b804d8.html) accusations.
1.15. [Deval Patrick](https://devalpatrick2020.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.16. [Kamala Harris](https://kamalaharris.org/) \(dropped out\).
1.16.1. Pro: Early polling suggests that the American people would rather [elect Harris as President \(49%\)](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2627) than reelect Trump \(41%\).
1.16.1.1. Con: According to Politico the American people favored Clinton \(45%\) over Trump \(42%\) during poling. \([1](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/politico-morning-consult-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-230818)\)
1.16.1.2. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.
1.16.2. Con: Harris is a [registered gun owner](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/12/kamala-harris-gun-ownership-gun-control-presidential-campaign/). The position of owning a handgun for safety is one that is [held by the NRA, and should not be held by a progressive Democrat.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/26/kamala-harris-owns-handgun-unacceptable-2020-democratic-race-column/3567371002/)
1.16.2.1. Con: Being a registered gun owner does not mean Harris agrees with the NRA on the issues. The NRA has given Kamala Harris a [7% rating](https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1034/rating/7165#.XQeneVVKiUk) which reflects that her voting record and stances do not align with the NRA.
1.16.3. Pro: Kamala has embraced a high-profile role in confronting the Trump administration, making her an ideal candidate for the nomination.
1.16.3.1. Pro: Kamala was [the first lawmaker](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-family-separation-kamala-harris-dhs-secretary/index.html) to call for the resignation of the Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, as a result of immigration policy that has resulted in family separations at the US border.
1.16.3.2. Pro: Kamala has not shyed away from questioning senior Cabinet officials in [public hearings](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-kamala-harris-20180731-story.html%3foutputType=amp), demonstrating her willingness to confront the Trump administration.
1.16.3.2.1. Pro: Kamala questioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, on the [economic fallout](http://www.cbs8.com/story/39625257/kamala-harris-questions-cbp-commissioner-about-november-border-closure) of the six-hour closure of the San Ysidro Port of Entry during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C.
1.16.3.2.2. Pro: Kamala questioned Judge Brett Kavanaugh regarding the Mueller investigation into [Russia election meddling.](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article217931685.html)
1.16.3.2.3. Pro: Kamala pressed Jeff Sessions into saying he was [“nervous”](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/573967/) about Russia’s contacts with the Trump campaign.
1.16.4. Pro: Kamala Harris stated in an interview that she will no longer accept donations from corporate PACs. This indicates that she is willing to put the interests of US citizens above corporate interests.
1.16.4.1. Pro: Her decision was based on the idea of trying to keep money out of politics in order to ensure that everyone has an [equal vote](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/thehill.com/homenews/campaign/384408-kamala-harris-will-no-longer-accept-corporate-pac-money%3famp). Therefore, her progressive liberal attitude renders her as an appealing candidate for the 2020 Presidential bid.
1.16.4.2. Con: Only [4.89%](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/27/pacs-democrats-campaign-finance-reform-pacs-big-money/) of Harris’s campaign fundraising has been through PACs. Yet, 64.99% of her campaign funding has come from [large donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00036915) \(those over $200\), which often come from corporate executives and lobbyists.
1.16.4.3. Con: Publicly stating that one is rejecting corporate PAC money is largely a "[cheap gesture](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/27/pacs-democrats-campaign-finance-reform-pacs-big-money/)".
1.16.4.3.1. Pro: Corporate PAC money makes up only a [small portion](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/27/pacs-democrats-campaign-finance-reform-pacs-big-money/) of campaign contributions. The bigger threat of corrupting influence comes from direct large-dollar donations from wealthy individuals.
1.16.4.3.2. Pro: Corporations have [funnelled money](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/27/pacs-democrats-campaign-finance-reform-pacs-big-money/) to candidates through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Therefore, for a public rejection of corporate PAC money to be meaningful, senators also have to disavow being backed by this type of money from this committee.
1.16.4.3.3. Pro: A meaningful gesture that one is free from corrupting influences would be to reject any [large donations](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/27/pacs-democrats-campaign-finance-reform-pacs-big-money/) over a certain amount \(e.g. $500, $750\) and have to rely on small dollar donations from regular Americans.
1.16.5. Pro: Kamala Harris has demonstrated a commitment to upholding online privacy, which according to a study is a major [concern](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-survey-details-the-state-of-online-privacy-and-social-media-in-america-amidst-gdpr-300653296.html) for US citizens.
1.16.5.1. Pro: Kamala worked out [voluntary guidelines](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/amp/Kamala-Harris-push-for-online-privacy-4190914.php) with seven of the biggest online services including Facebook, Google and Apple that would oblige app makers and services to disclose privacy policies more plainly.
1.16.5.2. Pro: Kamala sued [Delta Airlines](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/amp/Kamala-Harris-push-for-online-privacy-4190914.php), for allegedly collecting names, phone numbers and other personal data without fully informing online users through an up-front privacy disclosure.
1.16.5.3. Pro: Kamala put forward a [22-page list](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/amp/Kamala-Harris-push-for-online-privacy-4190914.php) of guidelines for app developers, networks, mobile carriers and others aimed at minimizing privacy conflicts and moving the mobile world away from sweeping up every shred of personal data.
1.16.6. Pro: Kamala Harris has the political experience necessary to warrant a Democratic nomination for the Presidency in 2020.
1.16.6.1. Pro: Kamala served as the [District Attorney](https://blavity.com/its-time-we-give-kamala-harris-more-respect) of the city and county of San Francisco.
1.16.6.1.1. Con: Kamala Harris' record as Attorney General of California is [worrying for progressives](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html).
1.16.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.16.5.2.
1.16.6.1.1.2. Pro: Kamala Harris has a ["controversial record"](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record) on criminal justice.
1.16.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Harris [opposed DNA testing that would have proven a man innocent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/opinion/sunday/death-penalty.html), a policy she says she now regrets.
1.16.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.4.4.
1.16.6.1.1.2.3. Pro: Younger minority citizens will never support this cop. [Here's one of many popular youtubers](https://youtu.be/kRVizGY0Rkc?t=178) calling out Harris for [laughing](https://twitter.com/WalkerBragman/status/1089831581030797312) about [locking up parents of truant kids](https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Truancy-costs-us-all-3213456.php).
1.16.6.1.1.2.4. Con: Harris implemented racial [anti-bias training](https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/04/17/california-kamala-harris-announces-police-anti-bias-training-program/) for police officers in California.
1.16.6.1.1.2.5. Con: Harris introduced [prison diversion programs](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to try and reduce recidivism.
1.16.6.1.1.2.6. Pro: Harris opposed the release of a man who had been proven innocent on the basis of a [legal technicality](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Daniel-Larsen-Murder-Conviction-Overturned-Innocence-Project-198996291.html).
1.16.6.1.1.2.7. Pro: Harris [fought a ruling](https://reason.com/blog/2018/01/12/kamala-harris-is-not-smart-on-crime) ordering California to release some of its prisoners even though the Supreme Court decided that California's [overcrowded prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24scotus.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=DB0B7BC6BCB7C11F259AF407BC5F55B6&gwt=pay) represented cruel and unusual punishment.
1.16.6.1.1.2.8. Pro: Harris [did not endorse](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/kamala-harris-trump-obama-california-attorney-general) two ballot initiatives \(in 2012 and 2014\) that gave judges more discretion in sentencing and retroactively scaled back punishment for certain low-level crimes.
1.16.6.1.1.2.9. Pro: Harris [fought](https://ocweekly.com/attorney-general-kamala-harris-to-fight-orange-county-federal-judges-death-penalty-ruling-6463617/) the 2014 ruling by a federal judge that California's application of the death penalty was unconstitutional.
1.16.6.1.1.2.10. Pro: Harris [urged](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/kamala-harris-trump-obama-california-attorney-general) California voters to reject [Proposition 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_California_Proposition_66), a ballot initiative that reformed California's harsh ["three-strikes law"](https://www.thenation.com/article/reforming-three-strikes/) that imposed life sentences for a third “strike” that was any minor felony.
1.16.6.1.1.2.11. Pro: Harris [opposed](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article22451643.html) requiring police officers state-wide to wear body cameras.
1.16.6.1.1.3. Pro: Kamala Harris has a [mixed record](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html) when it comes to her prosecuting the financial industry.
1.16.6.1.1.3.1. Con: Harris aggressively pursued the country's biggest mortgage firms during the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis) and her ["hardball tactics"](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-senate-harris-banks-20161016-snap-story.html) lead to a settlement which brought $20 billion in financial relief to California homeowners.
1.16.6.1.1.3.2. Pro: Despite the California Department of Justice finding that OneWest Bank participated in ["widespread misconduct"](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/steven-mnuchin-onewest-memo) when foreclosing on homes, Harris [refused](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/312742-senate-democrat-defends-decision-not-to-charge-trump-treasury-pick-over) to file a civil enforcement action against the bank.
1.16.6.2. Pro: Kamala has previously served as the [Attorney General](https://blavity.com/its-time-we-give-kamala-harris-more-respect) of the state of California.
1.16.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.16.6.1.1.
1.16.6.3. Pro: Kamala was elected as the [Junior Senator](https://blavity.com/its-time-we-give-kamala-harris-more-respect) of the state of California in 2017.
1.16.7. Pro: Kamala Harris will empower minority voices in the country.
1.16.7.1. Pro: Kamala Harris has emerged as a voice for immigrant advocates in the Senate.
1.16.7.1.1. Pro: Kamala has used her platform in the Democratic Party to keep young immigrants’ plight in the public eye – and pushed her party to take a hard line in the negotiations to give them [permanent legal status.](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article194282134.html)
1.16.7.1.2. Pro: Her stance on immigration has earned Kamala support from[activists and advocates](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article194282134.html) for equal treatment of immigrants, increasing her chances for the Democratic nomination.
1.16.7.2. Pro: Kamala Harris has the ability to increase African American voter turnout in the [same way Obama did](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/?utm_term=.cb1fdeceb477).
1.16.7.2.1. Con: There is ["little evidence"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/african-american-turnout-and-african-american-candidates/FF6959684A37B496F4B02595B482D9BF) that African American voter turnout increased by the fact that a candidate is African American.
1.16.7.2.2. Pro: In a context where some African Americans may see Trump as a ["threat to minority progress"](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/403977-theres-a-boost-in-black-turnout-especially-among-black-women-voters), Kamala Harris is a figure who African American voters could rally around.
1.16.7.3. Pro: Kamala Harris has long supported LGBT rights. She [voted for same sex marriage in 2000, and later created a anti-hatecrime group to fight against "trans panic" defense.](https://web.archive.org/web/20101125112342/http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality)
1.16.7.4. Con: -> See 1.16.6.1.1.2.3.
1.16.8. Con: Harris' commitment to a [prosecutorial approach](https://twitter.com/kamalaharris/status/1137831661557768192?lang=en) to combatting Trump would probably backfire in the general election. Such a strategy is unlikely to be effective against Trump.
1.16.8.1. Pro: The sitting president's rise to power was [fueled](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-2016-convention-melania-trump-speech-dark-art-of-pr-214083) primarily by his skill at leveraging bad publicity in his favor, and his bold willingness to "fight dirty" and forcefully confront those who attack him, which his base considers to be an asset.
1.16.8.1.1. Pro: Despite being targeted by a firestorm of negative press, Trump's [odds of winning the general election](https://www.oddsshark.com/other/2020-usa-presidential-odds-futures) are holding extremely strong at 11:10.
1.16.8.1.1.1. Pro: If provincialism is a defensive strategy against external threats, then attacking a bigot and their provincialism is counterproductive. Unless we intend to totally destroy and annhiliate such persons, their experience of being attacked will naturally lead to a deepening of the defensive posture. The only solution is to entice them to surrender, to make them feel comfortable and trust us, to sense that letting their guard down is the best possible outcome.
1.16.8.1.2. Pro: [According](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81186809?trackId=250062974) to Dave Chappelle: "I think Trump has a better shot \[of re-election\] than a lot of people would like to think.... The \[way the Left is\] talking is not going to win... Donald Trump is over there on the right grabbing handfulls of p***y, and Joe Biden can't even smell hair over here-- f***k this side."
1.16.8.2. Pro: Harris so far seems to have a campaign strategy of rehearsing certain attacks and parts of her debate performance. This could hurt her electability.
1.16.8.2.1. Pro: Kamala Harris' [extensively rehearsed, set piece "“That little girl was me" attack](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/28/kamala-harris-joe-biden-debate-1390383) on Biden during the first primary debate looked calculating and unprincipled, and that could hurt her chances with voters in a general election who take it as a reason to doubt her motivations and credibility.
1.16.8.2.1.1. Pro: Harris' attacks were obviously dishonorable as in the past she has been [a political ally and "friend" of Biden](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-daily-trail-markers-when-kamala-harris-praised-joe-biden/),
1.16.8.2.1.2. Pro: Harris does not support a policy of bussing, so implying that an adversary was prejudiced for opposing it is deceitful.
1.16.9. Pro: 2020 is a good time for a woman to be the Democratic nominee for President. Kamala Harris is a suitable candidate.
1.16.9.1. Con: -> See 1.13.4.3.2.
1.16.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.3.3.
1.16.9.3. Pro: There is evidence to suggest that voters believe the country would be better off with more women in political office, rendering Kamala as a potential candidate for nomination.
1.16.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.4.1.
1.16.9.4. Pro: Women are experiencing record levels of success in primaries.
1.16.9.4.1. Pro: A [2018 Rutgers study](http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/potential-candidate-summary-2018) found that more women in 2018 have run for office and won primaries for House, Senate and governor than in any past election cycle.
1.16.9.4.2. Pro: In open Democratic House primaries with at least one man and one woman running, women have won the nomination [69% of the time](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/08/636675661/its-official-record-number-of-women-nominated-for-house-seats-in-2018) in 2018.
1.16.9.5. Con: What a good time is for a woman to be president is subjective.
1.16.9.6. Pro: A female democratic nomination may help improve the condition of the political challenges facing women.
1.16.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.4.2.
1.16.9.6.2. Pro: Kamala Harris describes the [GOP health-care bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/06/27/kamala-harris-brings-her-feminist-voice-to-lena-duhams-lenny-letter/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.79163926f2d7) - which would slash coverage for benefits like maternity care and birth control, and make it impossible for women on Medicaid to obtain health care services at Planned Parenthood clinics - as “a hot mess” and “absolutely terrible for women.”
1.16.9.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.5.2.
1.16.9.6.4. Con: Male candidates can be just as effective as female candidates in championing political causes that affect women. Therefore the gender of the democratic nominee shouldn't matter.
1.16.9.6.4.1. Pro: Beto is [pro-choice](http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Beto_O%60Rourke.htm) when it comes to his stance on abortion.
1.16.9.6.4.1.1. Pro: Beto co-sponsored an [Act](http://www.ontheissues.org/Social/Beto_O%60Rourke_Abortion.htm) which protects the health of women by ensuring that abortion services will continue to be available, and that abortion providers are not singled out for medically unwarranted restrictions.
1.16.9.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.16.9.6.4.1.1.
1.16.9.6.5. Con: Not all women fight for the the interests of women. The [National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage](https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Association-Opposed-to-Woman-Suffrage) was a group of women opposed to women having the right to vote.
1.16.9.7. Con: One's identity, while offering potentially valuable insight, doesn't affect one's ability to approach problem solving in a meaningful, impactful, or practical manner.
1.16.9.8. Con: The Democratic nominee should be selected based on policy, not political identity.
1.16.10. Con: Kamala Harris’ is less likely than other candidates to appeal to swing states in the mid-west, as her base in in urban-Democrat California.
1.16.10.1. Pro: Harris' confrontational style and her identity as an African-American woman would motivate increased Republican Party voter participation leading to her defeat. Under the Trump Administration the Republican Party is [openly prejudiced against African-Americans.](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/04/social-scientists-look-at-racisms-role-in-birther-viewpoint/1)
1.16.10.1.1. Con: Racist Republican votes will turn out for Trump regardless of the skin color of the Democratic candidate. The fact that Obama was elected twice shows that these voters need not be a deciding factor in the election.
1.16.10.2. Pro: She will not gain traction in the [Interior West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_states), where both conservative and progressive voters [have strong libertarian tendencies](https://www.politico.com/story/2007/01/why-the-west-is-going-to-l-trends-make-it-more-libertarian-than-liberal-002429) and will not accept [her authoritarianism](http://thefederalist.com/2019/01/29/kamala-harris-is-an-authoritarian/).
1.16.10.2.1. Con: Kamala Harris supports [Marijuana legalization](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/kamala-harris-marijuana-legalization/index.html) and [LGBT rights](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-kamala-harris-believe-where-the-candidate-stands-on-9-issues), two things often [supported](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/281399-5-things-the-libertarian-party-stands-for) by Libertarians.
1.16.11. Con: Kamala Harris is [actively courting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-19/no-corn-dogs-in-sight-kamala-harris-scoops-cash-in-the-hamptons) the support of the Democratic establishment megadonors in the Hamptons. Voters - in particular the base of the Democratic party - are [not keen](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/394690-anti-establishment-fervor-grips-dems) to vote for establishment Democrats, so an establishment nominee might be a big risk in the 2020 general election.
1.16.11.1. Con: An objective ranking of [recent fundraising](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/president/democratic-primary/candidates/fundraising-and-campaign-finance-tracker/) shows that all candidates get a mix of small dollar and large donations. There is no indication that Harris is hand picked by the corporate Democratic establishment, which represents diverse views and presumably supports a mix of candidates.
1.16.12. Con: -> See 1.16.6.1.1.
1.17. [Michael Bennet](https://michaelbennet.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.17.1. Pro: As a [moderate](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/michael-bennet/), Bennet might have a chance of drawing some more moderate GOP voters.
1.18. [John Delaney](https://www.johndelaney.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.18.1. Pro: At a time when the country is bitterly [divided](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/), Delaney is campaigning with a message based on unity, vowing to only introduce legislation that receives [bipartisan support](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/john-delaney-has-been-playing-the-long-game/577597/) for his first 100 days in office. His bipartisan approach to politics makes him an ideal candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
1.18.1.1. Pro: During his time in Congress, Delaney worked with two Republicans to push for legislation that would use revenue from international tax reform to fund various [infrastructure projects.](https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/infrastructure/325555-lawmakers-want-infrastructure-funded-by-offshore-tax)
1.18.2. Pro: Delaney has been supportive of progressive policy ideas.
1.18.2.1. Con: Delaney [doesn't support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/medicare-for-all-is-political-suicide-for-democrats/2019/06/06/8c41f14c-87d1-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html) medicare for all.
1.18.2.2. Pro: Delaney is a proponent of [universal healthcare.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/john-delaney-has-been-playing-the-long-game/577597/)
1.18.2.2.1. Con: Although Delany [supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_John_Delaney) universal healthcare, he envisages a system where many people would opt into private programs and supports federal subsidies on private healthcare for people who need them. This is not the type of universal healthcare envisaged by many Democrats.
1.18.2.3. Pro: Delaney supports raising the [minimum wage](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/28/politics/john-delaney-democrat-president-2020/index.html) to $15.
1.18.2.4. Pro: Delaney is the author of the ['Early Learning Act'](https://www.johnkdelaney.com/delaney-authors-legislation-to-create-nationwide-pre-k-for-all/) which gives states federal funding to establish or expand their pre-kindergarten educational programs.
1.18.2.5. Con: Delaney has been a [member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_John_Delaney) of the [New Democrat Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrat_Coalition). This group is on the right of the democratic party, and has supported centrist and moderate policy ideas.
1.18.2.6. Pro: Delany has co-sponsored the [2018 Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://www.johnkdelaney.com/icymi-delaney-and-bipartisan-cosponsors-introduce-landmark-carbon-tax-legislation/) which would introduce a tax on greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of reducing carbon emissions.
1.18.3. Pro: While other Democrats are yet to announce their bids, Delaney [has already been campaigning](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/john-delaney-has-been-playing-the-long-game/577597/) since July 2017.
1.18.3.1. Con: Delaney has received [significantly less](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/in-a-polarized-era-this-2020-presidential-candidate-is-preaching-pragmatism/2018/08/15/89991f3a-9e5f-11e8-8e87-c869fe70a721_story.html?utm_term=.12da05d86662) media coverage than other well-known Democratic nominees, such as Sanders or Biden.
1.18.3.2. Pro: By announcing early, Delany has been able to get a clear message out about his ambitions and policy platform before the race becomes crowded. In contrast other candidates have wasted time being [evasive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-to-topple-trump-take-john-delaney-seriously/2018/11/16/d34346ee-e90d-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html) on whether they will run in 2020.
1.18.3.2.1. Pro: Internal polling from Iowa ranks Delany [fifth](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/05/2020-democrats-presidential-campaign-john-delaney-218592) in terms of name recognition among potential Democratic candidates \(behind only Biden, Sanders, Warren and Booker\).
1.18.4. Con: A sitting Congressman has not won the presidency [since 1881](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Garfield).
1.18.4.1. Pro: A sitting member of Congress may struggle to devote the time and effort to a Presidential campaign alongside their Congressional duties.
1.18.4.2. Con: Delany has [chosen](https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/baltimoresun.com/) not to seek re-election to the Maryland state legislature in order to focus on his presidential campaign.
1.18.5. Con: Delaney is a white man with moderate views. As the Democrat party [moves further left](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/opinion/democratic-party-progressive-left-midterm-elections.html), these factors become less desirable.
1.18.5.1. Con: -> See 1.18.2.
1.18.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.18.2.5.
1.18.6. Con: John Delaney is one of the [wealthiest members of congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/net-worth?cid=N00033897&year=2014), with a net worth of over $200 million dollars. He is therefore unlikely to truly understand the concerns of the working Americans the democratic party should support.
1.18.6.1. Con: His wealth might allow him to avoid corruption by corporate special interests, as he can [self-fund](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/08/18/delaney_a_different_kind_of_democrat_sets_sights_on_wh.html) a lot of his campaign.
1.18.6.1.1. Con: By not having to [campaign](https://prospect.org/article/myth-self-funded-candidate-0) to special interests and political action groups self-funded candidates lose out on creating strong networks of support essential for victory.
1.18.6.2. Pro: Self-financed candidates are less electable.
1.18.6.2.1. Pro: [In 2006](https://prospect.org/article/myth-self-funded-candidate-0), of the 13 candidates who invested more than $1 million of their wealth into general-election campaigns for the House and Senate, only three made it to Congress. By contrast, of the top-spending candidates who ran in competitive districts and raised most of their cash through fundraising, the majority won.
1.18.6.2.2. Pro: Personal wealth can inhibit a candidate’s ability to fundraise.
1.18.6.2.2.1. Pro: Large personal wealth can [deter](https://prospect.org/article/myth-self-funded-candidate-0) donor interest as donations are seen as less necessary.
1.18.6.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.18.6.1.1.
1.18.6.2.2.3. Con: Wealthier individuals are more likely to know other wealthy individuals who can donate money to them.
1.18.6.2.2.3.1. Pro: Wealthy individuals are likely to be on philanthropic boards with other wealthy elites.
1.18.6.2.2.3.2. Pro: Wealthy individuals are likely to have connections with other wealthy individuals through their business careers.
1.18.6.2.2.3.3. Pro: Given that a lot of wealth is hereditary, many wealthy individuals are likely able to fundraise from their family connections.
1.18.6.2.3. Con: Wealthy candidates, like John Delaney, are likely to have have success stories that can inspire voters.
1.18.6.3. Pro: The rich have different views and interests than other classes in society.
1.18.6.3.1. Pro: Wealthy respondents are [2.5 times as likely](https://democracyisforpeople.org/page.cfm?id=19) as the average Americans to list deficits as the most important problem facing the country.
1.18.6.3.2. Pro: While the majority of people support [raising taxes on millionaires](https://democracyisforpeople.org/page.cfm?id=19), there is little appetite for the policy among the wealthy.
1.18.6.3.3. Pro: While most of the population supported the [Wall Street protests](https://democracyisforpeople.org/page.cfm?id=19), over two thirds of rich people surveyed felt that the federal government had gone too far in regulating business and free enterprise.
1.18.6.3.4. Pro: The top 1% of US wealth-holders are "much more conservative" than the wider American public regarding policies concerning taxation, economic regulation, and social welfare programs [\(Page et al, p. 51\)](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf). Within this group, the top one-tenth of the 1% tend to hold even more conservative views on these issues.
1.18.7. Pro: John Delaney is a successful entrepreneur.
1.18.7.1. Pro: Delaney founded two companies which were so successful that they are now both traded on the [NYSE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Delaney_\(Maryland_politician\)).
1.18.7.2. Pro: Delaney won the Ernst and Young [entrepreneur of the year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Delaney_\(Maryland_politician\)) award in 2004.
1.18.7.3. Con: Entrepreneurial success does not correlate with good governance ability.
1.18.7.3.1. Con: Both entrepreneurship and being a politician involve inspiring people to contribute to a cause.
1.18.7.3.2. Pro: Corporate executives do not need to take democratic input into account in the same way a politician does when achieving goals.
1.18.7.3.3. Con: Skilled entrepreneurs by definition are able to [accumulate capital effectively](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-entrepreneurs-should-go-work-for-government). This is increasingly important in government work.
1.18.7.3.4. Con: Entrepreneurs can bring [more efficient processes](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-entrepreneurs-should-go-work-for-government) honed in the private sector to improve stagnant government programs.
1.18.7.3.5. Pro: Donald Trump has previously had [entrepreneurial](https://www.internationalbusinessguide.org/trump-business-career/) success. Yet [polls](https://www.salon.com/2019/01/14/donald-trumps-favorite-pollster-shows-his-approval-rating-tanking-amid-shutdown-chaos_partner/) demonstrate that he has low approval ratings overall, which indicates that the US population is unhappy with his ability to govern. Therefore, entrepreneurial success doesn't always correlate to good governance ability.
1.18.7.3.6. Pro: Herbert Hoover had [tremendous](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/680-presidents-day-entrepreneurs-small-businesses-history.html) entrepreneurial success after office, but while serving as president his policies led to the [worst financial disaster in US history](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/great-depression-history).
1.19. [Tom Steyer](https://www.tomsteyer.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.19.1. Pro: Steyer is competent on the economy. This would help win over voters who want business savvy, successful candidates.
1.19.1.1. Pro: Tom Steyer is a [billionaire hedge fund manager](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2019/07/09/how-tom-steyer-made-his-16-billion-fortune/) and therefore has extensive experience managing a large business.
1.19.2. Con: Tom Steyer is a [member of the ruling class](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/12/billionaire-ross-perot-tom-steyer-election-2020) and is thus unfit to represent the core voting base of the Democratic Party.
1.19.3. Con: Steyer is a billionaire and is using his personal fortune to buy exposure. Exploited laborers will likely not want to vote for a billionaire.[vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/29/18201005/tom-steyer-billionaires-president-democratic-debate)
1.20. [Cory Booker](https://corybooker.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.20.1. Con: Early polling suggests that the American people would rather [reelect](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/trump-2020-democrats-matchup-790890) Trump as president \(29%\) than vote in Cory Booker \(27%\).
1.20.1.1. Con: It is not clear what that actually means, given that nearly every American is familiar with \(or at least thinks they are familiar with\) Trump, whereas familiarity with Booker is much more limited.
1.20.1.2. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.
1.20.2. Con: Cory Booker has failed to support progressive policy ideas that are popular amongst the American people.
1.20.2.1. Pro: Cory Booker [voted down](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/14/14262732/cory-booker-senate-democrats) a proposal aimed at lowering prescription drug prices by allowing Americans to buy them from Canada. Yet, [72%](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-august-2015/) of the the surveyed population support this idea.
1.20.2.2. Con: Cory Booker has promised to fight for a [$15 minimum wage](https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2017/05/sen_booker_rallies_for_newark_airport_workers_wage.html) at the federal level. 58% of Americans [support](http://www.people-press.org/question-search/?qid=1884112&pid=51&ccid=50#top) this policy.
1.20.2.3. Con: Cory Booker has put forward a comprehensive [Gun Control Plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/cory-booker-gun-control.html).
1.20.2.4. Con: Cory Booker has been [vocal](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/13/democrat-cory-booker-branded-anti-christian-bigot-for-asking-trump-nominee-about-his-homophobic-views/) in confronting high profile Republicans for their anti LGBTQ+ views.
1.20.2.5. Con: Cory Booker [supports](http://the2020progressive.com/cory-booker-marijuana-bill-progressive-support/) the legalisation of marijuana.
1.20.2.6. Con: Cory Booker proposed legislation which will make the federal government guarantee [jobs](https://www.booker.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=778) for residents of up to 15 areas with high unemployment.
1.20.3. Con: Cory Booker's close ties to Wall Street are worrying.
1.20.3.1. Pro: In the 2014 mid-term Senate elections, no senator [raised more money](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/23/cory-booker-mitch-mcconnell-get-the-most-wall-st-campaign-cash.html) from Wall Street than Cory Booker.
1.20.3.2. Pro: In 2012, Cory Booker [attacked](https://thinkprogress.org/newark-mayor-cory-booker-defends-bain-capital-attacks-obama-campaign-ddbfa660b397/#.bx7ric3gi) President Obama for criticising Mitt Romney's time on Wall Street.
1.20.3.3. Con: In February 2018, Cory Booker [vowed](https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2018/07/03/booker-seeks-distance-as-corporate-donations-become-potent-campaign-issue-494360) to no longer take corporate Political Action Committee \(PAC\) contributions.
1.20.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.16.4.3.
1.20.4. Pro: Cory Booker has strong academic credentials.
1.20.4.1. Pro: Cory Booker is a graduate of [Yale Law School](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/10/nyregion/10newark.html).
1.20.4.2. Pro: Cory Booker is a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/10/nyregion/10newark.html).
1.20.4.3. Con: Having academic credentials do not make someone a good presidential candidate.
1.20.4.3.1. Pro: Renowned presidents, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, did not even [graduate](https://www.bestdegreeprograms.org/10-us-presidents-who-never-graduated-from-college) from college.
1.20.5. Pro: Cory Booker has been a [gifted orator](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/10/nyregion/10newark.html) for a long time.
1.20.5.1. Pro: Booker has given [inspiring speeches](http://time.com/4421756/democratic-convention-cory-booker-transcript-speech/) at past Democratic conventions.
1.20.6. Con: Booker may struggle to get elected because of his race. Democrats should choose a candidate who has the best chance of getting elected.
1.20.6.1. Con: Race should not be a determining factor in choosing a candidate. By choosing a white candidate for the purpose of placating racism in the GOP, people of color will likely feel alienated and may not vote.
1.20.6.2. Con: Obama, who is black, won the national election twice. Regardless of the opposition Republicans may run, being non-white is not a disqualifying factor in a country with an increasing non-white population.
1.20.6.3. Pro: Racism is on the [rise](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/FBI-Hate-crimes-in-U-S-CA-surge-in-first-year-13389522.php) in America.
1.20.6.4. Pro: The GOP will be able to use racism as an [electoral strategy](https://www.theroot.com/how-the-republican-party-became-the-party-of-racism-1827779221) to mobilize their base.
1.20.7. Pro: Cory Booker has [plans](https://corybooker.com/issues/) to protect every major marginalized group in the nation.
1.21. [Beto O'Rourke](https://betoorourke.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.21.1. Pro: Beto O'Rourke can compete effectively in [red states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states).
1.21.1.1. Pro: Beto O'Rourke was [close](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/tx/texas_senate_cruz_vs_orourke-6310.html) to winning a senate race as a Democrat in [deeply red Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states#Table_of_presidential_elections_by_states_since_1972).
1.21.1.1.1. Pro: Cruz beat his democratic challenger in 2012 by almost [15.9 points](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/senate/tx/texas_senate_cruz_vs_sadler-3074.html). He only beat Beto by [2.6](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/tx/texas_senate_cruz_vs_orourke-6310.html).
1.21.1.1.2. Pro: It would be very hard for Republicans to win a general election without Texas' [38 electoral votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College). Democrats should prioritize a candidate with a strong chance of flipping it.
1.21.1.1.3. Pro: O'Rourke was able to [outperform](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-beto-orourke-shifted-the-map-in-texas/) Clinton in key Texas counties.
1.21.1.1.4. Con: The [amount of resources](https://www.countable.us/articles/14553-democrats-wrong-think-beto-o-rourke-s-texas-campaign-blueprint-running-red-states) it took to fall just short of victory for O'Rourke against Cruz was astronomical.
1.21.1.1.4.1. Pro: O'Rourke proved that he couldn't win even with over [$70 million](https://www.countable.us/articles/14553-democrats-wrong-think-beto-o-rourke-s-texas-campaign-blueprint-running-red-states) in financing.
1.21.1.1.5. Con: This is because of Texas' rapid [demographic shifts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/06/beto-o-rourke-ted-cruz-texas-election-battle-can-he-do-it) that make its voters more sympathetic to a more diverse Democratic party.
1.21.1.1.6. Con: Most of O'Rourke's successes was amongst [urban populations](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-beto-orourke-shifted-the-map-in-texas/). Cruz dominated rural voters whose support is essential for Democrats to win in other states.
1.21.2. Pro: O'Rourke is very good at [fundraising](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/beto-orourke-fundraising-record-736304/).
1.21.2.1. Con: Beto still [lost](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/ted-cruz-wins-texas-senate-race.html) the Senate race to Ted Cruz even though he raised enormous campaign funds for his campaign. A candidate who is good at fundraising is not automatically guaranteed to win an election.
1.21.2.1.1. Con: Campaign funding can be [crucial in winning elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/upshot/what-fund-raising-would-reveal-about-trumps-campaign.html).
1.21.2.1.1.1. Con: Recent election results seem to suggest that it is not as much as a given as previously thought that the candidate whose campaign raises and spends more money will win.
1.21.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the 2018 New York Congressional Primary incumbent Joe Crowley was defeated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [Crowley spent US $1.5m on his campaign whereas Ocasio-Cortez spent only US $300,709.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/midterms/live-primary-election-results/rep-joe-crowley-defeated-by-challenger-alexandria-ocasio-cortez/?utm_term=.d6dda07a02ea)
1.21.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the 2016 Presidential elections Hilary Clinton's unsuccessful campaign cost [US $768m, whereas Donald Trump's campaign only spent US $398m.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/14/somebody-just-put-a-price-tag-on-the-2016-election-its-a-doozy/?utm_term=.5d651ff12668)
1.21.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: [American Crossroads](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/super-pacs-2016/470697/), a powerful Republican PAC founded by Karl Rove \(a top figure in the Bush Administration\), spent $325 million on eight candidates in the 2012 election cycle. Six were defeated.
1.21.3. Con: O'Rourke's campaign strategy in the race against Cruz left many voters annoyed.
1.21.3.1. Pro: A [class action lawsuit](https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/election/article220344070.html) filed against the Beto for Texas campaign claims the organization sent text messages to Texans without obtaining their permission, violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
1.21.4. Pro: O'Rourke has potential support from important figures in the Democratic party.
1.21.4.1. Pro: O'Rourke had a [recent meeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/beto-o-rourke-sounding-out-prominent-black-democrats-he-ponders-n946281) with former President Obama.
1.21.4.2. Pro: O'Rourke recently had a [meeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/beto-o-rourke-sounding-out-prominent-black-democrats-he-ponders-n946281) with Andrew Gillum of Florida.
1.21.5. Con: [Controversy](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/10/02/questions-persist-beto-orourke-drunk-driving-crash/) still surrounds the exact details of an event 20 years ago where O'Rourke was arrested driving drunk.
1.21.5.1. Pro: A police report [alleges](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/10/02/questions-persist-beto-orourke-drunk-driving-crash/) that O'Rourke attempted to flee the scene.
1.21.5.1.1. Con: O'Rourke has [denied](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/10/02/questions-persist-beto-orourke-drunk-driving-crash/) that he tried to leave the scene.
1.21.5.1.1.1. Con: The Washington Post’s Fact-Checker gave O’Rourke’s denial a [four Pinocchio’s rating](http://the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker gave O’Rourke’s denial a four Pinocchio’s).
1.21.6. Con: O'Rourke has little experience in governing. He is a good campaigner, but he is not a national leader. He should run for Governor, or Congress, or Senate again.
1.21.6.1. Pro: Beto O'Rourke is a [back-bencher](https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/beto-orourke-become-president/) without much political success during his three terms in Congress.
1.21.6.2. Pro: Beto O'Rourke is young and could have a promising career in the Democratic Party. He should not be made president at such a young age, as after being president one's time in professional politics is [normally finished](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/164127).
1.21.7. Pro: O'Rourke has a high level of public support. Therefore he is likely to be competitive in the general election.
1.21.7.1. Pro: Beto O'Rourke [topped](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/beto-o-rourke-narrowly-tops-moveon-2020-presidential-straw-poll-n946501) the wide-open MoveOn 2020 presidential straw poll.
1.21.7.1.1. Con: [MoveOn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoveOn) is not representative of the entire democratic party.
1.21.7.1.1.1. Pro: In 2016, it [endorsed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/beto-o-rourke-narrowly-tops-moveon-2020-presidential-straw-poll-n946501) Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton even though Clinton won the primary by a wide margin.
1.21.7.2. Pro: Beto O'Rourke is more popular on [social media](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/325847/beto-betting-on-social-media.html) than many of his competitors.
1.21.7.2.1. Pro: During his campaign against Ted Cruz many of his videos went [viral](https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/beto-orourke-nfl-player-protests-national-anthem/).
1.21.7.2.2. Con: Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hilary Clinton, even though he was more popular on [social media](https://www.fastcompany.com/3058681/inside-bernie-sanders-social-media-machine). Therefore, being popular on social media does not guarantee that he will win the Democratic nomination.
1.21.7.3. Pro: Beto O'Rourke placed [third](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/us/politics/iowa-poll-2020-presidential.html) in a poll of likely voters in the Iowa caucus. This is an astonishing feat for a candidate who has only recently been in the national spotlight.
1.21.7.4. Con: -> See 1.9.17.4.
1.21.8. Pro: Beto O'Rourke [did not accept](https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2018/aug/20/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-he-doesnt-accept-pac-donations/) Political Action Committee \(PAC\) donations in his campaign to be a Texas senator. He is therefore more likely to represent the interests of the US people, rather than corporate interests.
1.21.8.1. Con: -> See 1.16.4.3.
1.21.8.2. Con: Amongst all congressmen, Beto O'Rourke is the [second largest recipient](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01&cycle=2018&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U) of campaign donations from those in the oil and gas industry.
1.21.9. Con: Beto O'Rourke has not been supportive of [progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States#Progressivism_in_the_21st_century) policy ideas that are popular amongst the American people.
1.21.9.1. Pro: Beto O'Rourke did not co-sponsor the House of Representatives [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1880/cosponsors) proposing that public colleges be made tuition free. Yet, [60%](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/) of Americans support free college tuition.
1.21.9.2. Con: -> See 1.11.2.1.
1.21.9.3. Con: Beto has a history of supporting LGBT rights.
1.21.9.3.1. Pro: Beto has previously been [endorsed](https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-endorses-beto-orourke-for-u.s.-senator-from-texas) by the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States - The Human Rights Campaign \(HRC\).
1.21.9.3.2. Pro: Beto has been outspoken in challenging those who do not share his progressive views regarding LGBT rights.
1.21.9.3.2.1. Pro: Beto staunchly opposed Kyle Duncan, one of President Trump's nominees to the federal branch in Texas, speaking out against Duncan's ["long record of undermining LGBT rights."](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/09/ted-cruz-under-threat-as-pro-lgbt-democrat-beto-orourke-raises-millions/)
1.21.9.3.3. Pro: O'Rourke co-sponsored the Student Non-Discrimination Act which challenges [anti-gay discrimination](http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Beto_O%60Rourke_Civil_Rights.htm) in public schools.
1.21.9.4. Con: -> See 1.16.9.6.4.1.
1.21.9.5. Pro: Beto O'Rourke appears not to be supportive of Medicare for All. Yet, around 70% of Americans [support](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/) the introduction of such a system.
1.21.9.5.1. Pro: Later in his campaign, O'Rourke [no longer](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/14/beto-orourke-texas-senate-health-care-november-675953) used phrases like "single-payer" or "Medicare for all" when talking about the health care system he wants to see.
1.21.9.5.2. Pro: Beto O'Rourke did not cosponsor the House of Representatives [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors) proposing the creation of single-payer healthcare.
1.21.9.5.3. Con: When O'Rourke announced his intention to run for US Senate, he stated that Americans "[need a single-payer healthcare system](https://www.facebook.com/betoorourke/posts/we-need-a-single-payer-healthcare-system-for-all-americans-its-the-only-way-to-e/1364076160308757/)".
1.22. [Andrew Yang](https://www.yang2020.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.22.1. Pro: Yang is supported by a grassroots network of small dollar donations [with 66% of his donations being less than $200](https://www.thedailybeast.com/andrew-yangs-2020-campaign-raised-dollar17-million-in-the-first-quarter?ref=home). He is therefore indebted to regular people rather than corporate interests.
1.22.2. Pro: Yang started [Venture for America](https://ventureforamerica.org/) helping build companies that benefit old rust belt cities and poor communities which in turn brings jobs to places like Detroit, MI. This shows that he cares about deprived areas and knows how to revitalise them
1.22.2.1. Con: Venture for America was boldly promoted with big ideas, and [failed to do what it set out to](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/13/18637853/andrew-yang-venture-for-america-jobs-record).
1.22.2.1.1. Con: Yang realized that the efforts of trying to help young entrepreneurs was like putting a band-aid on a bathtub that had a massive hole ripped in the bottom. This helped Yang experience first-hand, on the ground, the dire situation the country is in and just how prevalent automation, AI, and job displacement is. VFA was a learning experience that prepped him for providing solutions and policies.
1.22.3. Pro: Yang's signature policy proposal, the "[Freedom Dividend](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/)", provides the broadest and most direct benefit to Americans by providing $1000 monthly cash to all American adult citizens 18 and above.
1.22.3.1. Con: Yang [misleadingly](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/16/andrew-yang-snake-oil-salesman-229855) frames his signature Freedom Dividend UBI proposal as an urgently needed offset to imminent, automation-induced mass unemployment.
1.22.3.1.1. Con: Focusing on jobs alone disregards what "type" of jobs those may be. A [human-centered economy](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/) must be implemented.
1.22.3.1.1.1. Pro: Yang wants to focus on human-centered capitalism where humans are more important than money, the unit of a[Human Capitalism](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/) economy is each person, not each dollar, and believes markets exist to serve our common goals and values.
1.22.3.1.2. Con: [Robots in Amazon's fulfillment centers reduce the need for employees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iaKHeCKcq4), yet those that are still around have to work under ridiculous conditions and answer to the robots.
1.22.3.1.3. Con: Automation, as of today, has already replaced many jobs in warehouses, manufacturing, and cashiering.[Automation is already causing job loss.](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8?t=1012)
1.22.3.1.4. Pro: In fact, automation is set to create [58 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2018/09/18/artificial-intelligence-to-create-58-million-new-jobs-by-2022-says-report/#37a8f25f4d4b) new jobs in the next few years.
1.22.3.1.4.1. Pro: [Forty percent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2018/09/18/artificial-intelligence-to-create-58-million-new-jobs-by-2022-says-report/#2e4329024d4b) of companies are expected to extend their workforce, while over 25% are expecting automation to create new jobs.
1.22.3.1.5. Con: Many of the workers displaced by these jobs [will not be able to access the new careers](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/war-on-normal-people-andrew-yang) that automation creates. Even if automation creates new jobs, it probably won't create jobs for middle-aged people with low skills and levels of education that are near the places they currently reside.
1.22.3.1.6. Pro: A 2018 [review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610005/every-study-we-could-find-on-what-automation-will-do-to-jobs-in-one-chart/) indicates there may be a net gain in overall jobs over the next 10-15 years.
1.22.3.2. Con: Much of the [funding for Yang's UBI would come from the Value Added Tax](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/), which is a tax that [disproportionately affects the lower class](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-would-bear-burden-vat)
1.22.3.2.1. Con: Andrew's plan is a "luxury VAT tax" that will be "higher on luxury goods that will be consumed by people of greater means and lower or total exemptions on consumer staples that are consumed by the poor." [Yang Explaining His luxury VAT tax](https://youtu.be/Z9FQHdEwrrM?t=111)
1.22.3.3. Pro: Providing citizens with $1000 extra a month has shown to have [many financial and lifestyle benefits](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/).
1.22.3.4. Con: We should not vote in a person who is intent on basing their candidacy to implement a UBI, which has [inherent issues](https://www.thirdway.org/memo/five-problems-with-universal-basic-income) and a [high chance of failure](https://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/universal-basic-income-experiments-fail/).
1.22.4. Pro: Andrew Yang has a unique policy platform and wants to implement a number of changes that will provide large benefits to the American people.
1.22.4.1. Pro: Yang is the only candidate [seriously considering](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/regulating-ai-emerging-technologies/) the fast-approaching and inevitable arrival of AI and its societal, economic, and other effects.
1.22.4.1.1. Con: Mayor Pete has [repeatedly](https://www.ted.com/talks/pete_buttigieg_how_one_mayor_forged_his_city_s_future_by_rethinking_its_past) [addressed](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/automation-is-coming-for-american-workers-says-mayor-pete-buttigieg) [concerns](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/03/20/pete_buttigieg_the_most_important_job_of_an_elected_leader_is_to_bring_people_together.html) over automation and [redefining societal concepts of work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_mWSp_0cc) and value to reflect the future of technology. He is [also presenting UBI](https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/b6t1d8/another_candidate_who_supports_ubi_in_response_to/) and other measures similar to Yang as potential solutions, though less clearly defined.
1.22.4.1.2. Pro: Yang has very clear solutions for the [arrival of AI](https://www.coindesk.com/andrew-yang-campaign-releases-technology-plan-focusing-on-rebuilding-public-relationship-with-big-tech) and its effects unlike the other democratic candidates.
1.22.4.2. Pro: Yang has a clear set of evidence based policies such as supporting a Value-Added-Tax, ranked choice voting, and universal basic income and shows the reasoning behind each of them on his [policies page](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/).
1.22.4.2.1. Con: Sadly, evidence does not correlate with voter turnout - emotion does. The value of his evidence based approach cannot realistically be counted on to win out over an incumbent. He may make for an excellent Cabinet member to work on these exact policies, but will have great difficulty winning the election himself.
1.22.4.2.2. Pro: Basing solutions on facts and data, as opposed to ideology, is the [cornerstone of science](https://www.livescience.com/20896-science-scientific-method.html), and arguably human [progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress).
1.22.4.2.3. Pro: Yang looks not only at recent trends, but also at what will be predicted to happen during the time the next president is in office \(such as widespread automation\) and is trying to get ahead of the curb. His policies are future focused at a time when short-termism is plaguing our democracy.
1.22.4.3. Pro: Yang has a bipartisan ["Humanity First" platform and policy proposals](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/) that address the immediate and long term issues impacting the broadest voter base and offers [clearly progressive stance](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/support-the-dream-act/) on [social issues](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/right-privacy-abortion-contraception/).
1.22.4.4. Pro: Yang's platform and policy proposals have a [proven appeal](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18408685/andrew-yang-2020-president-democrat-candidate-policies-universal-basic-income-reddit-twitter\]) to voters from across the political spectrum.
1.22.4.5. Pro: Yang supports [Medicare for All](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medicare-for-all/) and differentiates his proposal with complementing policies to reduce the [costs of prescription drugs](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prescription-drug-costs/) and [medical services](https://heavy.com/news/2019/03/andrew-yang/) to ensure the system's financial sustainability \(positions of all Dem candidates by [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-candidates-medicare-for-all-7d958bab-de34-4d8c-921d-b561f201c4c2.html) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/medicare-for-all/)\).
1.22.4.6. Pro: Yang demonstrates that social benefits can also be fiscally responsible by proposing [a spending-neutral funding plan](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/) that will not further widen the existing annual deficit burden for his Freedom Dividend proposal.
1.22.4.6.1. Con: By accepting the freedom dividend, you also opt out of any social programs. You may choose to keep your existing programs otherwise. [Conservatives who seek to eliminate all welfare programs and replace it with the UBI may misunderstand this nuance, and mistakenly believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWNePbOIgvk) that the cost of UBI will add almost 3 trillion to the deficeit
1.22.4.6.2. Con: Yang supports a [VAT](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/value-added-tax/) tax to pay for his UBI proposal. This may cause a [cost-push inflation](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-cost-push-inflation-3306096) scenario \(prices of goods would be increasing\) that could limit the purchasing power of a UBI.
1.22.4.7. Con: Andrew Yang has a [grab bag of over 70 policies](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/kzdjjy/all-of-andrew-yangs-76-policies-from-regular-to-weird), with [no apparent overall strategy](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/) for funding or implementation.
1.22.4.8. Pro: He supports [nuclear power](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/nuclear-energy/) as a part of his environmental policy, which is [necessary](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2019/09/17/nuclear-power-future-history-controversy) to effectively combat climate change.
1.22.4.9. Pro: [Yang wants to fund you to move.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/get-america-moving/) He wants to subsidize the moving costs for Americans who are relocating for work by using the federal government and state licensure boards to increase the mobility of individual licenses.
1.22.4.9.1. Pro: This will give Americans a chance to move to a place with better job prospects.
1.22.4.10. Pro: Yang has proposed several policies that will solve fundamental problems with American democracy.
1.22.4.10.1. Pro: Andrew Yang is the only candidate that has posed an actual solution to lobbyists hijacking American democracy. He has proposed that the government annually give out [100 democracy dollars](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8?t=5971) per citizen that can only be paid to political campaigns.
1.22.4.10.1.1. Pro: Money is usually the biggest factor in a campaign's success but ￼[it is very hard to regulate](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-campaign-finance-reform-never-works). Corporations wealth therefore gives them incredible influence over US democracy. It could be easier to simply give Americans the money to compete with lobbyists than it is to block every avenue of corporate donations.
1.22.4.10.1.2. Pro: This is an appealing policy to voters who feel like the system is rigged against them, which according to one poll included [77%](https://amp.businessinsider.com/voters-felt-like-system-was-rigged-against-them-2016-11) of Trump supporters.
1.22.4.10.1.3. Pro: This would give voters the ability to compete with lobbyists, break the need for politicians to choose between financial support and voters, and avoid the impossible task of trying to regulate corporate donations.
1.22.4.10.2. Pro: Yang supports [Ranked Choice](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/rankedchoice/) voting and wants to solve the problem of our current plurality/first-past-the-post system which drives tactical voting and partisanship while not necessarily reflecting the will of the majority.
1.22.5. Pro: Andrew Yang has been making serious moves to try and win bipartisan support, making it more likely that he could beat Trump in the general election.
1.22.5.1. Con: As of June 2019, Yang is [only polling at 1%](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-eu-introduce-a-carbon-tax-29370/settings?back=%2Fif-pricing-levels-rise-competitiveness-concerns-can-be-addressed-through-political-engagement-and-targeted-policies-29370.218%3Fpath%3D29370.0~29370.1-29370.6_29370.192_29370.195-29370.218%26active%3D-29370.218%26action%3Dcomments).
1.22.5.1.1. Con: Traditional [polling is outdated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/03/12/the-problem-with-modern-polling-in-one-chart/), as many polls use landlines.
1.22.5.1.1.1. Pro: Most Americans [do not](https://www.textrequest.com/blog/how-many-people-still-use-landline-phone/) use a landline anymore.
1.22.5.1.2. Con: Yang's national polling average as of [Nov. 20 is 3%.](https://www.mic.com/p/andrew-yangs-2020-campaign-by-the-numbers-19404112)
1.22.5.2. Pro: Andrew Yang is one of the few Democratic candidates to have significant crossover with Republicans and independents. A recent poll shows that nearly 20 percent of Republicans would choose Yang over Trump in the general election. That's double the amount anybody else has.[chegg.com](https://www.chegg.com/press/andrew-yang-can-woo-young-independent-and-republican-voters/)
1.22.6. Pro: Andrew Yang has the personal qualities needed to be a good president and leader of the country.
1.22.6.1. Pro: Yang is solution driven. His clarity and message stand out among the crowd of politicians. He has a clear vision for America and [isn't afraid to show it.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/)
1.22.6.1.1. Pro: According to the Democratic Party Leadership in Iowa, Yang by far has the most detailed [policy outline](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/) of the current candidates.
1.22.6.1.1.1. Pro: Andrew Yang is the only presidential candidate with a [position on male circumcision](https://www.thedailybeast.com/andrew-yang-the-upstart-democratic-presidential-candidate-comes-out-against-circumcision). Rather than banning the practice, he merely intends to compel hospitals or doctors to provide notice to new parents that circumcision is not necessary from the medical standpoint.
1.22.6.1.1.2. Pro: Andrew Yang is the only candidate with an [actionable plan to abolish the penny](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/no-pennies/). As long as it costs more than a penny to make a penny, we are not getting the most value out of our tax dollars.
1.22.6.2. Pro: Yang is very [compassionate about the poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTsEzmFamZ8). He understands that the majority of Americans cannot afford an unforeseen $500 bill, that they are living paycheck to paycheck, so the majority of his solutions are to help the true American populous. He is a man truly for the people, and one who can see the importance of technology, and the impact that it has on the true working class.
1.22.6.3. Pro: Yang responds to verbal attacks and emotional manipulation with grace and cleverness. [He keeps his cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru-AZZiJSjk), and this is a desirable quality in any public figure influencing our children, and in a leader who has to deal with foreign governments.
1.22.6.3.1. Pro: Yang respects his opponents. He complimented Warren's analysis of inequality in Oct despite disagreeing on her wealth tax; and defended Steyer's wealth in Nov on the basis that it's well-spent.
1.22.6.4. Pro: He is a great public speaker. He talks with great confidence and always bonds with his public. His appearances on radio, tv and podcast showcase his abilities.
1.22.6.5. Con: How Yang presents himself on the campaign trail is not necessarily an indication of how he would perform as President -- without a relevant track record, it could be all show.
1.22.6.6. Pro: Andrew Yang focuses on discussing issues we face as modern Americans rather than slandering his opponents. This shows his moral strength as well as his interest more in solving problems than just winning the Presidency.
1.22.6.6.1. Pro: Andrew Yang is not afraid to have discussions with strong political speakers, such as Ben Shapiro who is known for his incredible debating ability in favor of conservative values, about his platform.[Andrew Yang on the Ben Shapiro Show](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/04/07/andrew_yang_on_the_ben_shapiro_show.html)
1.22.7. Con: Yang lacks the experience needed to be a good president.
1.22.7.1. Pro: Yang has no prior government or military experience.
1.22.7.1.1. Con: Donald Trump also has zero experience in government, which suggests these are not a prerequisite for being president.
1.22.7.1.1.1. Con: Given Trump's [behavior](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/carl-bernstein-its-hard-to-separate-trumps-vile-behavior-from-what-is-possibly-criminal), [numerous staff firings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Trump_administration_dismissals_and_resignations), [numerous campaign staff indictments](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury), and [general approval rating](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/), the public may not be willing to give another non-politician a fair consideration.
1.22.7.1.1.2. Con: The issue isn't that Yang can't be president, but that perhaps he shouldn't be given the lack of experience.
1.22.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: To be president is to be the politician who is the face of America to not just Americans but to the World. Yang may be more equipped than Trump, but that doesn't make him adequately equipped to handle the job well.
1.22.7.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.22.7.1.2. Con: Donald Trump's 2016 victory may indicate that the electorate no longer wants career-politicians as president.
1.22.7.1.2.1. Pro: The phenomenon of "career politicians" is a barrier to innovation and [has been demonstrated to contribute to limiting social progress](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/). Andrew Yang may appeal to voters who wish to support a candidate who has fresh ideas for governance.
1.22.7.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.22.7.1.3. Pro: The instability of the Trump Administration suggests, in part, that experience in government is crucial to enacting a comprehensive platform such as Andrew Yang's.
1.22.7.1.3.1. Con: [Correlation does not imply causation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)
1.22.7.1.3.2. Pro: Documentation of the shoddy way the Trump government was assembled, starting with an [inept transition effort](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team), and leaving [hundreds of executive branch positions still unfilled](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/after-500-days-dozens-of-white-house-jobs-remain-unfilled.html) or with [no permanent head](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711094554/an-acting-government-for-the-trump-administration) over halfway through the term, has made it clear how inexperience with government at the top can lead to [poor structural results](https://nypost.com/2019/06/23/document-leak-reveals-vetting-during-trumps-transition-to-white-house/). Being understaffed and lacking in key expertise would make legislative progress much more difficult.
1.22.7.1.4. Con: Having government and military experience does not guarantee that someone will make a good president.
1.22.7.1.5. Pro: In a survey of respondents who said they would vote in the Democratic primary, [22%](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/who-is-andrew-yang-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3?r=US&IR=T) of people felt that Yang's lack of government experience is a liability.
1.22.7.1.6. Pro: Yang does not have a voting record to prove his reliability and so voters are unlikely to trust him.
1.22.7.2. Con: The president's executive functions include legislative work. Unlike the current president, Andrew Yang is a [law school graduate and ex-corporate lawyer](https://www.theepochtimes.com/avoid-the-golden-handcuffs-warns-ceo-of-venture-for-america_1140099.html).
1.22.7.2.1. Con: Yang quit working as a corporate lawyer [within a year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang#Career) of starting. He therefore does not have much experience of legislative work.
1.22.7.2.2. Con: A large percentage of federal lawmakers are lawyers, and this can be considered a bad thing -- the lawyer mindset and milieu is arguably not the best fit for democratic government.\[[1](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjk5m/less-lawyers)\]\[[2](https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu/news/there-are-too-many-lawyers-politics-here%E2%80%99s-what-do-about-it)\]\[[3](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/11/cull-the-lawyers-there-are-too-many-for-democracy-to-work/)\]
1.22.7.3. Con: Yang covers how his business background does the opposite of preclude him from having an understanding of how government works here \(timestamped\) [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/aZYX0lEwtSA?t=340)
1.22.7.3.1. Pro: Yang's experience as a business leader counts as leadership experience, since a government is run in much the same way as a business.
1.22.7.3.2. Pro: Yang's accomplishments in business have earned the recognition of President Obama.
1.22.7.3.2.1. Pro: Obama named Yang a [Champion of Change](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/champions/youth-entrepreneurs/andrew-yang) and a [Presidential Ambassador for Global Enterpreneurship](https://ventureforamerica.org/blog/presidential-ambassador-for-global-entrepreneurship/).
1.22.7.4. Con: Those with experience in other parts of government have voted for the Patriot Act, The Iraq War, and bank bailouts. Experience is not necessarily a good thing.
1.22.7.5. Pro: Yang lacks foreign policy experience, which is the most crucial expertise to possess as a president.
1.22.7.5.1. Con: Yang talks about how the US should push the ability to declare war back to Congress, and how it should be judicious and restrained on intervention here \(timestamped\) [vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/331494968#t=34m50s)
1.22.7.5.2. Con: Yang talks about how a trade war with China is the wrong way to go about addressing the imbalances in trade here \(timestamped\) [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/BmdX80OER4c?t=2144)
1.22.7.5.3. Con: Yang believes it's deeply immoral what the US has done for Puerto Rico and looks to fix the injustices \(timestamped\) [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/8tuJ0phjFys?t=2788)
1.22.8. Pro: Yang is the only candidate to [prominently declare](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1142905816346955777) that he is 'pro-science', which indicates that he is more likely than other candidates to prioritize [science policy](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/chemistry-careers/science-policy.html) while in office.
1.22.8.1. Pro: He wants to [increase STEM education](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/supporting-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/) to help individuals fill such positions.
1.22.8.2. Pro: For fighting climate change, he wants to set up a national laboratory and [Department of Technology](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/regulating-ai-emerging-technologies/) to conduct methods to "use research funds in order to advance the fight against climate change," with the data coming in from the Climate Change Adaptation Institute.
1.22.8.2.1. Pro: One of the ideas that would get supported by Yang's proposed Department is the development of a [thorium reactor](https://politics.slashdot.org/story/19/10/21/2159259/andrew-yang-wants-a-thorium-reactor-by-2027), which would be good because it's a concrete idea and not many candidates think this far ahead \(in terms of science\).
1.22.9. Con: Andrew Yang is an Asian-American, which decreases his popularity with [non-college-educated white voters](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00380253.2019.1580543?journalCode=utsq20). These were crucial in the 2016 [campaign](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00380253.2019.1580543?journalCode=utsq20).
1.22.9.1. Con: Andrew Yang's policies, not race, is what stands out most about him. Policy is the primary factor in which the electorate should determine who they will vote for; all other factors are superficial.
1.22.10. Pro: Yang has a [plan](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/climate-change/) to achieve net zero carbon emissions to reduce climate change.
1.22.10.1. Pro: Unlike plans of [some other](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2019/08/08/nuclear-power-and-the-2020-presidential-candidates/#f3058fa6c5d9) candidates, his plan supports existing nuclear power \(currently our largest non-fossil fuel energy source\) and increased nuclear energy research.
1.22.11. Pro: Yang would establish a [Department of Technology.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/regulating-ai-emerging-technologies/) This would help monitor the development of new technology, more quickly adapt to the changing technological landscape, and prevent technological threats to humanity from developing without oversight.
1.22.12. Con: Yang does not support a Medicare for all single payer healthcare system. [\(source 1\)](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/476162-yang-spars-with-jon-karl-over-whether-his-health-care-promotes), [\(source 2\)](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/03/politics/andrew-yang-medicare-for-all-private-insurance/index.html). His plan doesn't even call for a public option let alone a single payer system. Support for this policy should be a prerequisite for winning the nomination because over 70% of the Democratic base supports the policy [\(source 1\)](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-november-2019/), [\(source 2\)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/26/democrats-differ-over-best-way-to-provide-health-coverage-for-all-americans/).
1.22.12.1. Pro: [Nowhere in Yang's official healthcare plan](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/a-new-way-forward-for-healthcare-in-america/) does he mention the terms "single-payer" or "public option".
1.22.12.2. Pro: Healthcare is the #1 issue for registered voters [\(source 1\)](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244367/top-issues-voters-healthcare-economy-immigration.aspx), [\(source 2\)](https://www.people-press.org/2019/01/24/publics-2019-priorities-economy-health-care-education-and-security-all-near-top-of-list/). Only 4% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents say they trust Yang on the issue of healthcare, vs. 29% for the most trusted Democrat \(Bernie Sanders\) who has been consistent in his support for Medicare for all [\(figure 3\)](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-november-2019/).
1.22.12.3. Con: Yang has stated that he [supports the spirit of Medicare for All](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medicare-for-all/) but thinks the focus should be on bringing down costs by resolving the root problems with healthcare in America.
1.22.13. Con: Yang does not have a complete vision for the future.
1.22.13.1. Pro: His [pro impeachment](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2019/12/05/yang-on-impeachment-this-is-going-to-be-a-loser-n2557521) position for Trump doesn't amount to a coherent "[new vision](https://youtu.be/f2Wr7lDI-Hg?t=3101)" for Democrats becoming a majority in his presidency.
1.22.14. Con: Yang lacks name recognition. This may still be the case \(relative to Donald Trump\) even if he were to win the Democratic nomination, which may [hurt his chances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_recognition) at winning the presidency.
1.22.14.1. Con: Andrew Yang's name recognition is sky rocketing. The number of twitter followers he has is [growing exponentially](https://i.redd.it/dbf14xngasm21.jpg).
1.22.14.1.1. Con: The growth in name recognition on one social site is insufficiently narrow to indicate a strong overall trend. Most Americans [don't use Twitter](https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/jul/26/mark-cuban/mark-cuban-says-twitter-reaches-only-15-population/), so while important, this fact is not dispositive.
1.22.14.2. Con: Name recognition would surely be a non-issue after winning the Democratic nomination.
1.22.14.3. Con: Yang's lack of name recognition may prove to be beneficial. Trump's campaign strategists likely have not constructed a plan against Yang. This may allow Yang to garner mass support before Trump's campaign has any ammunition to fire back with.
1.23. [Pete Buttigieg](https://peteforamerica.com/) \(dropped out\).
1.23.1. Con: As someone whose highest-level of political experience is [as a mayor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg#Mayor_of_South_Bend), Pete Buttigieg lacks a reputation for federal leadership.
1.23.1.1. Con: Given then current POTUS, we've clearly established precedent that political experience at all, let alone any particular level, is not a prerequisite.
1.23.1.1.1. Con: Experience not being a prerequisite for POTUS doesn’t mean it isn’t a valuable presidential asset.
1.23.1.2. Con: This is arguably a positive. Given the abysmal public perception of the Federal government, [particularly Congress](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx) \(which traditionally serves as a soft prerequisite\), having a perspective from outside D.C. could be valuable.
1.23.1.3. Con: Being a mayor still provides valuable experience which would be useful for being President.
1.23.1.3.1. Con: Some of Mayor Pete's constituents don't feel that he has fulfilled his promises in [South Bend](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/south-bend-poor-say-democrat-pete-buttigieg-left-them-behind.html). This raises concerns that if he can't successfully carry out plans in his small city, he could not successfully govern the entire nation.
1.23.1.3.2. Pro: As mayor Buttigieg has had a [major role](https://www.wired.com/story/pete-buttigieg-revived-south-bend-with-tech-up-next-america/) in revitalising South Bend's economy.
1.23.1.3.2.1. Pro: Since Buttigieg became mayor unemployment in South Bend has [fallen](https://www.wired.com/story/pete-buttigieg-revived-south-bend-with-tech-up-next-america/) from 13% in 2010 to 4.3% \(below the national rate\).
1.23.1.3.2.2. Pro: As mayor Buttigieg [supported](https://www.curbed.com/2019/4/12/18308020/mayor-pete-buttigieg-president-development-urbanism) the creation of tech hubs and has focused on bringing private investment in South Bend.
1.23.1.3.3. Pro: [According to Buttigieg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsrjkQt60vI&feature=youtu.be&t=252), mayors have to interact directly with the people being affected by their actions, and have to deal with policy-making, administration of a government, and real-time reaction to crises. On the other hand those in congress can spend many terms without managing more than a small staff, or dealing real-time with the results of the policies they promote.
1.23.1.3.4. Pro: The role of a mayor, which is to lead an executive body while cooperating with a legislature, is very similar to the role of president.
1.23.2. Con: There are many religious and traditional voters who will be alienated by his homosexuality.
1.23.2.1. Con: "Many" is vague, as public support for same-sex marriage is around 70% [depending on the polling source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/234866/two-three-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx).
1.23.2.2. Con: This is irrelevant, since, those who wouldn't vote for a gay man will not realistically be voting for any Democratic President.
1.23.3. Pro: Mayor Pete's [openness about his sexual orientation and marriage](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/pete-buttigieg-2020-announcement-822324/) allow him to serve as a role model for today's LGBTQ+ youth.
1.23.3.1. Con: One's identity, while offering potentially valuable insight, doesn't affect one's ability to approach problem solving in a meaningful, impactful, or practical manner.
1.23.3.1.1. Con: A large, diverse electorate will more realistically unify behind policy created by political entities that reflect diversity than if they believe one group gets to make all the decisions.
1.23.3.1.2. Con: Identity politics are [ingrained](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/01/how-americas-identity-politics-went-from-inclusion-to-division) in the U.S.
1.23.3.1.3. Con: The majority of members of our governing bodies are [white men](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-10-24/despite-diverse-demographics-most-politicians-are-still-white-men), so these governing bodies do not reflect our diverse electorate.
1.23.3.2. Pro: Research demonstrates that many LGBTQ+ youth rely on strong role models for [positive identity development.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2011.546729) These role models are especially important when friends and family are not tolerant of their decision.
1.23.4. Con: Mayor Pete has described himself as a candidate who wants to focus on his ["philosophy"](https://youtu.be/p1ZHSe9ckCo?t=269) first. This may deter some voters who are much more concerned with the details of the policies candidates would implement.
1.23.4.1. Pro: Some people are concerned that the list of policies he has published are [underdeveloped](https://eu.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/05/16/pete-buttigieg-issues-democratic-presidential-candidate-posts-positions-27-issues/3698589002/).
1.23.4.1.1. Con: Policies can be developed over the course of the campaign. Buttigieg makes it clear that his approach to policy is by first [making his philosophy and values clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ZHSe9ckCo&feature=youtu.be&t=268), and building detailed specific proposals on top of that.
1.23.4.2. Con: Buttigieg has launched a [web page](https://peteforamerica.com/issues/) giving stances on specific issues.
1.23.4.3. Con: Pete Buttigieg's focus on "philosophy" is about [framing broad principles in terms of things that affect everyday people every day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ZHSe9ckCo&feature=youtu.be&t=353) -- this approach is a very accessible introduction to the candidate.
1.23.4.4. Con: -> See 1.13.2.1.1.1.
1.23.4.5. Con: Mayor Pete's [values-centric](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/04/buttigieg-shows-how-campaign-values-evangelicals-have-only-themselves-blame/?noredirect=on) campaigning is a refreshing change of pace from typical Democrat campaigns, where specific policy proposals are drowned out by the noise of populism on the right and the left.
1.23.5. Con: Pete has been accused of [not caring about poor people](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete) by acting dismissively towards the poor and disenfranchised, and not considering the effects his and others' actions have on them.
1.23.5.1. Con: The "[All About Pete](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete)" article referenced in this claim can be fairly described as profoundly misleading, with easily demonstrable misrepresentations throughout, as detailed in rebuttals like "[A final response to the Current Affairs hitjob](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pete_Buttigieg/comments/b9cujo/a_final_response_to_the_current_affairs_hitjob/)".
1.23.5.2. Con: One of Pete's central policy proposals is about[poverty-reduction and workers' rights](https://peteforamerica.com/empowering-workers). Another one is specifically about[black poverty](https://peteforamerica.com/douglass-plan). This demonstrates a certain amount of consideration for the effects of poverty.
1.23.6. Pro: Pete Buttigieg has made combatting climate change one of the cornerstones of his candidacy. He realises the seriousness of the issue, calling it a a [national security threat](https://politicalcharge.org/2019/03/22/pete-buttigieg-the-7-issues-guide/) and a ["life and death issue"](https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2019/04/19/mayor-pete-says-climate-change-a-life...).
1.23.6.1. Pro: Pete Buttigieg is a strong supporter of a [Carbon Tax](https://www.headlineoftheday.com/2019/04/20/pete-buttigieg-serious-about-carbon-tax-to-fight-climate-change/).
1.23.6.1.1. Con: A carbon tax only makes sense when its economically viable - convenient and cheap enough - for renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Because of the energy industry heavy importance to all other industries, it could potentially create a [cost-push inflation](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-cost-push-inflation-3306096) scenario in which the rate of inflation was being caused by the cost of the energy company's *supplies* increasing.
1.23.6.2. Pro: Pete Buttigieg promotes [relating climate change change to concrete realities affecting the public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsrjkQt60vI&feature=youtu.be&t=1629), like historic forest fires, flooding, and storms, to combat common abstractions like icebergs melting and glacial retreat that make the problem seem more distant.
1.23.6.3. Con: Pete's funding might compromise his stance on climate change. [For instance](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/17/pete-takes-money-fossil-fuel-billionaires-climate-activists-disrupt-buttigieg-rally), Pete got help from billionaire Craig Hall to host the now infamous "wine cave" fundraiser. Hall amassed much of his fortune with investments in the fossil fuel sector
1.23.7. Pro: Buttigieg has laid out a [clear foreign policy plan](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/11/18661329/pete-buttigieg-foreign-policy-speech-indiana-university) handling Climate Change, foreign rivals & adversaries, allies, and present & future conflicts.
1.23.8. Pro: Buttigieg unabashedly promotes a Christian Left message claiming that tenets of high moral principles should animate policies. A strong moral perspective would be good for the nominee to have in order to combat the principles that animate the GOP and their policies - those derived from the [supposedly christian values of the religious right](https://www.newsweek.com/debate-2020-buttigieg-religious-hypocrisy-republicans-1446422) - which are no longer moral.
1.23.9. Con: Some of Buttigieg's actions and comments show he is out of line with the views of supporters of the Democratic Party.
1.23.9.1. Pro: His opinions on [Chelsea Manning](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-candidate-pete-buttigieg-troubled-by-clemency-for-chelsea-manning/) and his derogatory comments about [student labour activists](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete?fbclid=IwAR2Plk4IZ_l57XR7UPfhCNgbWZwtP14_e_okR_L62Oe5cdF1bhZgsoXOjR8) may clash with the views of most voting Democrats.
1.23.9.2. Pro: Buttigieg's [support for "All Lives Matter"](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjdu6GMje7hAhVQXK0KHc-BDKQQFjAAegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F04%2F04%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fpete-buttigieg-all-lives-matter.html&usg=AOvVaw1rXNrWjnttv2RP18W1x06a) will undoubtedly put into question the ability of the DNC's base to rally around him.
1.23.9.2.1. Con: Buttigieg [explained](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/pete-buttigieg-addresses-all-lives-matter-controversy.html) that the statement was taken out of context, and he apologized.
1.23.9.2.1.1. Con: Buttigieg, as an elected official, to be unaware of the [political angling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter) of the phrase, considering the ubiquitous media coverage of the BLM movement, is hardly believable.
1.23.10. Pro: Buttigieg has the qualities needed to be an effective president in the modern era.
1.23.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.18.7.5.1.1.
1.23.10.2. Pro: President Obama has described Buttigieg as one of the contenders to be [the future of the Democratic Party](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/31/pete-buttigieg-meet-indiana-mayor-barack-obama-says-could-future/). As a [successful former leader](http://time.com/5336305/barack-obamas-best-president-survey/), President Obama likely has a good sense for who can be a successful future leader of the country.
1.23.10.2.1. Con: Endorsements are not necessarily indicative of qualifications nor electability.
1.23.10.2.2. Con: Two other people \(Kamala Harris and Michael Bennett\) who President Obama described as the future of the party are also running.
1.23.10.3. Pro: Buttigieg is a [good, clear communicator](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/3/3/1839017/-Presidential-Candidate-Pete-Buttigieg-Gifted-Communicator-Experienced-Executive-Relatable?): communicating well and relating to the American electorate has long been considered a good quality in presidential candidates.
1.23.10.4. Pro: Unique among all other candidates, Pete Buttigieg is proficient in at least [7 foreign languages](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/what-language-will-pete-buttigieg-speak-in-the-debate). This enables the building of stronger direct international alliances.
1.23.11. Con: Mayor Pete is a [gentrification enabler](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/mayor-pete-buttigieg-south-bend-gentrification).
1.23.12. Con: Buttigieg's reputation as a mayor has been tainted by controversies over [police shootings](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/29/pete-buttigieg-returns-to-south-bend-to-honor-man-killed-by-police-officer) and [racism in the police force](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-police.html). These scandals are likely to resurface if he becomes the nominee.
1.23.13. Pro: Buttigieg is likely to be a highly popular, and therefore successful, candidate.
1.23.13.1. Pro: Pete Buttigieg has the branding \(which includes the nickname "Mayor Pete"\) needed to win the General Election. In an age of intense and polarized partisanship on the national level, Mayor Pete presents himself as a [pragmatic leader from the American heartland](https://news.yahoo.com/mayor-pete-president-pete-crazy-thinks-ideas-arent-191944192.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJeMc2REKwj_thH9B5m7imw0_oh5I2TIztgE61FJXXyaHJj7gbyeJcL3OxQPI_Ka49jZUtRbnFncgVtGTZ6KM9koXVGrlBD-CzyhHovuFmtlQZAx9IVokpqsTOV0pg4e_wUDaoI_TGTgJPGCGKd08DH_ppWJd6NC4f8TpKF6wrFM) who can bridge divides and bring the country together.
1.23.13.2. Pro: Buttigieg is a [military veteran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg#Military_career), a characteristic that is [highly respected](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/heros-welcome-american-public-and-attitudes-toward-veterans) by the American public.
1.23.14. Con: Buttigieg's stance on healthcare is problematic.
1.23.14.1. Pro: Buttigieg ran for the DNC Chair with the [fervent support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/22/howard-dean-endorses-dark-horse-dnc-candidate-pete-buttigieg/?utm_term=.eb9e9dc4abbb) of [Howard Dean](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/21/howard-dean-despite-denials-has-long-sad-history-of-selling-himself-on-k-street/), who lobbies for Insurance and Drug Companies. The American people might therefore not trust Buttigieg's pro Medicare for All stance.
1.23.14.1.1. Pro: [Polls show](https://www.issueone.org/new-poll-shows-money-in-politics-is-a-top-voting-concern/) that money in politics is a top voting concern, especially among Democrats and Independents.
1.23.14.1.2. Con: This argument does not discuss Buttigieg's stance on the issues, but Howard Dean's.
1.23.14.1.3. Pro: [Pete Buttigeig recieved more money from the healthcare industry than any other candidate besides Joe Biden.](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/07/20dems-are-taking-money-healthcare/)
1.23.14.2. Pro: Pete Buttigeig wants to provide a public healthcare option rather than abolishing private healthcare all together. This has been tried in the past and has [enabled healthcare companies to increase prices](https://www.investopedia.com/insurance/why-do-healthcare-costs-keep-rising/)
1.23.15. Pro: The younger generation are our future, Mayor Pete being younger connects more to those ideals and allows change to happen.
1.23.15.1. Con: Pete Buttigieg only has a [39.4% approval rating among voters aged 19-29](https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-candidates-poll-age-gender-race-region-politics-2019#age-is-one-of-the-most-polarizing-factors-in-the-race-just-a-few-candidates-sen-elizabeth-warren-foremost-among-them-do-about-as-well-as-usual-among-all-age-brackets-in-the-set-2), showing that his young age doesn't necessarily connect with the younger voters. For comparison in the same age range, Biden has a 38.6% approval and Sanders has a 70.0% approval.
1.23.16. Con: Buttigieg [hired a former Goldman Sachs VP](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/buttigieg-hires-former-goldman-sachs-executive-as-policy-director.html) as his national policy director. People [don't trust Wall Street](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/wall-street-efforts-to-improve-its-image-fail-to-sway-americans) and want people affiliated with Wall Street out of the government. This hiring choice shows that Buttigieg is out of touch with the public.
1.23.17. Pro: Buttigieg has described himself as a candidate who wants to focus on his "[philosophy](https://youtu.be/p1ZHSe9ckCo?t=269)" first. Putting philosophy ahead of policy details may [connect better with voters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/people-dont-vote-for-want-they-want-they-vote-for-who-they-are/2018/08/30/fb5b7e44-abd7-11e8-8a0c-70b618c98d3c_story.html), and reduce exposure to attacks from opponents.
