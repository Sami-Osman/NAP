Discussion Name: The French Revolution had predominantly negative consequences

1. The French Revolution had predominantly negative consequences
1.1. Con: The evidence suggests that areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth. \([p.16-18](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/jr_consequeces_frenchrev.pdf)\)
1.1.1. Con: Industrialisation across Europe following the Industrial Revolution was far more likely caused by other factors, such as the availability of coal.
1.1.1.1. Con: France was one of the first European states to be [industrialized](https://historyofmassachusetts.org/where-industrial-revolution-take-place/), with it occurring at a much lower pace in the rest of Europe. It's likely that the French revolution had a significant impact on how early France became industrialized.
1.1.2. Con: Industry was heavily damaged by the constant war and violence of the French Revolution. In 1800, 6 years after the French Revolution had ended, French industry was [only 60%](https://iea.org.uk/assessing-the-economic-legacy-of-the-french-revolution-part-2/) of what it had been under the old regime.
1.2. Pro: It is important to note that the revolutionary wars and the following napoleonic wars changed the way wars were fought. War changed from a diplomatic tool between monarchs to a fight between the people. Hate and violence in warfare increased thereby heavily and found its pinnacle in WW1 and WW2.
1.3. Pro: The key concept of Liberty \(Liberté\) gave birth to modern capitalism, which has created societies filled with social inequality and injustice.
1.3.1. Con: [Capitalism](https://listverse.com/2010/12/24/top-10-greatest-benefits-of-capitalism/) has also brought a huge number of important benefits such as better access to options for improved health and hygiene, and increased happiness and greater freedom.
1.4. Pro: The key concept of Equality \(Egalité\) gave birth to 20th Century Communism, the regimes of which oversaw hundreds of thousands of deaths and oppression of human rights.
1.5. Pro: The key concept of Fraternity \(fraternité\) gave birth to 20th Century Fascism, the regimes of which lead to dictatorships of oppressed freedom and racial intolerance.
1.6. Con: Democracy is an overwhelmingly positive human achievement, and its roots are firmly found within the French Revolution.
1.6.1. Con: [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) rose to power in the aftermath of the French revolution and became an authoritarian ruler over France. The French revolution did therefore not inspire democracy.
1.6.2. Con: Democracy has its roots firmly in ancient [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy), not the French revolution.
1.6.3. Con: Very few people were afforded the right to vote and participate in democracy during the French Revolution.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Not only were women and people of colour unable to vote, but [strict laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_and_passive_citizens#Citizenship_during_the_French_Revolution) on who classified as an 'active citizen' meant that only 50,000 of the 25 million men in France were eligible to vote.
1.7. Con: The French Revolution gave newfound power to the populace. All following national leaderships were forced to be much more aware of their citizens desires.
1.7.1. Pro: The Thermidorian movement and the Napoleonic era, that came to power right after the French Revolution, were [autocratic forms of government](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/07/french-revolution-bastille-day-guide-jacobins-terror-bonaparte/) that restricted the rights of French citizens.
1.8. Con: The Revolution was largely caused by economic factors and the overtaxing of the working class compared to the \(effectively\) tax-exampt nobility and clergy. It rebalanced wealth distribution, and ended the irresponsible splendour of the elites.
1.8.1. Pro: The revolution saw the [end of the feudal system](https://medium.com/\@ajvenigalla/-8077517af9f1) in France and the abolition of the privileges of noble birth.
1.9. Pro: The following Reign of Terror and French Revolutionary Wars saw hundreds of thousands of citizens lose their lives. If the closely connected Napoleonic Wars are also included, hundreds of thousands more died. This extreme loss of life and decades of warfare is overwhelmingly negative.
1.9.1. Pro: Between the two summers of 1793 and 1794, the Reign of Terror resulted in [more than 500,000 people being killed](https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/reign-of-terror/) for suspected counter-revolutionary activity or so-called 'crimes against liberty'.
1.9.2. Pro: More than [2 million French people](https://iea.org.uk/assessing-the-economic-legacy-of-the-french-revolution-part-1/) died as a result of the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars.
1.10. Con: Republicanism, a direct product of the French Revolution, has proven itself to be an incredibly effective system of government that is willing to defend human rights.
1.10.1. Con: Republicanism [dates to 509BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic), and was not invented by the French.
